"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday. Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that ""it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea"" when the Bush administration took over. The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a  nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello. Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that? Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure. And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that ""This is what happened, and wasn't it a success,"" when we know it wasn't. Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea. Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions. And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals. amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch . Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, ""The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy."" How would you respond to that? Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues. I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership. Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want? Albright:  Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium. And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky. But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue. Costello: We'll see. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you.","Former secretary of state: U.S. made ""huge mistake"" stopping talks with North Korea .

"(CNN) -- ""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""True Detective"" and ""Cosmos"" picked up Emmys as TV's awards season began, while -- appropriately -- ""Saturday Night Live"" added to its four-decade-long haul with five more honors at the Creative Arts Emmys. HBO won the most awards of any network, with 15. The cable channel is a division of Time Warner, as is CNN. The awards, held Saturday night at Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre, were mainly dedicated to technical categories, though there were several given out for acting, writing and performing. Uzo Aduba, who plays ""Crazy Eyes"" Warren in ""Orange Is the New Black,"" won for guest actress in a comedy series. One of her thank-yous went to her mother, who ""came here from Nigeria to make a better life for her family."" Allison Janney of ""Masters of Sex"" won for guest actress in a drama series. Janney previously won four Emmys for ""The West Wing."" After serving as a voice of all trades on ""The Simpsons"" for more than two decades, the versatile Harry Shearer finally won an Emmy for his performance(s) on the show for character voice-over. He voices such figures as Principal Skinner, the Rev. Lovejoy and the nefarious Montgomery Burns. Shearer couldn't attend, however: He's currently appearing in a play in London. ""The Simpsons"" won three Emmys, but not the big prize for best animated series. That honor went to another Fox show, ""Bob's Burgers"" -- its first win in that category. Among the wins for ""SNL,"" which will begin its 40th season next month, was one for a former cast member who's gone on to bigger things: Jimmy Fallon picked up an Emmy for guest actor in a comedy series. Comic actor Joel McHale accepted for Fallon, who wasn't there. ""Fallon was unable to be here tonight, 'cause he was arrested,"" said McHale puckishly. ""But we are happy to accept this award and will keep it forever."" HBO's ""True Detective,"" which earned eight nominations, received four awards, including wins for makeup and credit design. ""Cosmos,"" the new version of the science series featuring astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, also earned four Emmys. Two of the awards went to Alan Silvestri, who composed the music for the show. He didn't forget its host. ""I have two special thanks left,"" Silvestri said, according to Deadline.com. ""Neil deGrasse Tyson"" and ""the voice of Neil DeGrasse Tyson."" CNN's ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" won for informational series or special. The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards are scheduled for August 25. The show will air on NBC.

"(CNN) -- As a society, it seems we'll always struggle with our vices. Our governments are less morally conflicted, it seems. Whether it's outlawing drugs, prostitution, even alcohol Prohibition, making vices illegal is problematic because it's illogical. Vices are personal choices made that harm one's own body or property. Crimes, on the other hand, are wrongs committed against another person, or society as a whole—by definition, damaging another person's body or property. It has often been said that vice crimes are ""victimless,"" because each one of them involves a deliberate choice to inject, fornicate, snort or swill to the detriment of one person: the person with the bad habit. Of course, supporters of vice prosecution argue that the individual's addiction or bad decisions always have an indirect collateral effect on society as a whole: Drugs and prostitution ruin neighborhoods, while booze and cigarettes impose a health care cost borne by all of us. And then there's gambling. On October 6, a federal district court judge will entertain New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's request to permit legal sports betting in the Garden State. As it stands, a federal court of appeals has struck down a New Jersey law repealing a sports betting ban. The court held the state law conflicted with federal law, called PASPA, which prohibits engaging in a sports gambling scheme ""pursuant to state law."" Which means -- and this is confusing -- sports betting may be legal in New Jersey. Confused? You should be. Here's what happened: . New Jersey passed a 2012 state law legalizing sports betting in the state. That was challenged by the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB, and the federal government in federal court. The court voided the New Jersey law, finding it was pre-empted by the federal law. Basically, if a state law conflicts with a federal law, and the federal exercise of power in that area is valid, the state law loses. So, the New Jersey law allowing sports wagering was struck down, except that the court observed that the federal law banned a state from ""licensing"" or ""sponsoring"" sports gambling. That is apparently different than banning a state from making sports gambling legal. By this logic, New Jersey could pass a law making sports betting legal in a casino, so long as the state had no part in regulating it. The New Jersey Attorney General's office has since directed law enforcement to refrain from prosecuting casinos and racetracks for running sports-wagering pools. The federal government and an association of sports leagues are opposing this move to legalize sports betting. These benevolent entities have every interest in preventing the moral scourge and corrosive addiction that is gambling. Just kidding. It's all about money. After all, state-sponsored gambling is already an entrenched part of our society in the form of the lottery. It's the ultimate hypocrisy to suggest that there's something evil about putting 50 bucks on the Eagles to cover the spread: a close to 50/50 wager. Meanwhile, if you would like to buy a lottery ticket, those odds on the Powerball are about a bajillion-to-one. But the government is happy to take your money on that bet. Make no mistake, the only reason lotteries are legal is because the government gets to wet its beak. As long as the state offers some flimsy pretext about the money going to schools or senior citizens, we the people are placated. That means you and I will continue to get stuck in line at the Kwik-e-Mart, behind some delusional nudnik spending money he doesn't have on a handful of scratchers, or calling out his ""lucky"" numbers to the clerk. Pal, you're in your pajama pants and slippers, out in public, at noon on a weekday: Your ""lucky numbers"" are anything but ""lucky."" Time for some new lucky numbers, and a job. Placing a bet with your bookie at the bar is outlawed, but not because it's intrinsically immoral. It's illegal only because the government is not taxing it, and because the pro sports leagues are not getting a cut of the action. Believe me, if Apple figures out a way to fit prostitutes with one of those Square credit card readers for the iPhone to automatically deduct sales taxes and Social Security, well, just get ready for the UberEscort app is all I'm saying. The nice thing about vices is that as they become more widespread, popular acceptance eventually overrides the law. Prohibition didn't work because we didn't accept it. Marijuana has become legal over time by slowly gaining ground, until users—and states—openly flouted federal criminal law. What a surprise: In states where it is now legal it is taxed and regulated. Sports wagering is probably next. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has conceded what the rest of us have known for a long time: Legal sports gambling is inevitable. The sooner the leagues figure out an infrastructure that siphons revenue from Grandpa Vito's nasty penchant for blowing his pension check on the ponies, sports betting will magically become OK with pro sports. Don't believe me? Fantasy sports—gambling havens of their own—are legal, and now an industry. The Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act of 2006 makes an exception for any fantasy sports game with an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants (but not chance). That sounds a lot like betting on games—but then again, who are we to question the wisdom of Congress? The pro teams and leagues must be furious, right? Well, actually no. The NFL, for example, runs its own fantasy leagues, and licensed use of any NFL products is an additional revenue stream. And, of course, fantasy activities increase viewership; instead of watching only your team on Sunday, you're going to watch every game and commercial featuring your fantasy players. Another way the NFL benefits massively from fantasy sports. Here's the fascinating part about the New Jersey case: The federal court of appeals held that the state could not sponsor or license sports gambling. That put Christie in a bit of a pickle: Is there any point in legalizing sports wagering if the state doesn't get a piece of the pie? That question might have been answered in the negative, if Atlantic City had not suffered big declines in the profits of casino businesses in 2013. It's in Christie's interest -- and that of New Jersey -- to revive the casino industry. So then, can sports betting become morally and legally acceptable in New Jersey, where the government is prohibited from licensing or sponsoring it? Traditionally, gambling has only been legal when the government can profit, but the governor and his attorney general have apparently decided that a devastating loss of jobs in Atlantic City justifies forgoing money in the coffers. While the Garden State has a ""moral"" dilemma, the leagues' position remains the same: the 3rd Circuit decision doesn't guarantee them any profit, so they will continue to oppose sports betting as they have so far in this case. Ultimately, don't think for a second that the leagues, the states or the federal government care about the morality of our gambling addictions. They care about money. When gambling is profitable to these entities and interest groups, it's legal. When someone else is making the profits, it's magically illegal. Standing in line for the lottery in your bathrobe in the early afternoon? Still legal, but really sad.","Court will rule on Chris Christie's effort to legalize sports gambling in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- America's top technology companies have approval ratings that most politicians can only dream of, according to a new poll. And Google, not Apple, is the ultimate object of our digital affection. A robust 82% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Google, and 53% have ""strongly favorable"" thoughts about the Web titan, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released last last week. The reigning king of Web search, Google has expanded its empire in the past few years, adding its Android mobile operating system and Google Plus networking site to already popular features like Google Maps and Gmail. Only 9% of respondents to the poll, conducted from March 28-April 1, held an unfavorable view of Google, while 10% had no opinion. Google's results put the company squarely ahead of Apple which tallied an impressive 74% favorable rating in their own right. At 13%, Apple's negatives were slightly higher than Google's. In an analysis of results, pollsters noted that ""the time is ripe for this sort of assessment, given these companies' envied positions in the marketplace."" While phones running Google's Android system represent the majority of the world's smartphones, no single phone has come anywhere near the popularity of Apple's iPhone. And the iPad -- the latest incarnation of which went on sale last month, continues to dominate the tablet computer market. Both Google and Apple fared best with wealthier respondents. In fact, in households earning more than $100,000 a year, 93% of respondents expressed a favorable opinion of Google, 91% of Apple. The results suggest that recent public-relations dings that both companies have taken haven't soured large chunks of their audiences. Over the years, Google's near omnipresence online has prompted privacy concerns. Most recently, critics, including some federal regulators and U.S. Congress members, objected to a revamped Google privacy policy that pulls user-activity data from the company's multiple products together to create a single user profile. And while Apple raked in a record $46.3 billion last quarter, some have complained that virtually all of its products are manufactured in China. Most notably, Foxconn, the manufacturing partner that makes the iPhone and iPad, has been hit with complaints of harsh working conditions. In an increasingly tech-centric culture, the poll results suggest consumers may be willing to overlook negative news -- even news that impacts them directly -- if they're happy with their digital experiences. ""The services in question, after all, aren't just services; they are, at this point, everyday and intimate components of people's lives,"" wrote Megan Garber of The Atlantic. ""They are, increasingly, implicit."" Facebook, the near ubiquitous social network, didn't fare as well as the top two companies, although with 58% favorable responses, it still has enough votes to get re-elected. But 28% of respondents had an unfavorable view of Facebook -- twice as many as Apple and nearly three times as many as Google. And for all its popularity among celebrities and in tech circles, Twitter limped in a distant fourth. Just 34% of respondents viewed Twitter favorably, with 36% holding unfavorable views and 31% having no opinion of the micro-blogging site. The poll was conducted by landline and cell phone among a random national sample of 1,007 U.S. adults. Results have a margin of error of 3.5 points.","Poll: Google more popular than Apple, but both are well-liked .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Ross Turk would be happy to explain the tattoo on his arm. By now, he's used to the penguin being met with bewildered stares. It represents, as he'd tell you, the Linux computing software, not the slightly less obscure character from 1950s cartoons. ""A lot of people see it and they think it's Chilly Willy or something,"" the West Hollywood, California, man lamented in a recent interview. ""The Linux logo is still kind of grass-roots."" When the then-21-year-old Turk got the logo etched into his left bicep in 2000, the penguin seemed poised to become mainstream, then appearing frequently in magazines and on the walls in computer stores. But the software market tumbled with the dot-com bust, and so too did the Linux brand, choked by investors' swift rejection then of the open-source software movement. Thursday marks 20 years since Linus Torvalds announced on a Web bulletin board that he'd begun working on a free computer operating system. In that message, Torvalds described Linux as ""just a hobby, won't be big and professional."" Now, two decades later, that market breakthrough doesn't seem any more attainable. And yet while the Linux name and its penguin mascot failed to go big, the software they embody is more pervasive today than ever. Linux's skeleton and spirit live on inside another familiar, adorable mascot: the green robot that represents Google's Android operating system. That software, which powers 43% of smartphones worldwide, many tablets and the Google TV set-top boxes, was developed with Linux at its core. Google's Chrome OS for laptops is also based on Linux. Another mobile system, webOS, sprouted from Linux. Hewlett-Packard says webOS, not the hardware that runs it, is a key asset from its acquisition last year of Palm. This month, HP took steps to discontinue its gadget production arm, but it will keep webOS. HP has discussed licensing the software to other vendors in order to expand webOS's reach, perhaps into computing platforms on appliances and in cars. Linux is already commonly installed on refrigerators with built-in TVs, car navigation systems, in-flight entertainment systems, public transit displays, ATMs and countless other machines. The Smart TV from Samsung Electronics, which competes with the Google TV, is also based on Linux. Sony previously allowed tinkerers to install versions of Linux onto their PlayStation consoles. Whether you're aware of it or not, Linux is practically everywhere. ""The fact that you don't have to call it Linux is what makes Linux work,"" said Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation. His nonprofit organization was formed to promote Linux development to the industry and sponsors Torvalds' ongoing work on the platform. 14 million lines of code . Linux can exist in so many places because, rather than being owned by one company, thousands of engineers contribute code to the kernel. (The kernel is the brains and sinew of the software, and Torvalds said in an e-mail that it's the aspect of his work that he finds most interesting and that he spends most of his time developing.) No one can claim ownership of Linux, and everyone is free to use it. The software contains 14 million lines of code and is protected by more than 520,000 patents, according to a Linux Foundation report. Governments like the system's flexibility and decentralized nature. Technology companies, even giants like Intel and AMD that typically don't publish schematics for their other products, encourage staff to contribute to and implement code from Linux. Google has carried this philosophy into many parts of its business, though not the ones that make the most money. The company did not respond to a request to make an executive available. Torvalds initially conceived of Linux as a free alternative to Windows. But the collaborative-development, peace-loving ideologies of Linux were no match for the freewheeling, business-savvy, marketing power of Microsoft. Linux, as a PC platform in the home, showed promise during the boom a decade ago. But it never came to fruition there, even as Apple's Mac has emerged as a more serious player. Instead, Linux became the bastion of geek morality, the king of the fast-growing server industry where Microsoft and Apple also compete with limited success, and the choice platform for supercomputers in laboratories. In Microsoft's annual report filed last week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the software giant revised its statement on competition to declare the war with Linux over. Microsoft no longer perceives Linux as credible competition to Windows, the change suggests, as ZDNet notes. A 'sticky' environment . However, Torvalds isn't ready to forfeit the PC. ""I'm definitely not indifferent to the desktop market,"" Torvalds wrote in an e-mail. ""The desktop is a very 'sticky' environment: Users really get attached to their environment."" Several Linux players are still tackling that market, but their efforts amount to only about 1% of desktop usage worldwide. Microsoft controls the lion's share. Microsoft has been very adept at ensuring that Windows comes as the default operating system installed on most new computers. ""Usage isn't what matters; mindshare is what matters,"" said Jono Bacon, a community manager for Ubuntu, the most popular general-purpose version of Linux. ""The biggest challenge we face right now is getting preinstalled on hardware."" SUSE, which makes another Linux desktop platform, and others have been choked by Microsoft's ""strong monopoly on the desktop,"" said Alan Clark, the chariman of the board for the openSUSE Project. ""It's played out differently than I expected, to be honest,"" Clark said. ""We made some progress, but nothing like anybody envisioned."" Yet, SUSE has a comfortable presence in the server market, Clark said. ""Linux is very much pervasive. It's everywhere. You can't even fly on an airplane; ... you can't use Facebook; you can't buy a book from Amazon,"" Clark said, ""without running into Linux."" The cult of Linux . Familiarity with Linux became a crucial skill for budding software engineers and server caretakers as far back as the mid-1990s. When David Bohnett sought a partner in his new Web venture called GeoCities, resulting in one of the largest Internet business deals ever when it went public and then was acquired by Yahoo for $3.6 billion in 1999, his main criteria was an adeptness with Linux programming, Bohnett said in an interview. John Rezner fit the description and shared in the pair's eventual fortune. Torvalds, the brain behind Linux, never seemed very interested in fortunes, according to people who know him. The reclusive programming wizard declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed by phone, though he talked openly through e-mail and appeared on stage last week at LinuxCon in Vancouver, Canada. There, Torvalds was treated like a celebrity. A lover of reclusive scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, he described the general reactions from Linux fans as ""just odd."" He wrote: ""Sometimes it does get to be a bit overwhelming."" Clark, from SUSE, described a memorable meeting with Torvalds. ""The first time he came to Japan, seriously, it was like a rock star arrived, and I could kind of tell it was really overwhelming for him,"" Clark said. ""He took it in stride."" The Linux faithful are predominantly male, often nerdy, with strong principles about collaborative development that translate to a belief in a less hierarchal, more cooperative society, according to interviews. For example, Ubuntu's Bacon has an Android phone, which uses Google's open-source software, because ""the ethical side of me feels like it's the right thing to do,"" he said. ""It's not just a product. It's an ethos."" Apple has tried to define its principles in advertising: artistic, noncorporate and able to ""think different."" Its brand has been adopted by millions of people. Meanwhile, Linux has maintained a devout but small following over the last two decades. The Linux software is embedded in many millions of machines, but its ethos and the penguin logo that embodies it remain an underground movement. To let Turk explain it, because he'd be more than happy to, his tattoo is like a secret handshake, waiting for someone to be able to recognize and reciprocate. ""Every so often, at the gym or something, I'll run into someone who's like, 'That's the Linux tattoo,' and there's a conversation,"" said Turk, who now works for open-source software maker Talend. ""It's always been something that the community feels like it owns. It's almost a little bit anti-establishment. The penguin doesn't stand a chance against the marketing of big firms. But that's great. It's good. It's ours.""","Linux, the free software platform, was conceived 20 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Has your Facebook feed become a gauzy parade of white gowns and veils? You're not alone. Those status updates that declare undying love, with pictures to prove it, can stop you in your tracks. Suddenly the life that was keeping you completely contented only moments ago looks like a series of doors shutting in your face. As a single 27-year-old career woman, the summer wedding season brought it home for me. It wasn't the seemingly endless slew of princess gowns and big, shiny rocks dominating my newsfeed per se. Sure, I'll admit to a touch of dress envy. But it's nothing that an online shopping session can't fix. It's not even that I'm lonely. I've long prided myself on my bravery and willingness to try new things. In pursuit of my dream career, I have moved to new cities by myself, met amazing people, had exciting experiences and even got some world travel in along the way. I love my life and the choices I've made. Yet as the smiling faces of girls in white dresses I hadn't seen since high school stared at me from my computer screen, I couldn't help but feel I was suddenly looking at the path I hadn't taken. I love the choices I've made, but did I regret some of them? ""I, unlike the Facebook updates in regards to weddings and babies have spent my 20s going to grad school, teaching both overseas/out of state and traveling,"" an old college friend recently wrote me. ""Despite being content and loving it (most of the time), it's easy to question your lifestyle when you see those around you (via facebook) settling down and choosing different paths, leaving you to question your own."" ""The newsfeed crushes my soul on a daily basis,"" said another friend whose wedding pics I recently ogled on Facebook. ""Between the babies and people getting to travel to awesome places that I cannot afford, it drives me nuts. Also the awful girl from undergrad who currently has my dream job/life and frequently posts about how awesome it is...."" She's got a point. It's not only the weddings, but the awesome jobs and enviable social lives. Oh, right, and the babies. I'm lucky not to feel the twinges of baby envy yet. In fact, while the giggling, gurgling, smiling faces are cute, seeing them on my newsfeed helps put my own choices in perspective. What's right for someone else probably isn't right for me. Not right now, anyway. Face it, Facebook: Sometimes you suck . The conclusion my friend helped me draw was a good one. For every profile I stalk that makes me contemplate the choices I did or didn't make, someone out there may be thinking the same thing about my latest vacation photos or newest bylines. So what gives? Are we all doomed until we delete our accounts? Maybe, says Dr. Joy Browne, radio host and licensed clinical psychologist. ""When people who are like us seem to be getting something we want there is certainly a tinge, but we like them for other reasons."" If a friend calls to say she is engaged, promoted, packing up to spend a month in India, it is normal to feel jealous, Brown said. But the intimacy of true friendship often mitigates whatever unpleasant feelings may creep up when you hear something good is happening to someone else. Tired of baby pics on Facebook? Try this! With Facebook, that true intimacy isn't there, Brown said. ""If you got engaged, you'd certainly call a limited number of people and they'd be happy for you."" Instead, Facebook creates what Browne calls pseudo-intimacy. A global posting board for those you kind of know or once knew to list their achievements neatly for you to ponder and compare with your own. ""It's a public forum for what is basically private information,"" Brown said. Another friend told me Facebook has made her compare the life she has to one she left behind. ""Just seeing so many from grade school going through big life changes and it makes you question what you're doing,"" she said. ""I see people buying houses and I am still throwing my money away on rent. But I think that is normal when you live in a city and come from a small town."" Another friend said, ""Facebook, the good, lets me feel like I'm still in the loop with everyone. I know where people went on someone's birthday, or who got what job or went on what vacation without having to actually be there. Facebook, the bad, gives you that fear of missing out. Or the fear that I made the wrong choice in moving. This feeling usually comes around big holidays or events like a birthday or the million wedding things that are going on."" To combat these feelings, Browne said, ""my first suggestion is you don't use Facebook as your primary barometer of how your life is going. You just don't have enough underpinning to evaluate the statements."" As for dealing with the jealously that can crop up while cruising Facebook, my friends recommended stepping away from the computer and soaking in some sunshine or a spending time with nonvirtual people, to keep things in perspective. So now when Facebook makes me long for someone else's fairy tale, I just remember that life is full of give and take, luck and circumstance, decisions carefully weighed, successes and struggles.

"(CNN) -- Just about every capital city in Eastern Europe seems to have been called ""the Paris of the East"" at some point. Unlike most other cities in the region, however, Budapest doesn't need the comparison. The grand old dame on the Danube is one of Europe's finest capitals by any measure.

Taxis are easy to spot in their bright new yellow livery. Take the subway and you'll be traveling on the world's second oldest underground railway and, on Line 1, a World Heritage Site. Parliament . Taking 17 years to build and completed in 1902, this neo-Gothic structure was partly inspired by the UK's Palace of Westminster. British politician-turned-broadcaster Michael Portillo memorably described it as ""one of the most beautiful legislatures in the world, a cathedral of democracy."" Kossuth Lajos Square in front of the building is being renovated, so the best views are currently from the river (Parliament is right on the Pest embankment) or the opposite Buda banks. Parliament, Kossuth Lajos tér 1-3, 1055 Budapest; +36 1 441 4000 . More: Hungary's signature dishes . St. Stephen's Basilica . Taking even longer -- 50 years -- than Parliament to complete, the biggest church in Budapest finally opened in 1906. During construction the building's dome collapsed and two of the three lead architects died. St. Stephen's Basilica contains the mummified hand -- called the ""Holy Right"" -- of Hungary's founding king-saint, Stephen (István). The dome is the same height as Parliament -- current legislation forbids anything higher, so Budapest isn't going to get its own version of London's Shard any time soon. The church is free to enter, though it costs 500 forints ($2.30) to climb up to the observation deck surrounding the 96-meter high dome (closed from November to the end of March). St. Stephen's Basillica, Szent István tér 1, 1051 Budapest; more on VisitBudapest.travel . Hungarian State Opera House . A lot of building rivalry has gone on in Budapest. The Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph approved (and partially paid for) the construction of an opera house in the city on the condition it was no bigger than the one in Vienna. Smaller it may have been but it was far more opulent -- the emperor's reported reaction on seeing it at the grand opening in 1884 was to mutter, ""These Hungarians!"" You can visit the ornate building on a tour but, even better, see it while watching an opera or ballet performance. The opera house is located on Andrássy út (itself a World Heritage Site), Budapest's grand boulevard full of high-end shops and other magnificent buildings.

Dohány utca Synagogue . Also known as the Great Synagogue, this is one of the largest Jewish temples in the world. Consecrated in 1859, the Moorish revival-style building is a center of Neolog Judaism, a moderate reformed branch of the religion. The complex also includes a museum and, in the rear courtyard, a memorial to Jewish Holocaust victims in the form of a weeping willow with the names of the dead and disappeared inscribed on the leaves. An estimated 565,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered in World War II from a prewar population of more than 800,000. Dohány utca Synagogue, Dohány utca 2, 1074 Budapest; +36 1 343 0420 . Széchenyi Chain Bridge . Budapest is a city of bridges, but the Széchenyi Chain Bridge (Széchenyi lánchíd) is the granddaddy of them all -- in 1849 it became the first permanent span linking Buda and Pest. Commissioned by a Hungarian count, after whom it is named, the 375-meter-long suspension bridge was designed by an English engineer and built under the supervision of a Scot. As with all Budapest bridges, the original was blown up during the siege of the city in World War II -- a broadly similar replacement opened to traffic in 1947. The bridge is at its most spectacular at night, when fully illuminated. Széchenyi Chain Bridge spans the Danube between Széchenyi tér on the Pest side and Adam Clark tér in Buda. More: Budapest's best 'ruin bars' Royal Palace . The Castle District, yet another World Heritage Site (why not just designate the whole town a World Heritage Site?), dominates the Buda skyline. Although it actually lacks a castle, the Royal Palace, dominating the southern end, is magnificent. A royal residence from the 1300s to the end of the Hungarian monarchy in the early 20th century, it was rebuilt time and again through numerous sieges and wars. It now houses the Budapest History Museum, the Hungarian National Gallery and the National Széchenyi Library. Like the Széchenyi Bridge, the palace looks particularly magical each evening, when floodlights are switched on. Royal Palace, Szent György tér 2, 1014 Budapest; +36 1 224 3700 . Fisherman's Bastion . So named because the fisherman's guild was responsible for protecting this section of the medieval defenses, this isn't a building so much as a glorified wall. What you see today was built between 1895 and 1902 to replace the former castle wall and designed to harmonize with neighboring Matthias (Mátyás) Church. The bastion's seven turrets represent the seven Hungarian tribes. They weren't designed to keep people out, but to provide a vantage point -- the panorama they offer over the river (both embankments are -- you guessed it -- also a World Heritage Site) is breathtaking. Fisherman's Bastion, Hess András tér 1-3, 1014 Budapest . More: Why misers should head for Budapest . National Theater . Proof that not every Budapest building worth seeing need be more than 100 years old, the National Theater opened on the Pest Embankment, next to the Palace of Arts, in 2002. The eclectic modern design includes references to much of the city's historic architecture but also incorporates a lot of glasswork. The public park in which the theater sits has a sculptured entrance gate in the form of theater curtains, statues of popular Hungarian actors in their most famous roles scattered about and a maze -- just in case you're not tired of walking around.

"(CNN) -- The question means little to millions living in poverty with neither electricity nor electronics. But there are also millions now weaving the Web 2.0 ever more tightly into their social fabric -- witness the booming popularity of Facebook and other social networking sites -- so the question seems worth asking. Happiness can be found everywhere, including social networks and on blogs. Enter the ""Virtual Happiness Project"" in the Netherlands, which explores the relationship between the Web 2.0 (in particular) and happiness. Though the final report hasn't been released yet, the project's global survey results and experiments suggest something that a lot of Facebook users already sense: social interaction is a driver for happiness, and the Web 2.0 is a valid way to experience it. Jim Stolze, a writer and researcher involved with the project, says the Internet has become our ""new global campfire,"" the place where we gather to argue, laugh, talk, learn, love, turn strangers into friends, and to get a sense of belonging. ""We are a social species and we need to interact in order to feel alive,"" he says. As happiness research over the past half century or so has shown, belonging is a strong a predictor of happiness. Psychology courses introduce students to Maslow's ""hierarchy of needs,"" a pyramid diagram created by the American psychologist Abraham Maslow. The project suggests the pyramid's middle levels of ""love/belonging"" and ""esteem"" can be met by services like blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other elements of Web 2.0, like comments sections below news articles or YouTube posts. But as with anything there are perils tempering the benefits of heavy Internet usage. Stolze warns the Internet can cause stress in users who don't take control of the experience. ""The attitude that they treat the medium with,"" he says, ""defines the happiness they experience."" People who feel they ""rule the Web"" are happier than those who feel like ""they are ruled by the Web,"" he says. ""The first group sees the long tail as a brilliant place to cherry pick for the best results, and the second group immediately experiences stress because they can't look at all the results."" Staying in control . At this month's TED conference in California, Stolze gave some light-hearted but probably sound advice for making sure you're in control of your Internet life. Among the tidbits dispensed: Don't take your Blackberry into the bedroom. Accept that there is more information than you can possibly look at. Human filters of information (like your Twitter network) often beat machine filters (like Google). Know when to go online and when to go offline -- sometimes a face-to-face talk is needed. Ignoring the latter is a possible sign of Internet addiction, a growing problem in many parts of the world. At clinics like the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery at Proctor Hospital, patients (especially online gamers) are challenged to look at sacrificing some of the ""high"" they get out engaging in their addictive behavior (a boost in self-esteem, a sense of belonging, an ability to forget about real-world problems) because of the consequences of the negative aspects. These can include loss of personal relationships, conflict with family members, and the threat of job loss. Of course it's important to distinguish between addicts and healthy users, which make up the vast majority. ""As far as people using networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to derive happiness, that is not uncommon,"" says Shannon Chrismore, a clinical coordinator at the clinic. ""Many people can use these sites for their intended purpose -- to remain in contact with people and/or to develop personal relationships."" But perhaps even healthy Internet users get ""addicted"" -- and are aware of it -- to at least some degree. As part of a playful experiment, Stolze, a blogger and Twitter user with hundreds of followers, decided to spend the month of December completely offline, during which time he worked on his upcoming book ""How to Survive Your Inbox"" (written in Dutch). Feelings he experienced went from ""phantom limb"" strangeness in the first week to anger and regret in the second to peace of mind in the third. Without the online distractions, he says, ""I had tons of energy and have never been more productive than in that single week."" In the fourth week there was anticipation but also a sense of growing anxiety about losing that sense of quietness and ability to focus. Life without the Internet, he decided after the experiment, was not for him. Life without email, though, was a blessing. A lot of us, not just Stolze, are wondering what it would be like to unplug for a while. That in itself is interesting. Twenty years ago the idea that millions would be so absorbed in the Internet might have seemed unlikely and bizarre. A T-shirt of Stolze's reading ""The Internet was closed so I thought I'd come outside today"" wouldn't have struck a chord the way it does now. And virtual happiness -- and unhappiness -- wouldn't have been considered real.","Dutch project examined relationship between Web 2.0 and happiness .

"(CNN) -- A new study finds that 54 percent of teens talk about behaviors such as sex, alcohol use, and violence on the social networking giant MySpace -- presenting potential risks even if all they're doing is talking, researchers said Monday. Do you know what your teen has posted on social networking Web sites? The study looked at MySpace profiles of 500 people who identified themselves as 18-year-old males and females in the United States. References to risky behaviors included both words and photos, the authors said. Not all teens who write about risky behaviors in their profiles actually engage in them in real life, said Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, one of the authors of the study, which appears in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. They may instead talk about sex, substance use, or violence because they are contemplating doing those things, or because they want to brag without actually doing what they say, Moreno said. Even if teens have not actually engaged in risky behaviors but merely brag about them online, this can still affect their future behavior, said study co-author Dr. Dimitri Christakis, professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Hospital. Those who lie about the behaviors to show off may receive positive feedback from others -- comments such as ""that's great"" or ""I do the same thing"" -- that encourage them to actually try out the behaviors, he said. Apart from that, teens who claim such behaviors are more likely to be victims of bullying and unwanted invitations for sex, he said. In a second study, Moreno and colleagues identified 190 profiles of 18- to 20-year-olds that contained three or more references to sexual behaviors or substance abuse. The authors then made a profile of their own, called ""Dr. Meg,"" from which they sent a single e-mail to half these profiles, warning them about the risky information and offering information about clinical resources. They found that, after three months, 42.1 percent of the profile owners who received the e-mail -- and 29.5 percent of those who did not -- either removed references to risky behaviors or made their profiles private. ""It's really not that MySpace is bad or good. I think the lesson is that it's a tool, and how you use it determines the kinds of outcome you're going to get,"" Moreno said. Experts say the bottom line is that parents should get more involved in the online lives of their children. ""I tell parents that they should absolutely create their own MySpace and Facebook page,"" Christakis said. The study inspired him to create his own Facebook account, and his 10-year-old already wants to know about his ""friends,"" he said. In some cases, parents should even have their children's passwords for these social networking sites, especially when the children are around age 13 or 14, said Vivian Friedman, child-adolescent psychologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Friedman was not involved with the study, but she is well aware of the problem. One of Friedman's patients, the daughter of a preacher, posted nude photographs of herself online, a move that cost her father his job, Friedman said. But she said 54 percent as a figure for profiles with risky behaviors seems too high, given that most of what happens on social networking sites is ""chit-chat."" ""I have parents that catch their kids bragging about something on MySpace, and when you actually confront them, the kid says 'I really wasn't doing it,' and they can prove they were not at the party where they were supposed to have been drinking,"" she said. Beyond keeping a watchful eye on risky interests and pictures, parents should also use social networking sites such as MySpace -- which had about 120 million users as of this summer -- as an opportunity to learn about their childrens' favorite movies and hobbies, as well as their top friends, she said. ""You so often hear parents say 'I don't even know my kid anymore.' Here's a very easy tool to get to know your kid again,"" she said. , .","Study: 54 percent of MySpace profiles of 18-year-olds mentioned risky behaviors .

"(CNN) -- Like a pop star leaving their biggest hit for the encore, Sepp Blatter made sure he saved his best for last. As a long day at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo came to an end, the 78-year-old announced he would stand for a fifth term -- reneging on a promise he made four years ago. The news, which was expected, came after FIFA rejected the opportunity to impose age limits and maximum terms for officials. ""I know that my mandate will finish next year on 29 May in Zurich -- but my mission is not finished,"" he told Congress. ""And I tell you together we will build the new FIFA together. We have the foundations today because we have the budget for the next four years. ""We have the foundation, now we work. Congress you will decide who takes this great institution forward. ""But I can tell you I am ready to accompany you in the future."" The Swiss has been heavily criticized following allegations of corruption over FIFA's bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. On Wednesday, a number of European members urged him not to stand for president. Speaking after a tense meeting between Blatter and UEFA members, the mood within the European camp was unequivocally clear. David Gill, the English FA's representative on the Exco committee said: ""The very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years, that should have been the situation. To change his mind is disappointing,"" he said. ""I think we need a full, frank and open debate about what FIFA needs going forward."" Only Jerome Champagne, a Frenchman, has declared he will oppose Blatter at the May 2015 Congress in Zurich, Switzerland. UEFA, the game's European governing body, has yet to reveal who it will select to contest the election. Michel Platini, the UEFA president, is not expected to challenge Blatter. Technology . As well as announcing his intention to continue in his role, Blatter also advocated the use of further technology within the game. The revolutionary idea would mean that each manager would be given two challenges to contest a refereeing decision with television pictures used to review evidence. This World Cup will see goal-line technology used for the first time -- but Blatter wants to see further changes. He told delegates: ""We could do something more on the field of play. ""Why don't we give team managers the possibility of two challenges for refereeing during the match? If the manager disagrees with a decision why should he not ask for an immediate TV review with the referee?"" The meeting also heard a speech from U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, the man appointed by FIFA to head an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively. Garcia has been given the task of probing allegations of bribery and corruption, but his findings are not due to be made public until mid-July. His investigation has been brought into sharp focus by a series of articles in the British newspaper The Sunday Times on the Qatar bid. The newspaper claims to have unearthed millions of emails and other documentation which allege Qatar's former FIFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid. The claims have been strenuously denied by Qatar organizers, who in a statement released to CNN Sunday said they had been co-operating fully with Garcia's investigation. ""We remain totally confident that any objective inquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly,"" it added. The latest controversies come in the countdown to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, which will start Thursday in Sao Paulo with a game between the hosts and Croatia.","Sepp Blatter confirms he will seek reelection .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Armed pro-Russian rebels paraded dozens of captured Ukrainian soldiers through the streets of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Sunday afternoon, the rebel stronghold's counterprotest to Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations in other parts of the divided country. A crowd of more than 1,000 people gathered to jeer and throw bottles at the prisoners, several of whom had bandaged heads and other wounds, calling them ""fascists,"" ""Nazis"" and ""traitors."" The march started around 2 p.m. and lasted just a few minutes. ""The people came out to see the soldiers who had been shelling them around the clock, thanking the separatists for protecting them,"" said freelance journalist Maximilian Clarke, who witnessed the parade near Donetsk's Lenin Square. The rebels aren't foreigners who have invaded this city, he said. ""The separatists here are locals; they are known here."" Water trucks followed the captured soldiers and hosed down the streets after the prisoners had passed, Clarke said. The streets cleared quickly after the brief march amid rumors that Ukraine would retaliate for the insult. The rebels intended Sunday's ""anti-fascist rally"" to evoke the 1944 forced march of almost 60,000 captured Nazi prisoners through Moscow, according to a rebel social media account announcing the march. In the capital city of Kiev, Ukraine's national government put on a display of military might to celebrate its Independence Day, with tanks, missile-launching vehicles, armored personnel carriers and soldier corps filing through the city. Many of them will soon deploy to the country's eastern conflict to fight the pro-Russian insurgency. Ukraine declared its independence in 1991 from the Russian-dominated Soviet Union as the USSR was dissolving. After bloody street protests led to Kiev distancing itself more starkly from Moscow this year, Russia invaded and annexed the peninsula of Crimea. And the pro-Russian insurgency gained momentum. Poroshenko: More military funding . Ukraine is fighting against foreign aggression, President Petro Poroshenko said in a commemoration speech. ""Events of the last months have become -- though undeclared -- real war,"" he said. And it is coming from a part of the world Ukraine traditionally would not have expected, he said, referring to Russia. Poroshenko spoke from the Maidan, Kiev's Independence Square, where protesters once railed against his pro-Russian predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, whom they drove from office. Sunday's show of military might, reminiscent of Soviet-era parades, stood in stark contrast to the lack of funding for the country's military. But Poroshenko vowed in his speech that Kiev will bulk up military funding by around $3 billion over the next three years to purchase military aircraft, helicopters and warships. Fragile situation . Funding might prove difficult due to Ukraine's fragile economy, falling salaries and a weak currency. Seven of the country's richest people have publicly donated to the military, and supporters have contributed millions to crowdfunding campaigns for Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The United States has pledged nonlethal military support -- equipment like night vision goggles and protective vests. There's also growing international concern over the apparent massing of Russian troops at the border with Ukraine. There were up to 18,000 such ""combat-ready"" troops on Friday, according to U.S. estimates, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April. Constant shelling . The battles in eastern Ukraine took no break for Independence Day. Five soldiers died in fights against rebels on Saturday and Sunday, Kiev's Defense Council said. The city of Donetsk was hit by shelling overnight, causing 13 fires, according to the city website. Shelling also continued in Luhansk, the city office said. It has been without water and power for 22 days. Convoy back to Russia . A day earlier, a convoy of Russian trucks that had crossed that country's border into eastern Ukraine without Kiev's authorization returned to Russia, international monitors said Saturday. In total, 227 vehicles were sent into territories held by pro-Russian rebels on Friday, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through. By Saturday afternoon, they had all returned to Russia after delivering aid to the city of Luhansk, a stronghold for the pro-Russia rebels that has been caught up in conflict. Russia said the vehicles were on an essential humanitarian mission and that it was satisfied with the deliveries, but international powers condemned it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Officials in Kiev referred to it as an invasion. Amid the furor, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Kiev on Saturday with Poroshenko. At a joint news conference, Merkel said she could not rule out further sanctions against Russia if no progress is made in resolving the situation in eastern Ukraine. Poroshenko said the Russian convoy had ""violated every international law."" But he also said he was committed to constitutional reforms and decentralization of power aimed at meeting the concerns of the Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian President is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and EU representatives on Tuesday in Minsk, Belarus. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to curing soccer injuries all you need is cheese, according to coach Felix Magath. The former Fulham manager confirmed reports he suggested defender Brede Hangeland wrap cheese around his injured knee to help it heal. The method might be unconventional but Magath -- who was axed by the London club earlier this month -- doesn't know why it's caused such a big stink. ""I mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with Quark, which is used to decrease inflammation,"" Magath said on his Facebook page. The 61-year-old German added claims by the former Fulham captain Hangeland that he ignored conventional medical advice in favor of the cheese cure were incorrect. ""I would never tell a doctor how he should manage the injury to a player,"" he continued. ""It seems this story has been blown completely out of context."" Magath, who guided Bayern Munich and unfancied Wolfsburg to the German Bundesliga title, has a reputation for his unconventional management style. Big cheese . But he is not the first big cheese in sport to use the savory dairy staple to help injuries. American ski star Lindsey Vonn revealed she had been wrapping her injured shin in an Austrian cheese to reduce inflammation in the buildup to the 2010 Vancouver Games. Vonn told Sports Illustrated about her physical therapist's unusual remedy: ""He's been wrapping cheese on it, and I know that sounds funny, but it seems to work."" The cheese hit the spot for Vonn as she went on to recover from injury and win the Olympic downhill title in a matter of weeks. Maybe Hangeland, who has since left Fulham for Crystal Palace, should have given cheese a chance.","Felix Magath suggested Brede Hangeland use cheese to cure injury .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, our nation will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address. President Abraham Lincoln spoke for only two minutes. He started off by reminding his audience that it had been only 87 years since the country's founding, and then went on to embolden the Union cause with some of the most stirring words ever spoken. He hoped that despite the terrible battle that had taken place at Gettysburg, his country might still have, as he put it, ""a new birth of freedom."" Within his famous address, he stated, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."" Yet a century and a half later, we still honor those sacred words he spoke on the battlefield in Pennsylvania as some of the most important words ever spoken. It is my hope that Americans across our great nation will take this occasion to look deeper into the history and legacy of the Gettysburg Address and the great sacrifices for freedom Lincoln honored in the midst of the Civil War. A great way to start is by simply picking up the brief speech and reading it aloud. Read it to your children, your parents and your friends. As you read this timeless piece of oratory, engage in a discussion with those around you on what these words mean to us today. Let us ask ourselves how it is these words have endured the test of time, especially in current times. We suffer today from what the late historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said was ""too much pluribus and not enough unum."" Few things survive in these cynical days to remind us of the union from which so many of our personal, as well as collective, blessings flow. Indeed, we have to look no further than the story of a tiny school in Putney, Vermont, the Greenwood School, to understand why this speech above so many others survives. Each year at the school students are challenged to memorize and then publicly recite the Gettysburg Address. These students, boys 11 to 17, all face a range of complex learning differences that make their personal, academic and social progress challenging. I was inspired by these students and that President Lincoln's historic words motivated them, so much that I am launching today an initiative to encourage as many people across the nation, especially students, to read aloud and learn about the Gettysburg Address. All five living U.S. presidents, as well as newsmakers and notable Americans from across the country, have already submitted videos of themselves reciting the address to learntheaddress.org. In the tradition of our great democracy, anyone who wishes to participate can join us in doing the same. As we consider Lincoln's words, we come to a greater appreciation of the significance of that day, just four and a half months after the Battle of Gettysburg, when the president of the United States of America journeyed to the now-quiet battlefield to dedicate a cemetery to those who fell in the greatest battle ever fought on American soil, in a war that had torn our fragile Republic in two. It is my hope, and that of so many people who have helped with the ""Learn the Address"" initiative, that we embrace the 150th anniversary and take this opportunity to more fully understand our democracy and our freedom. That we all discover the Gettysburg Address beyond ""four score and seven years ago."" In doing so, we hope to appreciate more fully ""that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that the government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" + + + . THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS: . Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

"(CNN) -- For Omara Moctar, the electrifying Tuareg guitarist better known as ""Bombino,"" there is no better place to play music than the majestic starkness of the desert. ""There's the heat, there's the wind, but after all of that, you find yourself at night in the most beautiful place,"" says Bombino, who is part of a new generation of Tuareg musicians performing ""desert rock"" on a global stage. ""The stars seem to be right there, next to you ...and the night feels good -- sometimes with the light of the moon and the changing dune colors, it's unbelievable, really."" Inspired by the changing landscape of the Niger desert, Bombino's haunting jams capture life in the desert and the spirit of his people. His almost mystic sound evokes the searing heat, the blustery wind and the shimmering horizon of the Sahel, combining music of the ages with riffs of Western blues and rock. Read more: Street musicians unite world through songs . Following in the footsteps of fellow Tuareg musicians -- and now international stars -- Tinariwen, Bombino's debut album has attracted critical acclaim from around the world. Called ""Agadez"" -- named after the largest town in northern Niger -- Bombino's album honors Tuareg culture, the hardships of youth and love. ""With music we can have dialogue,"" says Bombino, who lists Malian guitarist Ali Farka Toure and Jimi Hendrix as major influences on him. ""We can talk openly and explain ourselves without using violence, which isn't necessary."" The Tuareg are nomadic tribesmen in the Sahara and Sahel regions. Along with fighting the harsh climate of the endless desert, they have also been battling for their independence in the last 20 years, staging rebellions against the governments in Niger and Mali. Born in 1980, Bombino spent his childhood on the move as one rebellion followed another. He first picked up a guitar at the age of 12 while in exile in Algeria, where he had fled with members of his family after the first Tuareg rebellion in Mali and Niger. When democracy dawned in Niger, Bombino returned home. ""I went back to Agadez and at the time in Agadez to have access to instruments or a place to play, we needed to be part of a political party,"" he remembers. ""It was then they named me 'Bombino."" Read more: Ladysmith Black Mambazo: How we inspired Mandela . He spent the following years honing his craft as a working musician, performing at weddings and political rallies. But Bombino was forced to leave Niger once again in 2007 after two of his band members were killed in another uprising. He and thousands of others fled seeking refuge in Mali, Algeria and Burkina Faso. It was in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where he was tracked by Ron Wyman, the American documentary maker of ""Agadez: The Music and the Rebellion."" ""Ron was in Agadez in 2007,"" says Bombino. ""When he left for Iferouane, he got my cassette and he had it in his stereo during his entire trip in the desert."" Bombino's imaginative guitar playing and hypnotizing grooves entranced Wyman who embarked on a year-long mission to find the Tuareg musician. ""Ron came to Ouagadougou first and he told me about his documentary. Then, we made the album,"" says Bombino . Read also: Meet Asa, African pop legend in the making . The guitarist and songwriter recorded part of his debut offering at Wyman's house in the United States. Then they both went back to Agadez to complete the album that has won scores of fans of across the world and made Bombino an influential voice back home. Today Bombino is using his growing status to bring peace and celebration in troubled Niger. ""Everyone has had enough and does not want to return to the same situation,"" says Bombino . ""A musician in Tuareg society is a person who is always well-received,"" he notes. ""I'm in contact with the Niger government to make a small tour happen to calm and soothe the youth, and it's important to see this peace that we bring.""","Omara ""Bombino"" Moctar is part of a new generation of Tuareg musicians .

"(WIRED)  -- The Kyoto gamemaker is gearing up to launch Nintendo 3DS, a portable game machine with a glasses-free 3-D display, in the United States on March 27. Although 3DS sports a variety of built-in features like a 3-D camera and augmented-reality minigames, out of the box it lacks some features we would call basic -- a downloadable games store, for example, and the functionality to send messages to your online friends. But what 3DS does have is the ability to automatically receive system updates. Nintendo says it will push out firmware updates that will add content and new features to the OS without players having to do anything -- they just need to have their 3DS in sleep mode. Owners of game machines like Xbox 360 or Sony's PSP understand why this is a big deal. Microsoft has made massive overhauls to the Xbox 360's user interface since it shipped the console in 2005, adding major features like Netflix movie streaming, Avatar characters and support for Kinect. After five years of updates, today's Xbox 360 is practically a whole new machine. The same could happen with 3DS. Nintendo says some features, like the 3DS eShop and a web browser, will arrive in a system update in late May. To find out what could be next, Wired.com spoke to Nintendo 3DS' producer Hideki Konno at Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this month. As the producer of games like Nintendogs and Mario Kart, Konno's background is in software development. Nintendo clearly seems to perceive that continually tweaking and adding to the onboard software for 3DS is of paramount importance to the handheld's continuing success. Here are some things 3DS probably will do in the future (and some features you shouldn't expect.) Text chat . By exchanging 12-digit numerical codes with fellow early adopters, 3DS users can build a Friends List. Right now, there's not much you can do with it -- you can see which of your friends are online and what game they're playing, but there's no way to interact. No game invites, no voice chat, not even text messaging. When I floated the idea of text chat to Konno, he seemed to agree. ""We are going to be making updates to the system, and I think that's something that would be really interesting to do,"" he said through a translator. Game demos . Nintendo has traditionally been reluctant to release demo versions of games. It experimented briefly with them on its WiiWare service, releasing a handful of demos for a limited time. By contrast, playable demos are always available for every Xbox 360 downloadable game and many major retail ones. ""I question whether or not demos are effective,"" said Konno, adding that demos on 3DS would be ""technically feasible"" but that he isn't sure they motivate players to buy. ""There are cases where people play a demo game and they're satisfied with that play experience and they don't buy the game,"" he said. ""There are also times when they play a demo and think, 'Wow, this is great, I'm going to buy this when I have the chance.' So whether or not it's an effective use of resources, I'm not sure."" WIRED: 3DS idea man pulls back curtain on handheld's capabilities . Konno said demo versions or even entire games could be automatically pushed to 3DS with the SpotPass feature. ""You could wake up in the morning and say, 'Oh look, I've got a new game demo,' or a new game,"" he said. Games that require 3-D . At last year's E3 Expo, Nintendo showed off a massive array of software demos for 3DS. While most of them will be available soon, one of the most interesting ones seems to have been shelved entirely. The demo showed a Mario-style jumping game with transparent platforms. In the system's 2-D mode, it was virtually impossible to tell where the overlapping platforms were in relationship to each other. With 3-D on, the depth effect lets you see where to jump. ""We want to get software out to as many people as possible, and there are some people who just can't see 3-D,"" said Konno when asked about this demo. ""We're moving away from any stance that says if you don't use the 3-D functionality you can't play this game."" Limited time offer . Game industry executives like Gabe Newell of Valve Software have presented compelling evidence that allowing game developers to temporarily reduce the price of downloadable games can have a dramatic and lasting effect on sales. Konno says such price flexibility, a la Steam or the App Store, isn't quite what Nintendo is after. ""If what you're coming up with [is something like] the Apple iTunes store, where people can freely set their prices, I don't think that's going to be the case,"" Konno said. ""I'd be a little sad to see if there was a product that I worked on for a couple of years go on sale for a buck."" Echoing comments made by his boss, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, during a Game Developers Conference keynote address, Konno said the low prices on Apple's store aren't what Nintendo is aiming for on the 3DS eShop. ""Having a business model that allows for the prices to be driven down that low, as a developer it's kind of scary because we want to protect our content, and the only way we can justify creating good content is if it makes business sense,"" he said. ""It's more than a pricing issue, it's a company value. We want to compete with ideas, we want to surprise our consumer base. ""That's the battleground for us -- are we surprising consumers?""

"(CNN) -- A Ukrainian military plane with at least 49 passengers was shot down overnight Friday, a source said, making it the latest and likely one of the bloodiest single events in that nation's current period of turmoil. The Ilyushin-76 military transport plane went down while approaching an airport in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, a source with the Ukrainian Anti-Terror Operation of the Ukrainian military forces told CNN. It was not immediately clear how many of those aboard died or survived. The incident came hours after Ukraine's Kiev-based government -- which is trying to regain control of the country's restive south and east -- deemed successful an operation targeting pro-Russian separatists in the city of Mariupol. Anton Geraschenko, adviser to acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, said more than 30 ""terrorists"" had been detained and their base destroyed. Other separatists are hiding in homes and basements for safety, he said. Four Ukrainian soldiers were injured in the operation, he said. Residents of the southeastern port city may in the past have blocked Ukraine's security forces, he said, but ""today, not one resident of Mariupol protected terrorists."" According to the Interior Ministry, the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag is flying once again over the main municipal building in Mariupol. The city has changed hands several times in the course of hostilities over the past several months. Meanwhile, three Russian tanks that Avakov claimed had crossed the border into Ukraine on Thursday, prompting a skirmish between Ukrainian and Russian forces, are now in the Donetsk region, Geraschenko said. He said Ukrainian intelligence indicated that the tanks' drivers were Russian citizens. The Russian Foreign Ministry told the BBC on Thursday that the claim its tanks had crossed the border was ""another fake piece of information."" The United States also believes tanks and heavy weapons have crossed into Ukraine from Russia after moving from a deployment site in southwest Russia, a State Department spokeswoman said Friday. ""We also have information that Russia has accumulated multiple rocket launchers at this same deployment site ... and these rocket launchers also recently departed. Internet video has shown what we believe to be these same rocket launchers traveling through Luhansk,"" said Marie Harf. Geraschenko urged the tank drivers to leave their vehicles, warning they would soon be ""destroyed from the air."" Video posted online appeared to show the tanks in the Donetsk area. CNN was not able independently to verify the footage. Rival claims . According to Avakov, the tanks crossed the border at a checkpoint controlled by separatists in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Armored vehicles and artillery were part of the columns, the minister said Thursday, citing Ukrainian intelligence. Two of the tanks split off and were attacked by Ukrainian military forces, Avakov said. Part of that column was destroyed, he said. CNN has not independently confirmed the incidents. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March, when Russia annexed Crimea and massed troops along its border with Ukraine. Western leaders have accused Moscow of fomenting instability in eastern Ukraine. Russian leaders say Ukraine has failed to move to implement a framework for peace worked out in Geneva, Switzerland, in April. They say Ukrainian leaders have carried out a campaign of violence against people living in the largely pro-Russian east. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""held a substantial and long phone conversation,"" the Ukrainian President's media office said. The leaders discussed Poroshenko's peace plan to resolve the situation in the east of Ukraine, it said. Poroshenko has called on the rebels to lay down their arms and engage in talks. Also Thursday, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, said he would introduce a resolution on Ukraine at the U.N. Security Council in light of what he said was a deteriorating situation in the country. Churkin told reporters the resolution, to be introduced behind closed doors, would focus on stopping the violence in Ukraine and addressing political efforts through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Based on Russia's past vetoes of Western-backed Ukraine resolutions, its passage is thought unlikely. CNN's Matthew Chance and Richard Roth and journalist Victoria Butenko, in Kiev, contributed to this report.","NEW: Source: An Ilyushin-76 military transport plane is shot down near Luhansk .

"(CNN) -- Google this week unveiled its Chrome Web Store, which aims to do for the Web what Apple's App Store did for mobile devices: It provides a place to explore and ""install"" Web-based applications. The launch was announced alongside a new netbook running Chrome OS, Google's browser-centric operating system. And the Web Store is part of Chrome, Google's super-fast Web browser. Except that many Chrome apps can run in other browsers, since they're actually just websites. Oh, and don't mistake apps for ""extensions,"" which are add-ons for the Chrome browser. Confused yet? Suffice to say, Google's grand plans are ambitious, groundbreaking and darned difficult to explain to the average computer user. That's why I think it'll be some time before the world embraces Google's vision for the future. Google's grand plan . What is Google's vision? Ultimately, the company anticipates a future in which a Web browser is all you'll need. In an era when much of our time is spent online, operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS are overkill. Instead, Google plans computers that boot up almost instantly and take the user straight to the Web browser. This will be made possible by Google's super-simple operating system, Chrome OS. In this new world of Web-based software, meanwhile, desktop applications are replaced with Web applications -- all of your data and applications are stored on the Web rather than the device. Hence the launch of the Chrome Web Store. Missing pieces . Google's Chrome ambitions are hard to explain because these pieces of the puzzle are yet to be combined. While the Chrome browser is growing in popularity, with nearly 10% market share, the only Chrome OS computer launched so far is a test model available to a select few developers and journalists. In short, Google has essentially launched an app store for a series of devices that are yet to debut. Yes, you could use the Chrome Web Store as your starting point each day and jump into this new paradigm with both feet. But this is less intuitive when using a computer with existing desktop apps, browser bookmarks and other hallmarks of the existing paradigm. It's a move that some early adopters may make, but a step too far for the mass market. Slow progress . In truth, I don't see the Chrome Web Store gaining steam until we have devices in stores running Chrome OS -- expected sometime next year. Only then will consumers truly grasp this new approach to computing: A super-simple operating system linked to a Web-based app store. Until that day, color us confused.","Google this week unveiled its Chrome Web Store .

"(CNN) -- Remember when supermodel Linda Evangelista said she didn't ""wake up for less than $10,000 a day?"" The provocative comment -- made in Vogue magazine in 1990 -- haunted the Canadian beauty for the rest of her career. But fast forward two decades and $10,000 now seems like a paltry figure in comparison with today's ""modelpreneurs."" How about rousing yourself from bed to the tune of $42 million a year? That's how much Brazilian Gisele Bündchen earned in 12 months, according to Forbes magazine's latest list of the world's richest models. If it seems impossible to earn that much money from sashaying down a catwalk alone, then that's because it is. Bündchen doesn't make her millions simply from modeling -- she makes them through lucrative endorsement deals with everyone from H&M to Chanel, and her own line of sandals with footwear company Grendene. A new generation . Enter a new era of supermodel-turned-supermogul, where girls as young as 16 start carving brand names for themselves from the moment they hit the fashion runway. ""If you look at the top models, they probably make 10% to 15% of their money from the catwalk -- the rest is really made from endorsements and brands,"" said Ryan Schinman, chief executive of Platinum Rye Entertainment, which represents corporations that partner with celebrities. ""It used to be retired models who created their own brands. Now a lot of newer girls are thinking about it from the very start -- you don't need to be in the business for 10 years to build a name for yourself anymore."" Schinman pointed to the rise of social media in helping young models build a global following. By using Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter they can reach out to the public with more ease than ever before -- and push their brand. The Gisele factor . But being attractive, young, and tech-savvy isn't always enough to catapult you to the top of the model rich list. There's also another factor: personality. ""The ability to sell has nothing to do with your profession -- it's down to your popularity and likeability,"" said Schinman. He pointed to the phenomenal success of Gisele Bündchen, who this year tops the rich list for the seventh time. ""She's a global phenomenon who's been able to transcend the industry,"" he said. ""Now she's a mom, that's also opened her up to more categories of commercialism."" ""And the fact that she's married to American footballer Tom Brady means she also gets added coverage."" Victoria's Secret celebrities . Trailing behind Bündchen on the Forbes list is Australian Miranda Kerr on $7.2 million a year -- also a former Victoria's Secret model -- who today has deals with Qantas, Mango, and her own beauty products line, Kora Organics. In fact, eight of the top ten models in the Forbes list have worked for the Victoria's Secret lingerie label, a major name in the fashion industry which provides international exposure for its ""Angels,"" as they're called. And as the price of hiring well-known actresses continues to rise, retailers are increasingly turning to models to sell their products. ""Celebrities are becoming a lot less affordable,"" said Schinman. ""Models are now in a very strong period commercially, more so than ever before."" ""The more you are believable to the brand you're representing the better -- a lot of it has to do with trust. A model is seen as someone who understands good design, fashion and accessories."" It pays to be pretty (savvy) In an industry where you can be seen as ""over the hill"" in your 30s, it pays to build a career off the catwalk. ""It helps your longevity. It means when your looks start to fade you'll still have a lucrative career,"" said Schinman. For Bündchen and her fellow multimillion dollar ""modelpreneurs,"" it seems they really are more than just pretty faces.","Gisele Bundchen tops Forbes list of richest models, earning $42m in a year .

"BEIJING, China (Reuters)  -- A panda once believed to be male and sent to Japan to breed with a female without success gave birth to twin cubs this week, state media reported on Thursday. An estimated 1,600 wild pandas live in nature reserves in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The panda, ""Jinzhu"", gave birth to two female cubs on Monday at the Wolong Nature Reserve in the mountainous southwestern province of Sichuan, 11 years after being declared male at birth in 1996, Xinhua news agency said. ""Jinzhu was believed to be male owing to her inconspicuous secondary sex characteristic and behavior,"" the agency quoted Wei Rongping, assistant director of the reserve's research center, as saying. Jinzhu was sent to Japan in 2000 to mate with a female, the report said. ""When the pandas showed complete disinterest, experts decided to turn to artificial insemination, leading to the discovery that Jinzhu had no penis,"" it added. Jinzhu was sent back to China in 2002, with experts arguing the panda was either a hermaphrodite or had ""undeveloped"" sexual organs. ""The penis of an adult panda is only about 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) long,"" Xinhua quoted Li Deshen, a panda expert, as saying, as a possible reason for the mix-up. It was not until 2005 that scientists discovered nine-year-old Jinzhu's ovaries were positioned in the wrong place, and gave her a two-hour operation to make her a ""normal girl"", Xinhua said. Jinzhu subsequently mated with a male in March 2007 and gave birth 142 days later, Xinhua said. The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species and is found only in China.

"(CNN) -- Lion, the latest version of Apple's operating software for its Mac computers, was released to the public on Wednesday. It's an update that continues to blur the line between software on mobile devices and desktop computers. Marking the eighth major release of new software for Apple computers, Mac OS X Lion offers 250 new features, according to the company. With multi-touch gesturing, full-screen app display and access to the Mac App Store built directly into the software, the system was clearly designed to make working on a Mac more similar to working on an iPad. ""Lion is the best version of OS X yet, and we're thrilled that users around the world can download it starting today,"" said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, said in a written statement. ""Lion makes upgrading a Mac easier than ever before; just launch the Mac App Store, buy Lion with your iTunes account, and the download and install process will begin automatically."" Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital called Lion Apple's ""most radical new MacIntosh operating system in years,"" calling it a ""giant step in the merger of the personal computer and post-PC devices like tablets and smartphones."" The new system, however, does not run iPhone or iPad apps (at least, not yet) and it does run Adobe Flash -- something Steve Jobs and company have summarily banished from their mobile devices. Its touch features use a touchpad, making them similar, but not exactly the same, as what iPhone and iPad users may be used to on their touchscreens. Mossberg said he likes the system, but warned that new users may suffer during their transition. ""Switching to Lion will require a major adjustment even for veteran Mac users, though it will be easier for those who use iPhones or iPads,"" he wrote. ""Lion will significantly increase the learning curve for Windows users switching to the Mac."" Brian X. Chen of Wired wrote that ""some of Lion's iOS-like features scale up very well, while others behave very poorly in a desktop environment."" He found the software's iPad-like scrolling feature distracting and dizzying (he eventually disabled it) but said he enjoyed the system's app-opening full-screen mode and praised new sharing and auto-save functions. Mac OS X Lion is available as a $29.99 upgrade for people with the latest version of the Snow Leopard operating system. It will be available at Apple Stores in August for $69.99. Lion is the latest in a long line of cat-named operating systems rolled out by Apple for its computers. Past versions have included Cheetah, Puma, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard. Whether the king of the jungle marks the last version of feline-named software remains to be seen -- but we're still holding out hope for Jaguarundi.","Apple's Mac OS X Lion released on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Two former world No. 1s. Two tennis stars who have been unlucky in love with golfing partners. Two women who are getting their careers back on track. Caroline Wozniacki will take on Ana Ivanovic in Sunday's final of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo in a battle of two players who have promised so much, but fallen frustratingly short. Wozniacki's fortunes have taken a remarkable turn for the better since Rory McIlroy called off their wedding -- with a phone call -- in May. While the golfer regained his best form immediately, winning two major titles in a month, Wozniacki's resurgence has been more gradual -- culminating in defeat to Serena Williams in this month's U.S. Open final. The Dane, who won the Tokyo title in 2010, is seeking the 23rd WTA Tour crown of her career, and second this year following July's Istanbul success. She had to show her renowned fighting qualities on Saturday before battling to a 6-4 2-6 6-2 win over 20-year-old Spaniard Garbine Muguruza, who this season has reached the first two finals of her career, winning one of them. ""She was playing really, really well and very aggressively, but I just kept fighting and staying in there, and I think at the end I had just a little bit more energy than she did,"" Wozniacki said after her 22nd win in 26 matches since the hard-court swing began. The 24-year-old needs to improve on her 2-4 career record against Ivanovic, who holds the last of eight qualifying places in the race to feature at the season-ending championships in Singapore -- Wozniacki is ninth, with five slots yet to be decided. The Serbian, who had an on-off relationship with Australian golfer Adam Scott earlier this decade, has won three of her five finals in 2014 after rebuilding her game and ranking. Unlike Wozniacki, she has a grand slam title to her name -- the 2008 French Open -- but has not done so well in this season's majors since reaching the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. Ivanovic lost in the 2007 Tokyo final before it became a premier-level event on the tour, and the 26-year-old has another chance for Japanese success after knocking out top seed Angelique Kerber in Saturday's semifinals. She came back from 5-3 down in the opening set, winning 10 of the next 13 games to triumph 7-5 6-3 against the German -- who lost to Petra Kvitova in last year's final. ""In the beginning it really took me some time to adjust to her game. It wasn't like my previous matches,"" Ivanovic said after her 51st win this season, equaling her career best achieved seven years ago. ""But once I adjusted and got more aggressive it started to go my way, and I'm really happy with the win today because she's always such a tough and challenging opponent."" Meanwhile, Romania's Monica Niculescu won the second WTA Tour title of her career Saturday, beating France's Alize Cornet 6-4 6-0 in the final of the Guangzhou International Women's Open. American Varvara Lepchenko will play Czech Karolina Pliskova in Sunday's Korea Open final in Seoul.","Caroline Wozniacki faces Ana Ivanovic in the final of the Tokyo Open .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. General Assembly voted to adopt the world body's first treaty to regulate the global arms trade Tuesday, a move Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called ""a victory for the world's people."" The Arms Trade Treaty will regulate the transfers of tanks, heavy artillery, combat aircraft, missiles, warships and small arms. Ban said the pact will make it harder for weapons to reach black markets and fall into the hands of ""warlords, pirates, terrorists, criminals and their like."" ""It will be a powerful new tool in our efforts to prevent grave human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law,"" he said in a statement on the 154-3 vote. ""And it will provide much-needed momentum for other global disarmament and non-proliferation efforts."" Iran, Syria and North Korea were the only votes against the treaty, which will take effect when 50 member states ratify it. ""The international community can claim full ownership of this treaty, which will make trade in conventional arms more responsible and transparent, thus reducing human suffering and tangibly contributing to international peace, security and stability,"" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said in a written statement. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the pact ""can strengthen global security while protecting the sovereign right of states to conduct legitimate arms trade.""

"(CNN) -- How do you swipe $7 million in toys, electronics and other stuff without anyone noticing? Apparently, in Mom's flowing black dress, according to federal prosecutors who have charged three members of an Illinois family with transporting stolen property across state lines. They'd been at it for a decade, prosecutors said. Prosecutors say Lela Bogdanov stuffed merchandise in the blue lining of her big black dress, then walked out of the stores -- often with family members staging a diversion to draw the attention of employees. The family -- Lela Bogdanov, her husband Branko Bogdanov, both in their 50s, and daughter Julia Bogdanov, 34 -- then sold many of the items to a fence who unloaded them on eBay, prosecutors claim. The alleged fence is cooperating with authorities and was not named by prosecutors. The couple netted more than $4 million from the sale of stolen goods with a retail value of more than $7 million, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago. The Bogdanovs' decade-long scheme began to unravel, prosecutors say, when loss-prevention experts at Barnes and Noble and Toys R Us noticed huge amounts of merchandise had gone missing. They found an eBay account selling the same items in similar quantities as those allegedly stolen from their stores. Secret Service agents arrested the trio Wednesday at their Northbrook, Illinois, home. They'd just returned home from a trip to Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, during which prosecutors say they stole more items. If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and restitution.","Three Illinois family members accused in decade-long shoplifting ring .

"(CNN) -- House Republican leaders announced Thursday they will not take action on a new farm bill until after the November elections -- a sign of sharp internal GOP divisions on a critical political issue for many members of Congress. ""We will deal with the farm bill after the election,"" said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""The current situation that we face is we've got people who believe there's not enough reform in the farm bill that came out of (the House Agriculture) committee, (and) we've got others who believe that there's too much reform in the bill that came out of the committee."" Boehner indicated GOP leaders do not believe they currently have the votes to pass either a short-term extension or a more comprehensive five-year measure. The current five-year law establishing various levels of federal support for farmers and ranchers -- now struggling with drought in many parts of the country -- expires September 30. A failure to pass a new law won't impact existing federal support in 2012, though it would have a significant impact on agricultural markets in 2013, according to Dale Moore, a public policy deputy at the American Farm Bureau Federation. While the Democratic-run Senate passed a comprehensive $969 billion replacement bill in June through a rare bipartisan 64-35 vote, numerous conservatives in the Republican-controlled House have balked at the overall price tag and rising cost of food stamps included in the measure. Several Farm Belt Republicans in tight political races this year, however, have pushed hard for quick legislative action on a five-year plan. North Dakota Rep. Rick Berg, a freshman House Republican running for retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad's seat, told CNN Thursday he was ""frustrated with the Republican leadership."" ""We have to get a five-year, long-term bill passed. I'm really disappointed,"" he said. ""Agriculture is one of our bright shining spots in America right now, and we don't need to put this cloud of uncertainty over it."" Berg argued that GOP leaders should have allowed a full House vote on the Agriculture Committee measure. The committee's bill has a number of similarities to the Senate plan. Asked about the farm bill's legislative prospects in the post-election lame duck session of Congress, Berg said, ""I look back over history and this is more normal than not. ... I'm just doing everything I can do."" Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, told CNN there were ""10 different reasons"" why the House has so far failed to act. ""Some people think the food stamps are too high. Some people don't like the sugar program. Some people don't like the dairy program. Some people don't like the farm bill at all,"" he said. Peterson said he believes farm bill advocates will ultimately ""get a shot"" after the election. ""I think they're taking a (political) risk,"" he said in reference to the House Republicans. ""But they apparently don't think it's a problem."" Moore told CNN that ""we can whine and complain all we want, but the bottom line is this segment of the game is over. We've got to get our strategy together and move our chips onto the lame duck line.""","""We will deal with the farm bill after the election,"" said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio .

"Washington (CNN) -- North Korea's agreement to halt portions of its nuclear and missile programs and accept the return of nuclear inspectors is a ""modest step in the right direction,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. Clinton said, however, that the United States will be watching North Korea closely and judging the country's leaders by their actions in the coming weeks and months. North Korea last week announced it would freeze its nuclear and missile tests, along with uranium enrichment programs, and allow the return of U.N. nuclear inspectors in exchange for 240,000 metric tons of food aid from the United States. North Korea has suffered famines and widespread malnutrition during the past two decades -- thanks to its dysfunctional economy and international sanctions. Other countries and international groups have repeatedly stepped in with food aid to alleviate the situation. The United States suspended shipments of food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program and concerns that the supplies were not reaching those most in need. Clinton spoke after meeting in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan, who called the North Korean agreement ""a meaningful first step"" toward resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Kim said ""faithful implementation"" of the measures to which North Korea agreed -- the moratorium on nuclear activities and the return of the inspectors -- was important going forward. The timing of the food aid is unclear. Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, said the administrative details have been resolved, but officials are still working on details. King, who on Thursday wrapped up two days of talks with officials from Pyongyang, said he is optimistic that the food aid will find its way to those in need in North Korea. The initial deal last week to resume the deliveries came after the the two countries revived negotiations that had stalled after the death in December of the longtime North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The talks this week were intended to finalize points like what ports will be used to dock incoming ships, how the distribution of the food will be monitored and which nongovernmental organizations will be involved. U.S. officials cautiously welcomed the agreement last week in hopes of a new era in relations with North Korea and a resumption of multilateral talks aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, and his government since Kim Jong Un took over from his father, Kim Jong Il, as North Korean leader. Earlier this week, North Korean television aired footage of a military unit carrying out live-fire drills in sight of a South Korean island. It showed tanks repositioning and an artillery machine being prepared, overlooking waters that have seen a number of violent incidents over the years. Li Gum-chol, a North Korean deputy commander, threatened to engulf Seoul in a ""sea of flames"" in retaliation for U.S.-South Korean joint military drills taking place on the peninsula. North Korea has condemned the annual drills as provocation.","Clinton calls it a ""step in the right direction""

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his long-awaited and wide-ranging speech Thursday on American and Muslim relations, offering a hand of friendship to Islam and addressing an array of quandaries and conflicts dividing the two cultures. President Obama urges a new chapter in ties between the U.S. and Muslims in a speech Thursday in Cairo, Egypt. At Egypt's Cairo University, Obama quoted from the Quran as he expounded on Islam's glories and rights, the legitimate rights of Israel and the Palestinians, Iranian nuclear aspirations, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's rights, economic development, and religious rights and democracy in the Muslim world. The address, billed as a fence-mending mission between the United States and Islam, urged those present and the people across the globe viewing the speech on television to enter a new, productive and peaceful chapter in their relationship. Obama's stop in Egypt is part of a trip that started in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and will continue later to Germany and France.  Watch Obama's entire speech » . ""I know there are many -- Muslim and non-Muslim -- who question whether we can forge this new beginning,"" Obama said, emphasizing that ""it is easier to start wars than to end them. It is easier to blame others than to look inward, to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share."" Obama reiterated a statement he made in Turkey in April. ""In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. ""We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women and children. And it is my first duty as president to protect the American people."" Obama explored the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, endorsing a two-state solution and urging compromise and understanding between ""two peoples with legitimate aspirations."" iReport.com: A reaction to Obama's speech . And then he entered into the conflict's thickets, understanding claims from both sides. He said the United States ""does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements"" seen by Muslims as impediments to Middle East peace.  Watch as Obama seeks a ""new beginning"" » . ""This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop."" Calling America's ""strong bond"" with Israel ""unbreakable,"" he said, ""It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied."" He denounced the denial of the Holocaust and anti-Semitic stereotyping, and criticized anyone who would threaten Israel's destruction. Expounding on the plight of Palestinians, Obama said ""it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- have suffered in pursuit of a homeland."" ""For more than 60 years they have endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead,"" he said.  Watch Obama discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict » . ""They endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own."" Obama also denounced Palestinian violence and the rejection by some of Israeli existence -- both seen by Israel as obstacles to peace. The president conjured the lessons of America's civil rights movement when he urged Palestinians to ""abandon violence."" ""Resistance through violence and killing is wrong, and it does not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation,"" he said. ""It was not violence that won full and equal rights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding."" The conflict, Obama said, needs to be seen from a larger perspective, not from the viewpoint of one side or another. And both sides must live up to the responsibilities of the moribund ""road map"" peace process, he said.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Obama's message of detente » . He added that the Hamas movement -- which controls Gaza -- and has some support among Palestinians must end violence and recognize past agreements. He also urged Arab states to no longer use the conflict to distract their peoples from other problems. ""The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security,"" he said. Obama talked about the importance of confronting violent extremism, touching on the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Emphasizing the fact that the United States entered Afghanistan by ""necessity"" and not ""choice,"" he countered the stances of some ""who ""question or justify the events of 9/11."" ""But let us be clear: Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men, women and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody. And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with,"" he said. Obama said the United States does not seek to keep its troops in Afghanistan or establish military bases there but needs to continue the fight against ""extremists,"" with both military power and investment in the infrastructure and economy of Pakistan and Afghanistan. ""It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women. It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. But that is not yet the case,"" he said. He addressed the conflict in Iraq, calling it unlike Afghanistan ""a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world."" ""Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible,"" he said. He said the United States needs to help Iraq ""forge a better future and leave Iraq to Iraqis."" ""I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. That is why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all our troops from Iraq by 2012."" Speaking about prohibiting torture and the closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, Obama talked about working on ""concrete actions to change course"" and correct abuses in the war on terror. ""Just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles. 9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals,"" he said. Obama dwelled on the tensions over nuclear weapons between the United States and Iran and the ""tumultuous history"" between the countries. He pointed to the U.S. role in overthrowing a democratically elected government during the Cold War era and Iran's role in hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The president reiterated his desire to move forward with Iran on many issues, saying the ""question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build."" ""But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point. This is not simply about America's interests. It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path."" The United States and other Western nations have opposed what they believe are Iran's intentions to develop nuclear weapons. Obama said that any nation, including Iran, ""should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."" He said such a ""commitment"" is at the treaty's core and ""it must be kept for all who fully abide by it."" ""And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal,"" Obama said.","President Obama touches on Iran, Mideast conflict, wars in Iraq, Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Threats of a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Refusing to answer a hotline phone. Announcing the ending of the armistice. Even by North Korean standards, the threats this week by leader Kim Jong Un and ensuing actions have been incredibly provocative, making the situation on the Korean Peninsula more worrisome. Here's a look at the Kim's escalating rhetoric and his country's actions since he came to power following his father's death in 2011: . March 2012 . As South Korea hosts world leaders at an international nuclear security summit in Seoul, North Korea moves a long-range rocket toward a launch pad. Pyongyang says it plans to carry out the test in mid-April as part of a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder. April 2012 . Defying warnings by U.S. President Barack Obama that Kim has nothing to gain from provocations, Pyongyang launches the rocket. It breaks apart and falls into the sea. August 2012 . Kim visits the same military unit behind a 2010 attack on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, where he reminds the troops to be ready to fight a ""sacred war"" against Seoul. The North Korean leader makes the veiled threat just ahead of an annual war games conducted of the Korean Peninsula by the United States and South Korea. The dictator calls the joint Seoul-Washington military exercises a ""war rehearsal"" to invade. October 2012 . North Korea claims to have developed missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland. December 2012 . Kim announces plans to launch another long-range rocket in a renewed effort to send a satellite into space. Two days after the government announces the launch window is being pushed back because of technical issues, the rocket lifts off from the west coast of North Korea. Pyongyang declares the mission a success. January 2013 . North Korea announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it says are part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The threats come two days after the U.N. Security Council approves the broadening of sanctions in response to the rocket launch in December that apparently put a satellite in orbit. February 2013 . North Korea carries out an underground nuclear bomb test on February 12. The test is designed ""to defend the country's security and sovereignty in the face of the ferocious hostile act of the U.S.,"" the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency says at the time, referring to new U.S.-led sanctions. ""This nuclear test is our first measure, which displayed our maximum restraint. ...If the U.S. continues with their hostility and complicates the situation, it would be inevitable to continuously conduct a stronger second or third measure."" March 2013 . Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatens for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea. It's one of a series of threat that begins with Pyongyang threatening to scrap the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War. At the same time, it cuts off its direct phone links with South Korea at Panmunjom, the abandoned village that sits on the border between the two countries. On March 8, North Korea doubles down on the threat, saying it is nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. One of the country's top generals, according to published reports, claims Pyongyang has nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired. In a sign of crumbling relations, North Korea refuses to answer its hotline with South Korea, South Korea's unification ministry said Monday, according to the Yonhap news agency. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, reports Monday that North Korea's army has declared invalid the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the Korean War.

"(CNN) -- Are criminal charges just the beginning of Justin Bieber's legal troubles? Depending on how things play out, the Canadian citizen could also have an immigration case to worry about. #DeportBieber trended on Twitter last week, with critics pushing authorities to send the teen pop star north of the border after he was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on suspicion of drunk driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. It's not likely Bieber will be kicked out of the United States, immigration law experts say. But even so, criminal charges could complicate things for the 19-year-old singer -- and if he's charged with and convicted of any drug offenses, that could change the equation. What crimes lead to deportation? In addition to the charges he faces in Florida, investigators in California are also weighing whether Bieber will face a felony vandalism charge tied to an egg attack there. Immigration lawyers say convictions on those charges wouldn't generally lead to deportation for someone like Bieber, who has a visa allowing him to legally live in the United States because of his ""extraordinary ability"" in the arts. That's because those charges aren't considered to be aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude -- the two types of crimes that federal law defines as grounds for the deportation of non-citizen immigrants. And according to federal law, only violent crimes and sentences longer than one year result in a re-evaluation of a person's visa status. Translation for those of you who aren't legal eagles: Bieber's probably not going anywhere. But when it comes to deportation proceedings, it's not a simple matter. ""It's a very complex area of immigration law,"" said Annaluisa Padilla, a California immigration lawyer. An ""aggravated felony"" sounds severe. And often they are; crimes like murder, rape or sexual abuse are among the violations that fit that description. But crimes that might sound less serious to the average person can also be considered aggravated felonies. In 2000, for example, a federal appeals court determined that a man with a green card was an aggravated felon after a misdemeanor conviction for stealing Tylenol and cigarettes, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse Immigration project at Syracuse University, which follows immigration trends and statistics. Sometimes, Padilla said, a crime considered a misdemeanor at the state level is viewed as a felony by federal immigration officials. The bottom line: Until investigators finish weighing their options and the criminal case against Bieber proceeds, it's impossible to predict how his immigration status could be impacted. Drugs could change the equation . After his arrest in Florida last week, Bieber ""made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication,"" Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said. Since then, breathalyzer tests have suggested Bieber was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by Miami Beach police early Thursday. But it could be two or three weeks before tests that should give a more accurate blood-alcohol reading and could tell if he was high on pot are back from the lab. When authorities searched Bieber's California home earlier this month, a deputy found suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za, who now faces a felony drug charge. But a detective who searched other parts of the home told CNN last week that he saw ""no sign of drugs"" there. Bieber hasn't been charged with any drug-related crimes in connection with either case. But if drugs were involved, that could change the equation when it comes to immigration issues, experts say. ""He may have a difficult time returning to the U.S. after traveling,"" Padilla said. ""If there is a conviction on the use of marijuana, he may run into some issues when renewing his visa or even attempting to apply for residency."" And if authorities add a drug charge into the mix, that could eventually put deportation on the table, said Ira Kurzban, an attorney in Miami who wrote a widely used reference book on immigration law. ""Deportation grounds for drug-related crimes are broadly defined,"" Kurzban said. But a drunk-driving charge that isn't drug-related, he said, ""is not a basis to deport somebody."" Decision near on Bieber's egging charge; singer takes it easy in Panama . A double standard? Bieber was released Thursday from a Miami jail an hour after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a judge, who set a $2,500 bond that afternoon. Since his arrest, some critics have wondered whether Bieber wouldn't be deported for reasons that have little to do with the law. In a CNN.com opinion column last week, CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette suggested the wealthy singer's star status might be getting him special treatment. ""Bieber has an estimated net worth of about $130 million,"" Navarrette wrote. ""I bet that, right about now, many of those Mexican immigrants who were deported because they came to the attention of local police officers for a burned-out taillight, or for not making a complete stop at an intersection, are wishing that they had been a rich, white kid with marginal music ability and too much money. If so, things might have gone differently for them."" But Padilla says there's a key difference between such examples and Bieber's case: He has a visa. ""The reason an individual who had failed to stop at a stop sign or is driving without a license comes in contact with immigration authorities is because they're undocumented,"" Padilla said. ""You're not comparing apples to apples."" CNN's Alan Duke and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Immigration lawyers say it's unlikely Justin Bieber will face deportation .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- It was not surprising that investigators found bottles of prescription drugs in Michael Jackson's home, the singer's dermatologist said, as two sources told CNN that Jackson's sister Janet attempted an intervention two years ago. Dr. Arnold Klein, who was Michael Jackson's dermatologist, said he warned the singer about drug use. ""I'm very shocked by it, but I have to tell you it's not something that would be unheard of,"" Dr. Arnold Klein said Wednesday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" adding that he repeatedly warned Jackson about the danger of such drugs. Meanwhile, two sources close to the Jackson family said Wednesday that sister Janet, the pop star, was so worried after visiting the emaciated singer in 2007 that she tried to stage an intervention with assistance from her other brothers. Michael Jackson reportedly ordered his security guards not to let the family members in. He also refused to take calls from his mother, Katherine. ""If you tried to deal with him, he would shut you out,"" one source said. ""You just wouldn't hear from him for long periods."" At the time, the Jackson family released a statement to People magazine about the alleged intervention, denying it. But Janet Jackson was not among the signatories. Also Wednesday, a source said the Los Angeles County coroner's office has drawn up a list of doctors who treated Jackson over the years and will talk to them to determine what kind of drugs they may have prescribed the singer in the past. Among them: Klein and Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's cardiologist, whom the Los Angeles police already had interviewed. The cause of Jackson's June 25 death is pending a toxicology report. It is also the focus of an investigation by police, the state attorney general's office and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""I knew at one point that he was using Diprivan when he was on tour in Germany,"" Klein said, without specifying when. ""He was using it to go to sleep at night. I told him he was absolutely insane. I said, 'You have to quit it. This drug, you can't repeatedly take.' "" Diprivan is a powerful drug administered intravenously to induce or maintain anesthesia or sedation, according to the Food and Drug Administration. It is known by the generic name Propofol. Klein is the latest in a series of Jackson associates -- including doctors, nurses, employees and friends -- to tie the singer to drugs in recent days. Last week, sources close to Jackson said the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during the ""HIStory"" world tour in the mid-1990s. Klein, however, said he had not seen Diprivan or IV poles in the singer's house. Asked whether Jackson had track marks on his arms, as one source said, Klein said he had not seen any. ""Michael, at one time, had an addiction. He went to England and withdrew that addiction, where he went off drugs altogether,"" the doctor said.  Watch doctor on Jackson's use of Diprivan » . Klein refuted that he had ever given Jackson drugs beyond the doses needed for surgery. ""If you took all the pills I gave him in the last year at once, it wouldn't do anything to you."" Klein carefully couched a question about whether he was the biological father of Jackson's children. ""The most important thing is: The father is who the children want their father to be,"" he said. When King repeatedly pressed Klein, the doctor said: ""I still can't answer it absolutely one way or another."" He said he donated sperm to a sperm bank, but not to Jackson. He said he is willing to take a DNA test. ""I think, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not the father,"" he said. ""Can't we leave this alone? Can't we leave these children alone?"" Meanwhile, the city of Los Angeles said that Jackson's memorial service cost $1.4 million. Spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said the costs included extra police on the streets, trash pickup, other sanitation and traffic control for the Tuesday event. Three thousand police officers, almost one-third of the force, were on hand to ensure that the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell said. The city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans for donations to help with the expenses. On Tuesday morning, hundreds of donors contributed more than $17,000 through the site. But then, the high volume of traffic caused the site to crash frequently and for long periods, the mayor's office said. So the city couldn't collect contributions for several hours Tuesday. The site also crashed for 12 hours, beginning at 8 p.m. Tuesday, and again, periodically Wednesday morning, the office said. Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich does not want taxpayers to pay a penny for the service, his spokesman said Wednesday. ""The city attorney does not want something like this happening again, the city paying [the initial costs] for a private event,"" spokesman John Franklin said. ""That's especially in a cash-strapped city, where people have been furloughed or even lost jobs.""

"(CNN) -- Sometimes on a summer evening, I'll step out into the warm air as darkness descends around me. As my eyes adjust to the dimming sky, I'll look across the street and see a flicker from behind the all-but-dead apple tree. Just one small glimmer in the spreading gloom.

If you help someone out of a jam, you didn't do enough. If you can't help someone, you aren't good enough. The feelings are maddening. I look around me at the life I live. I make good money, I have a good job, my wife is great, I have traveled the world, and I have a little daughter that is a ray of sunshine in my life. How in the WORLD could I be depressed when I have what so many others in the world would LOVE to have? ""But, then there are times that the sky clears up, and life is just good. I feel comfortable with myself, and am at peace. These times are rare. I think it has happened maybe a half dozen times in my life. But, it does happen. For anyone suffering through depression, try to remember that the lives of those around you are better for knowing you."" -- sadGeek . ""The full blown version - the kind that is truly physiological and for which no medications have any effect - is witheringly exhausting, both physically and mentally. ... People have no idea the immense burden that you are carrying and you are judged as if you are normal."" -- JFairweather . ""For me, it's not 'feeling sad'; it's like I can't feel anything -- just emotionless, tired, dull, uninterested in everything. If it gets bad, I feel like everything has slowed down and I can't peel myself off the bed. I've been actively suicidal multiple times. But like the author of this essay I've found that it is easier to be open about it than to hide it as though it's a guilty secret."" -- Callista . Emotional eating: Gray cakes tackle depression taboo . Despite the pain in our voices, I'd still count us all among the incredibly fortunate for having the freedom to talk about depression and a language with which to do so. Not everyone has that freedom of communication as part of their arsenal. In particular, children, members of the military and some minority populations can find it difficult to speak about or get help for depression symptoms, often because of cultural taboos or lack of information. Children and adolescents (as I was when I was diagnosed) simply might not understand that there is a name for what they're feeling or have the language to articulate it to someone who might help. According to the National Comorbidity Survey, 11% of adolescents suffer from a depressive disorder by age 18, and that is heavily skewed toward girls. The National Institute of Mental Health reports that young people are likely to mask their their depression in behavior that simply seems like sulking, shyness, reluctance to go to school, clinging to a parent or pretending to be physically ill. Older adolescents may act out negatively or attempt to numb the pain through substance abuse. Because so many of these are pretty standard markers of growing pains, the behavior is often dismissed as ""just a phase,"" and kids are punished or tolerated but not treated. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the third leading cause of death among people 15-24. Sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, especially those who serve in the military, often feel isolated upon return from a tour of duty and don't wish to burden their loved ones with their pain and the horror of what they've seen. According to Army data, 2012 saw a 22% increase in active-duty suicides, and in a study of 72 active-duty service members who had attempted to commit suicide, every single respondent selected ""to stop bad feelings"" as part of the reasoning for their attempt. ""That is an epidemic. Something's wrong,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Congress after the figures were released in July. Army Sgt. Maj. Raymond F. Chandler III believes the key is for senior military personnel to lead by example and share their own stories of PTSD, brain injury and suicidal thoughts. ""It is a source of strength to ask for help,"" Chandler told participants in a Suicide Stand Down roundtable discussion on the issue. ""And we are all about being strong in the Army."" He continued, ""Our ultimate goal is to change mindset across the force, build resilience, strengthen life-coping skills and address the stigma associated with asking for help. We've got a long ways to go, but we're going to get there."" And in some cultures, the subject of depression is simply taboo. Terrie Williams, author of ""Black Pain: It Just Looks Like We're Not Hurting,"" says the silence is destroying the African-American community. Williams suffered a severe emotional breakdown not long after launching a public relations company with high-profile clients like Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and a who's-who of modern musical acts. As part of her recovery, she makes it her mission to ensure that people around her feel empowered to speak uncomfortable truths and get the professional help they need. ""Black folks tend to see mental illness as a character flaw, a sign of weakness, because we are a very faith-based people. Many are of the opinion that you just take whatever it is to the Lord in prayer,"" Williams says. But that's just the first step. ""I speak at a lot of churches, and I say, 'I know it was my God that led me to the right psychiatrist.' "" This reticence to seek help, she says, leads to some deeply destructive behavior. ""Not enough of us are recognizing it or getting help. We'll do anything we can not to feel the real pain. We drink, use drugs, buy things we don't need, have promiscuous, unprotected sex, gamble, create violence -- it's everywhere. ... And people commit slow suicide: They don't take their diabetes medication, or they go into enemy territory where they know they'll get shot."" Williams combats this with a packed touring schedule, addressing groups of African-American adolescents and professionals, speaking about her own experiences in an attempt to draw out people who may have experienced some of the same feelings and who may have never acknowledged it aloud -- let alone in front of a group of 700 people. And it works, she says. In one instance, a young woman came up to the podium in tears and spoke of sexual abuse from multiple relatives. Three other young women stood up and said that they had been raped. It was the first time they ever uttered it out loud, and as Williams says, ""Each left there a different person."" In another case, Williams found herself counseling two members of the Bloods street gang who, to her great surprise, opened up with their issues of abandonment and fatherlessness, wept at her desk for over four hours and then went back and ""started running around talking to their homies about the benefits of therapy."" The initial breakthrough is an extraordinary thing, but Williams admits that aftercare resources may be harder to come by in some communities. She suggests seeking therapists with a sliding scale and seeking out one of the growing number of counseling offices attached to local churches -- and she's deputizing clergy members to take action. Williams convinced one minister to slip the phrase, ""When I was at my therapist's office ..."" into his Sunday sermon. That, she says, normalizes the language and the notion. If your preacher is saying that he cannot handle the weight of the world by himself, laypeople may be more open to the notion that they don't have to either. ""When you share your story with someone else,"" Williams says, ""you find that you're not standing on that ledge by yourself."" CNN commenter mobustobus expressed a similar sentiment: ""Emotional honesty is almost like a taboo in our society, but it's essential for healing depression. Opening up to another human being and telling them your deepest, darkest secrets is one of the scariest things you can do, but also one of the most empowering. The first time I did it, I felt alive in a way I had never before felt in my life. There's definitely an energy you get from baring it all and realizing you're still accepted."" Resources: .

"(CNN) -- As smartphones gradually take over America's mobile market, these devices are helping more people cross the ""digital divide"" by providing their first regular access to an Internet experience that's at least moderately usable. But: If you're poor, nervous about your income or job security or haven't had much prior experience with technology, then crossing that divide can look about as dicey as the ""Bridge of Death"" from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Sure, you can try to get across, but there's a good chance you'll plunge to a horrible death on the rocks below if you miss a step or give the wrong answer to a bizarre unexpected question. Being on the right side of the digital divide is and increasingly key quality of life concern. For many Americans, lack of reliable, easy access to the Internet limits their ability to connect with jobs, services, education, public safety resources, emergency assistance, health care, news, civic or political engagement, personal support networks and much more. Being on the right side of the digital divide also means having wireless broadband service that's fast and robust enough to support a decent user experience, a wide range of activities and use cases, and to withstand spikes in numbers of users and data traffic. Increasingly this means having good Internet access on the go, because in just a few years most U.S. Internet access will be mobile. Recently International Data Corp. predicted that by 2015, ""more U.S. Internet users will access the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs or other wireline devices."" Americans don't necessarily need to turn to cell phone carriers to get mobile data service, but our other choices have big tradeoffs. Wi-Fi covers only small locations, which means you lose access if you're truly on the go. WiMAX can cover large regions, but that technology seems to be losing out, Betamax-style, to wireless carriers' competing LTE 4G technology. Recognizing the opportunity (and possible economic boost) that ubiquitous wireless broadband access could provide, in February the Obama Administration announced a National Wireless Initiative. One goal of this initiative was to to ""provide at least 98% of Americans with access to 4G high-speed wireless."" However, that particular goal might be stalling. In September, HotHardware.com noted that some provisions of the National Wireless Initiative were rolled into the American Jobs Act -- the same legislation which President Obama urged Congress to pass in a news conference Thursday. But the provision that would extend 4G coverage to 98% of Americans is omitted from the current text of the Jobs Act. Left to their own devices, wireless carriers tend to roll out faster networks mostly around major metro areas, concentrating coverage in areas where they can either serve the most people or make the most money. This means that communities and neighborhoods that are less densely populated, less wealthy or more remote tend to be the last to benefit from wireless network improvements. As author William Gibson observed: ""The future is here. It's just not evenly distributed yet."" Meanwhile, Americans have been getting the hard sell to buy smartphones. Indeed, in about a year (or maybe longer, if the economic recovery continues to sputter) most of the handsets in use in the U.S. will be smartphones of some kind. Unfortunately, those Americans who have been living on the wrong side of the digital divide so far face extra obstacles when they try to catch up via mobile technology. The way smartphones and their data service get sold in the U.S. is likely to continue to leave these people even farther behind -- just when broad deployment of mobile Internet access might help strengthen the nation's economic recovery. The first -- and biggest -- problem is that most smartphones are pretty pricey. In addition to having a higher up-front cost, in the U.S. it's difficult to get a new high-performance smartphone without a two-year carrier contract that includes a steep early termination fee. The cost for those contracts typically is somewhere close to $90/month. For people who earn a working-class income or less, or who are concerned about their job security or prospects, committing to such a large monthly expense for two years represents a huge financial risk. As the recession has dragged on, no-contract phone plans have been getting more popular. As of a year ago, 32% of all U.S. mobile users had no-contract plans, and the trend has been that each year no-contract phones are getting a little more popular. Among the major U.S. carriers, only T-Mobile and Sprint have been making it fairly easy to get a smartphone on more consumer-friendly terms than a two-year contract. But if AT&T's controversial acquisition of T-Mobile eventually goes through, T-Mobile's no-contract offerings could dwindle. Meanwhile, Sprint recently announced that it's eliminating its one-year contracts. This is why many Americans of more limited means turn to discount and regional carriers -- several of whom are starting to market smartphones without a contract, typically on month-to-month or prepaid plans that cost in the range of $50 a month. However, most of these smartphones cost about $200 to $300 upfront -- again, not a reasonable expense for many consumers of modest means. It gets even harder to opt to spend an extra $100 or more for a smartphone while there are plenty of decent feature phones, which with lower-income and less-tech-savvy consumers already are comfortable, available for $0-70 upfront, with no-contract plans that cost $20 to $40 a month. For many Americans right now, saving that much money can easily override longer-term hopes for what they might want to get out of a phone. Rollouts of faster 4G mobile networks only exacerbates the cost problem. 4G-capable phones typically cost more to buy, and their plans cost more, too. Most phones in use and on the market in the U.S. today cannot operate on 4G networks. So if you want 4G access you'll probably have to shell out for a new and more expensive phone, and get a costlier new contract or plan. Yes, there are a few bargain-basement, no-contract smartphones available, but these typically come with significant tradeoffs. For instance, the discount carrier MetroPCS is selling a Huawei M835 Android smartphone for $80 with a mail-in rebate that brings the costs down to about $55, with data plans that start at $40. The catch? That phone is small, slow, running an older version of Android and CNET reviewers gave it pretty low marks. Similarly MetroPCS has received low grades for customer support. So if something goes wrong with this phone, you'd probably be left mostly on your own to figure it out. Of course, simply having a smartphone doesn't mean you can use it well or benefit much from it. For many, making the leap from a feature phone to a smartphone entails a daunting, frustrating learning curve. Even the iPhone -- perhaps the most user-friendly smartphone interface of all -- is prone to weird glitches and mysterious problems, sometimes involving hard-to-pin-down conflicts involving installed apps or carrier-specific firmware issues. While older-model iPhones can be purchased from retailers for $100 or less (with contract), Android seems destined to capture most of the low-cost smartphone market because so many manufacturers compete on that platform. The catch: the Android operating system is still harder to learn than Apple's iOS platform. Worse, when something goes wrong with an Android device, it often takes a lot of online research to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. This can be especially difficult stressful for users with limited computer-based Internet access or prior technology experience. For instance, when my Android phone recently refused to install apps, the fix for that problem for that problem involved tracking down and deleting an arcane file in a hidden directory of the Android OS. I had to connect my phone to my laptop to do this. And if I hadn't previously rooted my phone (to remove controls placed on it by my carrier), I may not have been able to fix this problem at all. What happens when that kind of problem befalls first-time, not especially tech-savvy smartphone owners, especially with cheap, low-end Android handsets? After trying and failing to fix it on their own, chances are they'd resort to wiping and resetting the phone (perhaps losing all of their data in the process), or simply getting a new phone. And at that point, they might be tempted to give up on the smartphone concept altogether. Who could blame them? But even though that might be a very rational decision in the short term (they'd get a phone that just works), the long-term cost is that they'd remain on the wrong side of the digital divide -- and they might never fully realize how much opportunity they're sacrificing. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Being on the right side of the digital divide is an increasingly quality of life concern .

"Washington (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared the Afghan leader's visit to the United States this week a success, saying on Thursday that it had helped strengthen the partnership between Washington and Kabul at a critical point in the war against Taliban and al Qaeda extremists. They also stressed that President Obama's July 2011 deadline to start withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan did not represent a weakening of America's commitment to the war-torn Islamic republic. The two leaders spoke at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington -- part of what became a week of playing down tensions between U.S. and Afghan officials. ""From our side, this was a highly successful visit [that] took our relationship to an even higher level,"" Clinton said. ""We are building a very strong partnership that links together all levels of our governments."" Clinton said there is no contradiction between the July 2011 withdrawal date and Obama administration promises of an ""enduring partnership."" Kabul residents: Karzai needs to make jobs, not war . The date is meant to be ""the beginning of the security transition,"" she said. But ""we're not going anywhere."" The U.S. government will be supporting Afghanistan's war against extremist elements ""far into the future,"" she said. Karzai said his highly anticipated U.S. trip had been ""meaningful, substantive, and had all the right tones and objectives."" The July 2011 date doesn't pose a problem, he said, because ""we know the United States will not abandon the cause."" On another topic, Clinton said the expected NATO offensive in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar this summer would not be a ""massive assault."" ""D-Day is not coming to Kandahar,"" Clinton said, adding that ""Kandahar is not Marjah,"" the area of the last major NATO offensive that rooted out the Taliban from the area to empower a government presence. Kandahar, Clinton said, is an active area where ""people are getting on with their lives."" Therefore, she said, the goal of the upcoming operation is to ""weed out"" members of the Taliban who are intimidating the people who live there. ""They don't pose a threat,"" Clinton said of the Taliban presence in the province. ""They are not going to take over Kandahar, but their presence has a chilling effect."" Karzai acknowledged there had been a misunderstanding among the Afghan people about the operation, which was clarified this week during his talks in Washington. Karzai also spoke of his plan for reintegration of thousands of Taliban, whom he called ""country boys"" who are ""ideologically not against us"" and don't hate the United States. On the other hand, he said, political reconciliation with Taliban leadership would be much more difficult and far off in the future, requiring Pakistan's involvement because many Taliban live there. Karzai also said he raised the issue of his brother, Walid, with President Obama, amid reports that Walid was heavily involved in the drug trade. Karzai said he lacked the authority to fire his brother, who is an elected official, but added without elaborating that the issue was resolved to Washington's satisfaction. Clinton declined to comment about Walid Karzai. Earlier in the day, Karzai paid tribute to U.S. military members killed in the nearly nine-year American war in his nation, visiting the grave sites of Afghan war veterans at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Karzai slowly walked past several markers -- part of what has been called the ""saddest acre in America"" -- under a cloudy sky. He was joined by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The group visited Section 60 of the cemetery, the burial ground for personnel killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. More than 500 veterans are buried there. Karzai stopped at the grave site of Army Pfc. Justin Davis, who was killed in June 2006. He also paused at the graves of Army Specialist Ross McGinnis, killed in December 2006, and Army Capt. John Tinsley, killed in August 2009. Karzai has repeatedly expressed thanks this week to the American people for the sacrifices they have made in his country. He has said Afghanistan will remain a dependable partner with the United States and its allies in the global war on terrorism. The two governments have been using the week to portray their sometimes tempestuous relationship as a largely friendly one, paving the way for greater progress in the war against the Taliban and other extremists. After meeting with Karzai on Tuesday, Clinton conceded that ""we will have disagreements time to time, but that is a sign of a mature relationship and a steady relationship."" Clinton said it is unrealistic to expect the two nations to see eye-to-eye on every issue. ""President Obama and President Karzai both understand that the ability to disagree on issues of importance is not an obstacle to achieving our shared objectives, but rather it reflects a level of trust,"" she said. Sandwiched between sessions with Clinton, Karzai huddled with Obama at the White House on Wednesday. Obama said he is confident his administration will meet the 2011 withdrawal date, but warned that there is ""going to be some hard fighting"" in the months ahead. He stressed that the United States is in Afghanistan for the long haul. ""This is a long-term partnership,"" he said. ""We are not suddenly, as of July 2011, finished with Afghanistan."" Meanwhile, Karzai defended his recent meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, noting that while Afghanistan is ""a partner and friend"" of the United States, it also wants to ""remain friendly"" with its neighbors. The Washington meeting -- Karzai's first visit to Washington after his re-election -- came after some recent well-publicized spats between Washington and Kabul. Karzai's win in last August's national vote was marred by irregularities that forced a runoff. Since then, the Obama administration has publicly pressured Karzai to rid his government of graft and improve delivery of services to the Afghan people. Karzai irritated U.S. officials when he blamed election fraud on foreigners who want a ""puppet government"" in Afghanistan. He further aggravated his most powerful ally when he told tribal leaders that the U.S.-led military alliance would not move against Taliban fighters in Kandahar ""until you say we can."" Media reports have also included harsh criticism of Karzai by a former United Nations diplomat as well as claims that Karzai said he would consider joining the Taliban insurgency. At one point, the White House indicated it would call off this week's visit. But in recent weeks, the two governments have sought to play down their differences, rejecting the idea of any dispute between their leaders. Obama said Wednesday that reports of heightened tensions between the U.S. and Afghan governments ""were simply overstated."" Tensions are virtually inevitable in ""such a complicated and difficult environment,"" he said. But ""our job is to be a good friend and to be frank with President Karzai."" Karzai's role, in turn, is partly to ensure Afghan sovereignty is respected, he said. ""I am very comfortable with the strong effort that President Karzai has made so far,"" Obama said. ""There are going to be setbacks"" and disagreements, but ""we share a broad strategy"" that can hopefully be set out ""in a declaration by the end of this year."" Karzai, in turn, said the U.S.-Afghanistan relationship is ""strong and well-rooted."" There are moments that ""we speak frankly to each other,"" but those exchanges only strengthen the relationship, he said. Obama and Karzai said they discussed, among other things, the need for greater protection of Afghan civilians in light of the stronger U.S. military campaign. Karzai said a recent decision to transfer local detention centers to Afghan government control was a ""major point of progress."" CNN's Paul Courson and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton says expected Kandahar offensive is not ""D-Day""

"Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea (CNN) -- The Obama administration on Wednesday slammed North Korea's pugnacious rants toward South Korea and the West and a U.S. intelligence official called the strident remarks worrisome. ""The ratcheting up of rhetoric is of concern to us,"" the official said. The question is whether this is ""just rhetoric,"" he said. Or, ""are things happening behind the scenes indicating the blustering has something to it."" Another U.S. official said there is a lot of uncertainty about North Korea's intentions. ""North Korea is not a paper tiger so it wouldn't be smart to dismiss its provocative behavior as pure bluster,"" that official said. U.S. says it sent B-2 stealth bombers over South Korea . ""What's not clear right now is how much risk (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is willing to run, to show the world and domestic elites that he's a tough guy. His inexperience is certain -- his wisdom is still very much in question."" North Korea earlier said it was cutting off a key military hotline with South Korea amid high tensions between the two sides. ""Under the situation where a war may break out any moment, there is no need to keep north-south military communications,"" the head of a North Korean delegation told the South by telephone Wednesday, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. There are several hotlines between North and South Korea. Earlier this month, Pyongyang disconnected a Red Cross hotline that ran through the border village of Panmunjom and was used by officials on both sides, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. And senior U.S. officials do not believe the cutting off of some communication by North Korea in itself is indicative of more dramatic action or is conclusive. The officials note that North Korea has cut these links before, some of them multiple times. ""It's part of the current threat-of-the-day pattern. I wouldn't extrapolate it to anything more conclusive,"" one official said. ""They want attention and they want to scare people both inside and outside their country."" Officials see steps such as cutting off communication are more substitutes for doing other more dangerous things rather than precursors to more dangerous things. ""That is certainly our fervent hope,"" the official said. Analysis: what's Kim Jong Un up to? At the same time, there is concern about a North Korean miscalculation during this time. The officials said the lack of communication could complicate and hamper the ability of all nations involved (including North Korea, South Korea and the United States) to control and moderate any action -- and cycle of reaction should one begin as the result of a North Korean miscalculation. The North linked its move to annual joint military exercises by South Korea and the United States, which it has cited in a string of threats against the two countries in recent weeks. Tougher sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council also may have fueled its anger. ""It is important the U.S. send a message. In terms of the military side, the U.S. has clearly sent a message,"" the intelligence official said. ""When people engage in this sort of rhetoric, you can't appear as if you are not responding,"" the official said. The intelligence community has been providing the Obama administration with assessments of Kim Jung Un's control of the regime, but the official would not provide any details of that assessment. Administration officials also regretted the tough talk from Pyongyang. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell cited ""more bellicose rhetoric and threats (that) follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others."" Josh Earnest, White House principal deputy press secretary, said the United States is committed to ensuring the security of its allies, such as South Korea. ""The North Koreans are not going to achieve anything through these threats and provocations. They're only going to further isolate the North Koreans and undermine international efforts to bring peace and stability to northeast Asia,"" Earnest said. Pentagon spokesman George Little spoke on the government's nuclear threats to the United States and ""its more achievable threats to attack South Korean military units and shell border islands."" ""We take their rhetoric seriously, whether it's outside the norm which it sometimes is, or seems to suggest a more direct threat. And if you look at what they've said recently, it's been extremely provocative, threatening and bellicose. And it's a complete mystery to me why they would deem it in their own interest to launch this type of rhetoric at us and our allies,"" Little said. Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict . The North's announcement Wednesday appeared likely to affect the movement of people in and out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border. ""The measure taken by North Korea is not beneficial for the stable operation of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and we urge them to withdraw the measure,"" the Unification Ministry said. On Thursday morning, the day after the North said it was severing the line, South Korean workers were able to cross the border and enter the industrial zone, the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported, citing the Immigration and Quarantine office in Paju, near the border. An initial group of 197 workers went over the border at 8:30 a.m. local time (7:30 p.m. Wednesday ET) after North Korea gave the regular approval for their movement by phone through the industrial district's management committee, Yonhap said. A total of 530 South Koreans were due to enter the Kaesong complex on Thursday, and 511 are scheduled to come back into South Korea, according to Yonhap. North Korea's threats: Five things to know . A symbol of North-South cooperation, the Kaesong complex is also seen as an important source of hard currency for the regime in Pyongyang. The North previously cut off the Kaesong military hotline in March 2009 -- also during annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises -- but later reinstated it, according to Yonhap. The slew of recent fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is no longer valid. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . On Tuesday, the North said it planned to place military units tasked with targeting U.S. bases under combat-ready status. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula came after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive regime. Island faces North Korean threat up close . CNN's K.J.

"Pasadena, California (CNN) -- The Mars rover Curiosity successfully raised the mast that holds many of its instruments Wednesday, giving controllers a view of the ground scorched by the rockets that deposited it on the surface. The car-sized rover landed on Mars early Monday after a harrowing descent that climaxed with its being lowered by a ""skycrane"" that hovered over the landing site. Cameras mounted on Curiosity's remote sensing mast beamed back fresh images of the site once the column was raised into position, giving NASA a view of the roughly half-meter (19-inch) ""scour marks"" from the rocket exhaust. Those gouges are giving mission controllers an unexpectedly early view of the bedrock beneath the surface of Gale Crater, said John Grotzinger, a Curiosity project scientist at the California Institute of Technology. Mars rover beams back 'awesome' shot of surface . ""Apparently, there is a harder, rockier material beneath this veneer of gravel and pebbles, and obviously there's some impact ejecta,"" Grotzinger told reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where controllers operate the rover. While Curiosity isn't yet ready to start driving around, ""Here we've already got an exploration hole drilled for us,"" Grotzinger said. The mission of the mobile science laboratory is to determine whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting life. Its prime target is the 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) peak at the center of Gale Crater, Mount Sharp, where scientists hope to get a layer-by-layer look at the history of the planet. Grotzinger said so far, the landscape looks somewhat familiar. ""The thing that really struck the science team about this image is that you would really be forgiven for thinking that NASA was trying to pull a fast one on you and we actually put a rover out in the Mojave Desert and took a picture -- a little L.A. smog coming in there,"" he said. Mars rover: Is all this really necessary? Controllers are still activating Curiosity's instrument package, and all antennas that will beam back data to JPL ""work perfectly,"" mission manager Jennifer Trosper said Wednesday. The onboard weather monitoring unit has turned out to be ""completely healthy"" following a brief glitch reported Tuesday. The high-bandwidth antenna that aims back at Earth is beaming back ""lots and lots of data"" and the rover is expected to capture a color panorama of its surroundings on Thursday, she said. ""There are going to be some amazing images from that,"" Trosper said. Vandi Tompkins, one of Curiosity's operators, said images like those beamed back so far will be used to program the rover's movements when it gets under way. Because of the time needed for a radio signal from Earth to reach the rover -- about 14 minutes at Mars' current position -- ""We don't command the rover with a joystick or a steering wheel in real time,"" Tompkins said. ""If we were to do that, by the time we would see we were at the edge of a cliff, the rover would have driven off of it."" Opinion: Did Mars landing make science cool again? Instead, operators use the photos to develop a plan for the next day's operations and transmit it to the rover, which carries it out and sends back the results. Curiosity will start its third full martian day, or sol, on Thursday. A sol is about 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth. The rover is supposed to run for two years, but a previous rover, Opportunity, has been working on Mars since 2004 -- well beyond the three months NASA planned. Opportunity's sister rover, Spirit, ran from 2004 to 2010. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: Mars landscape resembles Mojave Desert, scientist observes .

"(CNN) -- The water had barely dried on the rain-soaked stages of Lollapalooza in Chicago Saturday night when festival founder Perry Farrell announced the franchise would be expanding to the Middle East next year. Lollapalooza Israel will take place August 20-22, 2013, in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park, making it the first large-scale global music event in the country. Israel marks the third international location for Lollapalooza, which expanded to Chile in 2011 and Brazil earlier this year. ""It's like an oak seed,"" Farrell explained to CNN. ""You look at it and go, 'What's the potential of that thing?' Put it in the ground and it starts to sprout it, and it keeps growing, and more and more branches grow out of it."" The three-day festival in Israel's second most populous city is scheduled for mid-week -- on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday -- steering clear of Friday, the Jewish Sabbath, when Orthodox observers abstain from driving, using modern technology and listening to music. ""I don't think it would be great to do it on a Friday night. No one would go,"" said Farrell. The 53-year-old musician played Tel Aviv with his band, Jane's Addiction, last September, and if he has his way, Lollapalooza will also put its imprint on another city in Israel. ""We got a call from Jerusalem, the Holy City, and they want Lollapalooza to be there, too,"" he confided. ""But it's going to start in Tel Aviv, and we're going to do something in Jerusalem. The mayor's like, 'We want to bring young people, we want to change the perception of Jerusalem.' So we're even talking with them about it."" As for the next location on Lolla's wish list, Farrell refused to tip his hand. ""I can't tell you, but make no mistake. I want to have a beautiful portfolio of Lollapaloozas to give to my children,"" he said with a smile. Stormy weather conditions Saturday brought a brief postponement and evacuation of Grant Park during Saturday's Lollapalooza in Chicago. The festival resumed in the evening.","Lollapalooza coming to Israel in 2013 .

"(EW.com) -- Carrie Underwood blew away the competition on the Billboard 200 this week, scoring her third straight number one album with her fourth release, ""Blown Away,"" and moving 267,000 copies. Other Top 10 newcomers included Norah Jones, with her Danger Mouse-produced ""Little Broken Hearts,"" B.O.B., Marilyn Manson, and the first-ever soundtrack from NBC's ""Smash."" Check out the full Top 10 below: . 1. Carrie Underwood, ""Blown Away"" -- 267,000 . This is Underwood's third straight number one after 2009′s ""Play On,"" which debuted with 318,000, and 2007′s ""Carnival Ride,"" which started with 527,000. Underwood's 2005 debut ""Some Hearts"" is her only album to not reach the summit of the chart — it debuted at No. 2 with 315,000 (behind Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"") and eventually sold 7.2 million copies. Her current single ""Good Girl"" has climbed up to No. 8 on the country songs chart, and follow-up ""Blown Away,"" which she performed on the Idol stage last week, kicks off its run at No. 22 on the Hot Digital Songs chart. 2. Norah Jones, ""Little Broken Hearts"" -- 110,000 . Norah Jones could have stayed the course and made lovely, jazz-tinged, perhaps slightly snoozy records and gone platinum for the rest of her career (her Grammy-winning debut ""Come Away With Me"" sold over 10 million copies, and her three subsequent records have all reached platinum status), but the chanteuse took a risk with her darker, Danger Mouse-produced fifth album. As such, ""Little Broken Hearts"" opened to Jones' lowest sales ever — but somehow, we doubt she's too worried about it. 3. Various Artists, ""Now 42"" -- 95,000 . The last five editions of the popular compilation albums have debuted in third place. It's the hits, kids: Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),"" Flo Rida's ""Good Feeling,"" Karmin's ""Brokenhearted"" and more. 4. Adele, ""21"" -- 77,000 . At this point, what's left say? Last week, it had sold roughly 8.9 million copies; now, it's rounding out on 9 million. Adele's world domination continues. 5. B.o.B., ""Strange Clouds"" -- 76,000 . The Atlanta rapper's sophomore album sold slightly fewer copies than his 2010 debut ""B.o.B Presents: The Adventures Of Bobby Ray,"" which started at number one with sales of 84,000 and ended up selling about 597,000 copies total. Still, after a handful of singles that didn't exactly burn up the chart (""Strange Clouds"" and ""Play the Guitar"" both failed to make much of an impact on radio), B.o.B. should be happy with these results. It seems his late-in-the-game pop-oriented material, like Ryan Tedder tune ""So Good"" and Taylor Swift collaboration ""Both of Us"" (which debuts at number 8 on this week's Hot Digital Songs chart), helped lift the album's fortunes in the weeks leading to its release. 6. Lionel Richie, ""Tuskegee"" -- 64,000 . The soft-rock star's country comeback record has sold 679,000 copies in six weeks. Say you, say him, say platinum: It was also just certified for shipments of 1 million copies to stores. 7. Jack White, ""Blunderbuss"" -- 56,000 . The onetime White Stripes frontman, who earned his first chart-topping week ever last week, dropped by 59 percent after last week's debut, still giving him 194,000 total in two weeks. 8. One Direction, ""Up All Night"" -- 45,000 . After eight weeks, the UK boy band has sold a whopping 586,000 units of their debut effort. That's what makes them beautiful (at least to Simon Cowell). 9. Soundtrack, ""The Music Of SMASH"" -- 40,000 . The first collection of songs sfrom NBC's inside-Broadway musical drama ""Smash"" started slower than the first ""Glee"" soundtrack, which debuted at number 4 in November 2009, but that's to be expected given ""Smash's"" smaller audience and general proportion of pop covers to originals. 10. Marilyn Manson, ""Born Villain"" -- 38,000 . He may have been born to his lowest numbers yet — but it's still the Prince of Darkness' seventh top 10 album.

"(CNN) -- ""Black Dynamite"" has a new lease on life. This time around, the hero of the 2009 film that lampooned blaxploitation movies is in animated form in a new series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim program block. Some of the actors from the film will reprise their roles, but there will be changes as well. The movie, which enjoyed only a two-week theatrical release despite premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, was deliberately cheesy. To parody the cheap, hastily produced blaxploitation films, ""Black Dynamite"" actors intentionally chewed up scenery or performed awkwardly. There were telltale signs of a second-rate production, such as the appearance of a boom mike. The new ""Black Dynamite"" is still set in the 1970s, but the 10-episode cartoon series is more like ""Shaft"" than a sendup of blaxpoitation, said Michael Jai White, who supplies Black Dynamite's voice and serves as a producer. As in the film, the polyester pants suit-garbed Black Dynamite is a former CIA agent, a lover and a kung fu fighter. He has returned to the 'hood to combat evil and protect the children in the Whorephanage, who are looked after by the working girls and their boss, sexy no-nonsense Honey Bee (Kym Whitley). ""The characters have to be a little bigger than life, but it's a fun challenge, and the essence of the characters is still there,"" said Carl Jones, former executive producer of ""The Boondocks"" on Adult Swim, who serves as the director and an executive producer for ""Black Dynamite."" ""Obviously, with a cartoon, you can do more things than you can do in live action,"" Jones said. ""It opens a lot more doors for us to explore different characters and genres."" In one episode, Black Dynamite is hired to make sure comedian Richard Pryor shows up for a scheduled performance. In the story, Pryor is distraught because audiences automatically laugh at him, making it hard to offer serious social commentary. ""I wanted to take another perspective on Richard as a human being,"" Jones said. ""Richard never wanted to be funny. He had something to say. He was a storyteller. He was a teacher to me."" In another episode, a parody of ""King Kong,"" Black Dynamite goes after an albino ape that scaled the iconic Watts Towers in Los Angeles. White said he isn't concerned that, despite its late-night time period, the show could irritate those who think its frequent use of bleeped profanity and the prominence of prostitutes perpetuate unwelcome stereotypes of African-Americans. ""I don't mind that at all,"" White said. ""This is a commentary on the time period. It is the truth that, at this time in the '70s, these were our heroes."" Added Jones, ""The main thing I focused on is being honest. This is a time when pimps, hos and hustlers existed, and they thrived within their communities. And Black Dynamite is trying to stop the negative things connected with that."" Yes, Jones said, there is a whorehouse in the show, ""but you never see them whoring. I made it a point not to show that. You'll never see Black Dynamite pimping either, because that's not what it's about. This was just a way to give a different world a texture that actually existed in that era."" Despite its short theatrical run, ""Black Dynamite"" the film drew a loyal following, and sales of the movie on DVD in 2010 were brisk. ""I think it's going to be off the chain with crazy fans,"" predicted Whitley. ""I did not know 'Black Dynamite' was so popular. You go on the Internet. You go down to Comic-Con, and they fill the room. These are devoted fans."" Byron Minns, the voice of Bullhorn, Black Dynamite's cunning sidekick, agreed. ""When I go to South Central (in Los Angeles) or New York, people say, 'Man, we wish we would have known this was in the theaters at the time.' It just didn't work out that way."" Jones thinks young viewers will tune in for a fresh viewpoint, and older viewers will watch with a sense of nostalgia. ""To me, it plays on so many different levels and on so many different platforms,"" he said. ""There are so many different ingredients that make it powerful for just about everybody.""

"(CNN) -- Comic book fans aren't the only ones expected to assemble in theaters Friday. Judging by its early international box office take, ""The Avengers"" -- the superhero equivalent of a musical supergroup -- should blow away the competition, kicking off the summer movie season as a hit with a wide spectrum of moviegoers. Early tracking estimates see it as possibly beating ""The Dark Knight's"" then-record opening weekend from 2008, which ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" overtook last summer. Not to be outdone, the final chapter in the Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" also has high expectations of its own to meet on July 20. (""Rises"" is from Warner Bros. Pictures, and the Batman character is part of DC Comics. They are both owned by Time Warner, also CNN's parent company.) Compared with these two superheroes, ""Spider-Man 3"" is practically ancient history. It too set a box-office record in 2007 for biggest opening weekend. Sony Pictures hopes to recapture some of that magic with the release of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboot on July 3, a holiday weekend. The upcoming trio of films is a far cry from recent years when movies such as ""Iron Man"" and ""Green Lantern"" took a chance by introducing lesser-known superheroes on the big screen with very different results. This summer the question is not, ""Will superhero movies be big,"" but ""How big will they be?"" You can hardly ask for safer bets than Spidey, Batman and a powerhouse superhero team. So will this be the moment that superhero movies reach their peak of popularity? ""This summer will blow 2008 (the year of 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight') out of the water,"" predicted Bill Ramey of Batman-on-film.com. ""It might have it beat, (even) if only 'Rises' was being released."" Author and professor Van Plexico, speaking from the viewpoint of the fan of ""The Avengers"" (he runs AvengersAssemble.net), agrees. ""There's no doubt that with so many epic franchises all rolling out this year, guys in capes -- and webs -- will be hauling in a lot of loot at the box office. It's just inevitable. No wonder Superman wisely held off till next year."" At the same time, each of these movies faces the challenge of potentially not living up to expectations. ""At this point, my only fear is that the hype (around 'The Avengers') will prove to be too much, and people's expectations will rise too far for the movie to possibly meet them, no matter how good it is,"" Plexico said. Gitesh Pandya of Boxofficeguru.com said: ""' The Avengers' has that challenge of going beyond the superhero crowd and to a more mainstream action crowd, but it seems to me that they have successfully done that. Excitement seems to be there among all groups and around the world. I see 'The Avengers' breaking the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office."" As for ""Rises,"" Ramey voiced one simple fact of life when it comes to movie franchises: ""How many third films in a series have been good?"" (Even so, he said he thinks the new Batman movie has the potential to be better than the last one, which is often credited for the expansion of the Academy Awards' best picture category to 10 films.) "" 'The Dark Knight Rises' will have to enter the marketplace without the Heath Ledger factor,"" Pandaya said, referring to the star's death before the release of ""The Dark Knight."" ""However, the last film was so well-loved that the new film will benefit from those coattails."" If anything, the ""Spider-Man"" reboot, with its new cast and creative team, including Andrew Garfield in the title role, seems to have the most challenges of them all. ""It's only been five years since the previous trilogy ended, but if they make a solid film, then people will come and the movie could last,"" Pandya said. Plexico added, "" 'The Amazing Spider-Man' must hit a home run, to justify the series reboot so very soon after the previous trio of Spidey films."" Not that Sony is sweating it too much: It has already hired hotshot screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to pen a new Spidey sequel. One doesn't have to be a genius to guess that not only will there be many more superhero films in the future, but also this summer won't be the last moviegoers see of the Avengers and Batman on the big screen (not to mention the individual Avengers -- ""Thor 2,"" ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Captain America 2"" -- which are already in the works.) ""The genre has been popular for decades and is here to stay,"" Pandya said. ""The main factor will be for studios to release the right number of comic films each year and to not overdo it as any genre can be hurt by an overabundance of product. I think the marketplace can handle three to four superhero films per year."" Share your ""Avengers"" review . But can Hollywood live on a few main superhero characters alone? The chances of a ""Green Lantern"" sequel look slimmer with each passing day, ""Wonder Woman"" plans fell through several years ago, and it's anyone's guess as to how next year's Superman reboot, ""Man of Steel,"" will be received. What about that DC Comics' ""Justice League of America"" film (which, if not for a 2008 writers' strike, might well have beaten Marvel's ""The Avengers"" to the screen by a good many years)? One person who had something to say about that possibility was ""The Avengers"" writer/director Joss Whedon (who once tried his hand at ""Wonder Woman""), at a recent press conference. ""DC has a harder time of it than Marvel because their characters are (from) an old, a bygone era, where characters were bigger than we were,"" he said. ""And ... they've amended that, but Marvel really cracked the code in terms of 'they're just like us.' So a dose of that sort of veracity that Marvel really started with 'Iron Man,' I think you should use that as your base."" Whedon pointed to 2002's ""Spider-Man"" as a model of a successful superhero film by staying true to the comic while also being entertaining as a movie. Plexico had a few ideas for the next big superhero on the screen, even if ""Justice League of America"" doesn't pan out. ""I think the Flash (from DC) has the potential to be a big hit, given his rogues' gallery and great years of history to work with,"" he said. ""For Marvel, Moon Knight could be their 'Dark Knight,' at least to a degree. And it would be great to see their 'cosmic' characters break loose on film -- Captain Marvel, Nova, Ms. Marvel and so on."" No matter what Hollywood comes up with next -- there are still rumors of an ""Ant Man"" film out there and a reboot of ""Fantastic Four"" -- fans know that after this summer the movie studios will keep trying to assemble the right elements for a superhero blockbuster.","Hollywood bringing back box-office juggernauts Iron Man, Batman and Spider-Man .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government Friday demanded the withdrawal of an Iranian ""armed group"" that it says seized an oil well in southern Iraq on Thursday night. Iran is denying any takeover took place. The Iraqi government issued a strong statement deploring the act after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki headed an emergency meeting of Iraq's National Security Council to discuss the situation. ""The council stressed that such incidents would be considered a violation of the border and violated Iraq's sovereignty and its territories and calls upon Iran to pull out the group from well No. 4 and take down the Iranian flag from the tower of the well immediately,"" Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in the statement. Senior Iraqi government sources initially referred to the Iranians as ""security forces,"" but the official Iraqi government statement later called them an ""armed group."" Drilled in 1979, the well is in Iraq's Maysan province, east of Amara, near the Iranian border. It is within the province's Fakka oil field, the Iraqi government said. Al-Dabbagh said in the statement that the Iraqi government had summoned the Iranian ambassador in Baghdad, Hassan Kazemi Qomi, to inform him officially about the incident and asked him to provide a note to Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry ""to address such a violation."" The statement said the Iraqi government called upon Iran ""to resolve all border problems through diplomatic dialogue and avoid the use of military force in order to preserve our common security and bilateral relations between the two countries."" An official at the Iranian Embassy in Baghdad had said earlier that Iraqi authorities had not yet contacted them. Iraq and Iran share a long border, and high-ranking committees from both countries handle all border matters, an Iranian Embassy official said. Iraq and Iran fought a bloody eight-year war that ended in 1988 in a cease-fire with no clear victor and parts of the border under dispute. But political, economic, cultural and religious ties between Iran, a predominantly Shiite Muslim nation, and Iraq, a majority Shiite Muslim nation, greatly improved after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. At the same time, there has been widespread concern among Iraqi and U.S. officials that Iran has been providing Iraqi insurgents with material for roadside bombs during the Iraq war. The report of the oil well incident comes several days after the Oil Ministry's two-day auction of oil fields. Aimed at increasing Iraqi oil production, deals were struck for seven of the 15 fields offered. There also had been oil bidding in June. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Yousif Bassil contributed to this report.","NEW: Iraqi official says Iranian ambassador to Iraq has been summoned over matter .

"(CNN) -- As members of Congress navigate the shifting political sands of the debt-ceiling crisis, many of them are turning to a digital platform more associated with sharing personal updates and funny videos about cats: Facebook. In recent days, lawmakers have swarmed the popular social network to post videos outlining their positions, conduct opinion polls, reach new constituents and ask for feedback. ""Over the past week, our team has seen a marked increase in the number of members of Congress speaking directly to constituents through their official Facebook pages,"" said Andrew Noyes, manager of public policy communications for Facebook. The number of posts including video or radio snippets also has increased over the past week as lawmakers seek to engage their followers in new ways, Noyes added. As more members speak in front of C-SPAN's cameras, he said, ""we fully expect to see the pace of these postings pick up."" All of House Speaker John Boehner's Facebook posts in the past two weeks have articulated his positions on the debt crisis. It's not clear whether they're nudging the needle of public opinion, but they are sparking dialogue: A message by Boehner on Monday drew more than 15,000 comments. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats have used Facebook to rally opposition to Boehner's debt-ceiling bill. Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, posted a C-SPAN clip of his comments from the House floor, while Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado, asked Facebook users to sign his online petition urging Congress to adopt a ""sensible"" bipartisan solution. Observers say politicians have embraced social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter because they allow them to communicate directly with constituents without having their messages altered. ""You can convey emotion in a Facebook update or a YouTube video. It offers an authenticity,"" said Brad Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation, a nonpartisan group dedicated to improving citizen engagement with Congress. ""They [lawmakers] aren't letting the dialogue be created by someone else. They're creating the dialogue,"" Fitch said. ""And they are very excited about avoiding the pesky media."" Some members of Congress are addicted to the instantaneous feedback they receive on Facebook and Twitter, Fitch said. ""Politicians long for public reaction, and they long to be loved,"" he said. Members of Congress also use Facebook and Twitter to quickly rebut published reports or opponents' claims they disagree with. One challenge of communicating through unfiltered social media -- especially on hot-button political issues -- is that comments can degenerate into name-calling or worse. On Friday Rep. Bobby Schilling, R-Illinois, had to remind his Facebook fans that profane, threatening or inappropriate comments would be deleted. So does all this social-media messaging by Congress really influence public opinion? Probably not, says Nick Judd, assistant editor of the Personal Democracy Forum, a website about the intersection of politics and technology. ""It seems that while the population of Americans on social media is large and growing, folks who talk politics on social media are already polarized. You could think of it a little bit like being at a large party where the political junkies are huddled up in a back corner, talking amongst themselves,"" he said. ""How much gets from that group to their apolitical friends, I don't know -- but one prevailing theory now is that Facebook in particular makes it hard to breach that barrier."" Judd cited a recent book, Eli Pariser's ""The Filter Bubble,"" which argues that Facebook tends to surround users with like-minded friends and shield them from opposing views. That's not stopping politicians from turning to the social network to get their message out. A recent survey of congressional staffers by the Congressional Management Foundation found that nearly 75% think Facebook is ""somewhat or very important"" for communicating their members' views, followed closely by YouTube and less so by Twitter. ""Facebook has become a critical channel for government communication,"" Noyes said. ""Politicians are only getting more creative with social media as the the debate over the debt ceiling and other crucial public-policy issues continue.""","In recent days, lawmakers have swarmed Facebook to outline their positions on the debt crisis .

"(CNN) -- The woman wore a nurse's uniform when she walked into the maternity ward. She left the hospital driving away in a red car with a sign that said ""Baby on Board."" Police say there was a baby inside the Toyota Yaris the 21-year-old was driving Monday evening as she left the hospital in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. But the little girl wasn't hers. At the hospital, baby Victoria's parents were frantic. Their child was only 16 hours old when she was abducted, mother Mélissa McMahon said in a Facebook post describing the ordeal. ""The worst case scenarios played out over and over in our heads,"" she wrote. ""Unfortunately, the endings are not often happy, above all in this type of case."" But just a few hours after the baby went missing, authorities returned her to her parents. Thanks to ""four marvelous people,"" McMahon wrote, and ""thanks to Facebook."" ""It is the only reason that explains why Victoria is in my arms at this time,"" she said. Amber Alert goes viral . Publicity about Victoria's disappearance started with an Amber Alert sent out by Quebec police. In social media posts, messages from police described the vehicle and the woman driving it. The newborn, police said, was wrapped in a blue blanket. It wasn't long before the alert and a photo went viral. A group of four friends spotted it on Facebook when they were hanging out on Monday night, Canadian media reported. ""We just wanted to do something for the night, so we went out to find the car,"" Charlène Plante told Canada's CTV network . When police released a photo of a woman wearing scrubs in the hospital, Plante said she immediately recognized her former neighbor. The friends drove to the woman's apartment and saw the car parked outside. ""The patio door was open. The lights were on,"" Mélizanne Bergeron told Canadian public broadcaster CBC. ""It was clear that she was there."" Then, they called police. Officers were there within minutes, Plante said, kicking down the apartment door. The baby was recovered and a woman was taken into custody. ""After the baby was in the hands of the police, it was the best moment in my life,"" Bergeron told CTV. ""We were crying."" On Facebook, she posted a video showing her tearful friends as a police officer appeared in the apartment building's stairwell, the baby safe in his arms. Woman in custody . Quebec police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe wouldn't confirm details about how the baby was found, but she said police received tips from the public after publicizing the case on social media. The woman was hospitalized for evaluation and was on 24-hour police watch, but she had not met yet with investigators Tuesday, Coulombe said. It is not known whether there was any previous link between the woman and the baby's family, she said. In a statement, the hospital from where the baby was taken thanked police investigators and said a team of risk-assessment experts would be analyzing the circumstances surrounding the incident and making recommendations about whether any changes are needed. Details from the police investigation will also be part of that analysis, the hospital said. ""At this time, it is difficult to discuss in more detail the situation without revealing specific elements that could harm the investigation and court proceedings,"" the Center for Health and Social Services of Trois-Rivières said in a statement. ""The establishment will therefore be reserved in public statements in the coming days."" Daniel Cossette, the baby's uncle, told CTV that he spoke with the woman in the nurse's uniform as she walked down the hospital hallway with the newborn in her arms. She told him she was taking the baby for routine tests. ""She had the attitude, the uniform, all of it,"" he said, ""and we never presumed she was a kidnapper."" 'Every click, every share made the difference' As authorities continue investigating, the baby's mother says she has no doubt about how Victoria ended up in her arms again. Alert hospital staff realized quickly that the baby had been taken, she said. Fellow patients at the hospital provided details about the woman and her vehicle. Security guards tracked down a photo of the woman with help from police. And investigators sent out the Amber Alert and image very quickly. ""The photo saved our daughter! In less than an hour, the photo was everywhere...You were more than thousands of people who shared the photo of this woman on social media. ... Know that it was this that saved her, our little Victoria. Every click, every share made the difference,"" McMahon wrote in a message thanking people for their support. But along with her thank-you message, she also sent a word of caution to other mothers, saying that her experience with the woman dressed as a nurse should be a warning. ""Never allow yourself to be influenced by a uniform....I know that it can seem trivial, but if I had been more skeptical, all of this could have been avoided....Verify the badge of the nurse...ask questions...it is your child, don't let them out of your sight,"" she wrote. ""I would not like anyone else to live this."" She did not describe further details about any interaction with the woman. As for her baby, McMahon said ""little Victoria wears her name well for this victory."" ""To give life to our child is an incredible moment,"" she wrote, ""but finding our child safe and sound is an indescribable feeling.""

"(CNN) -- Detroit's recent bankruptcy draws attention to a festering problem in America -- many of our cities are in trouble. According to Moody's, more than half of the 50 largest U.S. cities have expenses and liabilities that overwhelm their tax revenues -- the same fiscal stress that bankrupted Detroit. The average poverty rate in the poorest half of our 50 largest cities is now nearly 26%, up from just over 21% in 2000. Smaller cities are also struggling. Connecticut, where we are from, has five cities with a population between 100,000 and 150,000. Three of those five have poverty rates above 25%, despite the state's overall wealth. Hartford, once the wealthiest city in the country in 1870, is now one of the poorest, with a poverty rate of 38%. Cities develop as centers of trade, industry, government or learning that create opportunity and prosperity as their population and economy expand. But if the economic forces driving that expansion go away, a city's tax base can disappear while the costs of its infrastructure and a concentrated population remain. These cities end up with a lot of bills and no one to pay them. Their residents, who experience the American Dream when the city is growing, experience the American Nightmare when things turn down -- no job opportunity, underperforming schools, deteriorating housing stock, high crime rates and overextended social services. The market forces that make and break cities are powerful and probably cannot -- and should not -- be controlled. Forcing the car industry to remain in Detroit would not have been the answer to Detroit's problems. But market forces can be coaxed, and smart policy and good leadership make a difference. Pittsburgh, a city that arose around steel as Detroit did around cars, has been repurposed. With steel largely gone, Pittsburgh remains a smaller but thriving and financially healthy city with 125,000 net new jobs since 1990 and an unemployment rate below the national rate. Pittsburgh's recovery was helped by good policy that included eliminating regulatory impediments to redevelopment of old industrial sites, replacing abandoned factories on the city's riverfront with a 13-mile continuous loop of parks and supporting some of the country's earliest small-business incubators. San Diego, a city developed around the defense industry, lost tens of thousands of jobs when the Cold War ended. As jobs left, crime rates rose to record highs, and the city faced a Detroit-like downward spiral. But good crime-fighting policies, including community policing and the early adoption of new forensic technologies, resulted in violent crime dropping from over nine crimes per thousand residents in 1993 to under four by 2011. The Connecticut Policy Institute recently published its Urban Policy Project, a compendium of policy recommendations for preserving jobs, improving schools and housing, and reducing crime in struggling cities based on successful strategies from around the country. In addition to the strategies that worked in Pittsburgh and San Diego, these recommendations include education reform initiatives such as public school choice and ""money follows the child"" approach to school funding, where dollars for charter and magnet schools go directly to those schools, rather than shared with the student's school district overall. They also include crime reduction initiatives such as reducing recidivism with swift, certain and short punishment for probation violators and housing initiatives such as reforming the low-income tax credit so that it doesn't force low-income families to remain in distressed neighborhoods. The ""money follows the child"" concept of school funding helped San Francisco nearly double the number of students scoring ""proficient"" or ""advanced"" on the California Standards Test from 2002 to 2008. Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement program, which immediately jails any probation or parole violator for up to four days, led to a 55% decline in recidivism and a 72% decline in parolee/probationer drug use from 2004 to 2010. Without smart policy and strong leadership to counter the weakening of a city's economic foundation, its residents endure very real human suffering and displacement. Fairness and opportunity for everyone are essential premises and promises of America. Both can disappear in a decaying city. There was a heavy focus on urban problems in the 1960s and 1970s. Booming economies -- beginning in the 1980s and continuing through 2007 -- reduced and masked those problems, but most were not fixed. Political dialogue now emphasizes the needs of the ""middle class"" and ""working families"" rather than the urban poor. It is time to re-engage in an effort to help our most challenged citizens and ensure that fairness and opportunity extend to everyone. The impact of our declining cities is the most compelling equity issue today. Let's add fixing struggling cities to the national agenda.

"(CNN) -- Austrian director Michael Haneke took home the prestigious Palme d'Or prize -- his second -- at the Cannes Film Festival for his film ""Amour."" The film, according to the festival's website, is about a retired couple in their 80s and how their bond is severely tested after the woman, Anne, ""has an attack."" It features actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. Haneke also won the Palme d'Or at the festival in 2009 for ""The White Ribbon."" That film depicted the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before World War I. ""The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win,"" said Haneke at a press conference following his 2009 award. ""I am not proud, but I am very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud."" Another contender for the top prize was ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" a film by Wes Anderson that tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness in 1965 after a year apart. The film stars Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton along with Anderson favorite Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. But it's the two young lovers, portrayed by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, who steal the show. ""My point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me,"" Anderson told CNN earlier this week.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AMC's ""Mad Men"" won a fourth consecutive best drama series Emmy, while the ABC sitcom ""Modern Family"" took top comedy honors at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles Sunday night. PBS' ""Downton Abbey,"" a Masterpiece production, won the best miniseries Emmy, although HBO's ""Mildred Pierce"" and ReelzChannel's ""The Kennedys"" had a share in the acting honors. Charlie Sheen delivered onstage drama when he took the stage to present the trophy for best lead actor in a comedy series, which he called ""my old category."" Sheen, bounced from his hit sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" earlier this year after a spat with producers, said he wanted ""to take a moment to get something off my chest and say a few words to everyone here from 'Two and a Half Men.' "" ""From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season,"" Sheen said. ""We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you will continue to make great television."" ""The Big Bang Theory's"" Jim Parsons won the category. When Sheen's sitcom replacement, Ashton Kutcher, appeared with ""Two and a Half Men"" co-star Jon Cryer to present an award, their banter was all about Sheen. ""I'm that guy from 'Pretty in Pink,'"" Cryer said. ""And I'm not Charlie Sheen,"" said Kutcher. ""And Jon, I want to tell you something. I do not think that you are a troll."" It was a reference to Sheen's public trashing of his former cast member. The ladies competing for best lead actress in a comedy series conspired on a gag when their category was called. Each, starting with ""Parks and Recreation"" star Amy Poehler, walked on stage when their names were announced, lining up like beauty pageant contestants. Melissa McCarthy, who won for her work on the CBS sitcom ""Mike & Molly,"" said backstage that it was Poehler's idea. While the show ended with the ""Modern Family"" cast onstage for the best comedy award, the sitcom also monopolized the first half-hour of the show, winning all of the first four Emmys handed out. The actors who play ""Modern Family"" couple Phil and Claire Dunphy now have matching trophies as Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell won the Emmys for best supporting actress and actor, respectively. It was the first Emmy for each. ""I don't know what I'm going to talk about in therapy next week,"" Bowen said in her acceptance speech. ""I won something!"" ""Modern Family"" also claimed the Emmy for best directing in a comedy series, given to Michael Alan Spiller. The show's writers Steven Levitan and Jeffrey Richman won for best writing in a comedy series. ""Welcome back to the 'Modern Family Awards,' "" host Jane Lynch said as the show resumed from a commercial break. The ""Glee"" star is just the third woman ever to host the show, following in the footsteps of pioneers Angela Lansbury and Ellen DeGeneres. While ""Mad Men"" again won the top drama award, it was practically shut out for the other categories. Despite 19 nominations, a hairstyling creative service Emmy was the only other trophy given the AMC series this year. HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" was also shut out in the acting categories, although the drama series won seven Emmy's last week at the creative services ceremony and a best directing Emmy for Martin Scorsese. It was the first Emmy for Scorsese, who already has an Oscar from his career directing movies. ""We approach 'Boardwalk Empire' as a film, a very long film,"" Scorsese said backstage. He said telling stories in a cable series ""gives you more license and much more freedom"" to develop characters. ""You can do something really extraordinary."" The four drama series acting awards were split among other series, including DirecTV's ""Friday Night Lights,"" which claimed the best lead actor Emmy for Kyle Chandler, who plays Coach Eric Taylor. Julianna Margulies, star of the CBS drama ""The Good Wife,"" carried home the Emmy for best lead actress in a drama series. It was her second Emmy win after eight nominations. The most unusual acceptance speech may have been delivered by Peter Dinklage when he was given the Emmy for best supporting actor in a drama series. The co-star of HBO's ""Game Of Thrones'"" took time to thank Kitty, who is the sitter for his dog, Kevin. ""She's an important person in my life,"" Dinklage said backstage. Margo Martindale, who portrays Mags Bennett in FX Networks ""Justified,"" won the for best supporting actress in a drama series. ""Sometimes things just take time,"" said Martindale as she accepted. ""Downton Abbey"" was the most honored miniseries, with six Emmys, including for directing, writing, cinematography and costumes. Maggie Smith, who played the Dowager Countess of Grantham, won for best supporting actress, the mini-series only acting award. HBO's ""Mildred Pierce"" won five Emmys in the miniseries competition, including casting, music, art direction honors handed out last week. Guy Pearce, who played Monty Beragon in ""Mildred Pierce,"" won for best supporting actor. ""I got to have sex with Kate Winslet many, many times, and I didn't realize it was going to result in this,"" Pearce said in his acceptance.

"(CNN)  -- The suspect in last week's deadly shooting at a Binghamton, New York, immigrant center believed he had been harassed for years by undercover police officers, according to a letter received by a New York television station and purportedly written by that suspect, Jiverly Wong. Jiverly Wong included photos of himself along with a letter, his gun permit, and driver's license. Police said they were studying the two-page letter, neatly written in broken English, to determine its authenticity. But the package that arrived Monday at News 10 Now in Syracuse also contained photographs of Wong with two handguns, his gun permit and his driver's license. ""There's several things in there that indicate to myself and the district attorney that suggest mental health issues as well as there may be some religious connotation,"" Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski told 10 News Now, ""but until we get a chance to have mental health professionals, have some religious people look at it to determine what it really means, I'm really not going to comment on it any further at this time."" Zikuski added that the emergence of a letter from the shooting suspect was not a surprise to law enforcement. The package was postmarked April 3, the day of the shooting at the American Civic Assocation in Binghamton where Wong parked his car blocking a back entrance and entered through the front door, shooting two receptionists and then more people in a classroom. By the time he was done, 13 people -- and Wong himself, killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound -- lay dead.

"(CNN) -- A Texas district court judge Friday reversed the conviction of a man who died in prison nearly a decade ago, almost two decades into a prison sentence for a rape he swore he did not commit, CNN affiliate KXAN reported. Timothy Cole died in prison while serving a sentence for a rape DNA tests show he did not commit. Timothy Cole was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1985 rape of 20-year-old Michele Mallin. He maintained his innocence, but it was not confirmed by DNA until years after his 1999 death, when another inmate confessed to the rape. In the courtroom of Judge Charlie Baird Friday afternoon, Mallin, now 44, faced Jerry Johnson, the man who confessed to the rape. ""What you did to me, you had no right to do,"" she told him angrily, according to Austin's KXAN. ""You've got no right to do that to any woman. I am the one with the power now, buddy."" Cole's family also addressed Johnson. ""He'll never have the chance to have children,"" Cole's mother, Ruby Session, said. ""I want you to know he was a fine young man."" Johnson has been in prison since 1985 on two convictions for aggravated sexual assault, according to the Texas Department of Corrections. He was given a life sentence for the rape of a 15-year-old girl, and a jury later tacked on a 99-year sentence for another rape, according to the Lubbock, Texas, Avalanche-Journal. He cannot be charged with the Mallin case, as the statute of limitations has expired. Johnson also spoke Friday. ""I am responsible,"" he said. ""I say I am truly sorry."" Then a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Mallin was walking to her car, intending to move it to another parking lot, when a man approached her asking about jumper cables, she said. In a matter of seconds, he put her in a choke hold and held a knife to her neck. He forced himself into her car and drove her to the outskirts of town, where he raped her. The next day, police investigators showed Mallin pictures of possible suspects. She chose a picture of Cole and said he was her attacker. She later identified him in a physical lineup, according to the Innocence Project of Texas. ""I was positive,"" she said. ""I really thought it was him."" But there was one detail: Mallin told police her attacker was a smoker. ""He was smoking the entire time."" Cole, who suffered from severe asthma, ""was never a smoker,"" said his brother, Cory Session. ""He took daily medications [for asthma] when he was younger."" ""He was the sacrificial lamb. To them, my brother was the Tech rapist, there was no backtracking. It was the trial of the decade for Lubbock."" The ""Tech rapist"" attacked four women other than Mallin -- abducting them in parking lots near campus and driving them to a vacant location, where he would rape them and flee on foot, according to the Innocence Project of Texas. The rapist ""terrorized"" the Texas Tech campus in the mid-1980s, the organization said. Cole, like Mallin, was a student at Texas Tech. He had finished two years of college previously and was returning to school after spending two years in the Army, his brother said. But his dreams of getting married and having children never materialized. He was arrested and charged with Mallin's rape, declining a plea bargain offer that would have put him on probation. A jury convicted him and imposed a 25-year sentence. That night, ""he hugged my mother and he said, 'Mother, why these people lie on me, why they do this to me?'"" Cole's brother Reggie Session recounted for the Avalanche-Journal, which published a three-part series on the case in June. ""He said, 'They know I ain't done nothing to that girl. I don't even know that girl. Why they do this to me, mother?' ... He cried in my mother's arms on the floor."" Later, while in prison, Cole rejected an offer of parole that would have required him to admit guilt. ""His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated,"" his mother, Ruby Session, told KXAN. But the asthma that plagued Cole throughout his life brought about his death on December 2, 1999. The cause was determined to be heart complications due to his asthmatic condition. He was 39. It was 2007 when a letter addressed to Cole arrived at his family's home, written by Johnson.  Read the letter » . ""You may recall my name from your 1986 rape trial in Lubbock,"" says the letter, dated May 11, 2007. ""Your Lubbock attorney, Mike Brown, tried to show I committed the rape. ""I have been trying to locate you since 1995 to tell you I wish to confess I did in fact commit the rape Lubbock wrongly convicted you of. It is very possible that through a written confession from me and DNA testing, you can finally have your name cleared of the rape ... if this letter reaches you, please contact me by writing so that we can arrange to take the steps to get the process started. Whatever it takes, I will do it."" Johnson did not know Cole had died. In fact, according to the Avalanche-Journal, he had been writing to court officials for years to confess to the rape, but got nowhere. Upon finding out that Cole was dead, Johnson wrote he ""cried and felt double guilty, even though I know the system's at fault,"" according to the Avalanche-Journal. ""A day later, I am still bothered, terribly, by the death revelation. Because, not knowing Mr. Cole at all, I wonder if the wrongful incarceration contributed to his death."" The Innocence Project became involved after Cole's family received Johnson's letter. DNA tests confirmed that Johnson was Mallin's attacker. Now, Cole's family hopes the court hearing will be the final step in clearing his name. Mallin is helping them. ""I was very traumatized,"" she said. ""I was scared for my life. I tried my hardest to remember what he looked like. ""I'm trying to get his name cleared. It's the right thing to do."" Cory Session said, ""We don't blame Michele. She's very gracious.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)  -- Thousands of protesters gathered in several cities in Indonesia on Wednesday to push the government to deal with rampant allegations of corruption. Demonstrators massed in Jakarta, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Bandung and West Java. Organizers planned the protests for International Anti-Corruption Day, which the United Nations had declared to raise awareness about efforts to combat graft. The protests come amid a growing public dissatisfaction over investigations into a bailout of Indonesia's Century Bank. The controversy began when critics accused President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and some of his political allies of benefiting from the bailout money. The $710 million government bailout occurred in November 2008. In the South Sulawesi capital of Makassar, where protests are typically more violent, hundreds of demonstrators called for the resignation of Indonesian Vice President and former Central Bank Governor Boediono and Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Sri Mulyani. Both were blamed for key roles in the bailout. In Jakarta, protesters chanted: ""Down with corruptors"" and other slogans. One group burned a picture of Boediono. ""We know that corruption is the source of stupidity, poverty and social imbalance,"" protester Fadjroel Rachman said. ""We are expecting the world to bring down all the corruptors as well as Indonesia. Whoever the corruptor is, we have to take them down. If you're not a corruptor, there is no reason for you to be afraid."" Earlier this week, Yudhoyono said the planned protests were aimed at discrediting his government. On Tuesday, he seemed to soften his stance. In a televised speech, he said, ""I will lead the jihad against corruption,"" and called on everyone to join the rallies in an orderly and peaceful manner. Reacting to Yudhoyono's speech, student Zulkairnan who attended the protests told CNN, ""We are here to push the government to solve the Century Bank case. After watching his speech last night, I became an optimist. I believe he can eradicate corruption. He just needs a more powerful team."" Atin, another student protester said: ""I'm sure [the president] can handle corruption. Many corruptors have been arrested in his era. He did that then, he can also do it now. He needs to take a more firm step.""","Protesters march in Indonesia, urging government to address corruption allegations .

"(CNN)  -- Italy's Alessandro Petacchi took the first stage of the Tour de France after a series of crashes marred the finish in the Belgian capital of Brussels on Sunday. The 36-year-old Lampre star won the sprint for the line from a severely whittled down peloton after a chaotic finish which left many of the leading contenders on the tarmac. Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara of the Saxo Bank team retained the race leader's yellow jersey following his prologue victory in Rotterdam on Saturday. The 223.5 km run from the Dutch port city to Brussels was always expected to boil down to a bunch sprint finish and after the customary breakaways were reeled in, so it proved. Britain's Mark Cavendish, who won six stages of last year's Tour de France, and Spanish fastman Oscar Freire were the first of the favorites to see their hopes ended with both going off on a tight corner. Another big crash quickly followed, which held up the majority of the bunch behind a pile of tangled bikes and bodies while a third took place in the last 200 meters. Cancellara said he had hit the floor after doing a ""somersault"" while defending champion Alberto Contador came home 48th on the stage with his arch-rival Lance Armstrong in 56th. Seven-time Tour winner Armstrong told his twitter blog that it ""total mayhem"", but he survived to stay in fourth overall at 22 seconds behind Cancellara. Petacchi took full advantage to win from Cavendish's HTC-Columbia lead out man Mark Renshaw of Australia, with Thor Hushovd third for Cervelo, valuable points for the Norwegian in the battle for the green points jersey with Cavendish. It was Petacchi's fifth Tour de France stage win but first since 2003 when he was at the peak of his powers. ""It wasn't unexpected for me,"" he told AFP. ""I'm here to sprint and win stages, and to do my best and that's what I did. ""Of course Cavendish and I are sure to sprint against each other, but even if he hadn't been caught up in a crash who's to say I wouldn't have won. I think I did a great sprint,"" he added. Monday's second stage takes the peloton over 201 kilometres from Brussels to Spa.","Alessandro Petacchi claims first stage of Tour de France in Brussels .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban say they are suspending talks with the United States to exchange Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl -- the only American soldier held as a captive -- for five Taliban prisoners. U.S. diplomats had been carrying out ""extremely sensitive discussions"" with Taliban intermediaries, a U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday. The Taliban said the discussions were taking place in Qatar, where the group opened an office last year. However, on Sunday, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid sent a statement saying the group has called for the talks to be suspended. ""The leadership of the Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend the process for some time due to the current complex political situation in the country,"" the statement said. ""The process will remain suspended without the exchange of the prisoners until our decision to resume."" Mujahid did not say what ""complex political situation"" the statement referred to. Bergdahl has been held by insurgents in Pakistan since 2009. Taliban leaders 'appreciate' Karzai . Another statement released by a Taliban spokesman Sunday said a high-ranking delegation recently met in an ""atmosphere of peace and sincerity"" with representatives of the Afghan High Peace Council in the United Arab Emirates. The Taliban representatives ""appreciate"" Afghan President Hamid Karzai's release of 65 prisoners in February, the statement said. It credited the release ""as a reply to our previous demands in this regard."" U.S officials strongly objected to the release of men who they said pose a threat to security forces and civilians. The group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices. ""These individuals are dangerous,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""They pose threats to the safety and security of the Afghan people and the Afghan state."" Negotiating with terrorists . American officials are adamant that they have never given up on trying to get Bergdahl back and resist calling the current effort ""renewed"" discussions. But driving the current effort, according to the U.S. official, is Bergdahl's poor health and concern that a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan at year's end would essentially close the door on any rescue attempt. The United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with terrorists, which is what it considers the Taliban. However, ""we have a history of being able to dance pretty effectively along the edges of the declaration,"" said retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN military analyst. Opinion: Should the U.S. negotiate with terrorists? Possible obstacle . One possible obstacle to securing Bergdahl's release is what may be asked in return. The Taliban have long demanded the release of five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but another U.S. official said that releasing them would be difficult because Congress would have to be notified in advance, and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them. Van Hipp, who served as a deputy assistant Army secretary under former President George H.W. Bush, said that trading Guantanamo inmates for Bergdahl would put at risk ""every American soldier deployed all over the world."" ""We are sending the message to terrorist organizations all over the world that it's OK to capture an American soldier, that America will deal with you,"" said Hipp, now a defense consultant in Washington. ""I think we need to give the green light to the Special Ops and let them do their jobs quietly and methodically, as they have done so well in the past,"" he added. Who is Bowe Bergdahl? Fits and starts . In May 2012, the U.S. government acknowledged that it had been engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl, but those talks moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for the sergeant might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight. Bergdahl, of Wood River Valley, Idaho, appeared in diminished health in a video that the U.S. military obtained in January. His family also received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross. The United States believes that one route to getting Bergdahl back may be through Qatari officials, who have been talking to the Taliban. But Bergdahl is believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda -- and it was not clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban.

"(CNN) -- The same Obama administration that is under fire from critics for allegedly leaking classified information has used a 1917 law to target suspected leakers in twice as many cases as all previous presidential administrations combined. Under Obama, the Justice Department has prosecuted six cases under the Espionage Act in recent years; federal prosecutors had used the law in three cases before Obama took office. ""They've been very tough on these issues,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, senior legal analyst for CNN. ""I think Democratic administrations feel especially obligated to prove that they can be as tough as Republicans on law enforcement. That was true during Clinton, and it's true now, perhaps even excessively."" Congressional leaders call for halt to 'cascade of leaks' Toobin said he believes the prosecutions are ""mildly excessive,"" but ""I think it's par for the course. I think it's reflective of a very tough law-enforcement culture that spans the parties."" In a post-9/11 world, perhaps administration officials feel the stakes of leaking are higher, he said. The issue of leaking classified information has been thrust into the national spotlight this week. Several leading members of Congress argue that the Obama administration has not done enough to prevent leaks about a puported cyberwarfare program against Iran, the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama's personal involvement in ""kill lists"" of militants in Yemen and Pakistan. Some Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential race, say the White House must be knowingly involved in the recent leaks. They allege that the White House has leaked information to paint the president as a strong commander in chief, a sensitive election-year allegation that the White House has strongly denied. Read House Minority Leader Pelosi's reaction to McCain's accusation . The fact that the Obama administration has aggressively used the Espionage Act surprised people such as Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said the uptick in prosecutions was ""not what anybody expected."" He said he believes there are several reasons why ""there's something new and different going on."" ""The aggressive pursuit of leaks is extraordinary and unprecedented,"" he said. ""Why is it happening? I think there are probably multiple reasons. Those include the fact that it is probably easier to identify the source of leaks today than it was a couple of decades ago because there are more tracks of communications -- electronic communications, e-mail and phone records -- that are accessible to investigators than there were in the past."" Another reason could be a backlash stemming from the ""wholesale disclosures of classified information by WikiLeaks,"" he said. The disclosures, he noted, ""crossed so many different policy boundaries, they shocked and horrified government officials ... the tolerance for such leaks, to the extent there was any before, has gone away."" An additional factor is political pressure on the administration from Congress to stop the leaks, he said. Analysts: 'The ship of state always leaks' ""Nobody is saying, 'You're overreacting. Back off. There are too many prosecutions.' That is not the message coming from Congress,"" Aftergood said. ""Instead, congressional leaders of both parties are saying, 'We want more prosecutions and fewer leaks.'"" ""That is not my position,"" he said. ""I think Espionage Act prosecutions are, in most cases, inappropriate responses to the disclosures."" Passed after America entered World War I, the act is basically the only law prohibiting such leaks, Aftergood said. ""There are a couple of other lesser statutes that sometimes are invoked, such as misappropriating government property, that are more of a stretch, but there is no law that says you may not disclose any classified information under any circumstances,"" he said. ""And the Espionage Act is the closest fit. It doesn't mean they are being accused of espionage, but this statute is being applied to fit the facts of these cases. And the courts have said, when challenged that that's permissible."" However, he said, the prosecutions don't mean Obama has abandoned his pledge to provide the most transparent administration in history. ""If that seems like a contradiction, it's only on the surface,"" he said. ""The administration never pledged not to enforce classification rules or to invite defiance of limits on disclosure of classified information."" It is true, however, that the law has only been used recently to prosecute low- and mid-level employees. ""That's one of the problems with leak prosecution in general,"" Toobin said. ""High government officials feel no compunction about leaking, and the rare times anyone is prosecuted, it's usually someone at a low level."" ""And also, I react to this as a journalist -- an interchange of information and ideas between government and the news media is indispensable to a functioning democracy, and if you start scaring sources with the possibility of years in prison, the loser is not going to be the news media -- it's going to be the public,"" he said. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Obama ""has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken, unprecedented in American presidential administration history. ""But he is also president and commander in chief, and he will not countenance the leaking of classified information that can harm our men and women in uniform, harm Americans who work on our national security, harm counterterrorism operations,"" Carney said. Aftergood said the prosecutions of lower-level officials reflect ""one of the basic incongruities"" in the law. ""Is it only the Army privates and the mid-level bureaucrats who are leaking? Is it never White House officials or senior agency officials? Judging by the government's prosecution record, you'd think that senior officials never leak, because they're never being prosecuted, and we know that's not true,"" he said. ""What appears to be a pattern of selective prosecution is another aspect of the unfairness of the way these statutes are being enforced."" The government, he said, has several tools at its disposal to respond to leaks, including revocation of security clearances, terminations and other administrative penalties and fines. ""A felony prosecution for disclosure of information to the media ought to be the response in only the most egregious and damning cases,"" Aftergood said. ""Instead, it seems to be the first response, even in the mildest or most questionable cases, like that of Thomas Drake."" Drake, a former National Security Agency official, was indicted in 2010 on 10 counts of willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of justice and making false statements. Prosecutors accused him of leaking information to a reporter. But prosecutors decided they could not pursue the charges after a federal judge ruled classified information would have to be presented in open court. Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of exceeding his authorized use of an agency computer after authorities dropped the most serious charges -- including some under the Espionage Act -- against him. He was sentenced to a year of probation in July. Drake's attorneys said the case did not involve ""the handling or mishandling of classified information. Rather, it relates to Mr. Drake's decision to communicate with a Baltimore Sun reporter about his belief that NSA was engaged in waste, fraud and abuse."" Other cases include that of former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who pleaded not guilty in April to charges he gave classified information to reporters and lied to a CIA review board about material in a book he wrote; and Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and State Department documents while serving in Iraq, many of which ended up on the WikiLeaks site. Also, there's Shamai Leibowitz, a former FBI contract linguist who pleaded guilty to providing classified documents to the host of an Internet blog, who then published information on the blog. Leibowitz was sentenced to 20 months in prison in 2010. Aftergood said he believes authorities should take into account whether the leak resulted in damage. ""There's too much passion at work here, too much zeal and not enough judgment,"" he said. CNN's Tom Cohen and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama will not accept harmful leaks, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The TSA is not as bad you think they are. At least, that's what a list of ""myths and facts"" issued Thursday by the TSA about pat-downs and other security measures would like you to consider. Many Americans have reacted with displeasure, or even outrage, over recent high-profile stories about intrusive searches at airports. In one of the instances that reverberated the strongest, a California man's video of his encounter with TSA agents went viral. John Tyner refused an X-ray scan and then famously told agents that, ""if you touch my junk, I'll have you arrested."" In its fact sheet, the TSA says that pat-downs only occur when a passenger sets off a metal detector or opts out of an X-ray scan. The latter is what led to Tyner's confrontation with the TSA. Some see the pat-downs as a punishment for refusing to get scanned, but the TSA says that is not the case. ""There is nothing punitive about it -- it just makes good security sense,"" the TSA said. ""And the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we've found during pat-downs speak to this."" There are 400 full-body scanning machines at 69 airports nationwide, according to the TSA. About 24 million air travelers are expected to fly over the Thanksgiving holiday period, according to the Air Transport Association of America, an airline trade group. Grass-roots groups are urging travelers either not to fly or to protest by opting out of the full-body scanners and undergoing time-consuming pat-downs instead. Industry leaders are worried about the backlash. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met with leaders of travel industry groups to discuss the concerns. Another myth that the TSA tackled is that all children will receive pat-downs. Children who require extra screening who are under 12 receive a modified pat-down, the TSA said. That news probably isn't reassuring for teenagers who draw a secondary security screening. Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the hero pilot, has gone on record as a critic of the TSA measures. He said the use of full-body pat-downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel ""just isn't an efficient use of our resources."" Then there is the issue of whether the full-body scans, done in advance imaging technology, or AIT machines, are safe. It is a myth that they are not safe, the TSA says. The Backscatter technology used in the machines has been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the TSA says. ""In fact, a traveler is exposed to less radiation from one AIT scan than from two minutes of an airline flight,"" the fact sheet says. Passengers have also expressed concerns that the images from the scanners can be saved or transmitted to other devices. The TSA also calls this a myth, saying that the scanning machines do not have the capability to save or transmit images, and that other devices, such as cell phones with cameras, are not allowed in the screening rooms.","TSA says that pat-downs are only for those who set off metal detectors .
They are also for those who opt out of an X-ray scan .

"(CNN) -- Canadian investigators want to talk to actress Pamela Anderson about her recent revelation that she suffered sexual abuse as a child. Anderson, 46, described several incidents of sex abuse at the launch of her charity, the Pamela Anderson Foundation, at the Cannes Film Festival in France on Friday. The incidents started at age 6, she said, when she was molested by a babysitter. The former ""Baywatch"" star grew up in British Columbia before starting her modeling and acting career in the United States. ""Given the nature of the allegations, an investigator with the Ladysmith RCMP is in the process of reaching out to Ms. Anderson to discuss this matter with her directly,"" Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Darren Lagan said Thursday. ""Given the sensitive nature of these allegations, and out of respect for Ms. Anderson's privacy, we will provide no further comment at this time."" Although she had ""loving parents,"" Anderson said she ""did not have an easy childhood."" She never told her parents about the abuse. Child sex abuse is a taboo topic for some parents . ""I feel now might be the time to reveal some of my most painful memories,"" she said, according to a transcript posted on her blog. She recounted being molested between the ages of 6 and 10 by a female babysitter and then being raped when she was 12 by the 25-year-old brother of a friend's boyfriend. The man ""decided he would teach me backgammon, which led into a back massage, which led into rape,"" she said. Coincidentally, the Cannes event at which she revealed the rape was a backgammon tournament. ""Needless to say, I had a hard time trusting humans,"" Anderson said. ""I just wanted off this Earth."" Although her parents ""tried to keep me safe,"" the ""world was not a safe place,"" she said. Her mother was busy with two waitressing jobs, she said. Anderson said her love for animals saved her. ""My loyalty remained with the animal kingdom,"" she said. ""I vowed to protect them and only them. I prayed to the whales with my feet in the ocean. My only real friends, till I had children.""

"(CNN) -- For years, children from Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, have attended schools across the border in Del Rio, Texas, but this week that changed for students who cannot prove residency. The local school superintendent imposed new regulations to stem what he said is a long-standing problem for the district. ""I have seen van loads of kids with plates from Coahuila State (in Mexico) pulling in front of the school,"" San Felipe Del Rio School Superintendent Kelt Cooper told CNN. ""Everyone knows what is going on. It's real blatant."" Cooper, who joined the district 11 months ago, previously was superintendent in the border town of Nogales, Arizona, where he had to deal with similar circumstances. There, he remembered, he once had 32 students with the same home address. When district officials checked, the property was a vacant lot. In Del Rio, Cooper said he began to notice ""there was some slackness in the protocol"" dealing with proof of residency. ""Border towns are really unique,"" Cooper told CNN in a phone interview. ""There is a lot of fluidity between the two cities. Having grown up in the border, I know this is very common."" Last week, Cooper received confirmation from authorities at the International Bridge border crossing that some 540 school-age kids were crossing the bridge in the mornings. Cooper said the situation was ""getting out of hand,"" and on Wednesday he dispatched district staff members to the bridge to talk to the parents accompanying their children from the Mexican side. The staff was able to identify 195 students that could be barred from the district's schools if they failed to provide proof they lived within the district. Three of the students were Carla Gomez' children. In a phone interview, Gomez told CNN she lives in Del Rio with her sister-in-law, but she travels back and forth to Ciudad Acuna to see her husband, who was deported. On Wednesday, Gomez was stopped by school district staff and received a letter saying that her children would be dropped from enrollments if she couldn't provide proof of residency. To prove residency, the district requires parents or guardians to provide an official document such as a utility bill, lease or proof-of-rent payment, none of which Gomez said she can provide since everything is in her sister-in-law's name. She said her only alternative may be homeschooling her children. Cooper said he knows some of the parents who received letters are upset, especially those with children who are U.S. citizens. But he said the issue is a matter or residency, not citizenship or immigration status. ""Citizenship is a moot point. It really comes down to whether you live here,"" Cooper said. ""Frequently, they (Mexicans) come with the impression that their kids are U.S. citizens, so they can go to school here,"" he added. ""I am not U.S. Border Patrol, Customs or INS. If you are a resident here, you get to go to school here, if you don't, you don't. This is not a matter of border enforcement."" A 1982 Texas Supreme Court ruling protects students from being discriminated upon based on immigration status, but Texas law states the student must live in a school district's area to attend a school within that district. Cooper and his staff are trying to work out a tuition system for students who cannot prove residency. He is in talks with state agencies to calculate an appropriate tuition fee, but the school board would first have to approve the program. ""We are saying if we have room, you can pay tuition. We don't want this to be a burden on taxpayers. Some of the parents we have talked to have expressed interest in paying tuition,"" he said. But as Cooper has learned this week, the tuition program has proven unsuccessful in other cities. He has spoken with three superintendents of other border school districts, all of whom have said to him they tried the tuition program but it didn't work. ""I got the impression from them it was not worth the hassle,"" he said. But losing non-resident students could wind up costing the district. Cooper estimated that in a worst-case scenario, the district could lose some $2.7 million in state funding since budgets are based on attendance. There are currently about 10,000 students in the district.","School district cracks down on Mexican students crossing border to attend class .

"(CNN) -- Calling for an airport screening process that maximizes security but cuts down on passenger hassles, the U.S. Travel Association on Wednesday recommended key changes to the current system. The group, along with a panel of experts, suggested creating a trusted traveler program that would allow fliers who volunteer certain information about themselves to go through less rigorous security before their flight. It also proposed allowing each traveler to check one bag without a fee to reduce the amount of luggage going through security checkpoints. ""We need to do better,"" said Jim Turner, a former ranking Democratic member of the House Homeland Security Committee and co-chairman of the panel, during a news conference in Washington. ""We owe it to the traveling public to make the system make more sense."" Traveler frustration with the current routine -- which includes the familiar rules about taking off shoes, going through a metal detector or full-body scan (or both) and facing the possibility of a pat down -- prompted the report, titled ""A Better Way,"" the U.S. Travel Association said. What are the chances Congress would approve any portion of the plan? It's very difficult to get action in this area, Turner admitted. But if implemented, the recommendations could shorten wait times at security checkpoints and allow the Transportation Security Administration to screen passengers based on risk, the report said. 'Shrink the haystack' Right now, ""everyone who checks in is treated as a potential terrorist,"" said Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and co-chairman of the panel. The group called it a ""one-size-fits-all solution"" in which children and the elderly can be pulled aside for extra screening. But having everyone go through the system isn't the way to eliminate risk, Ridge said. ""If you want to find a needle in a haystack, you shrink the haystack,"" he said. That's where the trusted traveler program would come in, designating some passengers as low-risk based on information such as a background check, employment history, lack of criminal record and other factors. Once travelers enroll in the program and their identity is confirmed at the airport with the help of biometric information, they would be subject to less security, Ridge said. The program should be extended to qualified international passengers, the panel recommends. The TSA screens more than 628 million airline passengers every year at U.S. airports, and the vast majority present little to no risk of committing an act of terrorism, TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a speech earlier this month. In response to Wednesday's report, TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Pistole's vision for the future of airport security screening is ""one that is more risk-based and intelligence-driven, shifting away from a one-size-fits-all approach at checkpoints."" ""Last fall, [Pistole] directed the agency to explore ways to further develop this strategy, with plans to announce more details this year. We welcome dialogue with stakeholders and the traveling public as the process moves forward,"" he said. The bag problem . Meanwhile, the U.S. Travel Association report also sets its sights on baggage. Passengers are bringing more carry-ons onto flights to avoid paying checked-bag fees, which increases checkpoint congestion and requires the TSA to devote more resources to screen passenger bags, the report says. The solution? The Department of Transportation should require airlines to allow each passenger to check one bag as part of the base airfare, the panel recommends. Congress must improve the current system, said Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. There are economic considerations at stake as well, he said. Dow cited a 2010 survey by Consensus Research, which found that U.S. travelers would take an additional two to three flights per year if the hassles in security screening system were eliminated. The additional flights would add nearly $85 billion in consumer spending and 900,000 jobs to the American economy, the report said.","NEW: TSA welcomes ""dialogue with ... the traveling public"" on panel's recommendations .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two U.S. air marshals who arrested the wife of a Brazilian judge on a flight to Rio de Janeiro -- and were themselves arrested and had their passports confiscated by Brazilian authorities -- fled the country using alternate travel documents rather than face what they believed to be trumped-up charges, sources said. The incident has impacted air marshal operations on flights to Brazil, officials said, and air marshals contacted by CNN said the case raises questions about Brazil's willingness to support future law enforcement actions by U.S. officials on international flights. The incident occurred on October 1 on Continental Flight 128 from Houston, Texas, to Rio de Janeiro. During the flight, a female passenger who appeared to be intoxicated tried to serve herself drinks by going to the plane's galley, one source said. The plane's crew asked air marshals to intervene, and two marshals approached the woman, who began struggling with them. Two sources said the woman bit one of the air marshals, and she was handcuffed and placed under arrest. At the Rio airport, the air marshals went to turn over the woman to local authorities but were themselves brought before a federal judge and charged with misdemeanor counts of assault, sources said. Brazilian authorities took the air marshals' passports, so they could not leave the country and set a court hearing for the following week, sources said. ""They (Brazilian officials) did not want them to leave. They were not free to go,"" one U.S. law enforcement source said. But the air marshals used alternate travel documents and quietly departed the country on a commercial flight that same day without the knowledge of the Brazilian court officials who had sought their detention. One source said the air marshals believed the charges against them were retaliatory because the passenger they arrested is the wife of a prominent Brazilian judge. The air marshals believed it was to their benefit to leave the country and let the U.S. and Brazilian governments resolve the dispute, the source said. The air marshals had not recovered their passports when they left, the sources said. A Transportation Security Administration official, contacted by CNN on the day of the incident, confirmed that air marshals had confronted a ""disruptive passenger"" on Flight 128, and said that U.S. officials were working with their Brazilian counterparts to resolve ""an issue,"" which the official declined to discuss. Shortly before midnight the day of the incident, the TSA official said the air marshal team had left Brazil, but the official did not elaborate on the circumstances. U.S. officials on October 1 and again this week declined to discuss the circumstances in which the air marshals left Brazil. But, commenting about the incident on board the aircraft, an official said, ""We believe our federal air marshals acted appropriately within the provisions of the Convention on Offenses and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (Tokyo Convention)."" Air marshals and union representatives contacted by CNN say it is important that Brazil and other nations recognize law enforcement actions taken by air marshals during international flights. ""In theory we're all working together to combat the threat of terrorism and we should not let egos or marital relations impact proper procedure and legal protocols,"" said Jon Adler, national president for the union that represents air marshals. Numerous sources said the issue is still unresolved. According to court documents in Brazil, after the air marshals missed a scheduled court appointment on October 6, the court contacted the U.S. Embassy in an attempt to get the air marshals' addresses. On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met with Brazilian Minister of Defense Nelson Job to discuss strengthening the global aviation system. The United States and Brazil signed a ""joint statement of intent on aviation security."" A Department of Homeland Security official said the parties did not discuss the Continental Flight 128 incident or its aftermath. Sources said they believe the two agents remain charged in Brazilian courts. They did not know if the agents' passports had been returned to them or the U.S. government. State Department officials have declined to comment on the incident, but said it is not affecting relations with Brazil. ""We've got broad, deep relations with Brazil,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""We have many, many areas of cooperation with Brazil. And on those areas where we have had disagreements, or rather issues to address, and challenges, we've worked through them quite effectively."" A call to the Brazilian Embassy in Washington on Thursday was not immediately returned. Journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this report.","Two air marshals were on a Continental flight to Rio on October 1 .

"(CNN)  -- Christian Eshiett was a rambunctious pre-teen who spent a lot of time cavorting with his friends in southern Nigeria. He would skip school and run away from home for days, frustrating his grandfather, who oversaw the boy's care. Children branded as witches protest on February 26, 2009, in the southern Nigerian city of Eket. ""I beat him severely with canes until they broke, yet he never shed a tear,"" said Eshiett Nelson Eshiett, 76. ""One day, I took a broom to hit him and he started crying. Then I knew he was possessed by demons. ... Nigerian witches are terrified of brooms."" From that day two years ago, Christian, now 14, was branded a witch. The abuse intensified. ""They would take my clothes off, tie me up and beat me,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. The teen is one of the so-called witch children in Eket, a city in oil-rich Akwa Ibom state of Nigeria. They are blamed for causing illness, death and destruction, prompting some communities to put them through harrowing punishments to ""cleanse"" them of their supposed magical powers. ""Children accused of witchcraft are often incarcerated in churches for weeks on end and beaten, starved and tortured in order to extract a confession,"" said Gary Foxcroft, program director of Stepping Stones Nigeria, a nonprofit that helps alleged witch children in the region. Many of those targeted have traits that make them stand out, including learning disabilities, stubbornness and ailments such as epilepsy, he added. The issue of ""child witches"" is soaring in Nigeria and other parts of the world, Foxcroft said. The states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River have about 15,000 children branded as witches, and most of them end up abandoned and abused on the streets, he said. Christian ran away from home and wandered around for two years with other children similarly accused. He said they stole, begged for food and performed menial jobs to survive. The plight of ""child witches"" is raising concern among aid organizations, including the United Nations. ""It is a growing issue worldwide, among not just African communities, but in countries such as Nepal as well,"" said Jeff Crisp, head of policy development and evaluation for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ""We are trying to see whether it is a neglected protected issue."" Belief in witchcraft thrives worldwide. About 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia were locked in detention centers in March and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion, human rights organization Amnesty International said. In 2005, relatives of an 8-year-old Angolan girl living in England were convicted of torturing her for being a ""witch,"" according to the Times Online. Pastors have been accused of worsening the problem by claiming to have powers to recognize and exorcise ""child witches,"" sometimes for a fee, aid workers said. But some are true believers, such as one minister in Lagos, Nigeria. He pinpoints children affected by witchcraft for free, he said. ""Sometimes, we get a dream that shows us a certain person is suffering from witchcraft,"" said the Rev. Albert Aina, a senior pastor at Four Square Gospel Church. ""Sometimes, you have a child who has inexplicable body marks because of struggling in the night. They are easy to identify, but why charge when you have been given a gift by God?"" Aina said. Once a child is branded a witch, the stigma can last forever. Christian was reunited with his grandfather, a former theater instructor at a university in Nigeria. Eshiett said he let his son's child return home because he loves him and he advocates for youth education. But, he added, he does not think Christian has been or can be freed from witchcraft. ""When you are possessed, you are possessed; no one can deliver you from Satan,"" Eshiett said, adding that his grandson is a witch because he still exhibits unruly behavior and does not take education seriously. Aid organizations acknowledge that the belief is acceptable and popular in some communities. ""It is not the belief in witchcraft that we are concerned about,"" Foxcroft said. ""We acknowledge people's right to hold this belief on the condition that this does not lead to child abuse."" Foxcroft, whose documentary, ""Saving Africa's Witch Children,"" was broadcast last year, spoke to a U.N. panel on the issue in April. The aid worker said he is planning a global conference in 2010 and public awareness campaigns, including addressing the issue in Nigerian movies. The nation's film industry, dubbed Nollywood, is a popular form of entertainment in African countries. Government officials also have joined the fight. Akwa Ibom recently added a clause into the Child Rights Act, saying that anyone found guilty of branding a child a witch would get up to 12 years in prison. ""This is groundbreaking, and Stepping Stones Nigeria applauds the Akwa Ibom state government for this,"" Foxcroft said. But, he added, there is more work to be done, and other groups, especially churches, have to team up to resolve the problem.

"(CNN) -- The county that brought us the Tour de France has notched up another cycling landmark -- the world's first self-service city rental bike for kids. City authorities in Paris have decided that their widely imitated Velib rental bike program is so popular it should be extended to children as young as two. On Wednesday, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo launched P'tit Velib, which offers four sizes of cycle in five leafy off-road locations across the city. ""Because good habits begin early, the mayor of Paris wishes to familiarize children with using more environmentally friendly modes of transport, and from a young age,"" the P'tit Velib website says. Nadhera Beletreche, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office, told CNN the plan was the first of its kind anywhere. Chunky gray bikes . Velib was launched in July 2007 and now claims to have more than 20,000 of its chunky gray bikes available from 1,800 docking stations around Paris. The service, which offers half an hour of free riding followed by incremental charges, was reportedly used to make 130 million trips in its first five years. Although Velib followed numerous earlier bike-sharing and rental plans, it grew to become one of the world's most successful. The model of using corporate sponsorship and computerized docking stations has been imitated by other cities such as London. The new children's bikes -- designed with the same gray stylings as their adult counterparts -- are available to rent in the Bois de Boulogne near the Porte La Muette and the Rond-Point du Jardin d'Acclimitation, the Ourcq Canal, the Bois de Vincennes and the banks of the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides and the Pont De l'Alma. Rental rates start at â‚¬4 ($5.40). Further locations are expected to open later in the year.","P'tit Velib program claims to be the first self-service bike rental scheme aimed at kids .

"(CNN) -- Three armed men robbed famed Puerto Rican golfer Juan Antonio ""Chi Chi"" Rodriguez and his wife of up to $500,000 worth of jewelry, watches and other personal items in their home early Wednesday, police said. The crime occurred about 1:30 a.m. when the robbers broke into the golfer's home at El Legado Resort in the southern Puerto Rican city of Guayama, police spokesman Wilson Porrata said. The robbers tied Rodriguez up before making off with the merchandise, Porrata said in a statement. Rodriguez, 74, and his wife, Iwalani, were not injured, police said. ""Aside from the fright -- they were asleep -- they are fine,"" police spokeswoman Erica Colon told CNN. ""They were not beaten."" No arrests had been made by late Wednesday afternoon, Colon said. The losses were covered by insurance, said the golfer's publicist, Maria Morales. ""The thing that troubles (him) the most is they took Iwalani's wedding ring,"" Morales told CNN. Rodriguez and his wife have been married for 45 years, the publicist said. Rodriguez had the first of his eight PGA Tour wins in 1963. He has had 87 top 10 finishes in the 527 events in which he has played. He is the founder of the non-profit Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation and the Chi Chi Rodriguez Academy in Clearwater, Florida, which teaches golf and life lessons to at-risk children.

"(CNN) -- Jeff Szabo was by his wife's side when she gave birth to their son Gabriel seven years ago, and he was right there holding Joy's hand when their younger sons Michael and Daniel were born, too. Jeff Szabo was there when Joy gave birth to (from left) Gabriel, Michael and Daniel, but will probably miss No. 4. Joy is now eight months pregnant, but when this baby is born, her husband will most likely be more than 300 miles away. The reason: Their local hospital in Page, Arizona, won't deliver the Szabos' baby vaginally as the Szabos wish, so a week or so before her November 21 due date, Joy will drive 350 miles to be near a hospital in Phoenix that will. Their local hospital says they'll only deliver the Szabos' baby, another boy, via Caesarean section. Joy had her second son, Michael, by C-section. Page Hospital says it won't do a vaginal birth after a woman has had a C-section -- known as a VBAC -- because it has a higher than usual risk for complications. So Joy plans to move to Phoenix in November, while Jeff stays in Page, in far northern Arizona, to take care of their three children and run the family computer business. ""I'm so upset about this,"" Jeff says. ""I've been there in the delivery room for all the other boys and I won't be there for this baby, and I won't be there for Joy."" The Szabos and a growing number of other families are facing the choice of Mom having a surgery she doesn't want or attempting a vaginal birth at a hospital that, in most cases, would be far away. A mother's choice . The Szabos' story began in 2004 when she was in labor with Michael. Complications arose and doctors at Page Hospital feared the baby wasn't getting enough oxygen, and so they performed an emergency Caesarean section. ""I'm grateful for that C-section,"" Joy says. ""It saved Michael's life."" Two years later, Szabo had a successful, uncomplicated vaginal delivery with son Daniel at the same hospital. She assumed she could have a vaginal birth this time too, but, she says, a month ago her doctor told her Page Hospital had changed its policy and she'd have to have a C-section. Studies have shown VBACs carry with them an increased risk of a uterine rupture compared with births in women who've never had a C-section, but the risk is less than 1 percent, according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. The results of a uterine rupture can be devastating: The baby could die or have permanent brain damage. ""I know there's a risk with a VBAC, but we think the risks of surgery are worse,"" Joy Szabo says. C-section risks include breathing problems for the baby and infections and bleeding for the mother, according to the Mayo Clinic. ""And I don't want to have to recover from surgery when I'll have four children at home, at least not voluntarily,"" says Joy. After their discussion with their doctor, the Szabos made an appointment to speak with Page Hospital's CEO, Sandy Haryasz. When the couple told her about their desire for a vaginal birth, they say Haryasz would not budge, even telling them she would get a court order if necessary to ensure Joy delivered via C-section. ""I was a bit flabbergasted, because that seemed rather extreme,"" Joy says. ""I'd already had a VBAC at Page and it went fine. And if something happened, I know they can do an emergency C-section, because they did one for Michael."" Conflict over guidelines . Michele Grim, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Haryasz could not comment on her discussion with the Szabos because of patient confidentiality laws. Banner Health, which owns Page Hospital, says it decided to stop performing VBACs at Page when ACOG, the obstetricians' group, established guidelines for hospitals that Page Hospital was not adequately staffed to satisfy. The ACOG guidelines recommend ""24/7 coverage of both physician and anesthesiologist,"" and that ""two physicians be immediately available during the entire period of labor,"" Banner Health said in a statement. But ACOG spokesman Gregory Phillips says that's not what the guidelines say. ""These appear to be Banner's interpretations of the stated recommendation,"" says Gregory Phillips. The ACOG guidelines recommend that doctors consider several factors when determining if a VBAC is possible. For example, two criteria that can be considered are whether there's physician availability throughout active labor, and whether anesthesia and staff can be available for an emergency C-section. Since the ACOG guidelines came out in 2004, more and more hospitals have refused to do VBACs. Today, nearly half of hospitals won't do VBACs, either because the hospital has banned them or because doctors won't do them, according to a survey of nearly 3,000 hospitals by the International Cesarean Awareness Network, a grassroots group that has fought against VBAC bans. Missing his son's birth . To get around the ban, Joy Szabo plans on moving to an apartment in Phoenix in the middle of November. They have no friends or family there, but a doula, or childbirth assistant, will drive her to the hospital when she goes into labor. The Szabos have no option but to separate to get the birth they want, but in other situations, women don't have to go to such extremes. For example, some women don't want to be induced into labor, or don't want an episiotomy. The key is to look around for a doctor or midwife who shares your philosophy by asking questions about their induction rate, or whether they perform episiotomies routinely, according to Carol Sakala, director of programs for the Childbirth Connection, a nonprofit advocacy and education group. Also, choosing the right hospital or birthing center makes a big difference. ""The institution you walk into profoundly affects you,"" Sakala says. ""A really good thing is to ask doulas for their recommendations, because they've worked at multiple hospitals and have a good feel for what happens in each of them."" For more information on getting the birth you want, see these recommendations from Lamaze International. The Szabos know there's little chance Jeff will make it in time for the birth. ""With our other sons, her labor only lasted three hours. It'll take me five hours to get to Phoenix,"" Jeff says, noting that with three little kids along for the ride, it will take even longer. ""Of course I'm scared that I won't be there,"" he adds. ""It's my job as the dad to make sure the baby's OK after the birth, to follow him around and make sure he has 10 fingers and 10 toes. Now the chances of that happening are slim to none."" CNN's Sharisse Scineaux contributed to this report.","One woman plans to travel 350 miles to another city in order to avoid a C-section .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former FBI Director Louis Freeh said Friday that Attorney General-designate Eric Holder allowed himself ""to be used"" by the Clinton White House in the pardon process for then-fugitive financier Marc Rich in January 2001. Former FBI director Louis Freeh calls Attorney General-designate Eric Holder man of ""tremendous integrity."" But Freeh told senators at Holder's confirmation that Holder was nevertheless a man of ""tremendous integrity"" who ""will never allow himself again to be put in that position."" ""The pardon of Marc Rich was a corrupt act,"" Freeh said, but was not Holder's responsibility. Freeh asserted that President Bill Clinton's White House staff kept the FBI and Justice Department ""in the dark"" and ""actively conspired"" to ensure that nobody knew what pardons were being considered shortly before Clinton left office. ""The [Clinton] White House went to extraordinary lengths to deceive the attorney general, myself, the Department of Justice and everyone about who was on the secret pardon list. ... I don't think it's fair to put that blame totally on Eric Holder,"" Freeh said. ""He takes responsibility, and he will never make that mistake again."" Holder, Freeh said, had a proven track record of ""political independence"" and an ability ""to say no"" to the White House when necessary. Freeh was the opening witness on the second day of Holder's confirmation hearing. Holder, who was deputy attorney general during Clinton's second term, acknowledged at the outset of his confirmation hearing that many of his past ""decisions were not always perfect"" and that he ""made mistakes,"" but, if confirmed, he said, he would ""faithfully execute"" his duties in a ""fair, just and independent manner.""  Watch Holder admit he made mistakes » . He was particularly quick to admit that he made mistakes during the Rich pardon incident at the end of the Clinton administration that were ""not typical"" of his conduct over most of his career. Holder said he ""made assumptions that turned out not to be true"" during Rich's pardon process, which turned out to be the ""most intense"" and ""searing"" experience he ""ever had as a lawyer."" He said that as a result of the experience, he would ""be a better attorney general."" One of the lessons of the Rich case, Holder stated, is the need for ""full consultation with all lawyers in the pardon process."" He said there is a need to improve the pardon process, which seems to experience a ""deterioration ... at the end of every administration."" Holder was also harshly criticized Friday for ""playing Russian roulette"" with the safety of Americans for making an ""egregious recommendation"" in 1999 of clemency for 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group convicted of conspiracy and bomb-making charges. Joseph Connor, the son of a victim of a 1975 New York City restaurant bombing by the FALN -- or Armed Forces of National Liberation -- testified that the former federal judge and prosecutor was ""soft on terror"" and, as a result, should be ""disqualified"" for the position of attorney general. ""These terrorists took away my dad's life,"" Connor said. ""Did he actually believe in their cause? Did he not know what they did?"" Holder stated during his confirmation hearing Thursday that Clinton's decision to grant clemency to the 16 FALN members ""was reasonable."" Holder also noted that there were ""a lot of people in support of that clemency request,"" including former President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The FALN is responsible for multiple attacks on U.S. military installations. When Holder appeared before senators Thursday, he drew a clear distinction with President Bush's Justice Department by stating unambiguously that the controversial interrogation technique of waterboarding ""is torture"" and a violation of the Geneva Conventions.  Watch Holder call waterboarding torture » . Holder, who will be the nation's first African-American attorney general if confirmed, pledged to support interrogation techniques that are ""effective,"" but don't ""serve as recruiting tools for the enemy"" or violate America's treaty obligations. Any techniques used by the government, Holder said, need to be ""consistent with who we are as Americans."" Justice Department officials have admitted that waterboarding -- one of the greatest points of dispute between the Bush administration and both congressional Democrats and civil liberties watchdog groups -- was used in the past, but is no longer practiced, officials have said. The debate over waterboarding was one of a series of issues covered in Holder's confirmation hearing that have sharply and often bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans over the past eight years. Other issues raised during the hearing included the decision to hold prisoners at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; the implementation of the Patriot Act; and the broader need to strike an appropriate balance between protecting civil liberties and effectively prosecuting the war on terror.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago. Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing. Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29. Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, ""Yes."" Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal. ""We don't believe justice was done,"" Weinberg said. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long ""pattern of violence"" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict » . ""This was not an isolated incident,"" Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. ""The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that."" Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna. Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003. A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector ""a very dangerous man"" who ""has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth."" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. ""This entire jury took this so seriously,"" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that ""it's tough to be in a jury,"" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie ""Barbarian Queen"" and appeared in many other films, including ""DeathStalker,"" ""Blind Date,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and the spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector. Spector's professional trademark was the ""Wall of Sound,"" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict? The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called ""little symphonies for the kids"" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" and the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, ""Let It Be,"" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.","NEW: Defense says it will appeal; ""We don't believe justice was done""

"(CNN) -- Medical tourism is one of the hottest topics in health care as patients around the world are increasingly traveling abroad for treatment. Wockhardt Hospitals in India actively target international patients. Josef Woodman, author of Patients Beyond Borders, a guide to medical tourism, told CNN that two to three million people travel outside their home country for treatment each year, while consultancy firm Deloitte calculates that 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for treatment last year. The top regional destination for medical tourists is Asia, with Singapore, Thailand and India leading the way. Those countries are home to private health care chains that target international patients and are building modern, high-tech hospitals with a reputation for quality care.  See more medical tourism hotspots » . Bumrungrad International Limited (BIL), based in Thailand, owns and operates over 70 health care facilities in seven countries. According to BIL, its Bangkok flagship hospital treats over 400,000 foreign patients a year, with over 90,000 coming from the Middle East. Parkway Health, a Singaporean hospital chain, says the city of Singapore attracted approximately 450,000 international patients last year, and in India, the Apollo Hospitals Group says it has treated more than 60,000 foreign patients in the last five years. What these chains have in common is that at least some of their hospitals are accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), the global arm of an American nonprofit organization that accredits most U.S. hospitals. That provides overseas patients with the assurance that their treatment will be of an internationally recognized standard. Dr. Ajaya Jha, director of neuroscience at Max Hospital in New Delhi, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that medical tourism to India was being driven by a lack of available health care in neighboring countries, and by the lower cost of treatment in India compared with developed countries. ""Slowly we're developing a reputation for having the best technology in the world and some of best people in the world to do this,"" said Jha. For uninsured or underinsured Americans, low prices make treatment in Asia an attractive option. Surgery in Thailand and Latin America can cost a quarter of its U.S. price, and JCI-accredited Wockhardt Hospitals offer open heart surgery in India for $8,500, compared to around $100,000 in the U.S. and $28,000 in the UK. In countries with state-run health services, such as Britain and Canada, long waiting times for surgery are encouraging patients to look overseas for a cheaper alternative to private treatment in their own country. Would you travel abroad for medical treatment? Share your views in the SoundOff below . But contrary to the popular view of patients traveling from wealthy nations to developing countries for cheap medical care, a recent survey by consultancy firm McKinsey found that most medical tourists travel in search of advanced medical technologies or to receive better care than they would at home. Woodman says 250,000 Indonesians are treated in Singapore each year, while Cambodian and Vietnamese resident choose Thailand for treatment and patients from the Middle East favor Singapore and Thailand. While medical tourism is targeted as a growth industry in some developing countries, there is concern that it will result in a ""brain drain,"" where doctors migrate from public hospitals to private hospitals that cater to international patients. South Korea recently limited foreign patients to no more than five percent of its hospital beds, to ensure domestic patients do not lose out. Woodman says the ""brain drain"" isn't an issue in India, because there are so many talented surgeons and physicians there in the public and private sector. He adds that developing countries can benefit from medical tourism. ""The presence of medical tourism brings a lot of economic clout into a country and raises the bar by forcing at least certain hospitals to rise to the top standards of healthcare,"" he told CNN. While the bulk of medical tourism is for private care, there is a move towards a kind of state-funded medical tourism within the EU. Rulings by the European Court of Justice in recent years have verified the right of all EU citizens to receive healthcare in another member state, paid for by their own country's health system. Diane Dawson, a senior research fellow at the Center for Health Economics at York University, England, told CNN that patients can only take advantage of this if their own country cannot provide treatment without ""undue delay."" That limitation, as well as the difficulty in getting authorization from their own national health system, means that relatively few patients currently travel within the EU for treatment, she said. But an EU draft directive published last year aims to make the approval process easier and more transparent. Keith Pollard, director of British Web site Treatment Abroad, told CNN that the new directive will mean patients will be able to receive treatment abroad regardless of waiting times in their own country. But patients will only be reimbursed up to the amount their treatment costs in their home country and they will probably still require some degree of approval from their own health system. Pollard says that while he doesn't foresee a boom in medical tourism within the EU, he believes the new legislation will encourage patients to seek treatment abroad and help create a European health care market.","Two to three million people travel abroad for medical treatment each year .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea Handler, the foul-mouthed, alcohol-swilling, cutting, irreverent and occasionally naked host of E!'s hit talk show ""Chelsea Lately,"" is taking her act and moving it to Netflix. Later this year and in 2015, she'll create some comedy and documentary specials and then in 2016 premiere another talk show. Chelsea Handler to host Netflix talk show . The last episode of ""Chelsea Lately"" will air on Tuesday night. In her seven-year run, Handler has made ""Lately"" the go-to place for fans wanting something a little tarter with their talk-show entertainment. Let Jimmy Fallon have the ""nice"" aura; Handler is just as soon exasperated with her show, her staff and even her guests as she is tickled. At this point, who knows what she'll bring to her Netflix program, which -- given the on-demand nature of the service -- will almost certainly have a different format. Nevertheless, there's plenty about ""Chelsea Lately"" we hope carries over to Handler's next talk-show chapter. Here are seven things we'll miss in the meantime: . 1. She regularly bit the hand that presented her. Handler laughed and made fun of the same things the rest of us joke about, even when those things -- the Kardashians, Ryan Seacrest -- happened to share a network with her. She didn't care, which was classic Chelsea. Of course, E! probably didn't mind either, because any publicity is good publicity -- even mockery of Seacrest's stature. 2. She was willing to make fun of herself, too. Handler has been notably open about her louche, if exaggerated, private life. And she encourages needles from guests as well as the comedians who join her for the roundtable to discuss the news. 3. Those strange shower sketches. It's hard to imagine David Letterman -- or even Stephen Colbert -- being willing to engage in argumentative sketches with the likes of Sandra Bullock and Conan O'Brien while standing naked in a shower. (Judging from the fuzzed-out naughty bits, there's a minimum of special effects involved. Incidentally, nice abs, Conan.) Seems like Handler would be a natural to mount a revival of ""Steambath."" 4. Honestly, Jennifer Aniston. On other talk shows, the former ""Friends"" star is like most other celebrities: sticking to the script (or the blue cards) and answering only what was discussed backstage with some assistant producer. But on ""Chelsea Lately,"" she lets down her hair (so to speak), probably because Handler is a friend outside of the studio. She's even gotten choked up! 5. Well, hello there, guest. One of Handler's long-running jokes is that she sleeps with almost all her guests, which in the case of 50 Cent probably actually happened. But she was happy to flirt with almost everybody, men and women alike. 6. International incidents! It wasn't enough that Handler insulted Lupita N'yongo during the Oscars this year. That was on her Twitter account, which (presumably) won't be going anywhere. But how many other talk show hosts would offend a whole country? Chances are that Serbia isn't going to mind Handler's departure from E!. 7. What about Chuy? Jesus Melgoza, aka Chuy Bravo, has been Handler's diminutive right hand for the run of the show. No word on whether he'll be joining her at Netflix -- TMZ says he isn't -- but in the meantime, fans will have to be satisfied with his recommendations on serving tacos, using Tinder and healthy living.

"Rome (CNN) -- Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman sentenced to death in Sudan because of her faith, arrived in Rome on Thursday, the Italian Foreign Ministry said. Ibrahim ""will remain in Italy for a short time and then will travel on to the United States,"" the ministry said. Sudanese authorities had said Ibrahim was guilty of rejecting Islam in favor of Christianity, but her conviction for ""apostasy"" and adultery was overturned last month on appeal, following weeks of international controversy. After her release, she and her husband, American Daniel Wani, were detained for two days, accused of falsifying travel documents after going to the airport in Sudan's capital, Khartoum. They were trying to fly to the United States with their baby daughter, who was born while Ibrahim was in prison, and toddler son. Now their dream of starting a new life in the United States appears to be on the verge of becoming reality. Not only that, but Ibrahim and her family met with Pope Francis at his private residence in Domus Santa Marta in Vatican City. During the meeting Thursday, which lasted about half an hour, Ibrahim thanked the Pope for his and the Roman Catholic Church's support and prayers, the Vatican said. He, in turn, thanked Ibrahim and her family for their ""courageous witness and constancy of faith."" Francis also played with the children, 18-month-old Martin and 2-month-old Maya, and greeted the Italian diplomats involved in her journey to Italy. With this gesture, the Vatican said, the Pope ""desired to show his closeness, attention and prayer also to all those who suffer for their faith, in particular to Christians who are enduring persecution or limitations imposed upon their religious freedom."" Ibrahim has said that her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, raised her as a Christian. She remained steadfast in her faith despite the threat of a death sentence, saying at her sentencing hearing in May: ""I am a Christian, and I will remain a Christian."" 'Day for celebration' Ibrahim and her family were earlier greeted at the airport in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. In a brief statement to reporters at the airport, Renzi said, ""Today we are very happy. ... Today is a day for celebration."" Speaking alongside him, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lapo Pistelli said Ibrahim and her children were well and in ""excellent condition."" He said Pope Francis had been informed Wednesday by the Prime Minister that the family was coming to Italy, and that the government had worked to bring about a meeting between them. ""Mariam and her two children will have important meetings in the following days and then they will travel to the United States."" How Italy helped . Pistelli said Italy had become involved in the case because, as a Catholic country, it was very moved by Ibrahim's story and wanted to help. Italy has good relations with Khartoum and offered to help the U.S. Embassy there to speed up the process of getting U.S. passports for Ibrahim and her family to leave the country, the minister said. Pistelli said he had traveled to Sudan two weeks ago to start the process but it was not finalized until Wednesday night. He posted an image to his Facebook page of himself with Ibrahim and the two children, apparently taken on board the plane shortly before their arrival in Rome. ""Mission accomplished,"" he wrote. Ibrahim, her husband and their two children are now in a protected government house, he said. It is unclear how long Ibrahim will stay in Rome before flying on to the United States, he said, adding that it had to do with passport procedures. CNN has not yet been able to reach the U.S. Embassy or the Sudanese Foreign Ministry for comment. Persecution claim . Ibrahim's ordeal began when one of her relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. She was also charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. She insists she has never been a Muslim -- and says she was persecuted as a Christian while in prison. Convicted when she was about eight months pregnant, she gave birth two weeks later while shackled. On Monday, a Sudanese Islamic jihadi group which has previously claimed an attack on a Sudanese journalist released a statement threatening Ibrahim. The group vowed to carry out what it said was the justified death sentence against Ibrahim that was repealed by a higher court. Amid this threatening environment, Daniel Wani told CNN that his family had reported seeing unknown people outside their old residence in Khartoum. Their numbers had been increasing over the past few days, he said. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Nima Elbagir from Khartoum, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Mariam Yehya Ibrahim and her family meet Pope Francis, thank him for his prayers .

"(CNN) -- Barbie boasts an extensive resume of more than 150 careers, from fashion model to nurse, astronaut, veterinarian, firefighter, aerobics instructor and rapper. Now, Barbie is leaning in with a 21st century gig as an entrepreneur. Entrepreneur Barbie is available in four ethnicities and carries the essentials of start-up life: a tablet, smartphone and briefcase. Mattel says it hopes to inspire a generation of female entrepreneurs with Entrepreneur Barbie, which went on sale Thursday on Amazon. She also comes with a marketing back story in which Mattel partnered with eight real-life female entrepreneurs to serve as ""chief inspiration officers."" ""Having positive role models for dolls that are inspiring young girls to be entrepreneurs is exactly what we need to inspire a generation of young women to start running businesses,"" Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code, said in an interview with TechCrunch. ""You can't be what you cannot see."" ""To me, Barbie has always been a way to live out each and every one of my dreams and that young women today have Barbie as a role model, an icon in the form of an entrepreneur is so exciting and the best form of inspiration,"" said Jennifer Fleiss, co-founder of Rent the Runway. In typical start-up style, Entrepreneur Barbie made her debut by hosting a Twitter #BarbieChat in which she invited her #CIOs to share stories of ""breaking glass (and plastic) ceilings."" While many participants in Wednesday's Twitter chat praised Barbie's latest career, Mattel faced familiar criticism for pink-washing the message. Entrepreneur Barbie comes wearing a fitted pink dress in her usual unrealistic proportions. ""If we're talking representation, let's take a step back. It is impossible to ever grow up and be Barbie. She's anatomically impossible (unless you get tons of plastic surgery and survive on light and air),"" writer Sarah Gray said in a Salon column. ""Entrepreneur Barbie is modern woman with her smartphone and her tablet stuck in a sexist, outdated, dangerous representation of femininity. I take umbrage with the fact that, even though this doll is backed by an awesome group of diverse women â€” aimed at providing positive representation â€” Barbie still represents this problematic view of women."" The backlash is nothing new. Barbie caused a stir in February when Mattel and Sports Illustrated revealed that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition. The partnership included a promotional cover-wrap on 1,000 copies declaring Barbie ""the doll that started it all,"" a four-page advertising feature inside the magazine and video outtakes posted online. The doll was also available for sale at Target. Mattel stood by Barbie's ""unapologetic"" stance, and continues to use the #unapologetic hashtag in its social media campaigns for Entrepreneur Barbie.

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government is scrambling to find ways to comply with President Obama's order to put more air marshals on flights after a botched Christmas Day airline terrorist attack, government sources have told CNN. Hundreds of additional marshals could be ""loaned"" from the Secret Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a U.S. official briefed on the investigation said. Another source said marshals could be drawn from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Additional federal air marshals are needed for high-priority international flights, with other law enforcement personnel filling in on key domestic flights, another source noted. There are already believed to be thousands of air marshals, though exact figures have not been made public. Interactive: Key dates linked to Nigerian terror suspect .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. flag that once flew over cleanup and recovery efforts at ground zero and was stolen from a Long Island home was finally returned to its rightful owner on Friday, reports CNN affiliate WPIX. Melissa Ielpi-Brengel, the sister of a firefighter killed on 9/11, woke up to discover the missing flag folded up and resting outside her home. The flag was also accompanied with a note simply stating, ""I am sorry, I had no idea,"" WPIX reported. The American flag was presented to Ielpi-Brengel in memory of her 29-year-old brother Jonathan Ielpi, a member of the New York City Fire Department who was killed in the September 11 terror attacks. ""We put the flag out certain times of the year just to remember,"" Ielpi-Brengel told WPIX. Ielpi-Brenge was distraught when she discovered the flag, which was mounted outside her home, had gone missing a few days before the Fourth of July. ""There are other flags out, and for whatever reason they came here and took ours,"" Ielpi-Brengel said to WPIX. ""Coming on to my property and taking something that means so much to me and to so many Americans."" The thought that someone would take something so symbolic of her brother's bravery left Ielpi-Brengel unsettled, so she turned to social media, pleading for users to help her spread the word about the missing flag. The stolen flag was more than just a memento to Ielpi-Brenge. It was given to her by the September 11th Families Association in honor of her brother's sacrifice. This isn't the first time the family has endured heartache over a 9/11 tribute. Back in July 2013, Ielpi-Brengel was offended after watching an episode of ""Princesses: Long Island,"" where one of the cast members acted imprudently around a 9/11 tribute statue of her brother. Thankfully, though, the flag was returned just in time for Fourth of July celebrations. Ielpi-Brengel took to Facebook to share the news with her friends and family. She wrote, ""Good news, our flag was returned this morning. It was outside the house when we woke up. Thank you all for spreading the word and help us get our flag back."" In another post, she went on to write that she is glad that whoever took the flag was able to do the right thing by returning it. ""I don't know who took it or why. I guess they had their reasons,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. ""I also hope it taught them a lesson and they don't try and pull something like this, with anyone, again.""

"(CNN) -- Nancy Curtis said she wanted proof her son, Peter Theo Curtis, was still alive after being held captive almost two years by Islamist rebels in Syria, she told ""ABC World News Tonight."" She said she insisted intermediaries ask what museum he wrote about in his doctoral dissertation. ""It came back the Western Museum and I thought, 'Yes, that's right. Nobody would know that. It's him, he's alive,' "" she said. Nancy Curtis said she knew exactly who to contact after confirming her son had been released. ""Before I even told my daughter I sat down and I sent an e-mail to Diane Foley,"" she said, referring to the mother of slain American journalist James Foley. ""We've been through so much together and I didn't want her to hear it from the media first."" Peter Theo Curtis, 45, is believed to have been captured in October 2012 and held by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with ties to al Qaeda. ""My heart is full at the extraordinary, dedicated, incredible people, too many to name individually, who have become my friends and have tirelessly helped us over these many months,"" his mother said earlier in the day in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""Please know that we will be eternally grateful."" The United Nations said Curtis was handed over to U.N. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, which is under Israeli government control, and was given a medical checkup. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis was safe, no longer in Syria and expected to be reunited with his family shortly. He was on his way to Tel Aviv, according to a senior administration official. Nancy Curtis spoke to her son briefly by phone Sunday. ""He sounded so happy and excited to be free,"" she said. He told her ""I can't believe they let me out."" His cousin Viva Hardigg said, ""We've heard that his health appears good. That was very encouraging."" The United States was not involved in negotiations for his release but was aware of private efforts to secure the release, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. It's not known whether any ransom was paid, the officials said. Curtis' release comes just five days after ISIS militants released a video of one of its militants beheading Foley. ""Particularly after a week marked by unspeakable tragedy, we are all relieved and grateful knowing that Theo Curtis is coming home after so much time held in the clutches of (al-Nusra Front),"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. When asked ealier in the day about the death of James Foley, Nancy Curtis began to weep. ""I feel so bad for their family. Diane (Foley's mother) has become a good friend of mine, and I'm just so heartbroken for their loss."" Author and journalist . CNN obtained two videos that appear to have been recorded during the late stages of Curtis' captivity. In one, a gun is pointed at his head, and Curtis speaks rapidly, as if under duress. He gives his name and the date and says he is a journalist from Boston. Curtis is an author and freelance reporter who writes under the name Theo Padnos. He contributed articles about the Middle East to various publications, including the New Republic, The Huffington Post and the London Review of Books. He has also published two books: ""My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun,"" a memoir about teaching literature to young offenders at a correctional facility in Vermont, and ""Undercover Muslim: A Journey into Yemen,"" which investigates Islamic extremism. He was born in Atlanta and graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont. Curtis holds a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in French and Arabic, according to a statement from his family. He also speaks German and Russian. ""Theo has a deep concern and regard for the people of Syria,"" his mother said, ""which is why he returned during the war. He wanted to help others and to give meaning and to bear witness to their struggles. ""I am very fortunate that I do not have to tell his whole story. He eventually will be able to do so himself."" President Barack Obama has been briefed on Curtis' release and ""shares in the joy and relief that we all feel now that Theo is out of Syria and safe,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. ""But we continue to hold in our thoughts and prayers the Americans who remain in captivity in Syria -- and we will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to see that the remaining American hostages are freed."" Former cellmate speaks . In August, CNN spoke to Curtis' former cellmate in Syria, Matthew Schrier. They were locked up together in six prisons before Schrier broke free by climbing through a window. ""I took apart the screen, pushed the sandbags aside, and I got stuck, around my waist, so I had to reach in. I unbuckled my pants, and as soon as I unbuckled my pants I shot right out,"" Schrier said. Curtis wasn't as lucky. He got stuck. Schrier said he tried to get Curtis out, but he simply didn't fit, and so Schrier left, promising to get help. ""It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,"" Schrier said. ""It's hard to move on, because he's still there. You know, it hasn't ended yet 100%,"" he said then. ""I'm not going to have closure until he's home."" Fears heightened for Western hostages .

"(CNN) -- Now you see it, now you don't. That's the logic behind the vanishing spray being used at this year's World Cup in Brazil. If you watched Thursday's opening Brazil-Croatia match, you may have seen it: Before a free kick in the first half, a referee pulled a spray can out of a holster and squirted a white line on the field. No, the World Cup refs aren't wannabe graffiti artists. For the first time, FIFA referees are using the special spray to paint a temporary white line 10 yards from the free kick spot, marking the safe area into which opposing players cannot encroach. The spray disappears after one minute. This, although somewhat awkward to watch, addresses a problem for referees and players alike: Although they're supposed to remain 10 yards away, opposing players have frequently crept closer to the free-kick taker in an effort to disrupt the kick, starting countless arguments about fairness. The vanishing spray, which was an immediate hit Thursday on Twitter, is the brainchild of Argentinian journalist and entrepreneur Pablo Silva. ""It started seven or eight years ago when I was playing in a championship played amongst former school members,"" Silva told Reuters. ""In the 88th minute, we were losing 1-0 and won a free kick on the edge of the area. When I took the kick, the wall (of opposing players) was three meters away. The referee didn't book anyone and didn't do anything. We lost the game and driving home later, with a mixture of anger and bitterness, I thought that we must invent something to stop this."" The spray is called 9:15 Fairplay, or 10 yards expressed in meters. It's already been used in games the past several years by Major League Soccer. ""We find the vanishing spray to be extremely useful and very effective in ensuring the defenders are 10 yards from the ball,"" said Paul Rejer, training and development manager for the Professional Referees Organization, which supplies officials for MLS. ""The spray makes it clear where the ball is to be placed and where the defenders have to stand. Since the use of spray we experience very few problems in achieving the ... (minimum) distance."" Rejer said the spray has been welcomed by officials and is no hassle for them to carry during games. If nothing else, Silva and his spray already have some high-profile supporters, including Portuguese soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. ""I think it's a great idea,"" he said in a testimonial on the 9:15 website. ""Use a spray to mark the distance between the barrier and the kicker can be a great help.""","For the first time, FIFA referees are using a special vanishing spray .

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry added another high-powered lawyer to his team fighting a felony indictment against him, but this addition is just as much about sending a message than winning the case. Mark Fabiani has deep ties to the Democratic Party and is best known for his legal and crisis communication expertise. He guided President Bill Clinton in his White House years and also ran Al Gore's communications team during his presidential run in 2000. As Fabiani signed on, Perry's defense filed papers in Travis County District Court requesting the indictment be dismissed, arguing the charges are based on ""unconstitutional"" statute. Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has been charged with coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. They involve his threat last year to veto funding for a program run by the district attorney in Austin, Rosemary Lehmberg. The Travis County Democrat had been charged with drunken driving and refused to resign. While Fabiani's ability to navigate crisis communications will be useful to the Republican politician, Perry's reputation is on the line as he is simultaneously laying the foundation for a possible second White House bid. Perry's team approached Fabiani about working on the case, and he accepted because ""this case raises very significant First Amendment issues,"" he told CNN. His hire is another attempt to show that even Democrats think the charges against Perry are ridiculous. ""I'm proud to join Governor Perry's outstanding team which has been assembled to fight back against this attack on the rule of law,"" Fabiani said in a statement. ""I am confident this prosecution will be revealed to be contrary to the law and wholly meritless."" Fabiani joined the who's who list of political legal defense. The Harvard-educated lawyer will be on the same team as Ben Ginsberg, a sharp departure from 14 years ago when the two were on opposite sides of the Florida presidential recount that sent George W. Bush to the White House. Ginsberg worked for Bush, and Fabiani for Gore, then the vice president. Leading Perry's defense is Tony Buzbee, a Texas trial lawyer whose bio is 25 paragraphs long and includes media references like this one: ""The New York Times stated it best when it described Buzbee like this: 'Mr. Buzbee is a big, mean, ambitious, tenacious, fire-breathing Texas trial lawyer. Really big. Poster boy big.'"" Perry has said he acted lawfully and indicated the charges were political. ""I refer to Travis County as the blueberry in the tomato soup if you know what I mean,"" Perry said in New Hampshire Friday, referring to the liberal-leaning political views in the Austin area, compared to other parts of the reliably red state.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City police didn't violate New Jersey state laws when they carried out surveillance programs of Muslim-owned business, mosques and university student groups, according to a Thursday statement from the New Jersey attorney general's office. The findings are the product of a three-month review meant to address concerns expressed by Muslim community leaders, who had instead called for a formal investigation. Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said law enforcement officials are expected to meet regularly with the NYPD ""to exchange information concerning counter-terrorism intelligence and operations,"" and establish more formal protocols for out-of-state policing. Chiesa's office said it will also establish a ""Muslim outreach committee in order to enhance communication and encourage a greater understanding regarding issues of importance to both law enforcement and the Muslim community."" A 60-page report obtained by The Associated Press showed NYPD maps of Newark, New Jersey, and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. There was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity. After the report was made public, Newark Mayor Corey Booker called for an investigation. ""The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report,"" Booker said, referring to a leaked internal New York police document. ""I strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism, but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line,"" he said. New York police spokesman Paul Browne said their Newark counterparts were ""briefed before and afterwards, and a Newark liaison officer accompanied NYPD personnel when they were in Newark.""

"(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Thursday in a pre-screening area at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, authorities said. Houston Police Department spokesman Kese Smith told reporters that the man had just come through the doors in Terminal B when he fired at least one shot into the ceiling. A Homeland Security Investigations agent was working in an office near the scene, came out and told the man to drop his weapon. The agent fired once at the suspect, who appeared to try to shoot himself at the same time. An autopsy will determine whose bullet killed the man, who has not been identified, police said. CNN affiliate KHOU reported the man walked into the terminal with a military-style, semiautomatic rifle and fired two shots into the ceiling. The station interviewed a woman who works at a McDonald's in the terminal. ""As soon as he walked in, he just automatically started shooting quickly,"" said the employee, who said her name is Kendra. ""And we hear two shots and we just automatically started running. We ran all the way to the back."" Rebecca McCormick, a CNN iReporter, was just getting off a plane when she saw people running towards her and shouting and screaming. She talked to Grant Huff of Charleston, South Carolina, who heard the shots. ""After the first two gunshots everyone stopped and kinda looked"" thinking it might be a fallen chair or something like that, he said. ""A TSA gentleman came out and said, 'Everybody get down.' We heard two more gunshots."" Everyone took off running, Huff said. As iReporter McCormick recounted her interview with Huff, an airport announcement could be heard asking people to stay where they were because everyone had to be interviewed before they could leave.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- At least 184 people died in last weekend's violent protests in China's far-west Xinjiang region, state-run media reported. Ethnic Uyghur women grab the arm of a policeman as they protest in Urumqi on July 7. That number raises the death toll from a previously reported 156. On Friday, about 3,000 Muslims attended a weekly prayer themed at ""peace and harmony"" at Id Kah Mosque in the city of Kashgar, according to Xinhua news agency. But five major mosques near the center of Sunday's violence in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, were closed Friday morning, Xinhua said. Some smaller mosques in the city were open. ""Mosques in some sensitive areas were closed at their imams' suggestion,"" an official in charge of religious affairs with the Xinjiang regional government said. ""Muslims normally perform rituals at home in time of plague or social unrest."" Friday is the main day of worship for Muslims. The violent demonstrations Sunday also left more than 1,000 injured in the capital, according to government figures. Heavily armed troops remain on the streets of Urumqi and curfews are in effect. The violence is a result of ethnic tensions between the Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of China's Han majority. Hundreds of Han Chinese were on the streets of Urumqi on Tuesday, holding sticks and pipes, and calling for severe punishment of the Uyghurs, who they say committed serious crimes. The Uyghurs say they have been victimized and many of those killed in the violence Sunday were Uyghurs. Uyghur religious leaders have condemned the violence, saying it is against the spirit of the Muslim faith and Uyghur tradition. More than 1,400 suspects have been detained, according to Chinese officials, who have vowed to deal harshly with those involved in Sunday's riot. See a map of Xinjiang . ""For those who brutally killed the other people in the riot, the government will execute them,"" Urumqi's Communist Party leader, Li Zhi, said Wednesday. China's chief police officer, Meng Jianzhu, said the main instigators ""should be punished with the utmost severity,"" while others who were ""provoked"" to take part in the riots ""should be given persuasion and education,"" according to Xinhua. Police have detained 15 suspects in connection with that incident, Xinhua reported. As a result of the violence, Chinese President Hu Jintao cut short his trip to Italy for the Group of Eight economic summit. China was invited to attend as one of the world's emerging economic powerhouses. There is speculation that Sunday's protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to ethnic violence in southern China. That violence took place late last month at a toy factory in Guangdong province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died.","3,000 Muslims attended a prayer themed at ""peace and harmony on Friday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British-led military operation meant to clear the Taliban from parts of Afghanistan has succeeded, UK officials said Monday. A file image shows a British Royal Marine sniper team on an operation in Afghanistan. NATO and its Afghan allies launched Operation Panther's Claw to flush the Taliban from parts of southern Helmand Province before Afghan presidential elections next month. Major fighting is mostly over, and the military will now focus on ""holding"" the areas that have been cleared of Taliban so they do not return, Lt. Gen. Simon Mayall said in a briefing. The operation's success will enable up to 80,000 people in Helmand to vote. ""Panther's Claw has been extremely successful,"" said Brigadier Tim Radford, the top British military commander for the operation. ""There will be many Taliban who will not be fighting any more."" He said the Taliban suffered ""significant casualties,"" but refused to say how many. Nine British troops were killed in action in the operation, he said, and there were three Afghan civilian casualties. Radford estimated that there were 450 to 500 Taliban fighters in the area at the time of the operation, which he called ""one of the biggest that has taken place."" The British gave several weeks' warning that they were planning to attack, he said, both to exert psychological pressure on the Taliban and to give civilians a chance to flee. As a result, ""quite a few Taliban managed to get away,"" Radford said. ""They will always get away and they will always come back in."" Mayall, the deputy chief of the British Defence Staff for Operations, said the challenge now was to convince local people that the Afghan government and its allies could protect them from the Taliban. The Taliban ""are going to assume that we are going to lose interest and move on,"" he said. But they are wrong, he said. NATO forces were going to ""stay in Afghanistan for a very long time,"" he said, adding that active NATO-led fighting should ""tail off"" as Afghan security forces develop the ability to fight the Taliban themselves. The counter-insurgency strategy of clearing and holding an area to allow for development of infrastructure and the rule of law echoes the coalition forces' plan in Iraq. Panther's Claw focused on the area around the town of Babaji in Helmand Province. The operation mirrored a similar operation by U.S. Marines in the area. At least 20 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan this month, sparking intense debate in Britain about the country's military role there. The British-led operation involved about 3,000 troops -- mostly from the British military but also with Afghan, Danish and Estonian forces, the British Ministry of Defence said in a written statement. The operation started in mid-June with an air assault along a canal about 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of the city of Lashkar Gah, the ministry said. British-led forces attacked from three different directions over the next three weeks, essentially creating a ""gated community"" where Taliban insurgents could not get in or out, Radford said. Major fighting ended July 20, he said.","Major fighting in Operation Panther's Claw over, British military says .

"(CNN) -- Some things are just better after dark. Just because the sun goes down doesn't mean you have to turn in, too. Swimming with manta rays in Hawaii . The waters off the Big Island of Hawaii's Kona Coast are known for their manta rays: majestic and curious sea creatures with wings that can span up to 20 feet. After sunset, many area dive companies run boat excursions for both snorkelers and certified divers to get within inches of anywhere from a few to more than a dozen of them. The water's not completely dark: once you reach your location, operators use either spotlights or equip you with an underwater flashlight to attract the harmless rays by drawing plankton to the area. The lighting adds to the experience -- illuminating the creatures as they gracefully sway, twist and dive in an extraordinary water ballet around you. Big Island Divers is one of many reputable companies running year-round night trips for ages 10 and older to both dive and/or snorkel with manta rays. ""All the boats have snorkel guides and large lighted surfboard floats that guests can hold on to,"" says Big Island Divers' Frank Hendriks. ""Our divers are also guided around the manta ray dive site with their own divemaster, to make sure they are having a great -- and safe -- time while being 30 feet underwater.""

Kayaking Puerto Rico's bioluminescent bay . Mosquito Bay off Puerto Rico's Vieques Island is renowned for its bioluminescence: waters that glow an electric blue and green -- a combination of environment and the tiny luminescent micro-organisms called dinoflagellates that live there. ""We have the brightest luminescent bay in the world,"" says Barbara Schneider of Abe's Snorkeling and Bio-Bay Tours. The Vieques-based company runs two-hour kayaking tours to experience this spectacular natural light display. There's an info session on the bay's unique ecology beforehand. Despite recent news reports about the bay's loss of bioluminescence, Schneider assures that it's nothing more than an unusual -- and temporary -- occurrence, and the water's have since returned to glowing ""really, really bright."" The best time to go is on a moonless night after an especially sunny day, since dinoflagellates collect sunlight during the day and then flash that light as a defense mechanism in the darkness.

You can wander the zoo's tropical rainforest setting spotting striped hyenas and sloth bears as you go. There are no cages or walls to deter your view (there are still barriers between you and the animals, they're just hidden), and the lighting is designed to resemble moonlight. According to Wildlife Reserves Singapore, this May the zoo marked its 20th anniversary with the introduction of two white lions and ""two new exhibits featuring Asiatic black bears and Malayan tigers -- the finale to the park's 35-minute tram experience.""

For nearly 30 years, Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay was home to one of America's most notorious security prisons. Approximately 1,500 criminals cycled through this federal penitentiary, including some of the most disruptive men of their time: gangster and crime boss Al Capone; Arthur ""Doc"" Barker, killed by Alcatraz prison guards during an escape attempt; and Robert ""Birdman"" Stroud, who spent the first six years of his 17-year sentence in solitary confinement. In fact, with its tiny bare bones cells, inhospitable grounds and a well-known reputation for housing the worst of the worst criminals (not to mention being a favorite subject of Hollywood directors), Alcatraz has achieved legendary status. A visit to the island is creepy in the afternoon, but touring the empty prison halls at night is bone-chilling. ""It's an intimate experience compared to daytime,"" says Alexandra Picavet, public affairs specialist for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Only 700 people are allowed on the island at night, compared to the approximately 5,000-6,000 people that come through each day. ""You also have access to areas -- such as the former hospital -- that are typical off limits,"" she says. The Alcatraz Night Tour takes place Thursday through Monday and includes an audio cell house tour, as well as a narrated boat tour around the island. Due its popularity the night tour is often sold out weeks in advance. Alcatraz Night Tour, Pier 33, Alcatraz Landing, San Francisco; +1 415 981 7625; $37 per person .

South Africa's night game drives offer the chance to experience wildlife viewing in a unique way. Kruger National Park's night game drives give the chance to spot the Big Five: lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard, rhino. Most safari companies use open-sided vehicles so there's nothing between you and the animals, getting you as close as possible to the action -- which may include a wandering pack of wild dogs, a whooping pair of hyena or a leopard on the prowl. There's no guarantee you'll see anything, but the suspense alone is worth it. Night Game Drives typically begin around 5-6 p.m. and last three hours.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Australian authorities most likely will announce the next search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on Thursday, a senior Malaysian official told CNN on condition of anonymity Wednesday. The search area will be ""refined,"" rather than brand new, and still will be in the southern Indian Ocean, where previous underwater explorations have failed to find the aircraft, the official said. Flight 370 disappeared over Southeast Asia on March 8, and searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people aboard, making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history. The flight had been scheduled to go from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. Officials with three nations deeply involved in the search -- Malaysia, China and Australia -- approved the next search zone, the senior Malaysian official said. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said this week that it's been re-examining data and that the review could shift the search area south of the previous zone. Searchers plotted initial search areas based in part on satellite data that they said indicated the plane flew to the southern Indian Ocean. Hopes of closure then were raised in early April, when a search team detected pings west of Australia that were initially thought to have come from the plane's flight data recorders. But Australian authorities said an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings yielded no wreckage and ruled the area out as the aircraft's final resting place. Last week, a group of independent experts -- using satellite data publicly released in May -- also said it thought the missing aircraft was in the south Indian Ocean, but approximately hundreds of miles southwest of the previous search site. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Search area will be refined rather than brand new, Malaysian official said .

"(CNN) -- Traveling the world playing professional tennis isn't as lucrative as it appears. If you're outside the top 100, the consensus is that making a profit is difficult. Russia's Dmitry Tursunov, currently ranked 30th, told CNN last year that he needed to pocket $200,000 a season just to break even. The players, then, will be happy to hear about another prize money boost at the U.S. Open. It seems that every grand slam nowadays increases the total on offer and the U.S. Open didn't buck the trend after announcing it will pay out a tournament record $3 million to singles winners in September at Flushing Meadows. Ten years ago, Roger Federer took home $1 million for beating Lleyton Hewitt in the men's final. Based on current conversion rates, the $3 million is slightly less than the Â£1.76 million ($3.01 million) dished out to the singles champions at Wimbledon last weekend. Wimbledon and the U.S. Open lead the way in prize money of the four majors. The U.S. Open is also handing out double-digit raises in each round of the singles, something lower-ranked players will be particularly pleased about. Overall, prize money climbs to a tournament record $38.3 million. ""Last year, to recognize the importance of the players and the key role they have in building our sport, the USTA shared our vision to reach $50 million in prize money at the U.S. Open by 2017,"" Dave Haggerty, the USTA's chairman of the board and president, said in a statement Wednesday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Fourteen Pakistani soldiers were killed when they fired a mortar to try and repel a group of militants but accidentally hit themselves, a government official said. The incident occurred when the soldiers were traveling in a convoy of three vehicles Monday night near the village of Akakhel in Khyber Agency, said Roshan Khan, a government official in the agency. Miltants fired on the convoy with machine guns and a soldier responded by firing a mortar. Somehow the mortar landed among the soldiers, killing them, Khan said. Khyber Agency, 24 kilometers (14 miles) west of Peshawar, is the capital of northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and is considered a hub for militants. Khyber Agency also is one of the main supply routes for the U.S.-led coalition forces operating in Afghanistan and militants frequently attack NATO supply trucks in the region.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian pro-government Basij militia members dispersed crowds of protesters here Thursday -- sometimes with force -- witnesses said. Protests by Iranians, such as this one on June 15, have been defended by the reformist figures. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people crowded the streets in different locations of the city, and headed toward Tehran University, the site of a student uprising in 1999. Several protesters were hit on the arms and backs by the Basij, pro-government militia members, while elsewhere riot police released tear gas into crowds. Iran's state-funded Press TV described the crowd size near the university in the hundreds. Some of the protesters shouted ""Allah u Akbar,"" or ""God is Great"" and ""Ya Hussein, Mir Hussein"" referring to opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, the witnesses said. Police blocked roads leading to Tehran University, while some protesters set trash cans afire so smoke would counter the effects of the tear gas. When crowds tried to gather between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Revolution Square, hundreds of security forces were waiting for them, witnesses told CNN.  Watch scenes of protesters and street clashes » . Most of the security forces were uniformed officers wearing helmets and holding batons and shields, though many wore plain clothes. The forces ordered bystanders to move along, the witnesses said. There were at least five reports of clashes during this time. Over the next two hours, the crowds grew to around 3,000, but witnesses said security forces grew too. Many of the protesters left Revolution Square and marched to side streets and neighborhoods a few kilometers away. Many held up victory signs and clapped. The contents of several Dumpsters were set afire. See the protests and violence through Iranians' own photos . Witnesses said they heard several pops that sounded like gunshots and saw security forces fire what appeared to be pepper spray towards the crowds on several occasions. Some of the chants heard Thursday were familiar refrains that have been repeated often in recent days: . ""Death to the Dictator!"" ""Death to Khamenei!"" But a new phrase entered the lexicon on Thursday that referred to Mojtaba, the son of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei: ""Mojtaba bemire, rahbariroh nagiri,"" they chanted: ""Die, Mojtaba, so you don't become the supreme leader!"" During the past week, rumors have surfaced that Mojtaba has taken over the pro-government Basij militia and that his father is grooming him to be the next supreme leader. Thursday marked the first time protesters chanted against him. By nightfall, most of the demonstrators headed home. At 10 p.m. Tehran time two sources told CNN the chants of ""God is great!"" were louder than usual in their neighborhoods. The demonstration took place on the 10th anniversary of a student uprising that posed a major threat to the Islamic regime. On Thursday, the protesters used the anniversary to resume demonstrations against the outcome of the contested June 12 presidential election. Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian said Iranians have been scared since last month's bloody crackdown on those who protested the accuracy of election results. Incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner by a landslide over reformist candidate Moussavi, his chief rival, who declared the election rigged. Moussavi's supporters took to the streets by the thousands in the aftermath of the vote until the protests turned bloody as security forces cracked down. Iranian state-run media said 20 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been detained. On July 9, 1999, known in the Iranian calendar as the 18th of Tir, 200 students protested the closing of a reformist newspaper, Salaam, which supported moderate President Mohammed Khatami. Hard-line activists entered dormitories in Tehran University, broke windows, set fires and attacked students. Six days of protests ensued. According to Human Rights Watch, more than 25,000 people participated, making the demonstrations the biggest threat to the Islamic regime since its inception in 1979.

"(CNN) -- James Traficant Jr., who railed against government agencies while serving as a wild-haired, maverick congressman from Ohio, died Saturday after being critically injured in a tractor accident on his farm. Traficant was 73. Family attorney Heidi Hanni told CNN that Traficant passed away at 11:30 a.m. He'd been riding a small 1943 tractor on Tuesday at his farm in Greenford, Ohio, when he lost control, causing the tractor to roll over him, local police said. He died at St. Elizabeth Health Center, the Youngstown Vindicator reported. Traficant was a Democrat who represented Ohio's 17th Congressional District from 1985 to 2002. With a penchant for colorful, sometimes crude language, Traficant made a name for himself in Washington long before being convicted on federal corruption charges, a courtroom defeat that led to his expulsion from Congress because of ethics violations tied to it. ""There are no ethics in politics,"" he declared at his ethics hearing. ""And there should be no ethics committee. It is dog eat dog. Castrate your opponent."" Such comments made him a favorite of reporters in Washington, where he was willing to offer his opinion on just about any topic. 'Beam me up!' He was equally famous in Washington for his hair. The Washington Post obit noted: ""Reporters outdid themselves in trying to describe Mr. Traficant's pompadour -- and to determine whether it was real. In the words of the Los Angeles Times, it was a 'Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet,' or as Washingtonian magazine put it, 'a creature from Lake Erie before it was cleaned up.'"" But it turned out Traficant wore a toupee. This was discovered in 2002 when he was booked into a jail in Akron, Ohio, before being sent to federal prison, and authorities searched for ""contraband or weapons,"" according to a CNN story. A jail official said it was a small hairpiece and didn't fully cover Traficant's head. Traficant made flamboyant and animated House speeches, which often ended with his trademark, ""Beam me up!"" A former football player at the University of Pittsburgh, Traficant went on to play the role of hometown hero after graduation, serving as a drug counselor and Mahoning County, Ohio, sheriff. While sheriff, Traficant was tried on bribery charges in 1983. Acting as his own lawyer, he persuaded a jury to acquit him, saying he was conducting his own sting operation. He was elected to Congress in 1984. In Washington, he barreled through the House in rumpled sports coats and loud shirts. Traficant fashioned himself as a maverick populist, spending much of his career railing against foreign aid and various government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the CIA. ""Lying, thieving, stealing nincompoops"" is how he once described the latter. Convicted of bribery charges . In April 2002, Traficant was convicted on 10 charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion. Although not a lawyer, Traficant again represented himself. He was expelled from the House later that year by a 420-1 vote, becoming only the second congressman expelled since the Civil War. He took up painting as a hobby while he served his sentence from 2002 to 2009. Months after his release from prison, Traficant filed for office as an independent but lost his bid to regain his old seat to sitting Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat. A few days before his expulsion from Congress, Traficant told CNN, ""I'm a son of a truck driver. Forget this Congress business, I'm a regular guy."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Outside the Dutch Embassy in Moscow, people have left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial for the lives lost in a conflict-scarred corner of eastern Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 fell from the sky in Donetsk on Thursday, killing all aboard. Of the 298 people killed, 193 -- nearly two-thirds -- were Dutch citizens. The United States accuses Moscow of supporting the pro-Russian rebels that it suspects shot down the aircraft. Russia denies involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Ukraine's military operation against the rebels is to blame for the tragedy. He has called for a ""thorough and objective"" investigation. With rebels in control of the crash area, and reports of bodies and wreckage being tampered with, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters he had a ""very intense"" conversation with Putin on Saturday. Rutte said he told Putin ""the opportunity expires to show the world that he is serious about helping."" The tributes at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow include a hand-drawn picture of a plane broken in midair with the caption ""children should not die,"" in a child's handwriting. Another message reads: ""We are afraid, we are ashamed, we are in mourning."" While the official Russian position is that Russia played no role and has no responsibility for the crash, what's striking in many of the notes is the use of the phrase ""forgive us."" The messages give a sense that the people who have left them do feel that Russia has an element of responsibility in what is playing out in eastern Ukraine. One note reads, in English, ""Excuse us, please, if you can. Sorry! Russia, Moscow."" Paying his condolences at the embassy, Muscovite Yuri Yemshanov told CNN it was ""difficult to recognize that our country could be involved in this accident."" ""I think there's lot of proof that we're in closer relations and connections with the separatists in Ukraine. I suppose it's clearly understood that we support them by providing weapons, and so I think it doesn't matter who launched that rocket. Just because we're supporting terrorists, we're involved."" His wife, Marina, added: ""I think there should be investigation, but of course many things are understood now and we probably could know who did this. Now I think it's time to say I'm sorry for these people. This is the first thing."" Another woman, who gave her name as Olga, said that she was sure Russia was not involved in the tragedy and that an investigation would establish who was, but she added: ""However, I would also say 'forgive me.' I'm feeling the same."" Arnold van Sinderen, a Dutch citizen living in Moscow, told CNN he believed that the West painted the wrong image of Putin, but that all the same, the Russian leader needed to step up. ""It's time to take responsibilities there and bring peace in this region. He should take his responsibility as well with what is happening with the plane crash; this might accelerate the situation."" Meantime, the tributes outside the embassy pile up.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- For many Americans, the scariest phrase in the English language is ""changing demographics."" It's never easy to adjust to change -- especially when the thing that is changing is nothing less than the complexion of the country. America is being transformed before our eyes. In the early years of the 21st century, many white Americans are trembling at the thought that -- within three decades -- they'll be the minority in the United States. The demographic ""doomsday"" is about 2043, according to the most recent projections. If you're the kind of person who stays up at night worrying about such things -- either because you fear that you will be marginalized in the future, or because you're feeling a little guilty over how African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans have been treated and you're hoping they're not holding any grudges -- living in America at this moment means having to endure one terrifying story after another. In 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that -- because of immigration, and high birthrates among Latinos and Asian-Americans -- whites had become a minority among babies. In 2013, the headline was that, for the first time, racial and ethnic minorities made up about half of Americans under the age of 5. Now comes this bit of news, which is likely to send more Americans scrambling for their blood pressure medicine. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, starting this fall, U.S. public schools are projected, for the first time, to have more minority students than whites. At 49.8 percent, whites are still expected to be the largest racial group in the public schools. Yet, minority students will now make up the majority. And about one in four of those minority students will be Latino. This turnaround has already occurred in some states, most notably Texas and California. And now it's about to happen on a national scale. The economic, political and social implications of this demographic sea change will extend far and wide. For one thing, the immigration debate will continue to erupt periodically, every few years. After all, what drives much of that discussion isn't concerns about border security or the rule of law. That's just the window dressing. The real fuel is nativist anxiety over the ethnic transformation of our neighborhoods, towns and cities. We'll also keep fighting about language and culture, as one way of life yields to another. In addition, there will be greater expectations on Latinos in particular -- who now comprise 17% of the U.S. population and who, by 2043, are expected to account for as much as 25% -- to convert those population figures into something more tangible, such as political power. Already, many political observers wonder why one hasn't led to the other. As the numbers increase, that curiosity will become more intense. Specific to what will be happening in the schools, we can also expect greater demand for bilingual teachers and more resistance from older taxpayers to having to approve additional property tax bonds to pay for what will be a necessary expansion of school facilities in the years to come. That is awfully shortsighted given that the elderly rely on younger workers to pay for their Medicare and Social Security. It may surprise you to hear it, but I cringe every time I see one of these stories about changing demographics, if it doesn't come with the proper context. They get people all wound up for no reason, and needlessly pit groups of Americans against one another. They give Latinos, African-Americans and Asian a sense of false hope that, just around the corner, respect and power are on the way and life is about to get better. And they scare the dickens out of whites who, sensing that a storm is on the way, inevitably try to batten down the hatches by passing more restrictive laws. Good luck with that. There's not much any of us can do to stop these changes from happening. But there is no reason to fear them either. Immigrants change America, but America returns the favor and changes them right back. For instance, English is the dominant language in the United States, and so many immigrants will wind up speaking English within a matter of months or years. Their children will speak English as their primary language, as the immigrant's native language fades away. Where some Americans look at changing population figures and see calamity, I only see opportunity. This country continues to draw to its shores the determined and the daring, who come here -- to the land of second chances -- to reinvent themselves and, in the process, wind up remaking and revitalizing the country. That's not a threat to America. Quite the contrary. It's the very essence of America. Bring on the change.

"(CNN) -- Hari and Karl Berzins decided to build a tiny home for their family in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains to free themselves of the financial burden of owning a large home. They knew that moving two children, a dog and a cat into a 168-square foot space would be a challenge, though it would also eliminate the need for a mortgage and cut their utility costs. But they didn't expect it to completely change their lives, Hari Berzins said. The savings allowed the 39-year-old mother to scale back her hours working for a nonprofit and spend more time on the family's 3-acre hillside property in Floyd, Virginia, she said. She now has more time to pursue her passion for writing, gardening, raising chickens and, most importantly, to enjoy her kids. Her husband, a chef, was able to leave a stressful restaurant and take a pay cut to work in a more creative environment. iReporters share stories of living in small spaces . The perks go beyond saving money or having a smaller environmental footprint, though both are huge benefits, Hari Berzins said. There's also the intangible delight derived from cooking in a kitchen where everything is within arms' reach, or eating off the beautiful china set that was locked in a cabinet when they lived in a 1,500-square foot home, she said. ""Living mortgage-free has given us the freedom to make decisions based on what will make us happy, not what we have to do to pay the mortgage,"" Berzins said in a CNN iReport. ""The things we have are beautiful, enriching our tiny space. We got rid of so much and kept the beautiful things,"" she said. ""Freeing ourselves from consumer debt and living mortgage-free has cleared the clutter to help us see what is truly important: our relationships, our happiness, each moment."" The Berzins are part of a small contingent of homeowners who have found solace living in less than 500 square feet. Many of them live in homes built on trailers so they can move around; others, like the Berzins, live on property they own. Others live in Cob homes built of clay and mica. Some are motivated by a desire to lessen their carbon footprint while others want to own a home without worrying about property taxes. Small homes aren't for everybody, but those who embrace the lifestyle tend to become their most enthusiastic boosters. Most of the iReporters who shared their stories of living small with CNN.com also build tiny homes or run businesses dedicated to helping others build their own. The small home movement has been around for years in small cities and rural areas, but this summer, it made a big incursion into one of the country's largest and most densely populated urban centers. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in July announced a pilot program to develop a new housing model for the city's growing small-household population. The program, adAPT NYC, seeks to accommodate the need for smaller apartments for roughly 1.8 million households in New York that consist of one or two people. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development kicked off the program in July with a request for proposals from designers and development teams for self-contained ""micro-units"" between 275 and 300 square feet, including kitchen and bathroom. The contest closed last week, drawing 33 submissions mostly from teams in the Northeastern United States, along with international entries from London and Amsterdam. The proposals suggest the use of modular design and some include sustainable design such as solar paneling, the housing department said Thursday. The winning proposal will form the basis for a mixed-income rental building in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan consisting of micro-units. The winning applicant will be responsible for designing, constructing, owning and managing the property as part of the housing department's model for developing city-owned property. The housing department said it hopes to announce a winner in 2013 and break ground by year's end. Of course, many New Yorkers already live in micro-sized units or smaller. For iReporter Kristen Booth, living in her 214-square foot East Village studio is a rite of passage for living in New York. But after 13 years in the same small apartment, she's ready for an upgrade and a bathtub. Most of the city's small apartments are in old buildings and there aren't enough of them. New York has 1.8 million one- and two-person households, but only 1 million studios or one-bedrooms, the housing department said. The city wants to build more that ""have substantial access to light and air to create a sense of openness,"" the housing department said. Clearly, renting a micro-unit in New York and building your own home in the country are two different animals. But there is some overlap between micro-units and tiny homes and the people who live in them. Building codes and ordinances complicate matters and can prevent residents from living in the units full-time. New York City's housing codes currently do not allow an entire building of micro-units, a housing department spokesman said. Under the pilot program, Bloomberg will waive certain zoning regulations at a city-owned site to test the market for this new housing model. In Point Roberts, Washington, iReporter Jamie Dehner was surprised to learn that while there are no limits on how big you build a home, the same isn't true for building small. To get around Whatcom County regulations requiring a permit to build their 160-square-foot home with plumbing, the Dehners built their home on a trailer bed, subject to different regulations as a recreational vehicle. The Dehners stayed there while working on a bigger home on their property, which is nearly done, she said. At 700 square feet, it seems like a mansion. But they enjoyed their time in the smaller dwelling for a variety of reasons. ""A small space is easy to clean, heat and there's a wonderful coziness about it. You are all tucked in with the things you need and use the most and that's appealing psychologically,"" Dehner said in an iReport. ""It's a fantastically liberating experience to live in a small space that is also hugely fun and entertaining, not just for you as the builder and occupant, but for others who pass by and just want to peek inside. And whether you stay in a tiny house permanently or end up building, you've got a perfect guest cottage that you can share with friends, family, sell or rent out."" While the amount of savings can differ greatly for a renter of a micro-unit versus a small-home owner, cost-effectiveness is definitely part of the equation in both models. The average rent for a regular studio apartment in Kips Bay is roughly $2,000, according to the housing department. The department hopes to see proposals with rents well below that, though it has not set price or rental rate criteria as part of the competition. iReporter Carrie Caverly and Shane Caverly rent the land on which they keep their 204-square-foot home, which they designed and built mostly from off-the-shelf building materials. The design allows for passive solar heating in the winter, has a metal roof for rainwater collection and uses an incinerating toilet to minimize water usage and avoid the need for sewage disposal, said Carrie Caverly, an architectural designer. In total, their monthly expenses are around $300 and they own the home outright without having incurred any debt, she said in an iReport. Many of the advantages of living in a small space were planned and expected, she said. But the couple is also enjoying unexpected advantages, like a connection to their community. ""When humans can do everything in the sheltered enclaves of our homes, we rarely venture out; we become isolated. Our small home encourages us to go outside and talk to the neighbors, go on hikes and meet people, go to coffee shops and restaurants, the library, the gym etc., etc. The list goes on,"" Caverly said in an iReport. Downsizing has also produced benefits, she said. ""I have been inspired to finally be tidy and clean; always putting everything away in its designed location. This creates a sense of spaciousness and sanity I've never had before in a home,"" she said. Would you consider living in a tiny home to downsize and save money?

"(CNN) -- Indian Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi ""will be welcomed"" to the United States, the White House said on Friday. Spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama ""does plan to reach out"" to him soon. In a statement, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Modi would get a visa to the United States once he takes office and forms a government. Modi was denied one several years ago. Now, however, Modi would be eligible for an A1 visa, said Psaki. Heads of government use such visas to travel to the United States. ""We congratulate Narendra Modi and the BJP on its victory in winning a majority of seats in India's historic national election, which saw more voters cast their ballots freely and fairly than in any election in human history,"" Psaki's statement said. ""Secretary Kerry has also offered his congratulations, and looks forward to working with the BJP on expanding our shared prosperity and security."" Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have captured a landslide victory and he will likely become prime minister. ""Once a new Government is formed, we look forward to working closely with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to advance our strong bilateral partnership,"" the State Department statement said. In 2005, the United States denied Modi a visa because of his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence three years earlier in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. A Supreme Court-ordered investigation in India absolved him of blame last year. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this story.","White House says President Obama will reach out to Indian PM-elect Modi soon .

"(CNN) -- The death toll in the Bangladesh building collapse two weeks ago now stands at 823, an army spokesman said Wednesday, according to the state news agency. Rescue workers managed to save more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the April 24 collapse, but their work for the past week has focused on using heavy machinery to uncover the remaining bodies buried inside the ruins. The news agency also reported that two volunteer rescuers have been killed during the rescue and salvage operation. The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in, burying hundreds of people in a heap of mangled concrete in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. It is the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster.","The death toll in the Bangladesh building collapse two weeks ago now stands at 823 .

"(CNN) -- Autopsy results indicate two American security officers found dead on the container ship Maersk Alabama last week died of respiratory failure, coupled with a suspected heart attack, police in the Seychelles said Tuesday. Further forensic analysis will be carried out to establish if the two men, Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, had consumed a substance that may have brought on these events, a police statement said. Traces of narcotics were found with the bodies of the officers, it said. ""The police preliminary investigation report includes suspicion of drug use, as indicated by the presence of a syringe and traces of heroin which were found in the cabin,"" the statement said. The two men, both 44, worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off East Africa in 2009 -- an incident that inspired the 2013 film ""Captain Phillips."" The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said last week that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. ""Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,"" Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore leave policy was under review. Police said the ship arrived on February 16 in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave two days later. The bodies were found last Tuesday by a colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin, Seychelles police said. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria.","Autopsy reports on two U.S. security officers indicate they died of respiratory failure .

"(CNN) -- The World Cup is upon us, and for the next month, there will be a significant uptick in the number of folks skipping work, watching games in the break room and wildly mispronouncing Eastern European surnames. Want to get in on the fun surrounding this quadrennial event that stokes the intensest of passions while doing considerable damage to some countries' gross domestic products for the month? Here are some fun facts to get you started: . Let the games begin . The host country, Brazil, will kick off the action against Croatia at 4 p.m. ET Thursday in Sao Paulo. The Brazilian squad is a heavy favorite, but Croatia is no slouch, boasting several stars who play in Europe's top leagues. Keep an eye on one of them just before kickoff: forward Eduardo da Silva. Born in the slums outside Rio de Janeiro, he now plays for the Croatian national team, and his mother reportedly says he intends to sing both countries' national anthems. 64 games, like March Madness, but not . There is only one game on the first day of the Cup, but between Thursday and June 26, all 32 teams who qualified will play three games each in what is known as the group stage. Garnering three points for every win and a point for every tie, the teams will be whittled down to the best 16 -- two from each of the eight groups. They will then face off in a do-or-die knockout round beginning June 28. Your March Madness bracket? Yeah, it will look like that, but with a quarter of the teams. The final is July 13. Only world war can stop it . The World Cup has been held every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946, when it was canceled because of World War II. This will be the 20th World Cup. It's the eighth time it's been held in South or North America and the second time in Brazil, the first one being 64 years ago. Only South American teams have won World Cups held in the New World, and the last South American World Cup was won by Argentina on home soil in 1978. Speaking of winners . There isn't much parity to the World Cup. In fact, only eight teams have won it. England, France and defending champion Spain have won it once each. Argentina and Uruguay have won it twice. West Germany has held the trophy aloft three times, Italy has claimed victory four times and Brazil has won it five times. Hmm. Why on Earth do the Brazilians need home-field advantage again? It's not all fun and games . Allegations of corruption within world soccer's governing body, FIFA, and class warfare within the host nation are casting a pall over the Cup, though don't expect it to dampen fans' fervor once the teams take the pitch. Specifically, a key sponsor, Sony, is demanding an investigation into the controversial award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, and in Brazil, protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament rather than using it to alleviate poverty.","Croatia's Brazilian-born Eduardo da Silva reportedly will sing both national anthems .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray started the 2014 season off slowly, which might have been predicted given he had back surgery last fall. He picked up his game at the French Open only to suffer a bewildering loss to Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon as the defending champion. Things almost got worse for Murray on the opening day of the U.S. Open, as he suffered from cramps throughout his body before seeing off Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 on Monday. Despite Murray being in distress, Haase couldn't serve out the fourth set and also squandered a break chance in the final game when he netted a fairly routine forehand volley. For much of the last two sets, Murray struggled with his movement, didn't get pace on his serve and clutched at his body. Haase was ""incapable of taking his opportunity,"" Boris Becker, the coach of world No. 1 Novak Djokovic who was analyzing the match for Sky Sports, said. ""Murray was presented to Haase on a silver platter in that fourth set but Robin didn't like it."" Murray, known for his endurance, said he began to cramp after an hour and 45 minutes. That wasn't ""normal,"" he added. ""And then I didn't really know what to do in that third set, because my quads were cramping and then I started to get it in my lats so when I was throwing the ball up to serve, and then in my forearms,"" Murray told Sky. ""I didn't know whether to conserve energy or to try and finish it in three sets, but then I got broken at the beginning of the set. I just tried to hang around. I was trying to play without using my legs much."" Murray -- taken to five sets by Haase in New York in 2011 -- was also left wondering why his body let him down. ""I need to work out why that happened today because it shouldn't happen after an hour and 45 minutes regardless of the temperature,"" he said. ""It was hot but it wasn't particularly humid and we didn't play loads of long rallies in the first couple of sets, either."" If it was only down to cramps, Murray could very well make a complete recovery and the 2012 champion caught a break in the draw because his next opponent is Matthias Bachinger, not tricky Czech Radek Stepanek. Bachinger upset Stepanek in straight sets. In the women's draw, second-seed and French Open finalist Simona Halep survived a scare, too, eventually overcoming inexperienced American Danielle Rose Collins 6-7 6-1 6-2. There were victories for fourth-seed Agnieszka Radwanska, sixth-seed Angelique Kerber and 19th-seed Venus Williams. Williams, 34, beat the nearly 44-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm 2-6 6-3 6-3.","Andy Murray begins his U.S. Open by toiling past Robin Haase in four sets .

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Soft music filled the room as waiters served white wine and hors d'oeuvres. Two dozen well-dressed women chatted in small groups. Mary Johnson, 56, who lost most of her lashes during chemotherapy, was excited to give Latisse a try. But, this was no ordinary cocktail party. The setting was the lobby of the OH2 Medical Spa in Alpharetta, Georgia. The women were on hand to take part in a new beauty treatment hitting the United States: the promise of better looking eyelashes through a prescription drug called Latisse. ""It's the latest, the greatest,"" exclaimed the party hostess, Christine Glavine, wife of Major League Baseball pitcher Tom Glavine. She invited a group of friends to meet with local plastic surgeon Dr. Randy Rudderman to get a dose of the new FDA-approved medication. Glavine didn't have to do much convincing. Tammie Wilson, 43, of Roswell, Georgia, said she was motivated to try the product because ""I want to be able to look like I have on makeup when I don't.""  Watch more on the marketing of Latisse » . ""I have blond hair and blond lashes. I have to put on three coats of mascara,"" complained her friend Jennifer Altmeyer, also 43 and from Roswell. Altmeyer, who is hoping to be able to skip mascara altogether, was the first to line up at Rudderman's exam room. The drug is available only through a doctor; it is approved to treat hair loss on the lash line. The product maker, Allergan, says Latisse will thicken, darken and lengthen inadequate or skimpy eyelashes in as little as eight weeks. But, here's the catch: Doctors report it takes up to 16 weeks to see maximum eyelash growth. If you discontinue Latisse, your lashes will go back to their original state in a few months. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . Oh, and by the way, the drug isn't cheap. It costs about $120 for a 30-day supply. Latisse was discovered almost by accident, Rudderman said. The product contains a compound that is also found in medication that decreases eye pressure in glaucoma patients. ""A significant number of those patients started having a side effect of increased growth of eyelashes,"" said Rudderman. Women like Altmeyer are clamoring to give Latisse a try. Rudderman's assistant first removed Altmeyer's eye makeup and then applied a drop of Latisse to a small applicator. The wand was then swiped across her top lashes. Rudderman advised Altmeyer to apply the drug once a day before she goes to bed and not to apply Latisse to lower lashes because they come in contact with the medicine on the top lashes during blinks. Rudderman said Latisse comes with several warnings: It is approved only for those over 18 and is not recommended for pregnant women, people with pre-existing eye conditions or those with allergies to the ingredients. Rudderman said some of the most common side effects are itchy and red eyes and hyper-pigmentation, or darkening along the eyelash base. Dr. Pradeep Sinha, a plastic surgeon in Atlanta, Georgia, started working with the glaucoma version of the medication two years ago on an off-label -- or trial -- basis, before it was approved specifically for eyelash thickening. While he said his patients were happy with the results, Sinha noted another unpleasant side effect if the user is not careful while wielding the applicator. ""One patient was messy and grew small, fuzzy hair on her eyelid,"" Sinha said. He instructed the woman to stop using the product, and the unwanted hair eventually fell out. Some women, like Mary Johnson, a 56-year-old breast cancer survivor, are willing to take their chances. After undergoing chemotherapy last year she lost a lot of eyelashes. ""That was really devastating for me,"" she said. She said she could put a wig on her head, but for the rest of her face she had to ""fake it"" by drawing in a lash line and eyebrows with cosmetics. Johnson tried some over-the-counter lash products, but she said none of them worked. She was smiling as she received her first dose of Latisse from Rudderman. ""Until you have lost your eyelashes, you don't really realize how hard it is to put eye makeup on,"" she said. ""When you lose your eyelashes you just don't look the same.""","Newly FDA-approved Latisse promises to thicken, darken and lengthen lashes .

"(CNN) -- Feeling besieged by pesky little problems today? You might want to be careful with your Google searches. Users who look up the term ""Zerg rush"" Friday are finding the latest in a series of geeky Easter eggs planted by the search giant's engineers. The search produces a swarm of marauding ""O's"" which inevitably destroy virtually everything on the search-results page. The term quickly became a top search topic for Google Friday morning, as gamers and the merely curious flocked to the feature. In gaming terms, a ""Zerg rush"" is when a player is swarmed by a huge number of weak opponents. Any one of the bad guys is easy to take out, but the threat is that they'll overwhelm you with sheer numbers. It came from ""Starcraft,"" a 1998 real-time strategy game in which a player could choose to play as ""Zergs,"" an alien race. Skilled players soon learned that they could quickly spawn a massive number of low-level units (""zerglings"") and overwhelm their opponents. According to Know Your Meme, the first instance of the term came during a game among some Korean players (a significant portion of the early ""Starcraft"" player base). The first Urban Dictionary definition of the term appeared in 2004. Since then, the use has expanded. In some multi-player games, ""zerging"" has come to refer to a gamer who, often against the game's rules, creates multiple accounts to get an unfair advantage over other players. It has come to be used in some circles as slang for any situation in which someone is overwhelmed by superior numbers. In the Google search, the ""O's"" from the Google logo turn into ""attackers"" which multiply and begin banging themselves against text on the page. Users can click to ""kill"" them, but will eventually fall to the rush. After they take out your results, the O's band together to spell out ""GG"" -- gaming slang for ""good game."" If a player does well enough, they can post their score to Google+. Google, which famously encourages employees to take on sometimes-silly side projects in the course of their work weeks, has long been known for implementing winks and nods into their products. Most notably, ""Google Doodles"" transform the search page's iconic logo into other (sometimes animated) images to celebrate special days. It's hard to know when these ""eggs"" get planted at Google headquarters. But in recent months, more and more have been discovered. Currently, Googling ""askew"" or ""tilt"" will knock the search-results page slightly off-kilter and ""do a barrel roll"" will make the results page ... well ... do a barrel roll. Meanwhile, a search for ""chuck norris google"" renders this entry in the litany of one-liners about the action star: ""Google won't search for Chuck Norris because it knows you don't find Chuck Norris, he finds you.""","A Google search for ""Zerg rush"" spawns an attack of ""O's"" on the results page .

"New York (CNN) -- A caretaker who allegedly inflicted ""unimaginable pain"" in the final weeks of a 4-year-old boy's life has been indicted on a murder charge in his death, prosecutors said Thursday. The second-degree murder indictment against Kryzie King, 27, comes five months after she allegedly beat and tortured little Myls Dobson while the boy was in her care in a Manhattan apartment, prosecutors said. She pleaded not guilty during an arraignment Thursday, according to District Attorney Cyrus Vance. The murder charge was added after the medical examiner's office concluded in April that Myls died from ""child abuse syndrome including dehydration,"" said Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office. The manner of death was homicide. ""Myls Dobson was forced to suffer unimaginable pain in the last weeks of his short life,"" Vance said in a statement. Bryan Konoski, King's attorney, did not return a call seeking comment. According to the indictment, King ""repeatedly assaulted (Dobson), including binding his hands and feet, striking him with an electrical cord and belt buckle, locking him outside on a patio in record low temperatures, and burning him with a hot oven rack."" Myls died January 8 after his father, Okee Wade, left the boy in King's care before Wade went to jail in connection with a fraud case, police said. King told investigators she starved, beat and burned the boy before his death, according to a criminal complaint. On the day Myls died, King called 911 after allegedly assaulting him. When police arrived, they found Myls unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of a bathroom at King's apartment at the Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Myls was later pronounced dead at St. Luke's Hospital. In January, Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the court that Myls was a happy, healthy, well-nourished little boy when he arrived at King's home in mid-December 2013. But when police found Myls in her apartment, the prosecutor said, his body was burned, bruised and cut from head to toe. In addition to second-degree murder, King is also charged with assault in the first degree, attempted assault in the first degree and assault in the second degree. King was remanded until her next court hearing scheduled for September 17. A review of the case later found that New York City child welfare caseworkers visited the boy's home nine times without even realizing that his father was in jail, city officials said. Wade, 37, who has an extensive criminal record, was awarded custody of his son in August 2012 on the condition that the city's Administration for Children's Services check up on the child for a year and contact the father's parole officer. Caseworkers, however, never consulted the parole officer and never learned that Wade was jailed during their visits to the Brooklyn apartment where he was staying with his son, according to a review of the case ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio. His partner at the time told caseworkers that he was working. At the time, Myls was staying with King. De Blasio ordered a review of all cases involving court-ordered supervision at the agency and said custodians must now get a family court judge's approval before supervision ends.","Kryzie King, 27, pleads not guilty to second-degree murder charge, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- Deep red roses, waxy white lilies and bright, cheery sunflowers; as single blooms and in large bouquets, they pile up close to desk 29 at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Twenty-four hours ago this was where Malaysia Airlines' Flight MH17 passengers checked in before boarding their ill-fated plane; bound for Kuala Lumpur, their journey would end far too soon, in a Ukrainian field close to the border with Russia. On Thursday, Suzan De Wit was chatting to many of those fliers. A customs officer at the airport, she helped them claim back their VAT (sales tax) before leaving the country. A day later, a crying De Wit was among those leaving floral tributes to the dead, still stunned by the tragedy that had unfolded. ""We saw a lot of the people that are on the plane and it's just really weird to me to imagine that they are gone,"" she explained tearfully. Like De Wit, many of the others bringing flowers had little connection to those on the plane. Here to catch flights of their own, they dash inside, stopping at the airport florist -- more used to creating ""welcome home"" bouquets than funereal arrangements -- before walking back out onto the sidewalk to lay their offerings on the concrete. Outside the terminal, there are plenty of signs that this is no ordinary day at Schiphol, one of the world's busiest airports: The growing pile of flowers, the condolence book rapidly filling with messages of grief and support and, across the road, past the lines of cars pulling up to drop travelers off, huge numbers of film crews from across the world. But step inside the building, and it is business as usual: passengers looking forward to long-awaited holidays or arriving in the city for business meetings wheel suitcases across the concourse, shops and cafes are busy, and flights take off and land as usual. This extreme normality caused difficulties for at least one man, distressed and desperate to find out what had happened to his business partner, who he feared was on Flight MH17, and who was not answering his increasingly frantic calls. With no signs offering advice to those trying to check up on possible passengers, he was left wandering the airport, shuttling from one information desk to another, clutching one mobile phone to his ear and another in his hand as he tried to reach someone, anyone, who could tell him if his friend was on board. Sadly, there was to be no good news; after one call, crying ""I knew it, I knew he was on the plane!"" he hurried away. Many of the relatives of those on the plane are being cared for at a local hotel while they work out what to do next. The airline has offered them $5,000 compensation to cover their immediate expenses, and has said it will try and find a way of getting them to the crash site if they want to see it. It says visiting the site where a plane came down has proved helpful to relatives in some previous cases, but the location of MH17's final resting place -- in the middle of a conflict zone -- makes this problematic, to say the least. As the arguments and investigations over what brought down the plane go on, elsewhere in the Netherlands, other makeshift shrines are popping up. In the North Holland fishing village of Volendam, bouquets have been laid outside a flower shop owned by Neeltje Tol, who is believed to have been on the downed plane. Tol's boyfriend, Cor Schilder, apparently posted a jokey picture of the Malaysia Airlines plane on Facebook shortly before take-off: ""In case it goes missing, this is what the plane looks like."" On Friday, stunned customers and friends stopped by to sign a book of condolence and pay tribute to the florist; one weeping woman, a regular visitor to the store, said Tol was ""a very nice girl"" who would be sadly missed. As word spreads of those caught up in the tragedy, the number of mourners is only likely to increase in the coming days. CNN Flight 17 full coverage .

"(CNN) -- Surprise, mobility and the merciless treatment of opponents: the blueprint of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq as it has gobbled up territory in both Syria and Iraq over the past few months. But as its adversaries regroup, ISIS -- which now calls itself the Islamic State -- may begin to suffer setbacks on the battlefield, according to a new analysis of its capabilities and tactics. ""As a defensive force, the ISIS may struggle to hold terrain if it is attacked simultaneously at multiple points or if its auxiliary allies begin to defect,"" says Michael Knights, who has worked throughout Iraq and is now a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Knights says ISIS has a deep bench of talented military planners, veterans of the Iraq insurgency during the U.S. occupation and of the group's creation of a mini-state in Syria. It has foreign jihadists who have fought in Chechnya and the Balkans. ""Yet the pace of the war against the ISIL is accelerating, and the group's ability to continually shape and control the conflict will be sorely tested,"" Knights writes in the latest edition of Sentinel, published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. Military analysts say ISIS' success so far is largely due to the weakness of its opponents, as well as years of meticulous planning after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's ""reboot"" of the group in 2010. This war of attrition included a campaign to intimidate and assassinate senior members of the Iraqi security forces last year, a campaign al-Baghdadi called the ""Soldiers' Harvest."" Al-Baghdadi built a command structure designed to combine centralized control with execution at the local level. This was highly successful during 2012-13 when the group synchronized waves of car bombings in different locations across Iraq. It was in evidence at the weekend in Kurdish-controlled Kirkuk, when a series of three car bombs and a roadside bomb killed at least 20 people. ISIS has weaved this tactic into its current military campaign. Earlier this month, a well-planned attack against the Kurdish town of Jalula began with a suicide car bomb that killed more than 20 Peshmerga, ""a second tanker truck suicide device in the town center, followed by individual suicide-vest bombings on 12 checkpoints by fighters wearing Kurdish-style uniforms,"" Knights says. These multiple suicide bombings instil fear and panic in civilians and military opponents alike. They are ISIS' ""shock and awe"" tactic, complemented by the agility and speed of ISIS units. ""The relative compactness of Iraq, where good roads allow large swathes of the country to be traversed in a single day, gives an aggressive force strong ability to concentrate forces at a given point of attack,"" says Knights. There have been claims that ISIS is using U.S.-made M-1 Abrams tanks and Humvees seized from the Iraqi army. And sometimes heavy armor has made an important difference. ISIS used a single Iraqi T-55 tank of Soviet vintage earlier this month to fend off an attempt to break the siege of Amerli. But pinpoint U.S. airstrikes have already changed the local balance around the Mosul Dam and Sinjar. Knights told CNN: ""Though ISIS have undoubtedly captured 200-300 Humvees and will be able to keep them operational for many months before they require spare parts, other U.S.-provided vehicles are present in very limited amounts. In part this is because they are complex to operate and maintain. Very few were captured in good working order because the Iraqis themselves were having trouble keeping them running."" Knights says that there is no evidence that ISIS fighters have been able to operate M-1 Abrams -- nor U.S. manufactured 155mm howitzers. It does have far more armored trucks with heavy machine guns than it did before June, allowing it to overrun lightly armed checkpoints. ""But faced with U.S. airpower or even the slowly recovering Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, such vehicles become death traps,"" says Knights, citing the group's losses at the Mosul Dam. Making resistance appear hopeless to potential opponents is a critical part of ISIS' strategy. A tribal revolt in Zowiya in Salahuddin province last month was met with sustained mortar fire that almost razed the town. Those who wanted to re-enter Zowiya had to ""repent."" ""If local populations cannot mount an effective resistance to ISIS, then they likely will not attempt to do so,"" says Jessica Lewis at the Institute for the Study of War. ISIS may have as few as 15,000 fighters for a vast area stretching from northern Syria to the middle of Iraq. So deception is also critical to its success. On many occasions it has appeared to be launching an attack -- drawing defending forces toward it -- only to strike the place those forces have left. Earlier this month, ISIS hit Jalula, after Peshmerga had left the town to confront an ISIS thrust at Makhmour. The fact that it has relatively few fighters per square mile may explain why it prefers to depopulate some towns because of an ""accentuated fear of local uprisings and informers,"" says Knights. That could be a double-edged sword, because living among civilians in densely populated places should offer the group some protection. But there is evidence that the Iraqi air force strikes even when civilians are present. ""My sense from talking to people along the ISIS front line is that the group welcomes being able to shuffle discretely around depopulated towns,"" says Knights. And airstrikes, unless limited and carefully targeted, might even end up helping ISIS. ""Airstrikes into the Sunni heartland of Iraq or Syria may exacerbate the sectarian conflict in the region by illustrating a passive or active alignment of the U.S. with Iran in order to bring firepower to bear against Sunnis,"" says Lewis. ISIS has also traded on tribal rivalries to consolidate its position, ""such as by plugging into the anti-Kurdish sentiments of Arab tribes around Jalula or allowing Arab tribes to harvest the ripe wheat fields of displaced Shi`a Turkmen farmers at Amerli,"" says Knights. These local arrangements may work for a time, but ISIS is likely to encounter stiffer opposition. Its use of surprise will be slowly devalued, as its tactics are studied -- and especially as the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga begin to receive a flow of real-time intelligence from the U.S. surveillance. Knights says he was told by Kurdish sources that ISIS tried to infiltrate the town of Tuz Khurmatu after dark two weeks ago. But its fighters were detected by the U.S. military, which provided Kurdish artillery with the coordinates required to blunt the attacks. Knights told CNN that ""U.S. special forces seem to be operating along the front line, visually checking and designating targets. U.S. headquarters personnel at the joint operations center in Irbil [the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan] are helping the Kurds and the [Iraqi] air force to coordinate their actions and to avoid 'friendly fire'."" And then there is the weight of expectation among ISIS supporters. Its momentum has helped swell its ranks as both foreign fighters and young radicalized Iraqi Sunnis have flocked to join. But al-Baghdadi's declaration of a Caliphate means ISIS has to ""demonstrate that its physical stronghold is defensible, or at least prevent rival militaries from attacking it,"" says Lewis. ISIS has shown a rudimentary ability to defend its gains, building berms, booby-trapping approach roads and destroying bridges. It has successfully ambushed Iraqi troops and Shia militia trying to retake Tikrit. But defensive positions and predictable counterattacks leave its forces more exposed to airstrikes. ""ISIS' defensive style has two components,"" Knights told CNN. ""They use roadside bombs and vehicle-carried remotely detonated bombs to create explosive emplacement hazards along key routes and in key towns. The U.S. has shown that, along with ground sources, it can remotely spot and destroy these from the air."" ""ISIS' other key preference is for counterattacks, almost as an instinctive reaction to losing ground. This is an organization that much prefers to be on the attack, even tactically, as part of a defensive operation. But counterattacking ISIS convoys are easy meat for U.S. airpower and even for Iraqi aviators,"" he adds. And if ISIS has to do more defending than attacking -- as seems likely -- the Sunni communities that have supported, accepted or acquiesced to it may think twice. ""If the ISF and Kurdish forces undertake selective offensive operations on a widening number of battlefields,"" Knights says, ISIS and its allies ""will undoubtedly become stretched, particularly if its ability to move and mass counterattacking forces is limited."" Another vulnerability may be lines of communication between Raqqa in Syria, ISIS' administrative headquarters, and its units in Iraq. ""Snapping the ISIS caliphate in half is a key objective, both to undermine the narrative of a transnational caliphate that can be defended, and to reduce the synergies of two insurgencies fighting back-to-back,"" Knights told CNN. For now, observers say ISIS still has momentum, and repeatedly demonstrates its ability to fight on many fronts simultaneously, pacify or co-opt towns and villages that might otherwise resist and hold territory against the Iraqi Security Forces, which have been weakened by several years of political interference and poor leadership. The idea that the ISF are capable of retaking Mosul anytime soon seems far-fetched. Better co-ordination among its opponents, and the psychological effect of going on the defensive, may begin to turn the tide. But to borrow a phrase from another conflict, most analysts believe we are not close to the beginning of the end in the battle against ISIS, rather anticipating the end of the beginning.","ISIS' ""ability to continually shape and control the conflict will be sorely tested,"" analyst says .
Its success so far is largely due to the weakness of its opponents, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- It must be a bomb. That was Debbie Wagner's first thought when she heard the boom as she lay in bed overnight Saturday in her home on Indianapolis' Southside. Downstairs, she found a ceiling fan plunged to the floor, glass shattered, and the deadbolt of her front door blown open -- not even knowing then her garage doors had been blown in. Only later did Wagner and her husband Andy learn that, among their neighbors, they were some of the lucky ones. A huge explosion had pierced the nighttime silence and ripped through the streets before characterized by solid two-story homes, garages and lawns. Two adults were killed, while seven others went to area hospitals, due to the explosion and related fires, said Deputy Chief Kenny Bacon of the Indianapolis Fire Department. Aerial video showed the significant material cost as well, with only the foundations remaining of some homes, others left charred, and dozens more homes like the Wagners' suffering damage of all different sorts. ""The house felt like it was shaking, your chest was shaking,"" Wagner told CNN affiliate WISH. ""It's like nothing that you've ever experienced."" Fire department spokeswoman Bonnie Hensley said early Sunday that two houses sitting next to one another blew up. But hours later, authorities still hadn't determined, publicly at least, why they did. Citizens Energy spokesman Dan Considine said Sunday there were no reports of gas smells prior to the blast. While the personal and physical toll was enormous, some officials are counting their blessings and crediting the prompt, extensive response from public safety authorities -- plus the good fortune that some locals were away for the night -- with preventing even more bloodshed. ""It was a massive explosion,"" said Troy Riggs, the city's director of public safety. ""... But it could have been much worse."" Soon after it happened, first responders swarmed on the area -- some of them in shorts and tennis shoes, having apparently rushed to the scene right away, said Riggs. At one point, 60 to 70 firefighters were on site to control blazes and prevent more, according to Bacon. Their other primary duty was to round up residents, as crews ""did at least a primary, secondary and tertiary search of every home"" to clear people out, he said. About 200 neighbors eventually made their way to nearby Mary Bryan Elementary School, where doctors and paramedics checked each one, said Bacon. Wagner described the predominant feeling among her neighbors as sorrow. ""People are just ... in shock, because it is such a surreal thing,"" she said. After the sun rose Sunday morning, the devastation became more stark and painful. Authorities went door to door at 126 properties in the neighborhood, dividing them into a few simple categories: ""OK"" for those with cosmetic and survivable damage, other designations for those with an uncertain future, or those that were a lost cause. Eighty homes were somehow affected, said Adam Collins, the deputy code enforcement director for the city, causing an estimated $3.6 million in damage. Most of these had minor damage, in the form of broken glass, torn-off siding or garage door damage, that didn't make their homes uninhabitable. Another 31 suffered what Collins called ""major damage"" -- meaning, for most of them, it's still to be determined if they can be lived in again. Inspectors know for sure that five cannot, as they are ""either gone or will require a demolition."" Riggs said he expects authorities will discover more damage, and residents will have to deal with more headaches and heartache in the coming weeks. Handing out his cell phone number to those affected, he promised them they wouldn't be alone. ""We understand that their lives are upside down,"" Riggs said. ""We're going to do everything we can to help (re-)establish their lives, and go forward."" CNN's Jake Carpenter, AnneClaire Stapleton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Seven go to hospitals after the late-night blast in an Indianapolis neighborhood, officials say .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The International Consumer Electronics Show, the giant gadget convention that wrapped up on Friday, has brought some frustrating news for AT&T or Sprint customers who bought a cutting-edge 4G smartphone last year. That phone will soon be outdated. AT&T Mobility and Sprint Nextel unveiled some of the first smartphones that will tap into their new, even faster fourth-generation networks. But wait, Sprint has been talking about its 4G network since launching one in 2008 followed by its premier phone, HTC's Evo 4G, in 2010. And AT&T began adding ""4G"" to the names of many of its smartphones early last year. Now, two of the largest U.S. cellular carriers are ramping up yet another 4G system. They will have LTE, or Long-term Evolution, to compete with the one Verizon Wireless launched more than a year ago. T-Mobile USA says it has 4G, which is similar to AT&T's old 4G, but the carrier has not talked about plans for 4G LTE deployment. (Get all that?) Since AT&T and Sprint have already exhausted their usage of 4G in marketing, it's unclear how they will explain to customers the major investments they've made to have the latest network technology. ""I don't think the majority of our customers understand the monikers,"" AT&T executive Glenn Lurie said in an interview here at CES. Sprint product chief Fared Adib declined to comment on the company's marketing plans. Lurie, who serves as AT&T's liaison to Apple, declined to comment on why Apple refused to adopt the 4G moniker in the iPhone 4S, which uses last year's HSPA+ technology that AT&T also describes as 4G. ""Forget the G's for a second,"" Lurie said. ""What it's called doesn't matter."" Verizon has emphasized the speed enhancements offered by its version of 4G, and makes an effort to refer to the network as 4G LTE, rather than just 4G, to differentiate from competitors, David Small, the technical chief for Verizon Wireless, has told CNN. Verizon is on track to have its 4G network match the coverage of its 3G network by next year, a spokeswoman said Friday. At CES last year, Verizon hosted two large news conferences and operated a huge booth to promote the launch of its 4G network. This year, Verizon has kept a low profile. AT&T announced eight new LTE products at CES, including smartphones and tablets. The world's first LTE Windows phone, the Lumia 900, will arrive in March, Nokia wrote in a message to partners on Friday. ""We use this as a way to kick off the year,"" Lurie said. ""CES is becoming more wireless-centric than ever before."" AT&T's loss in its bid to acquire T-Mobile has not affected operations, according to Lurie. The first 4G LTE phones for AT&T hit stores in November, before the breakup with T-Mobile was announced. At many of the large CES exhibits, 4G was pervasive. For example, a station at the entrance to LG's booth displaying a row of phones was called True LTE Expert. Sprint announced three new devices at CES: a portable wireless hotspot, an LG phone made from recycled materials, and the Galaxy Nexus from Samsung and Google. Sprint's new 4G LTE network is expected to match its older, slower 4G network by the end of this year, Steve Elfman, the carrier's network operations president, said in an interview. The company will stop selling devices that support its old 4G around that same time, and it will turn off access to that network in 2015. ""The ecosystem is going to be larger in LTE,"" Elfman said. Not only will it be larger, but this 4G is likely to remain king for some time.","A new data network, called 4G LTE, took hold at CES .
The technology will exceed old 4G networks .
Old 4G phones from AT&T and Sprint are not compatible with it ."
"(CNN) -- As numerous news organizations have reported, Russia has sent two planes so that about 100 of its citizens who want to can leave Syria. Tellingly, the planes were not sent to Damascus where the security situation around the airport has reportedly deteriorated, but to Beirut instead to which the Russians departing Syria traveled by bus. In its characteristic fashion, the Russian government has denied that this is an evacuation. An unnamed Russian diplomat in Damascus, though, did not rule out the possibility of further flights. Russian naval exercises in the Mediterranean may also be the prelude to a seaborne evacuation from the Syrian coast. These actions are not the first indication that Moscow expects the Assad regime may fall. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov acknowledged this possibility in December, and President Vladimir Putin himself seemed to distance himself from President Bashar al-Assad a week later. Arranging for the emergency departure of Russian citizens from Syria though, is the most serious indication to date that the Kremlin is preparing for the further weakening or even the downfall of the Assad regime. Read more: The Moscow-Damascus alliance, a tangled tale . These Russian moves, of course, are not ones that the Assad regime can be pleased with. The top leaders as well as officers in its security services, though, may have a strong incentive to protect the Russian exodus in order to secure their own prospects for fleeing to Russia in the event that the regime falls. After opposing Western calls for al-Assad to leave Syria for so long, Moscow is not going to publicly urge him to do so before it is too late. The very fact that Moscow has begun to organize the departure of its own citizens from Syria though, is a signal that al-Assad still has a window of opportunity to depart. Moscow has not yet withdrawn its personnel from the Russian embassy in Damascus. If and when it does, this will signal that the Kremlin has determined that the regime really is about to fall. The departure of Russian embassy personnel may also be the last opportunity for al-Assad and his family to leave Damascus with Moscow's assistance. The downfall of the Assad regime will present challenges both for neighboring countries and for all the major powers. Because of its ties to the Assad regime the challenges that Moscow faces in Syria after its downfall will be especially difficult. Moscow will want to keep its naval facilities at the Syrian port of Tartus as well as its economic and trade relations with Syria. Yet while the West may be willing to accommodate Moscow here, it is not clear that a new Syrian government that is resentful over Moscow's past support for Assad will be. If the Alawite minority that the Assad regime is based on manages to flee to its heartland on the Syrian coast and establish a mini-state there, Moscow will face some especially difficult choices. That rump regime will be eager to allow Moscow to keep its naval facility at Tartus and continue receiving Russian arms. If Moscow agrees to do this, however, it will not only have hostile relations with the new Sunni-dominated regime in Damascus that is likely to arise, but also with Sunni-led governments throughout the Arab world. The new Sunni-dominated government (or just various Sunni forces) may decide to retaliate through attacking Russian personnel in the intra-Syrian conflict that is likely to continue, and perhaps through assisting Sunni Muslim rebels in the North Caucasus and Russia's other Muslim regions. Yet if Moscow does not back it, this rump Alawite regime may not last long and the new Sunni-dominated Syrian government might expel the Russians anyway. Moscow did not have to back the Assad regime as much as it has. But because it did, Russian interests in Syria are especially likely to suffer as it continues to crumble. Most unfortunately, it is the Russian citizens now desperately trying to escape from Syria who may suffer most from the consequences of Moscow's poor choices.","Russia has sent two planes so that about 100 of its citizens who want to can leave Syria .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The unfolding saga of the Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling touches upon big, explosive issues in American society: Racism. Money. Sports. Secret recordings. And an estranged marriage. Sterling, an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul, is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the NBA franchise after the league said it would ban him forever in the wake of allegations that he disparaged African-Americans in an audio recording. The Sterling controversy contains as many surprises and exchanges as the ongoing NBA playoffs, which, by the way, still include the Clippers in contention for the league title. In fact, on Thursday, the attorney for Sterling's wife, the other co-owner, told CNN that she's distancing herself from her husband and has informed the NBA she wants the team in her name. How the scandal began . Last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the league was imposing a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine against Donald Sterling, co-owner of the Clippers since 1981, for ""offensive and disturbing"" remarks he made about blacks. Those remarks were uttered in an audio recording published by the celebrity news outlet TMZ, which asserted the two people talking on the tape were Sterling and his ""girlfriend,"" V. Stiviano. TMZ hasn't stated who made the recording or how it was obtained. But Silver said the Clippers owner ""acknowledged it was his voice on the tape."" CNN hasn't independently confirmed the audio recording. Sterling and Stiviano haven't returned CNN's calls for comment. In a recent interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, however, Stiviano tacitly confirmed the authenticity of the recording when she stated she and Sterling often discussed race: ""There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one."" In the recording, Sterling argues with Stiviano about how she posted to Instagram a photo with legendary NBA player Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" the woman responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird was also a NBA star who played with the Boston Celtics and a storied rival of Johnson, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers. ""I've known [Magic] well and he should be admired .... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,"" the man on the recording says. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put [Magic] on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" When the woman says she doesn't share the man's views about race, he tells her: ""Well, then, if you don't feel -- don't come to my games. Don't bring black people, and don't come."" Stiviano's response . In her only substantial interview, Stiviano, 31, told ABC that Sterling, 80, is now hurting. ""Tormented. Emotionally traumatized,"" Stiviano said. About her relationship with Sterling, Stiviano said she plays a big role in his life, but they are not romantically involved. ""I love him just like a father figure,"" she told ABC. She also described herself as his ""right-hand man,"" ""confidant,"" and ""best friend."" They also have a financial arrangement, she said. ""He at first started paying me as an employee, and then he started paying me off the books,"" she said. Her attorney, Mac E. Nehoray, said Stiviano was a platonic friend of Sterling's and not his ""girlfriend"" or, as some media outlets, including CNN, put it, his ""mistress."" ""They were more like friends. Platonic,"" Nehoray told CNN. Stiviano is writing about book about her life, but she doesn't have a book deal connected to the Sterling controversy, Nehoray said. Even before the racial controversy erupted, Sterling's wife, Shelly, was well aware of Stiviano. In fact, in March, Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, accusing her of having an affair with her husband and targeting extremely wealthy older men. Stiviano's attorney dismissed as ""absolutely false"" any description of Stiviano as a ""gold digger"" and a ""con artist."" Shelly Sterling's suit claims that her husband used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Stiviano also took over a $1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $250,000 in cash from Sterling, the court document claims. Stiviano is fighting back, saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts. She also says she never took advantage of him. Donald Sterling's response . Sterling had largely been silent on the controversy. The only significant comment he made was published last week on DuJour.com, which quoted Sterling as saying ""I wish I had just paid her off"" in reference to Stiviano. The website specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers, but the publication didn't state when the remark was made. CNN couldn't independently confirm the remark. On Thursday, however, another celebrity news outlet, RadarOnline.com, published a new audio recording of Sterling conversing with an unknown man about allegations of Sterling being a racist. Sterling emphatically denies being a racist in the conversation. ""You think I'm a racist?"" Sterling tells a person Radar Online calls ""a long-time friend in the recorded phone conversation."" ""You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don't think that! You know I'm not a racist!"" Sterling says on the recording. ""I grew up in East L.A. ..."" Sterling continues. ""I was the president of the high school there. I mean, and I'm a Jew! And 50% of the people there were black and 40% were Hispanic. ... So I mean, people must have a good feeling for me."" CNN couldn't independently confirm the new audio recording. Radar Online said it obtained ""a secret audio recording"" from an unidentified source who also provided an affidavit confirming the phone call was made by Sterling. Sterling also declares in the recording that he won't sell his co-ownership in the Clippers as the NBA is now demanding. ""You can't force people to sell property in America,"" Sterling says. At one point in the conversation, Sterling sounds bewildered when the friend tells him that rapper-producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is among the celebrities seeking to buy the Clippers. Friend: ""I'm just saying they got Sean Combs Diddy... Sterling: ""Who?"" Friend: ""Sean Combs and Oprah."" What's next for the Clippers . The ""Oprah"" cited on the recording is Oprah Winfrey, who is among a long list of public figures reportedly seeking to buy the Clippers, one of 30 teams in the NBA. Other interested celebrities include Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked by Forbes as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world; former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya; basketball great Magic Johnson; producer-musician Dr. Dre; rapper Rick Ross; music mogul David Geffen; Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; Rick Caruso, a real estate developer and Los Angeles civic leader; and actors Matt Damon, Whoopi Goldberg and Frankie Muniz. Meanwhile, Shelly Sterling has no intention of surrendering her stake in the team and has been in touch with the NBA about keeping the team, according to her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, who spoke Thursday to CNN. Shelly Sterling owns 50% of the team, and her husband the other 50%, through a family trust, O'Donnell said. O'Donnell asserted that as of now, ""she's the owner in charge."" The couple continue to share properties, he added. But the Sterlings have been estranged and not living together for more than a year, O'Donnell said. Moreover, Shelly Sterling is now distancing herself from the racist comments attributed to her husband, O'Donnell said. ""Mrs. Sterling has denounced in the strongest terms possible terms her husband's racist comments,"" O'Donnell said. Whether Shelly Sterling can keep the team in her name is being robustly discussed by analysts. Complicating the matter is how Donald Sterling intends to fight the forced sale, according to the RadarOnline.com recording. Donald Sterling could be forced to sell his team if three-quarters of the NBA team owners agree, NBA Commissioner Silver said. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that for all practical purposes, the NBA effort to make Donald Sterling sell the team also applies to his wife. ""They're the same ownership group. That is not separate ownership,"" Toobin said. As for the Clippers' more immediate prospects, the team is now tied 1-1 with the Oklahoma City Thunder in a best-of-seven-games playoff series. Both teams are vying to advance to the Western Conference playoffs, whose winner will play for the league title against the Eastern Conference winner. The Clipper's next game is Friday night at home, though the team's off-court drama is proving to be equally compelling. CNN's Stephanie Elam and Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.","The saga of Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling involves secret recordings .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration says registration records for as many as one-third of all private aircraft are out-of-date and inaccurate, and has begun the process of re-registering aircraft in the United States -- a task made more urgent by the threat posed by criminals and terrorists. Of the 357,000 registered aircraft in the United States, records for about 119,000 are believed to be out of date, with many of them believed to be junked or inactive aircraft, the FAA said. But the inaccurate records also could conceal criminal or even terrorist activity, say some security and aviation experts, who say it is critical that the FAA restore order to its records. To deal with the disarray, the FAA is in the process of canceling registration for all civil aircraft -- a category that includes virtually everything except military aircraft -- and requiring the owners to re-register. The re-registrations will be phased-in over three years, and aircraft owners will be required to renew the registrations every three years thereafter. ""These improvements will give us more up-to-date registration data and better information about the state of the aviation industry,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in July, when the rule took effect. The FAA has long grappled with getting a handle on its records, in recent years requiring owners to report the sale of aircraft, the scrapping or destruction of aircraft, or a change in mailing address. But many owners have not complied with those requirements, the FAA said. And many aircraft owners do not voluntarily update the database with other information, it said. The FAA's database identifies each aircraft by its registration number -- or ""N"" number, which is displayed on the plane's tail or fuselage -- its complete description, and the name and address of its registered owner. In seeking to upgrade the requirement three years ago, the FAA noted that various levels of law enforcement use the database in drug smuggling investigations and ""their efforts now have expanded to include matters of homeland security."" Proper records can assist investigators, aviation and security. Authorities routinely check the ""N"" number, or tail number, of suspicious planes, or planes that have entered restricted airspace. Just as importantly, an accurate database can help the FAA notify aircraft owners of safety-related information, such as Airworthiness Directives. The incomplete records are a security concern, but probably not a security problem,"" said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ""Most of these planes are probably right where they're supposed to be. The FAA has just lost track of them through lost paperwork or the database not being updated or the owners not answering the triennial survey that the FAA sends out,"" Dancy said. ""So they're probably where they are supposed to be -- owned by the people the FAA last has record of. They just don't know that."" Dancy said most aircraft owners recognize the need for accurate records, and that AOPA has tried to minimize the inconveniences associated with re-registration. ""We offered some suggestions when the (new requirement was proposed) to try to make it a little less burdensome. But the fact of the matter is that the database is woefully out of date. It does need to be brought up to date. We thought it could be done without canceling current registrations. The FAA decided canceling was the best way. It's now the law of the land,"" he said.","Of 357,000 registered aircraft in U.S., records for about 119,000 are believed out of date .
Inaccurate records can conceal criminal or terrorist activity, experts say .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Julia Lynn Womack Turner, who was convicted in 2007 of murder for the deaths by antifreeze poisoning of her boyfriend and husband, died Monday in prison in Georgia, prison officials said. Turner ""was found unresponsive in her cell at 6:55 a.m., at which time prison medical staff and EMS responded but were unable to revive her,"" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. The cause of death was under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's medical examiner's office. Turner was serving life without parole in the Metro State Prison for women in Atlanta. Turner was convicted of murder for the 1995 death of her husband, police officer Glenn Turner, and for the 2001 death of her boyfriend, firefighter Randy Thompson, both of whom were poisoned with antifreeze. Glenn Turner died March 3, 1995, from what was initially determined to be an irregular heartbeat. A week later, Turner moved in with Thompson, with whom she had begun an affair several months prior. But it was not until Thompson died in 2001 under similar circumstances that authorities exhumed the body of Glenn Turner and performed another autopsy. In both cases, the men had exhibited flulike symptoms before being taken to the emergency room. They both died less than 24 hours after they left the hospital, from what a coroner initially identified as heart failure. Further examination, however, revealed traces of ethylene glycol, a byproduct of antifreeze, in both of their bodies. Cobb County prosecutors labeled the defendant a ""black widow"" who murdered both men for financial gain. After her husband's death, Turner received more than $150,000 in benefits and interest from his life insurance and pension. She received about $36,000 from Thompson's death.","Julia Lynn Turner was convicted in 2007 of murder .

"(CNN) -- The superintendent of the Kansas City, Missouri, school district on Thursday defended a plan to shutter nearly half the district's schools. ""No one likes closing schools. It's hard. It's tough on families, and it's certainly tough on our community,"" superintendent John Covington said Thursday. ""Closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do. We were operating far too many schools,"" he said. He said the district was only using about 60 percent of the seats in its elementary schools, 40 percent in its middle schools and an even smaller percentage in its high schools. After weeks of contentious debate and years of dwindling enrollment, a divided Kansas City Board of Education voted Wednesday night to approve what Covington calls the ""right-size"" plan. The plan will close 29 education facilities, including 26 schools, according to the district. Some parents voiced anger. Some students cried. ""I have an 8-year-old and a 6-year-old that will be going to school with 12th graders. I find that very inappropriate. I don't feel my children will be safe,"" Deneicia Williams told CNN affiliate KSHB-TV. ""I feel like I have nothing, I have no high school legacy. I feel like I have nothing, nothing to go back to,"" said Prince Jones, a senior, who will be part of the final graduating class at Westport High School. Covington proposed the plan arguing that the financial future of the entire school district was at stake. The plan also cuts 700 jobs and saves $50 million to help reduce a burgeoning deficit. School districts across America, hit hard by budget cuts, have been struggling to make ends meet. They have had to make tough choices between closures, program cuts, bus route cancellations and layoffs of teachers and staff. Schools in at least 17 states have opted for four-day weeks. Are your schools having trouble? Share your story . Covington said the closures were the first phase of ""right-sizing"" a district where enrollments have plummeted from more than 35,000 in the 1999-2000 school year to about 17,000 in 2009-10. ""Closing schools is hard, and it is tough on the community,"" Covington said recently in remarks posted on the superintendent's Web site. ""Closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do for kids,"" he said. ""Keeping all of the schools open with too few children in them is draining the resources we need to improve the education of all students."" But four of the nine board members disagreed with Covington. ""I deserve the right to make a rational decision based on facts, and we were never given facts about student achievement,"" Cokethea Hill, who voted against the closings, told KSHB. Some members of the public showed up Wednesday to air their last-minute appeals. ""What I'm asking you today to do is to give our children justice,"" said Ron Hunt, a community activist. Others worried that school closures would lead to deterioration of communities and drive residents out of the district. ""The blighting of the urban core is scandalous and shameful,"" said Sharon Sanders Brooks. Covington is slated to discuss the school closings at a news conference Thursday morning.","Kansas City, Missouri, school board approves plan to close 28 of 61 public schools .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis generally comes off as so hip, so completely at home in the 21st century, it's tempting to forget he's also a deeply religious believer and therefore sees the world fairly differently than most of his fellow celebrities and pop culture icons. We'll get a reminder of the point on Sunday, when Francis presides over a service in Rome's Basilica of St. Peter featuring a rare public exhibit of what Catholic tradition regards as the bones of Peter, the Church's first pope. The secular mind can't help asking, ""Are these really Peter's bones?"" and ""How do we know?"" For believers such as Francis, however, the more relevant question is, ""What spiritual message do they have?"" In a nutshell, the pope, as well as the throngs of believers who'll line up to see the bones, will venerate them not on the basis of empirical evidence, but a spiritual conviction that they evoke the very origins of the papacy and of Christianity. They invite devotees to see themselves as part of a 2,000-year ""communion of saints"" whose original leader was a poor fisherman, who the Bible says denied Jesus three times, yet whose faith was so strong in the end that he gave his life to defend it. The exhibit is designed to wrap up a ""Year of Faith"" for Catholics around the world originally launched under Pope Benedict XVI, and carried to its conclusion by Francis. To be sure, there's a beguiling detective story behind the bones. Detective story . St. Peter's Basilica was originally constructed in 330 A.D. by the Emperor Constantine, over an old pagan cemetery believed to be the burial site of Peter, whom tradition holds was martyred by being crucified upside down. For the next sixteen centuries nobody poked around underneath the basilica to see what was actually down there, feeling that the site was too sacred to be disturbed. In 1923, however, the world was dazzled by the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt, a global sensation that left a deep impression on a young Italian cleric named Eugenio Pacelli. When Pacelli became Pope Pius XII in 1939, he authorized a dig under the basilica, and in 1942 archeologists found a niche they believed housed Peter's remains. Unfortunately, the fragments turned out to belong to several people. It took a couple decades before experts singled out a set of bones belonging to a man who had been 5ft 7in tall, of heavy build, and who was aged between 60 and 70 at the time of his death, all of which were consistent with traditional depictions of Peter. Stains suggested the bones had been wrapped in a purplish, gold-threaded cloth, symbolizing a person of importance. Most intriguing, an inscription was found near the cavity that linguists reconstructed as Petros eni, which in ancient Greek could mean, ""Peter is within."" That was enough for Paul VI, the pope at the time, who announced in 1968 that the bones of Peter had been identified ""in a manner which we believe convincing."" Yet debate swirled then, and still does, about how reliable that identification actually is. Logic of faith . In truth, all one can say for certain is that these are ancient human remains found in a spot devoted to Peter's memory. Since there's no DNA sample to compare, there's no way of proving whether the bones are really his. A top Vatican official conceded as much in 2000, saying the Church is in a ""very discrete and insecure position"" on the bones and that references to Peter's remains are ""a bit relative."" It's similar to the situation with the alleged bones of St. Paul, preserved in another Roman basilica, which were subjected to carbon-14 testing in 2007 under Pope Benedict XVI and shown to come from the first century. That test provides a date, but not an identity. In other words, we still don't know if the bones really belong to the apostle. That's where the logic of faith takes over. First of all, the bones Francis will venerate on Sunday spent centuries resting in the site linked to Peter's martyrdom and burial. That history makes them, at a minimum, what Catholic tradition regards as ""relics by contact,"" meaning objects physically connected to the legacy of the saint. Beyond that, Francis knows these bones have been hallowed by countless acts of prayer and devotion, and that like other famous relics, such as the Shroud of Turin or the Belt of Mary, they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance. Especially for the first pope from Latin America, a continent where popular devotion is the very soul of religious experience, that mystical power is not to be dismissed. Faith, as the Bible puts it, lies in ""the evidence of things not seen."" In that sense, an exhibit of the bones of St. Peter, surrounded by scientific controversy yet wrapped in a blanket of belief, is probably the perfect capstone for a ""Year of Faith.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- In a possible portent of growing factional conflict, a leading Kurdish minister was removed from Iraq's government, and the Kurdish semi-autonomous government took over two oilfields in the north, officials said Friday. Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, the face of Iraqi diplomacy for a more than a decade, was removed Friday by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, two senior Iraqi government officials said. Zebari's ouster occurred as Kurds in Iraq's government launched a boycott followed comments made Thursday by al-Maliki, who purportedly linked ISIS extremists and Baathists to the Kurdish Regional Government in Irbil. The Kurds strongly dispute al-Maliki's allegations and say he wants to scapegoat the Kurds for his failures in northern Iraq and divert attention from how ISIS militants have poured into Iraq and waged warfare against the government, a senior Kurdish official said. The senior Kurdish official accused al-Maliki of trying to turn a conflict between al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government and Sunnis -- some of whom have supported the extremists from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -- into a dispute between Arabs and Kurds. Appointed as interim foreign minister was Hussain Shahristani, a Shiite and an al-Maliki adviser who is deputy prime minister for energy affairs, two senior Iraqi government officials said. The officials told CNN that Zebari was replaced after Kurdish ministers boycotted Cabinet meetings. CNN was not able to reach anyone at the Prime Minister's office for comment. Oil field seizures . Meanwhile, the Kurds' Peshmerga forces on Friday seized two oilfields -- one medium-sized and the other small -- though the fields weren't under any threat from ISIS, a Kurdish government source said. The Kurds took the oilfields after accusing Iraq's Ministry of Oil of trying to ""sabotage the recent mutually-agreed pipeline infrastructure linking the Avana dome with the Khurmala field"" in northern Iraq, the Kurdish Regional Government said. That new pipeline was to help increase revenues for Iraq ""at a time of great need and at a time when most of the Iraq-Turkey pipeline is under ISIS control,"" the Kurdish government said. The Kurdish government accused Baghdad of ordering officials not to use the new pipeline to export oil and instead to re-inject the oil back into an unused field in Kirkuk in the north. ""This politically motivated decision risked causing great damage to the field in question with a permanent loss of most of the oil that has been re-injected. It has also deprived the people of Iraq of much-needed oil export revenue,"" the Kurdish government said. ""This morning's events have shown that the (Kurdish Regional Government) is determined to protect and defend Iraq's oil infrastructure whenever it is threatened by acts of terrorism or, as in this case, politically motivated sabotage,"" the Kurdish government said. Despite being unable to export, the Avana and Makhmour fields were producing about 110,000 barrels of oil per day, the Kurdish government said. Baghdad and Irbil have long been at odds, especially over Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi Constitution. The document called for a referendum that never happened: the vote was supposed to have determined the final status of several disputed areas such as Kirkuk and small villages in Nineveh, Diyala and Salaheddin claimed by the central government and the Kurdistan government. Baghdad often accuses Irbil of signing illegal oil deals. A minister since the U.S. invasion . As a leading Kurdish and government figure in Iraq, Zebari had been Iraq's foreign minister since 2003, after the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein, according to his profile on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Before that, he was involved in the Kurdish resistance against the Hussein regime, and he was head of the Kurdish Democratic Party's international relations bureau. His ouster came as Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani called on all Kurdish members of the Iraqi parliament and Kurdish ministers in the Iraqi government to return to the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, said Khasro Goran, a leader in the KDP Kurdish Party. Goran, also head of the KDP bloc in the Iraqi parliament, added that no Kurdish member of parliament will attend Sunday's parliament session called for by the caretaker speaker of parliament, Mehdi al-Hafez. Goran also told CNN that the Kurdish ministers in the Iraqi government will not participate in Cabinet meetings for the time being. Kurdish participation in Iraq's government formation will depend on the outcome of the decisions made by the Kurdish alliance in Irbil, a senior Kurdish official told CNN. Last month, Barzani gave his strongest-ever indication that the Kurdish region would seek formal independence from the rest of Iraq, he told CNN. ""Iraq is obviously falling apart,"" Barzani said. ""The time is here for the Kurdistan people to determine their future and the decision of the people is what we are going to uphold."" Iraqi Kurdish independence has long been something of a dream, and the region has had semi-autonomy from Baghdad for more than two decades. But Iraq's latest crisis, in which Sunni extremists have captured a large swath of Iraqi territory on the border of Iraqi Kurdistan, seems to have pushed the Kurds over the edge. ""Now we are living [in] a new Iraq, which is different completely from the Iraq that we always knew, the Iraq that we lived in 10 days or two weeks ago,"" Barzani said last month.

"(CNN) -- Time-lapse videos are usually a stationary affair, shot from a fixed location and angle over an extended period of time. But now, Instagram is letting iPhone users ditch the tripods and take time-lapse videos on the go with its new app, Hyperlapse. The key feature of the free app, released Tuesday, is a stabilization engine that takes advantage of the iPhone's built-in gyroscope to keep images from shaking. Without the jiggling, Hyperlapse users are free to move around. Take Hyperlapse for a walk or a bike ride and explore your surroundings. Strap your phone to a quadcopter, hold it out the car window, or if you're feeling old-school, just leave it one spot to watch the world go by. Unlike Instagram, Hyperlapse is more a tool for creating videos than a social sharing app. You don't need to log in with an Instagram or Facebook account to use Hyperlapse, but there is an option to post clips to the two social networks when you're done. There aren't filters in the Hyperlapse app, but they can be added through Instagram (although the videos will still need to be cut down to 15 seconds). Though the videos look professional, the interface is dead simple. Open the app, tap to focus, and start recording. Once you're done, a slider lets you speed up the video as much as 12 times. Hyperlapse videos can run up to 45 minutes on the iPhone 5, 10 minutes on the iPhone 4. This is only Instagram's second stand-alone app. In July, it released Bolt, a self-destructing photo and video messaging app that is only available in a few countries. Instagram added a 15-second video function a year ago, a direct challenge to Twitter's Vine feature. Instagram's parent company Facebook has been more aggressive with pushing out stand-alone apps, including the recent controversial move to spin off messaging. Hyperlapse is only available on the iPhone. The company says limitations in Android's API will keep it off that platform for the time being.","Hyperlapse is a new iPhone app from Instagram for creating time-lapse videos .

"(CNN) -- A soldier apparently shot herself on Monday at a military post in central Virginia and later died, the Army said. The incident began at about 8:45 a.m. ET at Fort Lee when the soldier apparently brandished a weapon and then barricaded herself in an office at the Army Combined Arms Support Command headquarters building, according to a statement from the post. The statement said that Fort Lee Police responded within two minutes and quickly established contact with her. But during ""the course of negotiations,"" she ""reportedly turned the weapon on herself"" and fired one shot, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Have you always wanted to have your own garden and grow fresh, healthy food but didn't know quite where to start? Which vegetable varieties to go for, how far from one another to place the seeds and how much water to use? That's also how Claire Reid felt back in 2002, at 16, when her father asked her to plant a garden during her school holidays. ""I was overwhelmed by the amount of seed I had to buy, the amount of fertilizer, the wastage,"" recalls Reid. Reid quickly realized that gardening was not made easy for beginners. She was frustrated that she had to measure manually the correct distance between the seeds, as well as to pay a small fortune to buy what she needed, since everything came in bulk -- not to mention the badly written instructions. So Reid then decided to put her young mind to work. ""I wanted to come up with an idea that if I only wanted to plant a meter of spinach, I only needed to buy a meter of spinach,"" recalls Reid. After giving it some thought, Reid used baking flour and liquid feritlizer to stick seeds, in calculated intervals, onto newspaper strips. She then went on to plant the strips in furrows. The experiment worked and Reid was encouraged by a school teacher to present her idea into an expo for young South African scientists -- Reid's project won the gold medal. ""I was a 16 year old girl that was barely passing science in school and the concept of me becoming a businesswoman was quite absurd,"" says Reid. Yet, that high school idea has grown today to become Reel Gardening, an award-winning patented invention aiming to simplify food gardening and make it more effective. Launched in 2010, Reid's Johannesburg-based startup produces a paper strip that that comes pre-packaged with seeds and organic fertilizers. These are spaced at the right depth and distance apart so they can be easily planted and maintained. The tapes, which are sold in reels, are packed by hand and cost $1 per meter. ""We are passionate about starting a planting revolution,"" says Reid, whose packaged seed strips grow vegetables, herbs and flowers. ""So we enable anyone to be able to grow vegetables -- with little space, little education and little water."" Reid says her biodegradable strips use 80% less water than traditional gardening methods, because they require water only at the exact location of each seed. And that's one reason why she shares her product with people in urban slums where water is less available. So far, more than 120 community and school gardens have sprouted up with Reid's help. There are 11 official languages in South Africa so the young entrepreneur uses simple pictures on the products' packaging to overcome language and literacy obstacles. ""It tells you exactly where to water, all the nutrition is already in there,"" says Reid, who sells her planting strips throughout South Africa. ""Birds can't eat the seeds out of the soil; water can't move the seed; and you only need to plant as much as you have space for."" Looking ahead, Reid is determined to see Reel Gardening grow, even outside South Africa. ""We are hoping to be live in the UK, selling on the 1st of May,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- In a city that changes as fast as the weather, it can be easy to overlook Hong Kong's past. But on a winding street in Wan Chai, one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, a house painted brilliant blue stands out. The ""Blue House,"" a Chinese tenement building from the 1920s, is at the heart of a cluster of historic buildings that paint a picture of old Hong Kong. Home to the Hong Kong House of Stories, an eclectic museum and community center that offers tours of historic sites in the area, the building provides an important glimpse into the neighborhood's rich history. A block away, 50-story highrises loom and preservationists worry about the impact of gentrification on the neighborhood's character. ""We want local people to tell local stories,"" says Maria Kwok, a volunteer tour guide who has lived in Wan Chai for almost three decades. ""If you come back in a few years, this neighborhood may have completely changed."" The Blue House itself, which packed working class families into tiny rooms after it was built in the 1920s, is the first stop on the heritage tour. Tenement houses like these were once common in the neighborhood and the city. Now, along with two other tenements next door, the Blue House is one of the few remaining. Temples, post offices, war . In the surrounding blocks, other old buildings, like a tiny 1847 temple and a prim 1915 post office, are slipped between apartment towers. Of note is Pak Tai Temple, a Taoist temple built in 1863 and an oasis of incense-scented calm. The House of Stories also offers a nighttime ""haunted tour"" that shares ""spooky tales"" of the neighborhood's most eerie sites. The Japanese bombing and occupation of Hong Kong during World War II fuel stories of ghosts in Wan Chai. ""People come for the fun but they also learn about the history,"" Kwok says. The two or two-and-a-half-hour tours, all led by community locals, cost HK$60 ($7.75) per person, with private group tours for a minimum of HK$600 ($77). Visitors should schedule tours in advance over phone or email (see below). Nonprofit and school groups receive reduced rates. The House of Stories also organizes concerts, movie nights and art workshops on Thursday nights. People regularly wander into its welcoming, living room-esque space, which is full of old knickknacks and historic books donated by neighbors who've moved out. Renovation and preservation . Upstairs, the Blue House is in the middle of a government-supported renovation to preserve its architecture and improve living conditions for residents, some of whom lack air conditioning and even toilets in their century-old flats. While there are other historic renovation projects underway around the city, the Blue House effort is unique in that original residents will stay in their homes, says Mirana Szeto, a Hong Kong University professor who consulted on the project. ""We're not preserving an old house and its original culture, we're preserving a living community,"" Szeto says. Renovation plans were drawn up in consultation with locals. After construction is complete in 2017, the House of Stories will be joined by two new restaurants in the Blue House. Until then, there are plenty of good dining options in the surrounding blocks. Dining changes . The Pawn, a restaurant and bar housed in an 1888 pawn shop building, has an outside terrace and roof seating. (The Pawn is currently closed for renovation, but scheduled to reopen in October with a menu from British celebrity chef Tom Aikens.) Tai Lung Fung, a bar that opened three years ago in a former car repair shop across the street from the Blue House, has a long list of cocktails and excellent shrimp paste chicken wings (HK$55/$7). Its neon-lit vibe is straight out of '70s Hong Kong TV dramas, and its walls are adorned with classic movie posters. ""Old things are being destroyed,"" says Sam Leung, the bar's owner. ""I wanted to protect and keep the memory."" Some complain that new bars and higher rents are threatening mom-and-pop noodle joints and tea shops, where locals enjoy cold milk tea (dong nai cha). ""The whole area is changing. It doesn't match with the local residents,"" Kwok says. ""For us locals, they're making things more expensive."" A cheap option is an evening of snacks and beers on the sidewalk in front of the Blue House, a nighttime hangout for the community. The rattle of games of mahjong regularly mix with laughter echoing down the street. Leung Ping Wa, who has lived in the Blue House and its adjoining tenements for 18 years, says he has seen big changes in the area: lots of new faces and new highrise buildings. But the changes he notices are also cultural. ""In the past, more people used to come out and eat and talk to each other like this,"" he says. ""Now, most people go home and close their doors.""

"(CNN) -- At the annual rattlesnake roundup in Sweetwater, Texas, in early March, Jaycee sponsors and volunteers slaughtered 3,890 pounds of rattlesnakes. The event is billed as ""Fun for the whole family,"" and children take their turns to skin a snake, and afterward, press their hands covered with snake blood onto a wall of handprints. The Jaycees, short for the U.S. Junior Chamber, bills itself as a group that gives young people ""the tools they need to build the bridges of success."" The Sweetwater branch has been holding what it calls ""The World's Largest Rattlesnake Round-Up"" for 56 years on the first weekend in March, and the tool for success that it teaches young people is that it's fun to kill and torture animals. For weeks or even months, rattlesnakes are stored in crowded barrels until it's roundup time. The snakes that have not suffocated under their kin arrive hungry, dehydrated, and sick from gasoline that was sprayed into their burrows to flush them out. After a tour of the roundup, Michael Smith wrote an article for ""Cross Timbers Herpetologist"" in which he recalls noticing ""...an unusual smell ... like bad cologne and also like something gone bad."" Throughout the tour the smell keeps coming back to him, he writes, until he realizes what it is: ""...the musk, feces, and blood of a thousand terrified snakes, half-covered with sprays of deodorant from Jaycees working the pits."" In the ""research pit,"" snakes are weighed, measured, and probed to determine sex. Many have their venom extracted in the ""milking pit,"" ostensibly for scientific research and antivenin production. However, according to the Kentucky Reptile Zoo, which specializes in venom research and education, abused or gassed snakes ""are not viable ... Considering how dangerous gasoline is, venom produced from snakes collected this way should never be used in any product that might be used in humans..."" One might add that it is unwise to eat these snakes at the popular snake-meat-eating contest and barbecue cook-off. In the ""safety and handling demonstration pit,"" a Jaycee walks among hundreds of snakes, carelessly kicking them aside, trying to provoke them to rattle and strike. When this fails, the Jaycee may select a snake for special treatment. A rattlesnake's face gives almost no clue to its experience of fear or pain, making it hard for most people to feel empathy. But if people are willing to take a closer look at the rattlesnake trying to hide its head under its coils after being tormented and having given up his fight to survive, they might understand what it's going through. Just like people, rattlesnakes have fully developed central nervous systems, but they lack vocal chords and cannot cry out in pain. Finally, in the ""skinning pit,"" snakes are held down on a tree stump and decapitated with one or more machete blows. Schoolchildren watch from the galleries above. According to Smith, ""each machete blow brought a mixture of exclamations and laughter. ... Blood from this and other killing sessions covered the floor and the skinning table in clots of gore, and twisting rattlesnake bodies were hung to be gutted and skinned, still moving as if trying to get away."" Smith notes that one child asked to pet a beheaded snake, and a pit member held up a snake's body to oblige the child. If children learn that it's OK to hurt and kill animals for fun, what is to stop them from doing the same to people? What are they learning about the value of life, and how does this fit in with the Jaycee philosophy? Psychologists say that people who murder often tortured animals as children; there is a link between violence against animals and violence against people. Photos from Sweetwater roundups are particularly chilling because the facial expressions of participants are a mix of hatred, fear and pleasure. In one, a man holds an automatic nail gun and has a snake pinned to a chopping block, looking as if he wants to cause the snake as much agony as possible. Another photo shows beauty pageant winner Miss Snake Charmer 2014 in her crown and sash, holding long snake tongs in the air, with a huge rattlesnake clamped at the end, his head bloodied. Miss Snake Charmer hangs back, her face contorted in fear, her mouth open in a scream. She is 16 years old. How can such abuse of an animal be anything but damaging to this young lady's spirit? The traditional roundups of Sweetwater need to end. The Jaycees could create a festival that raises money for the community and celebrates the rattlesnake as an icon of the American West. In other states where rattlesnakes live, the transition from roundup to wildlife festival has already happened. One crucial purpose of rattlesnake and wildlife festivals should be to show children that all animals must be treated with kindness and respect. With young people being drawn to environmental science, conservation and wildlife biology, festivals provide networking opportunities and contact with professionals in these fields of interest. Not far from Sweetwater, on March 8 and 9, 2014, the inaugural Texas Rattlesnake Festival was held at the Dell Diamond in Round Rock. The animals on display were not taken from the wild, but bred in captivity, and handled with care so they were not stressed. There were demonstrations of the proper and humane technique for extracting venom. And children could leave their handprints in bright, colorful paint rather than snake blood. One visitor said, ""It was very nice to be in a comfortable and safe environment with venomous animals so close by. And to be around so many people who truly appreciated them. The (traditional) roundups are tense and stressful, but this was really nice.""","Wendy Townsend: 4,000 pounds of rattlesnakes slaughtered at Jaycee event .

"(CNN) -- Four men behind what officials describe as the most serious Islamist terrorist plot ever hatched in Scandinavia were convicted of the plot Monday in a courthouse in Glostrup, just outside of Copenhagen, Denmark. Three Swedish nationals and a Tunisian resident of Sweden were found guilty of targeting Jyllands Posten, the Copenhagen-based newspaper responsible for publishing controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. The court ruled there was no doubt about their plan to attack and sentenced each of the men to 12 years in prison. Counterterrorism officials in the United States and Scandinavia believe the plot was directed by al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan. Authorities contend the four suspects planned a gun attack on the newspaper, to be followed by ""the execution"" of hostages. It is possible a reception due to be attended by Denmark's crown prince in the same building as the newspaper was the intended target, a prosecutor said in court. The reception was to be held hours after the terrorist cell was arrested, but the prosecutor said there was no evidence the men were specifically targeting the crown prince. The cell's plans were thwarted by a joint operation of Swedish and Danish security services, which tracked the suspects in December 2010 as they drove from Sweden to Denmark with a submachine gun, a silencer, and several dozen 9mm submachine gun cartridges, authorities say. The four men convicted -- Mounir Dhahri, 46, a Tunisian citizen; Munir Awad, 31, of Lebanese descent; Sahbi Zalouti, 39, of Tunisian descent; and Omar Aboelazm, 32, of Egyptian descent -- are charged with plotting to kill a large number of people at the newspaper. They have denied the charges. Western security services believe the plot was part of a broader al Qaeda conspiracy, authorized by Osama bin Laden, to strike Europe with operations mirroring the Mumbai, India, attack in November 2008, which killed nearly 200 people. Dhahri, the suspected ringleader of the cell, Awad, and Zalouti had all traveled to Pakistan in early 2010. Awad and Zalouti, traveling separately, were arrested by Pakistani authorities in August 2010 before they could reach the North Waziristan region and were subsequently deported, according to a Swedish counterterrorism source. During the trial, prosecutors pointed to a map showing Miramshah in North Waziristan and told the jury the plot had links to Pakistan, according to Elisabeth Haslund, a reporter for Berlingske newspaper, who attended the proceedings. But while the court ruled that Dhahri spent time in Waziristan, few details emerged in court on his movements there. The court heard that Zalouti admitted to Swedish police he wired money from Sweden via Western Union to Dhahri in Bannu, a town bordering North Waziristan, according to Haslund. Dhahri evaded capture in Pakistan, and he is believed to have received training there prior to returning to Europe shortly before the group began to plot their attack, according to the source. At trial, it was revealed that Dhahri traveled back from Pakistan through Athens and Brussels, where Zalouti picked him up in a car. According to prosecutors, they then traveled to Copenhagen to case targets including the Jyllands Posten before traveling on to Stockholm. Awad, the Lebanese-born suspect, had long been on the radar screen of Swedish counterterrorism services. He was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in Somalia in 2006 before fleeing the country when Ethiopian troops launched a military operation against Islamist militants there, according to a Danish security source. By October 2010, Swedish security services had begun tracking the cell, placing listening devices in the men's apartments. A Swedish counterterrorism source told CNN the group did not settle on attacking the newspaper until shortly before the planned attack, and often squabbled. Prosecutors stated that in the weeks before the plot was thwarted, there were 75 calls from a SIM card used by Dhahri to a number in Pakistan linked to ""Masror,"" an individual suspected of involvement in terrorist activity. In court Monday, state prosecutor Gyrithe Ulrich argued the men deserved a significant prison sentence because they were ""fulfilling a task ordered from Pakistan"" and came close to carrying out their operation, according to Haslund. On the evening of December 28, 2010, three of the cell members set off from Stockholm in a rental car with Dhahri at the wheel, authorities said. Security services continuously monitored their progress, including from the air. Zalouti bailed from the journey at the last minute, and was later arrested in Stockholm, according to court documents. The court heard that after his arrest, he claimed to Swedish police he was aware that Dhahri -- his best friend -- and the others were planning an attack on the Jyllands Posten newspaper, but wanted out, according to Haslund. Taking the stand in court, Zalouti said that at the time he only suspected a possible plot and had thought about calling police to alert them of his concerns after getting out of the car in Sweden, Haslund said. It was just after 2 a.m. when the vehicle carrying the other cell members crossed the iconic Oresund Bridge connecting the two countries, authorities say. When they reached Copenhagen, they were initially unable to find the address where they planned to sleep. Just after 10 a.m. on December 29, Danish police, concerned the men might be about to try launch their operation, moved in to make the arrests. Authorities say officials had already taken precautions. When they learned the group was planning to travel to Denmark, they secretly disabled their weapons, according to a Swedish counterterrorism source. Plastic wrist strips were also found in their car, according to court documents, and security services said they believed the materials were going to be used to handcuff hostages. Security services believe the plan was to try to take up to 200 journalists hostage at the newspaper and execute many of them, a Swedish counterterrorism source told CNN. The equivalent of $20,000 in cash was also recovered from the suspects, and a pistol and ammunition were found in one of their apartments, according to court documents. A Swedish counterterrorism source has told CNN that investigations have revealed a complex set of connections between the plotters and a network linked to Ilyas Kashmiri, a senior Pakistani al Qaeda operative who Western intelligence believe orchestrated al Qaeda's plans to hit Europe with Mumbai-style attacks. Dhahri and Awad had a connection to ""Farid,"" a Stockholm-based militant of Moroccan descent who is suspected of acting as facilitator for Kashmiri's terrorist network, according to a Swedish counterterrorism source. At trial, the prosecutor stated that in the days before the cell set off for Sweden, Dhahri was in touch by phone five times with Farid, using Zalouti's phone. Also involved with Kashmiri's network was David Headley, an American of Pakistani descent who pleaded guilty two years ago to helping plot the Mumbai attacks. According to an interview of Headley by India's National Investigation Agency that was obtained by CNN, Headley met with Farid in 2009 in relation to a plot Headley himself was planning against the Jyllands Posten newspaper. The newspaper and its cartoonists have been targeted by several plots in recent years, including one by a Norwegian al Qaeda cell that was broken up in July 2010. Kashmiri was reported killed in a drone strike in June 2011. An attack strategy document seized on an alleged al Qaeda recruit in Berlin last spring indicates the terrorist group still hopes to launch a gun and hostage execution attack in Europe because of the publicity and fear such attacks would create.","Each of the four is sentenced to 12 years in prison .

"(CNN) -- A compilation album commemorating the 50th anniversary of the human rights organization Amnesty International features some musicians you might expect: activist artists like Sting, Elvis Costello and the Dave Matthews Band. But it's the singers you wouldn't expect who are causing the biggest stir: namely, Miley Cyrus and Ke$ha. Even more surprising? The pop princesses join 80 or so fellow musicians in offering their renditions of classic tunes by the venerable Bob Dylan. On the four-CD collection, ""Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International,"" Cyrus sinks her teeth into ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"" from the legendary songwriter's 1975 album, ""Blood on the Tracks."" Ke$ha's sparse cover of Dylan's 1963 recording ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"" has found a fan in Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, who admits it's one of his favorite cuts on the compilation. Morello himself contributes a haunting take of ""Blind Willie McTell"" under his solo alter ego, the Nightwatchman. ""It's been my dream to be on a record with Miley Cyrus and Ke$ha, and I commend them,"" the guitarist said with a hint of a smile. ""I, too, am nondenominational in my activism. If you're down for the cause, then the Nightwatchman is down with you."" ""I think that Amnesty International believes in everything Bob Dylan stands for,"" added Ziggy Marley, who puts a reggae twist to ""Blowin' in the Wind."" ""The best way to honor what he has done is not by imitating it but translating it into your own voice."" In 1962, Amnesty International evolved into a movement advocating freedom, justice and human dignity for people around the globe. That same year, Bob Dylan released his self-titled debut album for Columbia Records. Over the course of the next half-century, he has chronicled social issues and the human condition with an empathetic voice. ""The idea that Bob Dylan started at the same time as Amnesty International, and now we're doing the songs of Bob Dylan for Amnesty International to celebrate their 50th year, is something that is significant in the universe,"" Marley said. Even though Joe Perry has enjoyed a lengthy career with Aerosmith, he has yet to meet his fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, despite donating a bluesy version of Dylan's ""Man of Peace"" to the Amnesty project. ""He's the enigmatic Bob Dylan, and I've never crossed paths,"" Perry confided. ""A good friend got me a signed 8x10 for my birthday. It says, 'To Joe, keep your hands on the wheel. From Bob.' It's one of my prized possessions.""","Amnesty International celebrated its 50th anniversary with a compilation album .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazilian police have arrested three people suspected of killing at least two women, eating parts of their bodies and using their remains to make stuffed meat pies sold in the northeastern town of Garanhuns. The three suspects -- 51-year-old Jorge Beltrao Negroponte, his wife, Cristina da Silveira, and his mistress, Bruna da Silva-- were arrested Wednesday and have confessed to the crimes, the police said on local television. Interviewed behind bars, Negroponte told SBT Television that he followed the instructions of voices in his head. ""I did certain things for purification, to protect people and deliver them to God,"" he told SBT on Sunday. He confirmed that he and his two companions ate the flesh of the women ""to purify them."" Police said the suspects lured the two young women to their house by offering them jobs as a nannies. Authorities were first alerted to the situation when the suspects tried to use the credit card of a woman who had disappeared. According to Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, a 5-year-old girl living with the suspects showed the police where they could find the remains of the bodies. The remains of two women were found buried in the backyard of the house, police said. Police said they believe the girl is the daughter of another woman who disappeared in 2008. According to the newspaper report, Negroponte's wife was known in the town for her meat pies. During the police deposition, she said she stuffed them with human flesh and sold them to neighbors, schools and hospitals. Police believe the number of victims could be greater than 10.","The suspects are accused of killing two women and using their remains to make meat pies .

"(CNN) -- He was a 20-year-old male model. His lover was a 65-year-old man who was a television journalist. They were from Portugal, visiting New York City. The older partner broke off the relationship and ended up mutilated and dead. Now, almost two years later, a New York judge has sentenced model Renato Seabra to 25 years to life in prison -- the maximum sentence -- for the grisly second-degree murder of Carlos Antonio De Castro in their InterContinental Hotel room in Times Square. ""This was a brutal and sadistic crime, where Renato Seabra bludgeoned, choked, and mutilated his victim before murdering him,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said following the jury's guilty verdict this month. ""But the jury's verdict now, finally, holds Seabra accountable. It is particularly tragic that Carlos Castro was not only ... betrayed by his spurned lover, but met a very painful and violent end far from his home,"" Vance said. Castro was found bludgeoned and castrated in the hotel room in January 2011, a law enforcement source told CNN at the time. Seabra, now 23, attacked Castro because he was angry that Castro had ended their relationship, prosecutors said. Court document: Model confessed to choking and castrating victim . Following the prolonged attack, Seabra showered, took about $1,600 from Castro's wallet, and hung a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, prosecutors said. On his way out of the hotel, Seabra bumped into a friend of Castro's in the lobby, who later testified that Seabra said Castro ""won't be leaving the room,"" prosecutors said. Castro's body was found shortly after an acquaintance appeared at the hotel asking to see him, saying she had been in contact with him earlier in the day, but was unable to reach him for some time, officials said. A hotel employee found Castro's unclothed body on the room floor on January 7, 2011, and the cause of death was later determined to be blunt injuries to the head and neck compression, prosecutors said. Seabra was taken into custody after he was spotted leaving a New York hospital where he received treatment for lacerations to his wrists, authorities said. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation at Bellevue, the source said at the time. The day after the murder, Seabra confessed to the crime at Bellevue Hospital, prosecutors said.

"(CNN) -- Monday night's tribute to Robin Williams at the Emmy Awards was moving and powerful and funny, like the man himself. When I first heard the news about Williams' apparent suicide, like millions of his fans, I felt heartbroken. He was so brave, talented, funny and brilliant. What a loss of a great actor and a great man. In days that followed, I learned that Williams had been battling severe depression. This brought back memories of my own battle with depression many years ago when I was a teenager. I never told anyone about it because I was terrified that I would be judged. But the time has come for me to share this with my family, friends and the world. Earlier this year when I read that six students from a high school in Virginia committed suicide during a three-year period, my eyes welled with tears and I felt incredibly sad. I knew I could not remain silent anymore. I didn't want to read about another student taking his own life who had to deal with the same intense, complicated challenges that I dealt with. I called the school district and was invited to speak at its Teen Suicide Prevention Summit. I felt humbled and honored, and scared at the same time. After speaking at the summit, guests of all ages lined the aisle to tell me how my message gave them hope. In essence, what I shared in that speech was that depression can be overcome, but it takes a village. You never know what sharing your concern may mean to someone in pain. My pastor recently told me I have become a living testimony of how a support network can help others find rest in the midst of storm. Living life as a husband, a father and a journalist assigned to overnight shifts is not easy. Even the best of us will be tested to their limits. Some days, I don't know if I'm getting it right at all. Those who suffer depression have it tough. I would like to share how I found hope in the midst of my storm. I created a system for myself to remain focused, LASER focused, on staying free from storm. For young people who face storms of their own, here's my story. I was that kid, in the midst of storm. I am the son of proud immigrant parents who drilled into me a sense of duty to repay the opportunity afforded me. With American ""success"" comes the responsibility to accept the full weight of their dreams of a better life for their children. I thank my parents for setting standards that stay with me to this day. My parents moved us to a nice D.C. suburban neighborhood surrounded by opportunity, but it was isolating. At age 16, I fell into a deep and dark emotional hole. The stress of school, sports and assimilation became too much to bear. I felt guilty for wanting to abandon my cultural heritage. I stopped feeling loved. I quit caring. I would later learn that this despair I felt was actually a suffering from depression. But at the time, I only knew that I was in unimaginable darkness and loneliness, even if I were surrounded by people. Going public with depression . One day after school, I was at home babysitting my napping, 7-year-old sister. I became overwhelmed with anxiety. Tears rolled down my face. I was scared, but didn't know what I would do. I picked up the phone and called a classmate named Lori Lee. I don't recall exactly what I said, but I know I was at my end. She listened intently. After we hung up, she called a teacher, Mrs. Jo Henry, in my high school and within minutes Jo appeared on my doorstep. Suddenly, I was not alone. She called my parents, and suddenly I was surrounded by a village. A village that gave me the courage not to hide from them my pain. I held on to that village and never looked back. I used those experiences to form a list of guiding principles that I have honed through life that I use to weather those everyday storms of life. I call it the LASER system. LASER is an acronym for Listen, Assess, Support, Execute and Respond. It's designed to provide a systematic, positive and consistent approach to help individuals endure challenges and perform through stress. Mental health help: Where to turn . In my role at CNN as a Senior News Editor, I help decide what gets covered. Unfortunately, all too frequently, I cover stories of youngsters, professional athletes and personalities who didn't find a way out of despair and die tragically. Robin Williams, sadly, is one of many on the list. The common thread we often learn in those cases is that there was no village. There was no network. There was no one there to Listen and Act, to show them that life is full of possibilities and promise, and there are people who love them. That they have value. I write to reach those who find themselves slipping, and to urge those around them to help. You can manage through crisis. How? Listen (intently to when someone is in trouble) Assess (what the problem could be) Support (the person to live and dream) Execute (a plan to get help) Respond (if initial actions don't help) The first letter in each of the words just mentioned forms the word laser, like a beam of light that can help you in the dark. I was on the verge of being defeated more times than I care to count. At each challenge, I found a way out of the storm with the village. I was armed with a LASER focus that in life I am not alone, that storms come and go. Can you be a part of a village to someone? Can you be their haven from storms? The difference begins with you. Each and every one of you. To anyone who might be struggling -- you're not alone. Struggle is natural. It's OK to be afraid. It's OK to hurt. What's not OK is keeping those feelings to yourself. It takes courage to share those feelings. Reach out to your village. To those around someone who's struggling, know that it took me 10 years to fully share with my school friend how her single, simple act of making a phone call to a caring teacher set a chain of events that changed the course of my life. Who would have thought that that kid who struggled to succeed academically and socially then would be flourishing at arguably the most prestigious and influential media organization in the world? I thank God every day that someone showed up with an umbrella in the midst of my storm, and gave me a haven, and that a village came to make me believe in my promise and my purpose, and that I can look in the mirror every day now with LASER focus, with hope, in spite of the storms, and use my principles to live and thrive. My heart goes out to Robin Williams' wife and family. For all those who are struggling with depression, don't slip into the darkness, because it doesn't have to be that way.","Rick Martin: When I heard the news about Robin Williams' death I felt heartbroken .

"(CNN) -- In 1966, British soccer legend Geoff Hurst booted a right-foot shot against Germany in the World Cup championship game. The ball struck the top crossbar and rifled down near the goal line before spinning out. Confusion ensued; it was impossible to tell if the ball had crossed the plane. Eventually, officials awarded the goal, and England secured its first and only World Cup victory. Try not to remind German fans. ""They can't take it away now anyway,"" Hurst told Britain's The Telegraph last year. ""It is in the book."" He's right, but soccer's governing bodies are doing their best to ensure a similar controversy over a so-called ""ghost goal"" never happens again. And as fate would have it, they're turning to a German company for help. A new system . According to official estimates, FIFA is paying a small German start-up nearly $3.5 million to operate its new goal-line technology in the 2014 World Cup, which kicks off Thursday in Brazil. The company, called GoalControl, would install 14 cameras in each of the 12 World Cup stadiums that triangulate the motion of the ball with maximum precision: up to 500 images per second. With that tracking, plus sensors on the goal line, GoalControl can instantly alert a referee when the ball crosses the line. There's no need to consult a replay booth or another official; the referee in charge merely looks at their smartwatch. In other words, say ""tchau"" to ghost goals in Brazil. ""The cameras are connected to a powerful image-processing computer system which tracks the movement of all objects on the pitch and filters out the players, referees and all disturbing objects,"" a GoalControl representative said. If the system registers that the ball has crossed the goal line, it can send a vibration and a visual ""GOAL"" signal to referees' watches within a second. GoalControl says the idea was developed by Dirk Broichhausen, a company founder, after he attended a soccer match in Germany in which there was a dispute over a goal. He began contacting technicians the next day. For Broichhausen's fellow Germans, though, the invention came nearly a half-century late. The tipping point . For years, FIFA President Sepp Blatter dragged his feet before introducing technology to the soccer field. At various points, he complained it would lead to dramatic increases in play stoppage, or that it limits human officials. Two things changed his mind: the quick, accurate nature of new systems such as GoalControl, and a high-profile controversy involving two familiar opponents. Forty-four years after Hurst's 1966 miracle, Germany met England during a World Cup knockout match in South Africa. In the first half, English midfielder Frank Lampard sent a powerful strike toward the goal, which -- of course -- hit the top frame, dropped near the goal line, and bounced out. A goal was not given. Unlike 1966, however, instant replay revealed the truth: the ball had clearly crossed the line, and England was unjustly denied a goal. Germany won, 4-1. But for FIFA and its president, it was the ultimate embarrassment. Blatter said Lampard's ghost goal was the moment he changed his mind. ""For me as FIFA president it became evident the moment what happened in South Africa in 2010,"" he said at FIFA headquarters after the incident. ""...I have to say 'thank you Lampard'. I was completely down in South Africa when I saw that it really shocked me, it took me a day to react."" Debate rages on . Still, there are vocal opponents to introducing technology to soccer officiating. UEFA President Michel Platini is the most prominent. He controls popular European tournaments including the UEFA Champions League. Earlier this year, Platini told CNN he remains staunchly against goal line technology, philosophically and practically. ""I prefer that we have more referees to see if there is a penalty foul and if the ball is going over the line. We don't need perfect cameras to see the ball,"" he said. Platini also mentioned the high cost, estimating that implementing the technology in the UEFA Champions League could cost â‚¬52 million, or nearly $70 million. ""I prefer to give these millions of Euros to grass-roots, to the young players in football, to some infrastructures so they can play football,"" he said. Cost is also a barrier for Major League Soccer. In a statement, league officials said they have not found the right mix of ease, effectiveness and price concerning goal-line technology, although they support its use in theory. ""We have met with multiple goal-line technology system manufacturers and have been carefully monitoring plans to implement the system,"" the league said. ""As of today, the time required to purchase, receive, install and properly test the equipment precludes MLS from considering the approved system for use, but we will continue to monitor the progress."" Most professional American sports leagues use technology to aid officials in some form. Most recently, Major League Baseball expanded its instant replay rules this season. At any rate, one man is overjoyed with the new technological developments: World Cup hero Geoff Hurst. ""If we had this system 50 years ago, it would have shown quite clearly the ball was at least a foot over the line,"" he said.","After years of debate, FIFA introduces goal-line technology to the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Prepare for pangs of envy. A torn page in a cheap, tatty frame has sold at auction for an eye-watering $68,000 (A$74,000), plus commission. Sydney auctioneer Mark Owens confesses he still knows very little about lot 11, which appears to be a page of the Quran. ""I've never even spoken directly to the person who put it in apart from a couple of e-mails,"" he said. ""He said it came from an estate in Melbourne. I don't think he knew a great deal about it. How old it is, I still don't know."" The double-sided page was bought by an anonymous dealer in London who presumably knew it was worth more -- a lot more -- than the pre-auction estimate of $37 to $55 (A$40 -- A$60). Owens had a clue it might arouse some interest. A few months ago, he sold another page of the Quran -- which he says was in worse condition -- for $27,000 (A$29,000). It had been previously bought for less than $10 at a local auction. Since the weekend sale, half a dozen other people have emailed Owens with photos of their own tattered pages. ""I like to think we're becoming world experts without having any knowledge whatsoever,"" he laughed. His auction house, Bargain Hunt Auctions, sells everything from fridges to paintings, many from deceased estates, and mostly for less than $100. On this sale alone, the company made about $22,000 (A$24,000) in commission, before tax.

"(CNN) -- Atef 'Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash is a 32-year-old Libyan blogger, government critic, and a father of two young children. He has not been seen since a February 18 gathering near Benghazi. Amnesty International said in a briefing paper issued Tuesday that Al-Atrash is one of many people who have vanished in what they say is a ""campaign of enforced disappearances"" -- a practice by pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces trying to squelch the opposition movement. The paper -- titled ""Libya: Detainees, Disappeared and Missing"" -- explores more than 30 cases of people who have disappeared since protests started in the war-torn North African nation. Among those missing are political activists and ""those suspected of being rebel fighters or supporters of fighters."" ""It appears that there is a systematic policy to detain anyone suspected of opposition to Colonel al-Gaddafi's rule, hold them incommunicado, and transfer them to his strongholds in western Libya,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""Given the circumstances of their enforced disappearance there is every reason to believe that these individuals are at serious risk of torture and ill-treatment."" Smart called on Gadhafi to ""halt this outrageous campaign and order his forces to abide by international law."" Amnesty says the documented cases ""are believed to represent only a small proportion of the total number of people who have been detained or have disappeared"" recently in Gadhafi's custody. Recent video indicates the extent of the problem. It shows prisoners roughed up and taunted by Gadhafi forces. Some of them say there were demonstrators and others deny it. ""The true number is impossible to establish, as the authorities in Tripoli generally do not divulge information about detainees they are holding and because many areas of the country are not accessible for independent reporting. Some relatives of detainees are also unwilling to publicize their names for fear of possible reprisals,"" Amnesty said. Libyan officials did not immediately respond to efforts to obtain a response to the Amnesty International report. The cases include ""three broad categories,"" the report says: . -- Government critics, pro-democracy activists, writers and others detained in the days before the February 17 ""peaceful demonstrations"" across Libya. ""They appear to have been arrested by the authorities as a pre-emptive strike in an effort to nip the protests in the bud following the public protests that had caused the downfall of longstanding repressive governments in Tunisia and Egypt, two of Libya's neighbors."" -- Anti-government protestors and youths who went missing on February 20, when the Kateeba al-Fadheel, a pro-Gadhafi special forces unit, was forced to evacuate from a military compound in Benghazi after violent clashes with protesters. ""Amnesty International has documented the cases of nine men and boys who have not been seen since they went to the Kateeba compound area on evening of 20 February 2011, including four teenagers under 18."" -- People captured in or near Ben Jawad, where there had been ""intermittent fighting."" ""Amnesty International has obtained information about a number of individuals who went missing in the area between Ajdabiya and Ben Jawad, west of Benghazi. Some are believed to have been fighters, others to be civilians who went to the area in order to assist the wounded, and still others people who may have been onlookers."" Amnesty said foreign journalists who had been detained and released ""have reported that they were beaten and assaulted and threatened with execution, in some cases even being subjected to mock execution, and have expressed concern about Libyans who they saw being mistreated in detention."" It said there are fears too that some detainees may be held ""as bargaining chips or to put pressure on their relatives and friends to deter them from joining the opposition."" The agency said its concerns ""are heightened by the long pattern of gross and widespread human rights violations"" that have marked Gadhafi's rule. ""These include enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, prolonged arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, as well as severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the rights to freedom of assembly and association."" Amnesty is urging the government to release peaceful protesters, ensure than any alleged captured fighters be treated humanely and given access to the Red Cross, and grant ""unhindered access"" to humanitarian groups. As for Atef 'Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash, his family fears for his safety. One relative told Amnesty that ""he has simply disappeared,"" and speculates he was taken to areas under the control of pro-Gadhafi forces. ""We kept trying to call his phone but never got through, until some days later when a man who spoke with a western (western Libyan) accent answered and said: 'this is what happens to those who throw stones at us'. But Atef had never even thrown stones,"" the relative said.","Amnesty International looks at more than 30 disappearances .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- What do the Apollo space missions, laser eye surgery and sustainable cocoa have in common? These are just some of the historic breakthroughs that IBM research labs across the world have helped become a reality over the years. But the prestigious tech firm had a glaring omission on their global map. Africa is now the fastest growing continent in the world, according a recent report from the African Development Bank. And yet IBM didn't have a single hub there -- until recently. Last year, IBM opened its 12th research facility in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, its first in the continent. Spearheading this innovation center is Uyi Stewart, a Nigerian scientist who has spent more than 20 years overseas working on software answers to real-world problems. Armed with this international experience, the researcher has now returned to the continent to help create innovative solutions for African everyday challenges. ""It's easy to talk about giving back but when the opportunity presents itself -- such as IBM Research Africa that allows you to create innovations in science and technology to begin to make a proper impact in the lives of more than a billion people -- I don't know what more can stop anybody,"" says Stewart. Conquering the ""new world"" As a teenager Stewart was interested in computer sciences. But his country's lack of infrastructure prompted him to look abroad as a way of"" intellectual escape."" The bright Nigerian managed to secure a scholarship at the University of Cambridge in England and with only a plane ticket and bus fare he set off for, what he called, ""the new world."" After completing his education in England, Stewart moved to the U.S. where he began his career in software and services research. Stewart went on to work in IBM's Services Innovation Lab -- an international program where he was responsible for the technical strategy at eight global facilities. Today, having returned to the continent, he wants to leverage the strong growth of Africa's emerging markets and continue IBM's longstanding tradition in research breakthroughs. ""As I build and design I have got to understand that the majority of my people live [on] under less than two dollars a day,"" he says. ""[The] majority of my people only speak one language -- so think about those things -- that whole holistic view allows technological innovation to be relevant to the community. That is what we're calling Africanized solutions."" ""Let's come back"" That approach is central to Stewart's work. ""All innovators in the continent of Africa should be problem centric,"" he says. ""What problems are we trying to solve and ask yourself, at the end, 'who is going to use it?' If you ask those two questions then we can begin to talk about sustainability."" In recent years the Kenyan government has actively encouraged ICT development in the country. Christened the ""African Silicon Savannah,"" the $9.2 billion project known as Konza City is an ambitious undertaking that could help Kenya become a technology and innovation hotspot. The country's technological boom has also been spurred by a rise in the number of innovation centers, where young coders and aspiring entrepreneurs join forces, network and work on their trailblazing ideas. Similar hubs have also mushroomed across the continent in recent years -- from Nigeria to Tanzania and Egypt to Madagascar. But while there is a boom in tech spaces across Africa, many of the apps created there often fail to take off. Stewart says tech entrepreneurs need to be cautious about starting businesses without any commercial foresight. ""Sustainability of innovation comes from commercial viability,"" he says. ""If you innovate for fun, then we wouldn't be where we are today and I think that is the kind of ecosystem we see right now."" After more than two decades abroad, Stewart is committed to reverse the continent's so-called ""brain drain,"" the exodus of brilliant minds relocating to countries outside Africa. ""I am part of the diaspora and I am home,"" he says. ""And I am saying 'let's come back, there is just so much'; the winds of change [are] massive -- let's come back and make a difference,"" adds Stewart. ""There is a tremendous potential for skill of impact when you innovate.""","IBM research has opened its 12th research facility in Kenya's capital, Nairobi .

"(CNN) -- The online coupon market has been exploding in the last year or so. Just look at some of the startups offering this service: Groupon, LivingSocial, Scoutmob, OpenTable, zozi, SCVNGR LevelUp, viagogo, Google Offers and many others. Now, welcome a new member of the digital-coupon club: Facebook Deals. The massive social network, which has 600 million members, announced on Tuesday a pilot project that will let local businesses offer discounts through Facebook. But with so many group-discount sites already out there, is Facebook's version offering anything unique? Here's a breakdown of how the service works and how it differs, at least a little bit, from some of its competition. What are group discount sites? First, the basics. Group discounts are essentially digital coupons, sometimes with strings attached. At Groupon, a certain number of people must purchase a deal before it's ""unlocked,"" for example. Some, such as Scoutmob, are mobile deals based on a person's location, and offer deals on nearby restaurants, spas or other services. Others, such as LivingSocial, are more generic. They're basically coupons sent by e-mail. What is Facebook Deals? Facebook Deals aims to make the idea of digital coupons more social. With so many millions of users, it's hard to argue that Facebook isn't in a good position to do this. Users must purchase a coupon online before using it in real life. When they decide to buy, an item is automatically posted on their Facebook news feed, alerting all of their Facebook friends about the deal. Where is Facebook Deals available? For now, Facebook Deals is only being offered in five cities: Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; San Diego, California, and San Francisco, California. Facebook is testing the feature in these places first, and says it may expand to others at a later date. Some of Facebook's competitors in online coupons are available more widely. Groupon works in dozens of U.S. and Canadian cities. Google Offers, however, which is another pilot project, is so far only available in Portland, Oregon. What's the incentive to use Facebook Deals? Many of these online coupon sites use video game mechanics to try to entice people into purchasing stuff. LevelUp, a Boston and Philadelphia pilot from the social network SCVNGR, works somewhat like an airline frequent-flier program. The more a user participates, the more he or she ""levels up,"" giving him or her access to premium deals. Groupon is similar in that it requires a bunch of people to buy a coupon before it's activated. That encourages friends to spread the word about the deal, if they want to be able to use it. Facebook Deals doesn't do any of that -- at least not yet. So why would anyone use Facebook Deals? Because they're offering coupons. And because they're on the world's biggest social network. Facebook says the goal of the deals isn't necessarily even that they're deals -- it's that people will be able to plan events on Facebook. ""While many Deals on Facebook offer discounts, it's more important to us that you find interesting experiences around you to do with friends,"" Facebook's Emily White writes on Facebook's blog. In other words, expect deals on group-centric activities, such as concerts or horseback riding. Are Facebook's discounts as good as Groupon's? Doesn't look like it. Groupon claims to offer discounts of 50% to 90%. Most of Facebook's coupons for Atlanta range from 13% to 75% off, with more of them seeming to fall on the lower end of that scale. Again, Facebook says the social aspect of these coupons is almost more important than the discount itself. ""If your primary reason for doing something is getting together with friends, I don't know if a discount is necessary,"" White told the Wall Street Journal. ""We are not looking for the deep discount customer."" The integration with Facebook is what the site sees as key: ""A lot of deal sites get that deals are social,"" White told The New York Times' Bits Blog. ""But I wouldn't say they are really well integrated with Facebook."" Where can you see Facebook Deals? In your news feed. On the Facebook Deals page. On the Facebook ""Pages"" sites of various businesses. Or in your e-mail inbox, if you sign up for that. Other sites, like LivingSocial and Groupon, also send out daily e-mails about the discounts they offer. How do you pay for Facebook Deals? With a credit card, with PayPal or with Facebook Credits, Facebook's own currency that, for the first time, will be used to buy real-world goods. Users buy deals in advance and then print out a coupon that's used to redeem the deal. Some other deal sites and apps let users buy discounts on-the-go. Scoutmob, for example, which is available in 13 U.S. cities, offers mobile coupons once a person is in the store or restaurant where they intend to use a deal. Users just pull up the coupon on their smartphones, show the waiter or store clerk that they've ""unlocked"" the deal (for free) and then get that discount applied to their bill -- without having to make any payment beforehand. Paying up front -- the Facebook and Groupon model -- annoys some users. Why is there so much competition in this space? Because there's apparently lots of money to be made. Ever since Google, in December, reportedly offered to buy Groupon for $6 billion, social coupons have been expanding like mad. As is often the case in tech, once start-ups in a new sector get hot, the big companies -- Google and Facebook in this case -- join the party late, hoping either to put out better products or capitalize on their huge user bases.","Facebook on Tuesday announces a Groupon competitor called Deals .

"(CNN) -- For ""True Blood's"" series finale on Sunday, fans received a wedding, a funeral, and ... an infomercial starring Eric and Pam? Even after seven seasons, ""True Blood"" kept fans guessing right on through to the end. Whether the show's fans appreciated those twists is another story. For some, the ending was all they could've asked for after sticking by the show for seven seasons. For others, ""True Blood's"" conclusion just might rank up there with the worst finales of all time. One of the big surprises was the death of a major -- and we mean major -- character. Yes, the demise of Tara (Rutina Wesley) and Alcide (Joe Manganiello) were shocking to viewers earlier in the season, but they were secondary characters. If you were told before the final season that Stephen Moyer's Bill Compton wouldn't make it out alive, would you have believed it? Granted, the show has been building up to Bill's death the last few episodes, but it still seemed like something that wouldn't actually happen. Most were convinced that in typical ""True Blood"" fashion, writers would pull out a twist in the final act and he would end up living. But surprisingly, they had the guts to actually go through with it. While Sookie's (Anna Paquin) feelings for Bill have definitely flip-flopped throughout the series, there was no doubting who had her heart last night. All she wanted was for her one true love to live. But Bill's mind was made up. He knew they wouldn't be able to stay away from one another, and he wanted Sookie to have the life he felt she deserved -- one with a family, something a vampire cannot give her. (Being dead and all makes it kind of difficult to reproduce.) His martyrdom and his speech were romantic, but then he asked Sookie, while she stood there crying over his impending death, to do the actual killing. Annoyed fans had one word for his choice: selfish. Yet before Bill could say his parting words, ""True Blood"" took an unexpected detour and threw a human-vampire wedding. Baby-vamp Jessica (Deborah Ann Woll) and Hoyt (Jim Parrack) decided to get married. Jessica and Hoyt are one couple that fans have rooted for, and while the gesture was sweet -- it allowed Bill to walk Jessica down the aisle before his untimely death -- it was still a bit of a rush, and took away from the main event. As one impatient fan put it, ""This is cute and all BUT ARE WE REALLY WASTING VALUABLE TIME ON JESS AND HOYT?!"" That question became all the more pointed upon the realization that Nelsan Ellis' Lafayette didn't even get one line of dialogue in the finale. We knew he got his happy ending with James (Nathan Parsons), but couldn't we get just one sassy comeback from him before the credits rolled? Apparently, there just wasn't enough time, not with Sookie donning a black dress to meet Bill at the graveyard for his funeral. Paquin and Moyer gave stellar performances as they said their final goodbyes to one another (although the two actors get to stay happily married to one another in real life). And then, after a time jump of roughly four years after Bill's death, the town of Bon Temps became a much brighter place. Jason (Ryan Kwanten) ended up with Brigette (Ashley Hinshaw), and a loving father to three young children. It probably wasn't what you would expect from the promiscuous ladies' man we met back in Season 1, but seeing him bonding with his children was adorable. These couples looked positively peaceful too: Jessica and Hoyt, Andy and Holly (Lauren Bowles), Arlene (Carrie Preston) and vampire Keith (Riley Smith), plus Sam (Sam Trammell) and Nicole (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) with two kids now. As for Sookie, she got her happy ending. Viewers never learn the identity of the man Sookie settled down with, but she ends the series pregnant and presumably in love. And with that, HBO closed the coffin on ""True Blood."" ""I don't know if I loved that ending or hated that ending...Maybe a little of both?"" one viewer tweeted amid the chorus of responses, many of which were disappointed. ""Wow True Blood series finale was horrible,"" another fan said. ""I can't believe how much I loved that show in the beginning and how far it fell."" ""May be the only fan who loved the finale,"" chimed in one grateful viewer. ""Thanks #trueblood for 7 great seasons."" The only plot point that seemed to escape viewers' criticism involved Alexander Skarsgard's Eric and Kristin Bauer van Straten's Pam. As suspected, the pair didn't keep the Hepatitis-V cure a secret from the public, and instead started New Blood, a cure and replacement for TruBlood. Their infomercial was definitely a series highlight. ""Eric and Pam need a spinoff show,"" tweeted one fan, as another called for a ""new season of #TrueBlood called #NewBlood and it's the adventures or lives of Eric and Pam."" Whether or not the show lost steam during its seven-year run is irrelevant now. Those who stuck with the series until the end have endured each hardship and tragedy alongside the characters themselves. The finale was appropriately titled ""Thank You."" So thank you, ""True Blood,"" for taking viewers on an unforgettable, bloody ride, and staying true until the very end.","HBO's ""True Blood"" aired its final episode Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Two Canadian women who said they were headed to Atlanta for a week of vacation and shopping were arrested after agents found 75,812 pills of the drug Ecstasy in the trunk of their vehicle at the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday. Officers at Detroit's Ambassador Bridge seized about 53 pounds (24 kilograms) of PCP-laced Ecstasy with a street value in excess of $100,000, authorities said in a statement. The driver of the vehicle, which had a Canadian tag, told an officer at the crossing that the vehicle was hers, the agency said, but it was actually rented. A search began. Officers found what appeared to be tampering with the rear quarter panel areas in the trunk, the agency said. ""Utilizing a fiber-optic scope the officers were able to observe what appeared to be plastic bags secreted inside one of the quarter panels,"" according to the statement. ""Continuing their inspection they discovered more plastic bags hidden in the opposite quarter panel as well."" A field test determined the colored pills were Ecstasy, the agency said. Shennelly Finn and Lashawna Morgan, both 24-year-old Canadian citizens, were arrested and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further investigation and prosecution, authorities said.","Vehicle from Canada stopped in Detroit .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. and Russian ambassadors to the United Nations have exchanged a flurry of Twitter posts about the controversial punk rock band Pussy Riot. Meanwhile, Russian media suggested a Russian athlete in the Sochi Games may have been sporting an image supporting Pussy Riot on his snowboard Thursday in what could be the Olympics' first protest. In the diplomatic dispute, Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, apparently initiated the exchange with a Russian counterpart when she tweeted Wednesday about meeting formerly imprisoned band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, both of whom were released in December. Power posted a photograph of herself with the two punk rockers, who ""came by to discuss their time in jail,"" Power tweeted. She also stated: ""Met some brave 'troublemakers' today."" . Power subsequently tweeted: ""I asked #PussyRiot if they were afraid of prison. Response: No. In prison we could see the terrible conditions. It's human rights fieldwork."" Then the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, told a U.N. press conference that Power should join the band and invite them to play at the National Cathedral in Washington. Power responded on Twitter: ""Ambassador Churkin, I'd be honored to go on tour with #PussyRiot -- a group of girls who speak up & stand for human rights. Will you join us?"" Power also added: ""I can't sing, but if #PussyRiot will have me, Amb Churkin, I say our 1st concert is for Russia's pol. prisoners. #LiveFromMatrosskayaTishina."" Matrosskaya Tishina is a notorious Moscow prison where opposition activists have been held. Pussy Riot tells Christiane Amanpour: 'We are free people, and free people feel no fear."" A third member of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in 2012. The three members were sentenced to prison after performing a song critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February 2012. The performance was carried out in a flash-mob style. Meanwhile, the Russian state-run media agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday that Russian athlete Alexei Sobolev sported an image on his snowboard resembling ""a female figure in a balaclava wielding a knife."" That image purports to resemble members of Pussy Riot because the anti-Putin, all-female band perform while wearing balaclavas, the news agency reported. The headline stated: ""Sochi Snowboarder Coy on Possible Pussy Riot Protest."" When asked if the design was an homage to Pussy Riot, Sobolev responded: ""Anything is possible."" He added: ""I wasn't the designer."" Sobolev, a slopestyle rider, was also the first Russian to compete in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and finished 10th in a qualifying heat Thursday. The drawing on his snowboard was described as ""what could be the first protest by an athlete"" in the games, the Russian news agency said.

"(CNN) -- In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, not even the notorious traffic congestion can slow the voracious demand for property. Roughly 10 million people live within the urban core of this vast city while a further 28 million populate the suburbs. With affluent cash-buyers and local businesses driving the housing market at a rapid pace, anyone with a hope of climbing on the property ladder has to move fast to secure value. ""The prices go up really quickly,"" said Afifa Loutfie Abdousaalaam, a local property investor. ""If you think 'oh you know I don't have enough money now,' you're not going to then catch up with the race because property prices in Jakarta go up above 10% a year,"" Abdousaalaam added. This is the reality of apartment hunting in what has become one of the hottest property markets in the world. In the vast Metro Park residential building under construction downtown, for example, only a handful of the 1,200 units remain unsold -- a story that is repeated across the city. According to David Cheadle, managing director of real estate agents Cushman and Wakefield Indonesia, Jakartans are keen to snap up new builds like these as soon as they come online. ""More Indonesians are buying high-rise now, either for primary or secondary residence, and also for investment purposes... given the growth in the economy and the buying power of the middle class,"" Cheadle said. ""I think coupled with that, the increase in traffic issues and rise in fuel prices, that has also been another major driver for people really looking to try to be located closer to the areas of the workplace and within the more central Jakarta areas,"" he added. But land is scarce in this sprawling metropolis, ensuring throwing up new buildings is no easy task. For each new multi-million dollar high rise or office tower threatening to change the skyline, kampungs (make shift dwellings found closer to earth) occupy the space in between. Yet despite the lack of room and high demand adding to the premium of new-builds, some developers say there is still far more value for money to be found in Jakarta than in other popular Asian cities. ""Nowadays our range price of apartments is about $2,500 or $3,000 per meter square,"" said Agung Wirajaya, assistant VP for marketing development at property developer Agung Podomoro. ""If you compare to the other countries in Asia, in Hong Kong for instance, it could be per meter square it could be $15,000 or $20,000, so that's why compared the other city around the world, Jakarta it's a very attractive, exotic property for investors."" And with that international optimism, local expectations are rising. The World Bank predicts solid future growth for Indonesia's economy although there remains much work to be done in improving infrastructure within Jakarta to ensure further expansion in the property market. For now, however, local buyers like Abdousaalaam will have to remain sharp to secure that bargain.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- American-based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country, President Barack Obama will claim during remarks at a community college here on Thursday. Taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the Caymen Islands and Bermuda while keeping the bulk of their operations in the United States, Obama will call on Congress to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government's fingers. A White House official, previewing Obama's remarks, said the President would make the case on Thursday that tax-avoiding companies ""are essentially renouncing their American citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America."" The White House has aimed this week to advance the President's domestic agenda, focusing on jobs programs and the economy. Bolstering the middle class has formed much of Obama's midterm election year pitch. But world events -- including Israel's ground invasion of Gaza and furor over the downed airliner in Ukraine -- have largely overshadowed the intended topics this week, despite the White House's attempts to highlight new job training measures. Obama's remarks Thursday, which he'll deliver at a technical college in downtown Los Angeles, come at the end of a three-day fundraising swing which also brought him to Seattle and the Silicon Valley. The event will be the only public showing for Obama during his stay on the West Coast. He withstood some criticism for not canceling the trip, which aides countered by saying the president could conduct his job from anywhere. The White House did, however, nix an appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" replacing the late night show with a more sober CNBC interview. Obama will touch on an issue Democrats believe could help them win over voters in this year's midterm contests. The President has long decried the inherent unfairness in large, multimillion dollar corporations that operate chiefly in the United States but pay little in U.S. taxes. He used the issue to attack Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign. Both Republicans and Democrats say the entire tax code needs an overhaul, but Obama is pressing lawmakers to take action now to prevent so-called ""inversions,"" which allow U.S. companies to merge with foreign firms in countries with lower tax rates. In the past decade, at least 47 U.S. companies have made the move. Several inversions have been proposed this year and more are in the works. ""We should prevent companies from effectively renouncing their citizenship to get out of paying taxes. What we need is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise and fall together,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew In a letter to lawmakers last week, adding he believed any new measure should prevent companies from gaining tax advantages by incorporating overseas. Lew said a new law should retroactively bar any firm that moved abroad after May 2014 from enjoying lower tax liabilities. CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.","Obama to slam companies that establish residency in overseas tax havens in speech Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The long-running battle between a Tennessee Muslim community and its critics over a new mosque took a dramatic turn with a county judge's ruling that could bring construction to a halt. ""Everyone is really shocked, many people are crying about this,"" Imam Ossama Bahloul, leader of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro (ICM), said Wednesday. ""We did exactly what other churches in the county did,"" he said. ""We followed the same process that other churches did. Why did this happen? Some people feel like it is discrimination."" Chancellor Robert Corlew ruled Tuesday that plans for the new mosque, previously approved by a planning commission, are now ""void and of no effect."" Opinion: America, how can Muslim-Americans reach non-Muslims? He said the planning commission violated state law by not providing proper public notice. The ruling throws the date of the mosque's completion, scheduled for July, up in the air. Rutherford County Attorney Jim Cope said Corlew did not address the issue of whether work on the mosque has to stop right away. County planners will discuss options and determine an appropriate course of action, he said. Cain: Opposing mosque construction is not discrimination . Bahloul said construction will go on until the Islamic Center receives orders to stop. ""The ruling was a bit foggy,"" he said. ""We will do what's right."" Sally Wall, a critic of the decision to approve the mosque, said Corlew's opinion was correct ""because there was no due process."" She told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday evening that the public knew nothing until ""it was a done deal."" ""It's not a matter of Islamophobia with me,"" Wall said. ""The county government is supposed to operate in a particular way ... People who live in an area where a mosque or anything else is going to be built are supposed to have a right to say something about it."" In his opinion, Corlew said he would allow attorneys for those who filed suit over the mosque approval process to prepare an order for his review. Attorney Joe Brandon lodged such an order Wednesday. It will be held five business days, after which the judge can review and sign it. The order says the May 2010 decision by planning commissioners to approve the center's plans failed to meet public notice requirements. It decrees ""a permanent injunction is entered against defendant county officials from taking any further actions or permitting any third party from taking any further actions inconsistent with this order."" Corlew did not order an immediate stop to construction, Cope argued. ""An order is not final for 30 days,"" the county attorney said. We can't go out there (and stop construction) and then be sued by the ICM. They can file suit against us."" The judge's opinion, according to Cope, also could be appealed. ""We're very much premature in telling someone to stop something."" Corlew, in a statement Wednesday, said he could not comment and the case was still pending, without a final order. Brandon told ""AC360"" that construction should stop because of the ruling. During the trial, attorneys for the mosque's opposition argued that the county failed to alert the public about meetings before the mosque was approved, CNN affiliate WTVF reported. Rutherford County attorneys said that the meetings were announced in the local free newspaper and on its website and that the notices clearly complied with Tennessee law. The judge, however, said the announcements in a local paper were ""in relatively small type near the bottom of a page which contained a number of advertisements and legal notices, most of which were provided by the city of Murfreesboro."" Corlew said his decision does not preclude the county from ""again considering the same issues at a subsequent hearing when proper notice is given."" The Islamic Center has 30 days to appeal the ruling and plans to apply again for a permit, spokesman Saleh Sbenaty said. ""Hopefully, this time, the county will make it right,"" he said. ""We followed the process according to the law. There is no question about it. We are singled out just because of our faith."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations called on the Justice Department to ensure the religious rights of Muslims in Tennessee. ""American Muslim constitutional rights should not be diminished merely because anti-Muslim bigots are able to manufacture a controversy about what would otherwise be normal religious activities,"" said Gadeir Abbas, staff attorney for the organization, which advocates for Muslim civil liberties. ""The judge's ruling is apparently based on a fictitious 'heightened standard' for public notice when Muslims are involved,"" he said. The mosque expansion gained national attention, including a CNN documentary, because in some ways, it was similar to the proposal to build an Islamic center two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has existed for more than a decade, but the fight erupted when planning commissioners approved the 52,960-square-foot building on Veals Road. The backlash was stinging and included intimidation, lawsuits and an August 2010 fire that destroyed construction equipment and damaged vehicles at the construction site for the mosque. Police said it was arson. A sign announcing the mosque was spray-painted with the words ""Not Welcome."" For months, mosque leaders searched for contractors willing and able to do the job. Because of the opposition and threats the project has provoked, the construction job became more complicated. The work now requires more layers of security, including cameras. My Take: This just in, Tennessee court says Islam is a religion . Some contractors weren't willing to take the job. Mosque leaders said contractors told them it had become too much of a hot-button issue and presented too much of a risk to their business and equipment. Several contractors began the bidding process but never finished. Mosque officials said one contractor told them that he needed the work but that the leaders of his own church were against the new Islamic center. In September, Corlew, the Rutherford County judge, ruled that the Muslim group had a right to build the larger facility. In the opinion, Corlew said organizations must be treated equally under current land-use ordinances, but added that some of the county's land use laws are ""in dire need of revision."" Corlew also wrote that the plaintiffs suing Rutherford County's planning commission can challenge whether the mosque's approval violated open meeting laws. That led to the lawsuit and trial that was decided this week. Opponents of the mosque have also argued that Islam is not a real religion deserving of First Amendment protections and claimed that the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has links to terrorism, WTVF reported. The judge dismissed those allegations, the affiliate reported. The congregation has outgrown its old facility and worshippers have to pray outside the crowded mosque, said Bahloul, the leader of the Islamic Center. ""I am confident that American values will prevail in this,"" the imam said. ""What makes America so special is how it handles freedom. This decision does not seem like it reflects American values.""","Attorney criticizes continuation of construction .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Jordan's ambassador to Libya was kidnapped Tuesday in central Tripoli, the foreign ministries of both nations said. Ambassador Fawaz al-Aytan and members of his security detail were abducted and his driver was injured, Jordan's Foreign Ministry said. Libyan state news agency LANA reported the driver, a Moroccan national, was shot during the kidnapping. A spokesman for the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said masked gunmen in two vehicles ambushed the ambassador's convoy and whisked away al-Aytan. A diplomatic source said the motive appeared to be to swap the ambassador for the release of a Libyan from a Jordanian jail. The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Jordan and Libya discussed the situation in phone calls on Tuesday, LANA and Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said the kidnappers had not contacted his government, but he held them responsible for the safety of the ambassador. ""Through our permanent mission in New York, we have asked the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement condemning this unacceptable act that targeted Jordan and its diplomatic representation in Libya,"" Judeh told Petra. In a separate incident, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli said Tuesday one of its locally hired employees was abducted. Later, a senior Obama administration official said the woman, who worked for the embassy as a bodyguard, had been located. There appeared to be no connection to the embassy, and the incident occurred after business hours when the woman was with her boyfriend in his car, another senior administration official said. The woman escaped, flagged down a truck and was taken to a hospital, where the ambassador met with her, the official said. A diplomatic source earlier told CNN the employee was believed to have disappeared Monday night at a checkpoint. After the Jordanian ambassador was abducted, Jordan's national airlines, Royal Jordanian, canceled its daily flight to Tripoli. ""Royal Jordanian is closely monitoring the situation in Libya following news that Jordan's ambassador to Libya ... was kidnapped Tuesday morning. The airline will take the appropriate decision in regard to its operations to Libya,"" the airline said on its website. Royal Jordanian runs 10 flights a week to Tripoli, four to Benghazi and two to Misrata. Militia groups have routinely targeted and intimidated officials in the fractured nation. On Sunday, Libya's newly appointed Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni stepped down after he and his family were attacked. Al-Thinni was with his family when his convoy came under attack by militia members near where he lives in Tripoli, a neighborhood resident told CNN. After they escaped and entered the neighborhood near Tripoli's airport road, heavy gunfire erupted in the area. Al-Thinni said he and Cabinet members will continue their work as a caretaker government until a new prime minister is chosen by the General National Congress, the country's interim parliament. In October of last year, the country's former prime minister, Ali Zeidan, was kidnapped briefly by a militia in the capital. So far this year, Egyptian diplomats, a South Korean official and a Tunisian Embassy employee have been kidnapped and later released in Tripoli. Al-Aytan is the highest level diplomat to have been kidnapped in Libya since the 2011 revolution. Diplomatic missions have been targeted in attacks both in Tripoli and Libya's second city Benghazi, leading all western countries to shut down their Benghazi consulates. On September 11, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. In June of that year, the convoy of former British Ambassador Dominic Asquith was targeted in an attack in Benghazi that injured two British guards. Security in Libya has deteriorated since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Government forces have been unable to rein in the hundreds of militia groups, which have competing interests, ideologies and agendas. CNN's Ed Payne reported and wrote from Atlanta, with Jomana Karadsheh in Tripoli and Caroline Faraj in Dubai.","Jordan's foreign minister holds kidnappers responsible for ambassador's safety .

"EINDHOVEN, Netherlands -- Frenchman Alain Bernard set a world record for the men's 100 meters freestyle in 47.60sec at the European swimming championships in Eindhoven on Friday. Bernard has not yet qualified for the Beijing Olympics. Bernard surpassed the 47.84 of Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband on September 19, 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Bernard has yet to qualify for the Beijing Olympics but will have his chance at the French championships next month. After returning 48.70 in the morning heats, Bernard surged ahead over the last 50 meters of the semifinal. His previous best was 48.12,  in June 2007 in Saint Raphael in southern France. Bernard, from Antibes, said: ""I knew I had a great performance in me, but I didn't think I would set it (record) so soon. ""When I looked up and saw I'd broken the record, I couldn't stop shaking. I'm still shaking, it's unbelievable!"" Bernard becomes only the third swimmer to complete the distance in under 48secs, after Van den Hoogenband and Sweden's Stefan Nystrand. Nystrand, the second swimmer to break the 48-sec barrier, in Paris, was quick with his congratulations. ""It was a great record for him. I really believed he could beat it, but I didn't think he would do it so soon,"" said the Swede. Retired French swimmer Franck Esposito believes Bernard is strong enough to go even faster. ""I was sitting on my sofa and he nearly blew me off it. It's stunning,"" said Esposito. ""He's fought really hard to get where he is, and it just goes to show they are doing some good work down at his club in Antibes. ""I'm convinced Alain can swim in world record time at the Olympics. I think he's capable of swimming even faster."" In the second men's semifinal Fabien Gilot of France won in 48.68. Bernard and Gilot will now lead France's bid for the men's European title, alongside co-favorites Nystrand, Italian Filippo Magnini and Croatia's Duje Draganja. Reigning two-time Olympic 100m freestyle champion Van den Hoogenband missed Friday's race having pulled out of the competition because of illness, after failing to qualify from the heats of the 200m freestyle.

"(CNN) -- John David LaDue readily admits he came from a good home and says he was never bullied. But something in him drove the 17-year-old Minnesotan toward an obsessively detailed plot -- one in which, he said, he wanted to kill his family, set off bombs at a school and then shoot students. ""I think I'm really mentally ill,"" he told police. ""And no one has noticed. I've been trying to hide it."" Transcripts of LaDue's police interviews were released Tuesday. They fill more than 140 pages. And they offer, in his own words, a chilling glimpse of a teenage boy and his homicidal mindset -- and how far he had wanted to go to act on it. LaDue was arrested in April before he could carry out his attack. He sits in jail facing numerous charges, including attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty. CNN does not usually publish the names of minors charged with crimes but is naming LaDue in this case because his name has been widely reported in his community. Despising Lanza . LaDue's mother told police she had no idea he was allegedly plotting to kill his family. Yet, he said, he plotted right under her nose. He made no effort to hide anything. He told police they'd find three live bombs in a box on the floor next to his bed. LaDue said his main target was Waseca Junior/Senior High School. But first, he said, he was going to kill his father, mother and sister. ""They did nothing wrong; I just wanted as many victims as possible,"" he told officers who questioned him. He said he wanted his attack to be more effective than Adam Lanza's shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary. He had a low opinion of Lanza, he said, because he shot small children. ""I didn't want to be known as a guy who would go to a place with a bunch of kindergartner(s),"" he told police. He thought it more honorable to kill students his own age. LaDue had studied mass killers in the United States dating back to the 1920s and rated them on the intensity of their crimes, he said. He had a pecking order of killers he admired. One of his favorites used explosives to kill people at a school. Another Columbine . After slaying his family, the teen, who idealized the Columbine school shooters in particular, allegedly wanted to set a fire. The arson, however, would only be a diversion to tie up emergency responders while he carried out the main plot at the school, police said. He'd planned to set off ""numerous bombs"" during the lunch hour at Waseca Junior/Senior High School, then kill the school resource officer. Then he'd shoot at students until police officers arrived. He wanted to die but thought it cowardly to turn the gun on himself the way Lanza did. ""I wanted to get taken down by the SWAT,"" he told officers, according to the newly released documents. ""I really wanted to get out of this place."" Plan foiled . Luckily, a witness thwarted his plan when she saw the 17-year-old tending to a storage locker, where he kept his stash of bomb-making materials. She dialed 911. Officers arrived to find LaDue in the locker surrounded by an assortment of gunpowder, pyrotechnic chemicals, ball bearings and a pressure cooker, police said. Mental torment . LaDue asked his interviewers to let him see a psychiatrist over his state of mind. In the eighth grade, he was a model student, whose report card was filled with top grades, he said. A year later, his thoughts began to turn dark. ""I started having homicidal ... thoughts about some people in my school,"" he told officers. Homemade bombs . He loved his chemistry class in particular and developed a fascination for explosives. Recipes to concoct the volatile chemicals were right at his fingertips. ""I spent hours, maybe hours a day reading websites of how to synthesize things like mercury fulminate and nitrocellulose, HMX, HNB and various other things,"" he said. His mother described how she'd go to bed and see him still in front of his computer screen, but she had no idea what he was up to. LaDue built bombs, starting off with small charges. Police found videos he made of himself setting off his homemade devices. He tested them then tinkered with their designs to improve them, he said. A close call . The teen's cache in the storage locker contained just pieces of the puzzle. Police got a search warrant in April and went to LaDue's home, where he lived with his family. Behind that door lay finished bombs, ""numerous guns"" and ammunition, police say. And they found LaDue's neatly laid plan in a journal dozens of pages thick. A bomb squad removed all recovered explosives and destroyed them by controlled detonation at a local airport. They did so just in time. Everything was prepared and ready to go; LaDue was just waiting for the right moment to launch the scheme. A lucky calendar this year may have prevented him from hatching his plan earlier -- before it could be thwarted. He had wanted to carry it out on April 19, a day before the 15th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. The date fell on a day when school was out. ""But then I had to skip it,"" he said. ""I wanted it to be in April, because it's my favorite month ... because that's the month that all the really bad tragedies happened."" Robbins: The real gun problem is mental health, not the NRA . What you need to know about U.S. School Violence .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Rudeness isn't contagious -- but we all may be carrying the virus. Has rudeness become a chronic condition? I was in the Amtrak Quiet Car last weekend. The ""Quiet Car,"" as the conductor pithily put it, means, ""No cell phones, no fun!"" Twenty minutes into our blissfully silent journey, this woman behind me makes a call. She was speaking in French, and I sort of wanted to use her transgression as a way to test what's left of my French skills. But the most primal part of me wanted to grab her phone, just as Kanye West snatched Taylor Swift's mic; I wanted to threaten to shove it down her throat, just as Serena Williams threatened the line judge with a tennis ball; and I wanted to yell j'accuse! in the same Southern cadence of Joe Wilson's bug-eyed, ""You lie!"" However, self-control prevailed, so I shot Madame a very pointed stare. Kanye's interruption, Serena's threat, Joe's outburst, Madame (not so) Quiet Car: Does America need a time-out? Is rudeness on the rise? Oprah.com: 3 rules of civil behavior . Not exaaaactly. I'd say our capacity for incivility is the same as ever, but what is on the rise is our ability to express and bear witness to rudeness. I'm not the first to point out that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, talk radio -- all of these give us ways to behave rudely with immediacy, scope and, often, anonymity. We have more means at our fingertips to react without delay: We can tweet, text, phone or e-mail our nastiness, unfiltered. Our outlets for rudeness are on the rise, but so is our consciousness of it -- and that's not a bad thing. Oprah.com: Is there such thing as too much communication? That ubiquitous technology that enables us to be so rude, so quickly and thoroughly, also allows us to broadcast people's bad behavior. (Thanks, TMZ!) The boorishness of Kanye, Serena and Joe was immediately disseminated, deconstructed and debated. The public has shamed and judged them. Each issued apologies. (Although U.S. Rep. Wilson seems to spell his: ""I'M $$$ORRY."") But I think if our best answer to rudeness is self-righteousness, we're missing something. That question -- ""is rudeness on the rise?"" -- implicitly suggests that we might be in the throes of an epidemic, that rudeness is contagious. Such a diagnosis implies we're not rude until we ""catch"" rudeness from someone else. You can't help catching a cold right? And if someone's rude to you, you can't help being rude back, right? Wrong. This notion of contagious rudeness absolves us of responsibility. I think of it more as a latent virus we all carry. Gross, I know, but helpful...and hopeful. You know how when you feel stressed, or run-down, or Bart in HR forgets to sneeze into his elbow, you ""happen"" to get sick -- because you're in an environment that activates a virus? I think it's the same with rudeness: It's this little beast inside us that just trolls about, waiting for its opportunity. And when someone is rude to us, that beastie lunges out of us -- if we let it. What this acknowledgment of our inner rude beastie does is create a little compassion, a little space, a little ""there but for the grace of God go I"" when we encounter the rudeness of others. Oprah.com: What to do when a stranger attacks . Like any kind of chronic condition, we have to stay on top of it. If only there were a rudeness alert system so we could be prepared. You know, like the UV Index or the Air Quality Alert -- Al Roker could tell you, ""There's a cold effrontery hitting your neck of the woods!"" Alas, we have stay on top of our own latent rudeness. If we own it, watch it, then we can take some spiritual vitamin C to keep it dormant. We can carry with us emotional Purell so we're not at the mercy of others' bad behavior. Remember Quiet Car Lady? Well, a gentleman pointed to a sign that read ""QUIET CAR. NO CELL PHONES."" This was more productive than my passive-aggressive stare. Madame ended her call (something about Michel going to le plage and la plume de ma tante? I really have to bone up on my French...) and immediately said: ""No cell phone? I'm sorry...I did not know."" Pop! My self-righteous bubble burst. I was so glad I hadn't been ruder, more imperious. She was human; she was sorry. The other day, I was invited to visit a K--8 school in Harlem. Purell dispensers dotted the hallway walls. This school was taking precautions against getting sick. But a sign of even more robust health? Every single kid I passed stopped, introduced him or herself, and shook my hand. In their classrooms, they stood up before talking to me. Some seventh-grade boys in ""Conflict Resolution"" class explained to me how when they get upset, they check their ""anger barometer."" While this made me feel very, very old, it also filled me with hope. Seems like they're doing some hand and heart sanitizing.

"Washington (CNN) -- Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu's campaign paid for more than 12 years of wrongfully taxpayer-funded travel, her office announced on Friday. Landrieu's campaign reimbursed the federal government $33,727 for chartered flights that were wrongly charged to her Senate office. The payment comes a month after the Louisiana Democrat ordered her attorney to audit her office's travel spending to root out incorrectly-billed campaign travel. Landrieu said the ""mistakes,"" which go back to 2002, stemmed from ""sloppy book keeping."" ""I take full responsibility. They should have never happened, and I apologize for this,"" Landrieu said in the Friday statement. CNN first reported in August that Landrieu used government dollars to pay for a chartered flight that took her to a campaign fundraiser last November. Landrieu's campaign spokesmen said then that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her campaign and that mistake had already been rectified. The next day, Landrieu's office announced she would refund the Senate for a separate $5,700 charter flight after CNN questioned the expense. It was shortly after that report that Landrieu ordered a full review of her travel expenses. Landrieu said her office now has a new system successfully used by other Senate offices to prevent future mistakes. The reimbursed funds accounted for about 11% of her Senate office's travel costs over the last 12 years. Marc Elias, Landrieu's attorney who conducted the review, also wrote in a letter to the Senate Ethics Committee that future taxpayer-funded charter flights would be ""cleared in advance by counsel."" Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican challenging Landrieu for her Senate seat, slammed Landrieu for only disclosing her travel records since 2002, when the Federal Elections Commission changed the rules on payment for campaign-related travel. ""No matter how Sen. Landrieu spins it, she billed taxpayers for dozens of private jet flights since the turn of the century,"" he said. Cassidy called on Landrieu to release her nearly 18 years of travel records as a senator. ""Prior to that (rule change), it was also illegal to bill taxpayers for private flights. Given Senator Landrieu's own admission of faulty oversight, how do taxpayers know that problems did not exist prior to 2002?"" Cassidy said in the statement. Landrieu's flight troubles first came in late July when USA Today listed Landrieu as one of the Senate's most frequent flyers after she billed the federal government more than $47,000 in chartered flights in 2013 alone.","Louisiana Sen.

"(CNN) -- Instead of concrete jungles could our cities become urban forests of wooden skyscrapers? Swapping cement and steel for timber is the vision of a number of environmentally-minded architects who are planning high-rise buildings across the world. Architect Michael Green has plans for a 30-story wooden skyscraper in Vancouver, while plans are afoot in Norway and Austria for 17- and 20-story buildings that use wood as the main building material, eschewing steel and concrete. ""We think we can go higher than 30 stories,"" says Green. ""We stopped exploring wood around 100 years ago (with the advent of steel and concrete); now we're looking at a whole new system using mass timber products."" Green says that the modern wood materials have been around for around 20 years, but until recently they've been quite niche or used only in low-rise buildings. What has changed is the way in which architects and builders are thinking about using wood. ""The real change came when we started thinking about climate change. Steel and concrete are great but not environmentally friendly,"" he says. Cutting down trees to make buildings doesn't immediately sound eco-friendly either, but if sourced from sustainably managed forests (like those in Europe and North America), it can be more environmentally sensitive. Wood buildings lock in carbon dioxide for the life cycle of a structure, while the manufacture of steel and concrete produces large amounts of CO2 -- the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that for every 10 kilos of cement created, six to nine kilos of CO2 are produced. Green's ""Tallwood"" structure is designed with large panels of laminated strand lumber -- a composite made of strands of wood glued together. Other mass timber products use layers of wood fused together at right angels that making they immensely strong and able to be used as lode bearing infrastructure, walls and floors. Despite being made of wood any worries about towering infernos should be banished, says Green, as large timber performs well in fires with a layer of char insulating the structural wood beneath. ""It may sound counter-intuitive, but performing well in a fire is something inherent in large piece of wood, that's why in forest fires the trees that survive are the largest ones,"" he says. Currently one of the highest modern wooden buildings is in London. Called the Stadthaus, Murray Grove, it's a nine-story residential building that stands at just under 30 meters (98 feet). Even the lift shafts and stairwells are made from wood. ""It's under 30 meters because over that UK regulations say that sprinklers have to be installed and other regulations come in to play,"" says Craig Liddell, commercial director of KLH UK the company that developed the cross-laminated timber for the building. Liddell thinks that 15 stories is possible before having to use other materials like steel but says that building codes are one of the main reasons we haven't seen more tall wooden buildings, ""and more recently the economic downturn,"" he adds. The cross-laminated timber used on the Stadthaus is classified as air-tight, making it one of London's most energy efficient buildings. As a pre-fabricated structure it also took less time to construct and was cheaper than a conventional steel and concrete building, says Liddell. For all the eco-credentials ultimately buildings are erected because of a strong bottom line. ""For the idea of tall wooden buildings to be viable they have to be cost effective,"" says Green. ""We can show that wood structures are dollar for dollar or cheaper compared to other buildings."" Beyond that Green believes it's about thinking big. ""Really we're at the stage where we're able to start to show what's possible, a bit like that Eiffel Tower moment. That was built when no one was used or understood tall structures, but it showed what could be done and just as importantly stretched the imagination.""","30-story wooden building planned for Vancouver .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's cabinet met at the base of Everest on Friday to highlight the impact of climate change on the Himalayas and adopted a 10-point Everest Declaration. ""The Himalayas are important not only for the people of Nepal but for 1.3 billion people who depend on waters from the mountains for their livelihoods,"" said Nepal's Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal at the cabinet meeting broadcast live by state-owned Nepal Television. Wearing oxygen masks and warm jackets, the cabinet met for about half an hour at Kala Patthar at an altitude of 5,242 meters surrounded by the world's highest mountains and glaciers. The ministers flew in to Lukla, in the Everest region where the nearest airstrip is, a day earlier to acclimatize to the rarefied atmosphere of Kala Patthar. The cabinet met out in the open where tables had been set up. The ministers spoke through microphones because it was difficult to hear even over a short distance with the wind blowing. Of the 27 cabinet ministers, 24 were present at the meeting and they were wearing blue sashes that said ""Save the Himalayas."" The sun was shining bright during the meeting in the morning but in the afternoon fog descended and the wind grew fiercer. Before they were airlifted by helicopters to Kala Patthar the ministers' health was checked to ensure they could withstand the high altitude and not suffer from acute mountain sickness because of the low amount of oxygen in the atmosphere at that altitude. ""This is a very important and historic meeting,"" Prime Minister Nepal said. The meeting comes ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen next week. The Himalayas have an important role in the world's environmental balance, he added. The melting of the glaciers in the mountains due to global warming would bring about a scarcity of water in the river systems in South Asia, affecting more than a billion people in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China, according to various experts. ""But there has not been enough study to say exactly how much of the river water comes from the melting of the snow and ice in the mountains,"" said Ajay Dixit, a climate change expert from the Institute of Social and Environment Transition, a Kathmandu-based think tank. ""Estimates vary between four to 10 percent."" Dixit, however, added that in specific areas in the mountains where people depend on the melting of specific glaciers for irrigation, the change in the snow system will affect livelihoods. There has been an annual increase of temperature by 0.06 degrees Celsius over the past decade, according to a study conducted earlier this year by Dixit together with Oxford University. It it estimated that the temperature in Nepal could rise by as much as two Celsius by 2030. Rainfall patterns have also been erratic and this affects the livelihoods of almost two thirds of Nepal's population of 28 million who depend on rain-fed agriculture. ""Various global circulation models show that precipitation could go down by 14 percent or increase by as much as 40 percent by 2030,"" Dixit told CNN. Although the contribution of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world, to carbon emissions is negligible, the poor and the marginalized bear the brunt of climate change, Prime Minister Nepal said at a press conference after the cabinet meeting. The 10-point Everest Declaration the cabinet adopted includes increasing the protected area of Nepal's land from 20 percent to 25 percent, developing communities' capacity to cope with climate change and working together with other countries to mitigate the impact of global warming. The declaration also supported developed countries' plans to contribute 1.5 percent of GDP to a climate fund and bring down greenhouse gases to pre-industrialization levels. ""The earth is our common abode,"" said Prime Minister Nepal. ""To save the earth the biggest sacrifice is needed from nations producing large amounts of carbon.""","24 of Nepal's cabinet members met at base of Everest to highlight impact of climate change .

"(CNN) -- Millions of golf fans around the world were watching on television with great anticipation. The 18th-green gallery at Medinah Country Club was packed as a remarkable sporting story was about to be concluded. All Martin Kaymer could think about was getting his phone out and capturing the moment. ""I looked around and thought, 'How nice is that,' to see the big leaderboard and then see the screen which says 'Kaymer to retain the Ryder Cup,' "" he tells CNN's Living Golf show. ""I would have loved to take out my iPhone and take a picture of it."" The German stood over a seven-foot putt to win the 2012 Ryder Cup for Europe, which had stunned the U.S. team by making up a four-point deficit on the final day. His opponent Steve Stricker had already missed his birdie putt to level their crucial singles match, and all the attention switched to Kaymer. Short of his best form for over a year and feeling he had let down a teammate in an earlier match, Martin Kaymer could have been forgiven for having doubts. But despite his earlier difficulties, having lost his only other match in that Ryder Cup when paired with Justin Rose in fourballs, Kaymer is adamant that thoughts of failure never entered his mind. ""Honestly I didn't think about missing, I didn't think about the importance of that putt -- I was just very, very happy to be in that position,"" he recalls ahead of this week's rematch at Gleneagles in Scotland. ""I mean some people they are scared of that moment and, obviously I can talk like this now because I made the putt, but I was not that nervous."" Sure enough, Kaymer walked confidently forward and stroked home the putt with some aplomb before being mobbed by his teammates. Europe eventually won 14½ - 13½ to retain golf's most prestigious team competition -- a comeback win that was soon dubbed the ""Miracle of Medinah."" For Kaymer it proved a turning point in a career that had seen him win a major and reach No. 1 in the world rankings before a slump in form sent him tumbling down the rankings. ""It made a huge, huge difference for the future, because I know when it comes down to those crucial situations and when it comes down to making those putts, I have done it before,"" he says. The improvement in form did not happen overnight and 2013 passed without a tournament victory, but having made the decision to campaign full-time on the PGA Tour this year, it was only a matter of time. Kaymer's purple patch started with a superb victory at May's Players Championship in Florida -- a tournament known unofficially as ""the fifth major"" -- and then a stunning eight-shot win at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in June. The 29-year-old was simply unstoppable as he broke Rory McIlroy's halfway record for the tournament and kept on stretching his lead. It was his second major after 2011's PGA Championship triumph and confirmation of his talents. Victory also sealed his place in the European team for September's biennial Ryder Cup match against the United States -- his fourth straight appearance having been a captain's pick by Nick Faldo in the 2008 match at Valhalla. Kaymer revealed to CNN that Paul McGinley, the European team's skipper for the match at Gleneagles in Scotland, had told him prior to his Players triumph at Sawgrass that he was going to be in his lineup as a pick should he fail to qualify by right. ""He said, 'You don't need to make anything special, just play your game -- show what you can do. Show to yourself and then you will make the team anyways.' And then obviously it turned out to be a great week for me."" With McIlroy claiming the British Open and PGA Championship titles, two members of the European lineup will be have three of this year's four majors between them, but Kaymer knows that the pressures of team golf are completely different. ""You see the fans singing songs on the first tee, like at a football stadium, it is just brilliant and we don't really have that usually -- only every two years,"" he says. For Kaymer, a football fan who cheered Germany to ""one of my proudest moments"" as his national team claimed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, this acts as extra motivation. ""You can't wait to go out there and play with your partner, play for the whole team, play for your continent and obviously play for my country,"" he says. ""I played football when I was younger and I loved it. I loved that atmosphere, you know, when you play for each other, you fight for the same reason, for the same goal. "" Despite Europe appearing to have the advantage on current form, Kaymer will not be taking anything for granted when the action starts Friday in Scotland. ""I think it will be a battle again -- it was very, very tight the last couple of times. And that is what is so nice about it -- it's not like one team shows up and has no chance against the other,"" he says. ""It's great that you play for the pride -- it's not about money, it's not about world ranking points. It is fantastic to play.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has identified six military personnel who are missing after an Israeli helicopter crashed in Romania Monday during a joint military exercise. According to Israel Defense Forces, the Israelis included: Lt. Col. Avner Goldman, Lt. Col. Daniel Shipenbauer, Maj. Yahel Keshet, Maj. Lior Shai, Lt. Nir Lakrif and Sgt. 1st Class Oren Cohen. IDF said the aircraft was carrying four pilots, two mechanics and a member of the Romanian Air Force. The Israeli CH-53 helicopter went down about 3:20 p.m. (8:20 a.m. ET) Monday, the Romanian Defense ministry said in a statement. Search-and-rescue operations began immediately, using a Romanian medical helicopter and two Israeli helicopters, the statement said. The wreckage was found a few hours later in the Fundata-Zarnesti area, near Brasov in central Romania, the defense ministry said. The crash site was in a remote area at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters (about 6,560 feet) in the mountains, according to the ministry. Fog prevented helicopters from flying to the site Monday night. Defense Minister Gabriel Oprea has ordered a commission to the site to investigate the crash, the ministry said. The exercises, scheduled from July 18 through Thursday, are aimed at training low-altitude aircraft crews in search-and-rescue operations and medical evacuations, according to the statement. A CH-53 helicopter made an emergency landing July 18 after experiencing technical problems, the defense ministry said. The problem was fixed, and it took off and landed safely. Journalist Cosmin Stan contributed to this report.","The crash occurred during a joint exercise, the Romanian Defense ministry says .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- When France's Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg was quoted in French daily newspaper Le Monde over the weekend attacking the economic policies of his very own government, he knew what he was doing: Pulling the pin out of a grenade. And he certainly seemed to have no regrets. France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls, appointed 147 days ago after President FranÃ§ois Hollande's Socialist Party took a severe beating in local elections, was not going to take such overt rebellion kindly. ""It's me or him,"" he is reported to have told Hollande. On Monday morning, the whole French government presented its resignation and Valls was immediately asked to form a new cabinet. Apparently savoring the effects of his political sortie, the cocky Montebourg, in a televised address from the ministry of the economy, said that he would follow into the steps of Cincinnatus, a kind of gentleman farmer Roman senator, who in 500 BC came to represent civic virtue for his modesty and restraint. Cincinnatus was also known for his beautiful curly mane, just like Arnaud Montebourg. Many observers were quick to point out that vanity, rather than political restraint, were probably what the French minister shared most with the great Roman senator. Why is the French government imploding and its members at loggerheads? It's the economy and it is ideological. Montebourg, at the left of the French Socialist Party, advocates the end of austerity measures that supposedly kill economic growth, while Valls, at the right of the French socialist party, as well as President Hollande who long dithered about what economic direction to take, both favor a more German approach, with policies focusing on reducing public deficits and corporate tax breaks. In fact, many people in France are asking why it took more than two years to get rid of Montebourg, whose histrionic style and interventionist mantra have made him more enemies than friends, especially in the business world. You may remember how he lectured French and foreign investors such as the Peugeot family and Lakshmi Mittal over their plans to scale down their activities in some of their French factories. Montebourg has been a thorn in the side of President Hollande ever since his appointment as minister, however he is also the symbol of Hollande's confusing and mostly unreadable economic choices. When the French president finally decided back in March to reclaim some control over his unruly government, and to impose a new series of business-friendly measures, the appointment of Valls was seen as a coherent and strong sign that political and economic uncertainty had finally ended. However, Hollande insisted that his new prime minister keep Montebourg in government and give him the economy portfolio. As The Economist put it: ""Hollande calculated that the risk of a confusing economic policy was less high than that of having his firebrand left-winger sniping from the outside."" How wrong Hollande was. In fact, Hollande seems to have been governing France as if he was still leader of the Socialist Party, trying desperately and at all costs, to hold a divided family together. If such strategy can work for a political party, it may be disastrous when governing a country. To be president and to govern is to make clear choices. Since his arrival in power in May 2012, Hollande has given the country the impression of playing it by ear, steering the wheel on the right or the left as events came along. This has certainly not proved popular. With an approval rating of barely 20%, Hollande is one of the most unpopular presidents of the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958. Will the exit of the most rebellious socialists from the government be enough for the president and his prime minister to restore some credibility and be able to implement at last a string of pro-Business measures? If this heralds the end of Hollande's political contradictions, this will be most welcome. However, the new French government, which will be announced later today, will have to convince French MPs and be backed by a majority in Parliament. Montebourg and the anti-austerity crusaders within the socialist party may want to systematically hinder the government's actions and force Hollande to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. However, this would not necessarily be good news for the opposition, as the French Right, shaken by a series of scandals, has almost disappeared from political debate. The facts remain that economically, France is not performing as well as expected. With unemployment at more than 10% and two consecutive quarters without growth, France is not going to reach its deficit target of 3.8% of GDP in 2014. The French government must now decide what direction it wants to take and have the courage to stay the course. France is not performing in a vacuum and Hollande's ability to work in tandem with its European partners, Germany in particular, will prove key to a much-needed coherence. In fact, as Brussels-based journalist Ian Traynor rightly points out: ""The turmoil in Paris presages more battles ahead in Brussels and between EU capitals as the existential crisis that was the euro emergency turns more political."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","On Monday morning, the French government presented its resignation .

"(CNN) -- The government of Colombia has reached an agreement with FARC rebels in the fight against drug trafficking and cultivation of illicit crops, both sides announced Friday. Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers. The rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia is estimated to make around $500 million from the illicit trade per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. ""I invite Colombians to maintain confidence in the process, in our negotiating team and that we will continue to do exactly what we said,"" President Juan Manuel Santos said. He added that because of the agreement, Colombians should have more faith in the peace process. The agreement is part of a complex peace deal with the rebel group aimed at ending the decades-long war. As part of the deal, the government will launch a national program of illegal crop eradication and alternative development. The government also promised to step up its efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, as well as address public health issues related to drug consumption. The president, who is running for re-election, also announced Friday that FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN) have agreed on a cease-fire during the May 25 presidential elections. ""Imagine a Colombia without coke? That is what is at our fingertips if we implement these agreements,"" Santos said.","Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- You could call it ""the year of the rear"" at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, although last year's chief twerker chose a higher path. While Nicki Minaj and her collaborators paid tribute to their assets with song and dance, Miley Cyrus stood offstage and watched as a young homeless man accepted her best music video award. These might have been the most memorable moments of the night if not for Beyonce and her daughter, Blue Ivy, stealing the show. Here are four highlights from the show at the Forum in Inglewood, California, on Sunday night. 1. Beyonce and Blue Ivy steal the show. Beyonce's 2-year-old daughter gave her own performance while sitting in her father's lap and watching her mother onstage Sunday. Blue Ivy's facial expressions and hand gestures suggested she inherited the music gene. Blue Ivy applauded her mommy as daddy Jay Z carried her onstage at the end of Beyonce's 16-minute performance. Jay Z handed his wife the MTV Michael Jackson Vanguard Award while declaring that she was ""the greatest living entertainer."" Blue Ivy is heard saying ""Mommy!"" ""I'm so full,"" Beyonce said, as the audience began chanting. ""I have nothing to say, but I'm filled with so much gratitude."" The family hug that followed could be one of the most loving and memorable moments ever on the VMA stage. Even the stars were struck by Beyonce's daughter. Katy Perry tweeted: ""OMG BLUE IVY JUST PERSONALLY WAVED AT ME. MY LIFE IS OVER."" 2. Miley Cyrus is the adult in the room.  A year after she set tongues wagging with a provocative dance with a teddy bear, Cyrus was more like Mother Teresa when her ""Wrecking Ball"" video was named as the best of 2014. She stopped short of the stage, instead sending a young man who identified himself as Jesse to accept the moon man trophy on ""behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youths in the United States who are starving, lost and scared for their lives right now."" Cyrus, 21, appeared to be near tears as Jesse, who said he was homeless, read a speech: ""I've survived in shelters all over this city. I've cleaned your hotel rooms. I've been an extra in your movies. I've been an extra in your life. Though I may have been invisible to you on the streets, I have a lot of the same dreams that brought many of you here tonight."" Jesse's speech called attention to the large population of homeless young people in Los Angeles. ""The music industry will make over $7 billion this year, and outside these doors are 54,000 human beings who have no place to call home. If you want to make a powerful change in the world right now, please join us and go to Miley's Facebook page. A dream you dream alone is only a dream, but a dream you dream together is reality."" In a video posted on her Facebook page, Miley instructs fans to donate through a Prizeo fundraising site to the Los Angeles-area charity, My Friend's Place, which provides support for homeless youths ages 12 to 25. Prizeo is not yet releasing information on how much has been raised or how many people donated, but Heather Carmichael, the executive director of My Friend's Place, said she had been told the campaign was on track to bring in $200,000 in its first day. Cyrus later posted an Instagram photo with Jesse, calling him ""my favorite dude ever."" 3. They like big butts. Nicki Minaj set the tone early with her ""Anaconda"" performance and again when ""Bang Bang"" collaborators Ariana Grande and Jessie J joined her onstage. The choreography, costumes and lyrics paid tribute to ladies who have plenty to shake. Minaj returned later in the show for a brief cameo during Usher's performance in which he bumped her rump while also strumming a bass guitar. The only diversion from the theme was an accident, when Minaj suffered an apparent wardrobe malfunction that threatened to expose her upper front. She survived with her dignity -- such as it is -- by clutching the rebellious garment for the remainder of the song. The snake that bit a dancer during a VMA rehearsal was not used in Sunday's show. Boa bites dancer during rehearsal for Nicki Minaj's 'Anaconda' at VMAs . Taylor Swift brought something completely different to the stage: her long, lanky physique. Presenter Chelsea Handler joked that she demanded producers put on ""someone who's white"" so she wouldn't have to follow ""big fat asses."" ""So thank you, Taylor Swift, for being so white,"" Handler said. 4. Moment of silence for Michael Brown. The 2014 VMAs did not ignore what's been happening in Ferguson, Missouri, over the two weeks since a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager. Rapper Common took the stage to address it. ""The people in Ferguson and St. Louis and communities across the country have used their voices to call for justice and change to let everyone know that each and every one of our lives matters,"" Common said. Saying that hip-hop has always been about truth and has been a powerful instrument of social change, Common led the Forum in a moment of silence ""for Mike Brown and for peace in this country and in the world."" The MTV broadcast also included a 15-second public service announcement that featured the ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" chant of the Ferguson protesters. It included a quote from American poet James Baldwin: ""Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" Chris Brown's VMA party turns violent; 'Suge' Knight, 2 others shot . CNN's David Shortell contributed to this report.","Beyonce and daughter Blue Ivy steal the show at the 2014 MTV VMAs .

"Kiev (CNN) -- Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced Monday on Twitter that he has dissolved the nation's parliament. Elections are scheduled for October 26, the President wrote. ""Dear compatriots, Today I have taken a decision to early dissolve the Parliament,"" he said in a post written in English. Also Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov didn't rule out that Russian President Vladimir Putin might have a direct meeting with Poroshenko when the two attend a trade meeting in Belarus on Tuesday. ""Russia is ready to take part in the Ukrainian crisis settlement in any format that might lead to their national unity,"" he added. Lavrov told reporters that Russia hopes to send a second humanitarian aid convoy to Ukraine this week. ""Russia has notified the Ukrainian foreign ministry of its intention,"" he said. Last week, a convoy of Russian trucks crossed that country's border into eastern Ukraine without Kiev's authorization. In total, 227 vehicles were sent into territories held by pro-Russian rebels on Friday, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through. They all had returned to Russia by Saturday afternoon. Russia said the vehicles were on an essential humanitarian mission and that it was satisfied with the deliveries, but international powers condemned it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Officials in Kiev referred to it as an invasion. The U.S. State Department expressed concern over news of a possible second convoy. ""Any new missions done without the explicit permission of Ukraine would be another provocative measure that would only escalate a situation President Putin claims he wants to resolve,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Prabhjot Singh, a turbaned Sikh doctor and Columbia University professor, was surrounded recently by a gang of teenagers on bicycles who beat him, fracturing his jaw. He says they called him a ""terrorist"" and ""Osama."" His response: ""If I could speak to my attackers,"" he said, ""I would ask them if they had any questions, if they knew what they were doing. Maybe invite them to the gurdwara where we worship, get to know who we are."" Most people would be surprised by Dr. Singh's willingness to forgive and constructively engage his attackers. I am not. Like most Sikhs, I was taught at a young age about Bhai Ghaniya, a famous Sikh who would distribute food and water to wounded enemy soldiers. The lesson instilled was that the work of mending fences begins as soon as one can no longer harm you. As a professional advocate working with Sikh hate crime victims for more than a decade since 9/11, I have consistently seen Sikhs move beyond the punitive bent of our criminal justice system and adopt a Sikh approach to addressing our attackers. The result is a decidedly Sikh-American brand of justice that produces more social benefit than the revolving-door criminal justice system in our country. Take our work with Gurpreet Singh and Thomas Brand. Thomas worked at Marsh McLenan at the World Trade Center. He never had a chance to say goodbye to his colleagues who died there on 9/11. Traveling on trains made him scared and angry. He acted on his anger a year later by pushing Gurpreet on the Long Island Railroad, urging him to leave the train and calling him a ""terrorist."" Thomas was stopped by an off-duty police officer, arrested, and eventually prosecuted. When it came time for sentencing, the prosecutor was ready to recommend jail time for Thomas. Gurpreet did not want that to happen. He saw a man in real pain who needed a lift up and not jail time. He asked that the prosecutor recommend Thomas engage in community service aimed at combating hate in a post 9/11 world. Thomas was very nervous when he came to our office. He said he knew nothing about us and always thought we were ""stern"" and ""angry."" He said he was surprised that one of my colleagues was wearing shorts instead of pants. We got to know each other and eventually Thomas was standing with Gurpreet and me as we went to gurdwaras, Sikh houses of worship, collecting reports of bias against Sikhs. All of us were better for the experience. Gurpreet and I had our own prejudices and fears of people who looked like ""Joe America"" and clearly Thomas had his own perceptions about us ""turban folk"" as well. Rather than allow him to spend time incarcerated in the overworked criminal justice system, we all found healing and became better people for it.

"Washington (CNN) -- Bomb plots targeting the New York Stock Exchange and the city's subway were among more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide thwarted by top-secret surveillance programs since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States, security officials said Tuesday. The startling details disclosed at a House intelligence committee hearing reflected a unified effort by the Obama administration and legislators to defend the telephone and e-mail surveillance made public this month by classified leaks to newspapers. Testimony by Gen. Keith Alexander, the National Security Agency director, as well as officials from the FBI, Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence office called the programs created under the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks a vital tool against terrorist plots. Joined by panel Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers and other legislators, they condemned the document leaks by former government contractor Edward Snowden as harmful to the United States and its allies. The leaks also led to what officials called widespread public misinformation about the surveillance programs that necessitated the relatively rare open hearing by the intelligence panel, where they detailed previously classified information in order to set the record straight. It was the most comprehensive and specific defense of the surveillance methods that have come under ferocious criticism from civil liberties groups, some members of Congress and others concerned about the reach of government into the private lives of citizens. National security and law enforcement officials repeated that the programs are tightly run with significant regulation and oversight by federal judges and Congress. Addressing the most basic questions that have emerged, Rogers asked Alexander if intelligence workers have the ability to simply ""flip a switch"" in order to listen to phone calls or read the emails of Americans. When Alexander replied ""no,"" Rogers asked again to reinforce the message for anyone listening. ""So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?"" he repeated. ""That is correct,"" Alexander answered. He and others also asserted that the leaks were egregious and carry huge consequences for national security. ""I think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation,"" Alexander said when questioned by Rep. Michele Bachmann. ""Has this helped America's enemies?"" the conservative Minnesota Republican asked. ""I believe it has and I believe it will hurt us and our allies,"" Alexander said. President Barack Obama has defended the programs as necessary in an era of terror. In an interview with PBS' Charlie Rose broadcast on Monday night, Obama said the situation requires a national debate on the balance between security and privacy. Obama bristles at suggestion he's shifted on snooping . Alexander told a Senate committee last week that the surveillance programs helped stop dozens of terror plots, but he was unable then to provide classified details. Under pressure from Rogers and other legislators, Alexander joined law enforcement officials Tuesday in making public some declassified details of the Patriot Act provisions. In recent years, Alexander said, information ""gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world."" Details of most of the thwarted terrorism acts remain secret, but national security officials said they were working on declassifying more information and could have a report to Congress as early as this week. Sean Joyce, the deputy FBI director, detailed how email surveillance of foreigners under one program helped authorities discover the two New York City plots. In the fall of 2009, Joyce said, the NSA intercepted an e-mail from a suspected terrorist in Pakistan. That person was talking with someone in the United States ""about perfecting a recipe for explosives,"" he said. Authorities identified Afghan-born Najibullah Zazi of Denver. The FBI followed him to New York and eventually broke up planning to attack the city's subway system. Zazi pleaded guilty and is currently in prison. Snowden claims online Obama expanded 'abusive' security . In the other New York case, the NSA was monitoring a ""known extremist"" in Yemen who was in contact with a person in the United States, Joyce said. The FBI detected ""nascent plotting"" to bomb the stock exchange, long considered a target of terrorists, and the plotters were later convicted, according to Joyce. He also said e-mail surveillance disrupted an effort to attack the office of a Danish newspaper that was threatened for publishing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in 2006. The plot involved David Headley, a U.S citizen living in Chicago. The FBI received intelligence at the time regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack that killed 164 people, Joyce said. The NSA, through surveillance of an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist, found that Headley was working on a plot to bomb the newspaper. Headley later confessed to conducting surveillance and was convicted. He also pleaded guilty to conducting surveillance in the Mumbai case. In a fourth case, secret surveillance ""tipped us off"" to a person who had indirect contacts with a known terrorist group overseas, Joyce said. ""We were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity,"" Joyce said. In an exchange with Joyce, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas said the case involved someone financing a designated terrorist group in Somalia. Rogers, who scheduled the hearing in recent days after Alexander pledged to declassify information on terror plots thwarted by the secret programs, said it was necessary to clear up public confusion caused by misinformation. ""If half the things I read in blog and other places were true, I wouldn't support it,"" the Michigan Republican said, later adding that skeptics ""have no understanding"" of what is going on. In particular, he said Snowden disclosed only a sliver of information about the programs without knowing the full extent of what they did and the strict regulation and oversight of them. ""None of the things he talked about were accurate,"" Rogers said of Snowden. The hearing came one day after Snowden defended his actions in leaking classified documents to Britain's Guardian newpaper and the Washington Post. In a series of blog posts on the Guardian website, the 29-year-old Snowden said he disclosed the information because Obama worsened ""abusive"" surveillance practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a presidential candidate. The former NSA contractor insisted that U.S. authorities have access to phone calls, e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds. While he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the NSA, FBI and CIA, Snowden stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws. Instead, he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called ""suspicionless surveillance,"" and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses. At Tuesday's hearing, officials detailed how the programs operate and the judicial and legislative oversight involved, repeating several times how access to the content of e-mails or telephone calls -- or even the names of people involved -- required authorization. Deputy Attorney General James Cole noted that basic phone records collected under Section 215 of the Patriot Act were not protected by Fourth Amendment rights to privacy, citing a 1979 Supreme Court ruling. In the case, Smith v. Maryland, the justices ruled that information about telephone calls -- such as their time and duration -- was different from the content of the calls and therefore not protected under the Fourth Amendment. Cole also provided a detailed description of the legal framework of the programs, noting that the anti-terrorism surveillance effort is not ""off the books"" or ""hidden away."" ""This is part of what government puts together and discusses,"" he said. ""Statutes are passed. It is overseen by three branches of our government -- the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the Executive Branch."" He described the U.S. phone records collected under Section 215 as basic information ""just like what you would get in your own phone bill."" ""It is the number that was dialed from, the number that was dialed to, the date and the length of time. That's all we get,"" he said. ""We do not get the identity of any of the parties to this phone call. We don't get any cell site or location information as to where any of these phones were located. And, most importantly, and you're probably going to hear this about 100 times today, we don't get any content under this. We don't listen in on anybody's calls under this program at all."" Tech companies jockey to seem the most transparent . Instead, it takes permission from a special court to get access to further information, based on a verifiable link to a terrorism investigation, Cole explained. Such links have mostly come from another surveillance program that collects communications information of foreign terrorism suspects living overseas. Critics question the need to store the vast amount of U.S. phone records, saying it creates a database prone to abuses and provides little return for the risk and privacy concerns. Alexander said Tuesday the phone database played a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks. At the same time, he and other officials said there were no cases they knew of in which anyone willfully misused the system to access information. ""If you're looking for the needle in a haystack,"" Cole said, ""you have to have the haystack.""","Officials disclose details of plots to bomb New York's subway system, stock exchange .

"(CNN) -- There have been 108 goals scored in this World Cup. Greece has scored a total of 0. And yet, if things go its way today, it could make it to the knockout round. That's one of five things we'll be watching for and talking about Tuesday: . 1. ENGLAND V. COSTA RICA . Leaving on a jet plane: . What a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad World Cup it's been for England. Sure, Wayne Rooney scored that goal that had eluded him for three World Cups. But to what end? The Three Lions still had their feast spoiled by Uruguay last week. Today, England is hoping for at least a draw -- so it doesn't leave with a goose egg for the first time. (Costa Rica is already through.) UPDATE: Well, England got its draw. But not a win or even a goal. The result meant Costa Rica -- predicted by many to finish last in Group D -- instead came in first. 2. ITALY V. URUGUAY . Right down the line: . This is the match to watch today. Both Uruguay and Italy have 3 points in Group D. Winning is crucial for moving on up. Here's hoping the Italian coach gave the team a refresher course on staying onside. In its game with Costa Rica, the Italian boys were caught offside 11 times! Fix that, and make opportunities for magic man Mario Balotelli, and Italy may make it through. But watch out! Something's gotten into Uruguay. After a stunning loss to Costa Rica, they were sizzling hot against England -- especially with the return of injury-plagued Luis Suarez. UPDATE: Italy is out of the World Cup, and it's got to hurt in more ways than one. First, there's their 1-0 loss to Uruguay. But what everyone is talking about is star Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez allegedly biting the shoulder of Italian defender Girogio Chiellini a few minutes before the game's lone goal. 3. GREECE V. IVORY COAST . All it takes is one: . We get it, Greece. You're really great at defense. You proved that when you played with 10 players for most of the match with Japan, and still held them to a goalless draw. But it's time to aim for the net now. Like Greece, the Ivory Coast hasn't ever made it to the Round of 16. A win will change that. Brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure have decided to stay with the squad as they mourn the death of another sibling, Ibrahim, who passed away of cancer last week. UPDATE: Greece did it. They scored two goals, the last on a penalty kick in extra time to earn a 2-1 win and a berth in the knockout stages. The result also assured an end to the World Cup hopes of Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure and their Ivory Coast cohorts. 4. JAPAN V. COLOMBIA . Tangled up in blue: . We want to love Japan. They have the nicest fans. But the Blue Samurais have been meh. And we're not sure they have a fighting chance today. They not only have to win against Colombia, they'll also have to hope that the Ivory Coast draws or loses the other game. Colombia's sitting pretty at the top of the group. They're already through. But we want to see their 22-year-old phenom, James Rodriguez, score again. Because that dude can give Shakira a run for her money(maker). UPDATE: Colombia has been unstoppable up until Tuesday. Against Greece, they gave their fans more reason to dance -- four goals worth, in fact, en route to a 4-1 win and a spot atop Group C. 5. MONDAY'S RECAPS . Mexico - Croatia: 3-1 . The scouting report goes something like this: Rafa Marquez is the target player for Mexico on corner kicks. Mark him with two players if you have to. He'll make you pay if he gets his head to the ball. Croatia missed that page and now El Tri is moving on to the next round while the Blazers are going home. Marquez scored Mexico's opener and assisted on the second. And if that wasn't enough to watch the game, the Mexican coach's priceless expressions sure were. Brazil - Cameroon: 4-1 . If you've been watching Brazil play this World Cup, know that you're witnessing a legend in the making: Neymar. He scored his fourth goal in three games and booked his country a date with Chile. Just two more goals and he'll be the top scorers in the tournament so far. And he's only 22. Netherlands - Chile: 2-0 . Chilean fans wear their emotions on their sleeves, and their shoulders, and on their faces. So, losing to the Netherlands made you just want to give them all a big hug. And then remind them: Stop it, you're in the next round. The Dutch showed again they can be Speedwork Orange as Arjen Robben, in the counterattack, with the insightful cross to Memphis Depay, put Chile away. ""It was a very good game to watch,"" Robben said afterward. Well, maybe for your team. Spain - Australia: 3-0 . Where was this Spain all this time? Three goals! That's two more than all the goals it scored in its other World Cup games combined this year. This is how a defending champ should play. But clearly, Spain got the memo too late. It's going home. It was the last international match for David Villa, who spent the last two games on the bench watching Spain lose. He went out in style yesterday.

"(CNN) -- Noah and Connor Barthe, the two boys apparently killed by a 100-pound African rock python in Canada, died from asphyxiation, according to preliminary autopsy results. ""While we now have some preliminary information, investigators still have to wait for other test results to come back and for the final report,"" Sgt. Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday. ""We recognize that this has touched the hearts of people across the world and that people want to know how this could have happened. Our investigators are looking at all aspects of this tragic incident, and that will take some time,"" he said. Noah, 4, and Connor, 6, were found dead Monday morning. Sometime before dawn, the snake came crashing through the ceiling of the apartment where they were spending the night. The apartment was the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, a family friend whose Campbellton, New Brunswick pet store was downstairs. Tremblay said the python was kept upstairs in a custom-built glass enclosure similar to an aquarium. The cage reached the ceiling, and the snake was somehow able to crawl through a vent into the building's ductwork. It was above the living room, where the boys were sleeping, when the ceiling fell in. The snake was found in the same room as the boys, Tremblay said. He would provide no further details. He said the RCMP is conducting a criminal investigation but wouldn't discuss possible charges. ""Obviously, it's not a standard or regular case,"" he said. ""It's very traumatic for the family that this happened. But for the police, this is an investigation where there's a loss of life, and our approach to analyze a scene is almost identical, although here we're dealing with a reptile."" Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that the python was between 11 and nearly 15 feet long and weighed more than 99 pounds. It was euthanized. The necropsy showed the snake was in good overall health, Tremblay said. Deaths caused by large constrictor snakes like pythons are fairly rare. The Humane Society documents 17 people who have died in incidents in the United States related to the snakes since 1978, 12 of them since 1990. CNN's Matt Smith, Jethro Mullen, Dana Ford and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Noah and Connor Barthe, aged 4 and 6, were found dead Monday morning .

"New York (CNN) -- Lions may be kings of the jungle, but for nearly two hours, two kittens ruled the concrete jungle as officials halted New York subway service Thursday. The fearless felines risked all nine lives meandering the subway Thursday, causing part of it to be shut down for 90 minutes as personnel cut the power to begin their search. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended subway service on the B and Q lines between the Kings Highway and DeKalb Avenue stops in Brooklyn -- about 6 miles of track -- to search for two cats that were reported seen at about 11 a.m., MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said. MTA had to cut the power to the third rail, which carries 600 volts of electricity. ""If you touch that third rail, you're not going to make it -- people and especially cats, anything that moves,"" Ortiz said. New Yorkers are accustomed to seeing critters, but it's usually rats and mice scampering around the underground tunnels, leaving the alley cats above ground. Even though the search was for a couple of friendly felines, some riders were not happy with the inconvenient suspension. ""It's a waste of money. They could have been doing something else. It's a waste of money. But that's the MTA for you,"" subway rider and former MTA employee Wilson Burton told CNN affiliate WABC. The New York Police Department was brought to the scene later in the day for crowd control. ""As the trains backed up, the crowds build up and people are late in their travels. We have to make sure everyone gets to their place safely,"" Lt. Paul Ng of the NYPD said. Though the sneaky cats were at large on the tracks for more than seven hours, they reappeared around 6 p.m. and were corralled and captured within the half hour, MTA spokeswoman Judie Glave said. They were taken to a nearby shelter, police said. It is MTA protocol for conductors to stop and call in anytime something is on or traveling on the tracks, so it is in the best interest of customers and MTA to clear the track as soon as possible, Glave said. The pair was found in the same spot where they were first sighted earlier in the day, despite the running trains and the re-electrified deadly third rail. It was a close call -- but, luckily, curiosity didn't kill these cats.","Two kittens spotted at MTA station in Brooklyn .

"(CNN) -- In Florida, a 64-year-old bus driver has been criticized for failing to physically intervene in a three-on-one fight that took place in July. The bus driver says he was afraid to step in. As a high school teacher, I can't blame him. The adults who work in public schools are outnumbered. When a violent, hormone-fueled scene unfolds, it's our duty to quell the calamity with every resource we have in the name of safety. But where do we draw the line? Early in my teaching career, I was afraid of some of the bigger boys at school, especially one. I could see he carried a great deal of hatred inside -- for me, for his classmates, for the world. He was tall and muscular; he could have been an athlete, but his poor grades, bad attitude and spotty record kept him from playing sports. One afternoon, as I waited outside my classroom door, I heard a scuffle behind me. The boy I feared and another, smaller boy were shoving each other by my white board. I stepped in, and told them to stop. When they didn't, I shouted louder and told another student, my go-to helper, to get another teacher. As the shoves turned to punches, rage grew in the larger boy's eyes. The other student asked him to stop, but he had thrust his hands around his neck. I tried to pull him free, but the large boy shoved, pressing the other student and my arm against the cinder block wall. I felt trapped and frightened, and thought I might black out. Just then, two male teachers pulled the boys apart and dragged them to the office. ""Are you OK?"" a third teacher said. ""Look at your hand!"" My wrist was red and swollen. It hurt, but not as much as knowing I wasn't safe in my own classroom. My neighbor teacher took over my class so that I could go to the office to fill out an incident report. I could barely grip the pen. Two police officers assigned to our school urged me to file assault charges against the boys, but I insisted they just hadn't seen me. I wanted to believe that they wouldn't hurt me, but I also wondered if the boy would retaliate if the law got involved. Fortunately, my wrist was only sprained and I returned to work the next day in a cumbersome brace. But I kept wondering, what if the boy had pushed the other one harder? What if his anger was directed at me? Suppose it was my head that was smashed against that cinderblock wall? What if he'd had a weapon? On the other side, what if adrenaline gave me undiscovered strength and I had hurt one of them? Could their parents sue me? Would I lose my job? Both students were expelled, but the one I'd been afraid of eventually returned. ""C'mon, man,"" he'd scowl when I asked him to hurry along to class. When I saw anger in his eyes, I backed away, and if needed, I asked for help. Almost a decade later and much wiser, I'm no longer afraid of my students, but I've made some changes to how I approach fights since then. I shout at students to stop and try to keep the crowd under control from a distance. If available and in working order, I'll use a radio or phone to contact administrators or school resource officers. Their appearance usually signals the end of a fight. After all, administrators are the disciplinarians in the school, with more training and higher pay than teachers, bus drivers or janitors. Officers wear badges, carry the pepper spray and, above all, are trained for combat situations. Of the many classes one must take in order to earn a teaching degree, not one prepares us for the possibility of classroom combat. Supplemental training in restraints and fight intervention is made available to some teachers, but I and most other teachers I know are mainly qualified to fight ignorance. We're the ones who can prevent fights from happening in the first place. I always ask a student who seems angrier or quieter than usual what's wrong, even if, ""nothing,"" is the only answer I receive. I always listen to my students' seemingly banal chatter because fights seldom break out without some sort of a build up. Many times, one of my students, like a high school Don King, will bring an upcoming brawl to my attention. If fight rumors start to flood the hallways, or even if something seems a little off, it's best to bring it to the attention of the administrators or school resource officers. In many cases, students want an adult to intervene before the first fist is thrown. I've learned that the most responsible action can be protecting yourself so you can care for others. In keeping myself safe, I'm better able to protect my other students, the innocent bystanders. I have children of my own who need me to be functioning at 100%. I'm pregnant now, and when school starts in a few weeks, I must first and foremost protect my unborn child. For all of those reasons and more I will remain a conscientious objector during fights that occur in my classroom. As a parent, I'd expect the same of my children's teachers. I know that, like me, they didn't enter their classrooms to be prison guards, and that they'd prefer to guide children toward higher roads to civility. Sometimes it just takes a peaceful protest to get them there. Would you step in to stop a fight among teens? Do you expect the people who work at your child's school to do it?

"(CNN) -- One thing did shock me on my visit to Iran last month: the immigration officer at Tehran Airport smiled as he stamped my passport. This rare travel incident set the tone for the rest of my trip. You wouldn't know it for all the diplomatic sound and fury that surround the country, but possibly the most exceptional thing about Iran compared with the other Middle Eastern countries I've been to -- and I've visited them all, as a roving travel correspondent and Middle East specialist -- is how almost manically welcoming everyone is. Other than that, its extraordinary archaeological wealth, palaces dripping with former regal indulgence, elaborate Islamic gardens and urban skylines bristling with minarets deserve to place it alongside Turkey and Dubai on the international tourist circuit. Whether the election of Hassan Rouhani to the presidency earlier this month will spur more travel to the country remains to be seen, but his moderate political stance at home and abroad at least bodes well for tourism. Sharia immersion . Sure, there are things you might not be used to in Iran. The country follows Sharia law, of course, but it's not as sinister as some people think. Women must cover their heads with a shawl (including in the photo they send in with their visa application) and alcohol is prohibited. But most of the obstacles to travel in Iran arise before you get there. No doubt your acquaintances will try to put you off, for a start, made wary by the overwhelmingly tense news that emanates from the country. Tourist visas, too, can take up to a month to obtain. On the bright side, most are -- eventually -- issued without question. Then there are the typically dire but, in my experience, exaggerated Western government travel advisories on the country. Curiously, while Britain advises ""against all travel"" to Iran, the U.S. State Department merely suggests its citizens ""carefully consider the risks"" of a trip. Those ultra-cautious advisories, like an overprotective aunt, also risk invalidating your travel insurance -- so be sure to check the fine print of your policy if you have one. But perhaps the greatest risk of visiting this member of the former ""axis of evil,"" as George W. Bush memorably described it, is being profiled by your own government. Zoroastrian fire temple . Am I putting you off yet? Well, let's consider what you'll miss out on if you don't one day slot Iran into your travel itinerary: most travelers who do take the plunge come away raving about the place. Among the highlights of my recent visit was the Zoroastrian fire temple in the city of Yazd, whose flame is said to have burned since 470 AD. Nearby, I climbed to the hilltop Tower of Silence, where the Zoroastrian dead were picked clean by vultures to avoid contaminating the earth right up until the 1960s. Then there's the National Jewels Museum (Ferdowsi Avenue; +98 21 6446 3785) in Tehran -- where most travelers start their Iranian trip -- located in a vault beneath the Central Bank of Iran. Among its treasures are the 182-carat Darya-e Nur diamond, so chunky and iridescent it virtually constitutes its own light source. There, too, you'll find the emerald, sapphire and pearl-studded Peacock Throne, stolen by one of the shahs from a Mughal emperor. Fancy a further glimpse of Iran before the January 1979 Islamic Revolution, which sent the last shah into exile and turned the country into one of the West's biggest bad boys? There's the grand Golestan, Niyavaran and Sa'd Abad palaces, unchanged since that seismic political event. They're all worth visiting. What you won't find in Tehran are surly crowds chanting anti-Western slogans or hustlers similar to those cruising the streets of Cairo and Istanbul. Imam Square . Isfahan is the next stop on many Iran itineraries, with its Imam Square said to be the second largest such urban space in the world after Tiananmen in Beijing. Facing this immodest expanse are the gloriously tiled Lotfollah and Shah mosques, the seven-story Ali-Qapu Palace and the entrance portal to the huge Bozorg Bazaar. Nearby, the 16th- and 17th-century frescoes of the Chehel Sotun Palace are alive with color and incident. Frescoes also illuminate the Vank Armenian Cathedral south of the Zayandeh River, itself crossed by three massive 17th-century stone bridges. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, wine production may have dried up but some of the finest gardens, historic homes, mosques and markets in the country remain. Most people stop by Shiraz en route to ancient Persepolis, less than an hour to the northeast. The ruins of this ancient Persian capital, built by Darius the Great in 520 BC and sacked by the equally great Alexander 200 years later, were buried under sand until the 1930s and are well preserved. Darius and Xerxes . A short drive from Persepolis is Naqsh-e Rostam, with the cliff tombs of the Persian kings Darius I and II, Xerxes and Artaxerxes. Finally, Yazd, on the Silk Road toward Central Asia, has one of the largest and best preserved medieval quarters in the Middle East. The portal of Jame Mosque (1324) is the highest in the country with towering twin minarets, a hallmark of the Shia faction of Islam. There, again, is that eerie Zoroastrian fire temple, with its apparently unquenchable flame. These sights stay with you as markers of a great, enduring civilization. But perhaps the most enduring memory is how universally friendly ordinary Iranians are. In a world in which jaded attitudes about tourists reach from Tenerife to Timbuktu, it may take a while before it stops feeling strange. David Stanley has written guidebooks for Lonely Planet and Moon Handbooks.","Travel to member of former ""axis of evil"" may increase with election of new president .

"(CNN) -- Often forgotten in our national political discourse are those who need our attention the most: the poor. On Thursday evening in Washington, D.C., prominent broadcaster and author Tavis Smiley is setting out to remedy the situation with an important bipartisan discussion of poverty in America entitled, ""Vision for a New America: A Future Without Poverty."" The goal of the discussion, for which Smiley deserves credit, is to bring much-deserved attention and aid to America's poor. Systemic poverty maligns every generation of Americans, but the 2008 recession and subsequent lackluster recovery have exaggerated the problem to a crisis level. Smiley cites government figures that nearly half of all Americans are living in or near poverty. In 2011, the Census Bureau found that 49.7 million Americans were in actual poverty and the national poverty rate topped 16%. Worse, almost 20% of American children live in poverty. Food stamp use hit a record high in June of 2012 with 46.7 million Americans. Since October 2008, food stamp use has jumped more than 50%. An estimated one in four children was on food stamps in 2011. For decades, America has wrestled with poverty but with little success. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson famously declared ""war on poverty."" A 2012 study by the Cato Institute estimates that the United States has spent roughly $15 trillion since then, and yet the poverty rate is close to where it was more than 40 years ago. Cato reports that the United States spends nearly $1 trillion a year between federal and state programs to fight poverty. That amounts to more than $20,000 per poor person and more than $60,000 for a family of three. And yet, the problem has not improved. Both liberals and conservatives recognize this reality. However, Smiley and some on the left think the problem is that the government has not gone far enough. They call for more government intervention, like living wages and expanded social services. Granted, the government has a role in aiding the poor, particularly the disabled, handicapped and those who are poor largely at no fault of their own. But if history is any indicator, government transactions and services don't seem to be the key drivers of upward mobility. In fact, they can have the opposite effect and insulate lower classes from upward mobility. Instead, conservatives would argue that education, earned success and the all-important mediating institutions -- families, churches, communities, private and philanthropic enterprises, associations of coaches, teachers, parents, doctors, civil servants and religious and non-religious volunteers, the Boy Scouts and other worthy mentoring groups, all what Edmund Burke called the ""little platoons"" that make up healthy civil society -- are the pillars of upward mobility. The evidence seems to support that. In a landmark study, the Brookings Institution found that young adults who finish high school, get a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children have just a 2% chance of falling into poverty and a 74% chance of ending up in the middle class. Furthermore, young adults who violate all three conditions have a 76% chance of ending up in poverty and only a 7% chance of making it to the middle class. The threshold for middle-class success -- sound education and moral training -- is not high, but even on these measures our nation is falling short. Our education system is failing our children. In Washington, D.C., public schools, only 59% of high school students graduated on time in the 2010-2011 school year. We're not talking about academic excellence here, just basic graduation and completion of high school. It should come as no surprise then that the poverty rate in Washington was 18.7% in 2011. While many high school dropouts join the ranks of low-wage workers or the unemployed, American employers estimate 3 million skilled jobs are available right now. But our students, specifically our poor and underprivileged, lack the skills and education to fill those jobs. That must be remedied. At the same time, America's family unit is decaying in record fashion. In 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then assistant secretary of Labor and later a U.S. senator, authored The Moynihan Report to bring light to the economic and social breakdown of the black family. He warned about the catastrophic out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks, which was at that time less than 25%. Today, it is more than 70% for blacks and more than 40% for all Americans. With the nucleus of the family in shambles, the fabric of American society is unraveling one thread at a time. Conservatives are often criticized for harping on family values, but what many of the critics fail to acknowledge is that strong, healthy families are essential for a strong, healthy economy. We know that the poverty rate is higher among single parent households than in families with married couples. In fact, the marriage gap accounts for much of the income inequality in the labor force today. The first step to alleviating poverty is to promote better schools, families and churches. A national conversation about poverty must include these critical institutions. While we may disagree on economic solutions, Tavis Smiley acknowledges this much and I'm encouraged that with voices like his we can start building consensus around issues crucial to the upward mobility of many poor and disadvantaged Americans. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Often forgotten in our national political discourse are the poor .

"(CNN) -- Gaze across the Riyadh skyline and one building immediately demands your attention. Towering high above the city, with its distinctive inverted arch, is the 992 ft Kingdom Center -- owned by the richest man in Saudi Arabia, if not the Middle East. Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud's wealth has been estimated at anywhere between just over $20 billion by Forbes and more than $30 billion by Bloomberg. Whichever way you look at it, it's a lot of money -- could it be set to grow? Inside His Majesty's striking skyscraper is the headquarters of Kingdom Holding, one of the largest investment companies on the country's stock exchange. With plans to open up the market -- known locally as the Tadawul -- to foreign investors next year, this is the start of a brave new era for the phenomenally wealthy prince and Saudi businesses. Media mogul . Alwaleed already has high-profile stakes in media groups News Corp, Time Warner (CNN's parent company), and Walt Disney. Added to that, his $300 million stake in Twitter has quadrupled in value in just two years. Fellow billionaire, News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch, may have been unsuccessful in his recent attempt to take over Time Warner. But Alwaleed believes it might not be the end of the story just yet. ""Combining both companies (News Corp and Time Warner) would have been a dream proposal because the amount of content the combined company would have had would have been tremendous,"" he said. ""Knowing Mr Murdoch I think the idea is still in his mind. But I think the time is not right now because the management of Time Warner against it, and the shareholders of Fox were also not for it."" Oil rich? Saudi Arabia might be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but Alwaleed says now is the time for the kingdom to look beyond crude. ""It's a huge worry when the price of oil goes down,"" he said. ""I have always called on the Saudi government to reduce its dependence on oil, because as it stands today, 90% of our annual budget is dependent on oil. And 50% of our GDP is oil based."" Isis threat . Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia held exercises with 135,000 troops. But at a time where Isis exerts its power across parts of the Middle East, the prince does not believe boots on the ground is the way forward for his country. ""I think Saudi Arabia will not be involved directly in fighting Isis in Iraq or Syria, because this does not really affect our country explicitly,"" he said. ""Each killing by Isis that takes place is unfortunate, but hopefully every time it happens the world will be more united in eradicating this disease that's infecting the whole Middle East."" Billion dollar question . While other billionaires might downplay their fortune, the prince filed a lawsuit against Forbes after he claims it underestimated his wealth. ""They've been undervaluing my wealth for 10 years and I didn't give attention to it,"" he said. ""But when they came and attacked Saudi Arabia, and Kingdom Holding, and myself, that's when I didn't accept that and that's when we filed a lawsuit in the UK courts.""

"London (CNN) -- Peaches Geldof, the daughter of musician Bob Geldof and the late Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose after relapsing into use of the illegal drug following attempts to give it up, an inquest heard Wednesday. The death of the 25-year-old TV host in April at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, shocked the entertainment world. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently. Geldof, who had two children younger than 2, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2Â½ years, being prescribed methadone, he said. She had said she wanted to come off methadone completely and was following a reduction plan. A drug test in November indicated that she was not taking any illegal drugs, he said. However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that she had started using heroin again. High-grade heroin . Fotheringham's report to the inquest gave new details of Geldof's death. Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said. Inside was a bag containing what tests proved to be heroin as well as a bag of citric acid, used to make the heroin more soluble in water for injection, according to the report. The bag also held dozens of syringes, some sealed while others contained traces of a brown residue, alcohol wipes, cotton buds and cards advertising a needle exchange in central London. According to a police drug expert, PC Adrian Parsons, the heroin found was of ""importation quality"" -- that is, with a purity of 61%, compared with the average 26% purity found at street level. The 6.91 grams (about a quarter-ounce) recovered would have been worth Â£350 to Â£550 (about $600 to $940), Fotheringham said. Burnt spoon, knotted tights . Geldof was discovered sitting slumped on a bed in the spare bedroom by her husband, rock musician Tom Cohen, who went to their home after he became concerned when he couldn't contact her. The couple's younger son, Phaedra, was in the house at the time, having been dropped off by Cohen's father the previous afternoon. The musician had taken both children to spend the weekend at his parents' home. A pair of knotted black tights was found under her body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said. The tights could have been used as a tourniquet while she was injecting the drug. An autopsy also found evidence of recent puncture marks on the inside of both elbows and on her left hand. The inquest heard that tests by a forensic scientist suggested recent use of the drug, resulting in a ""high"" concentration of heroin in Geldof's body, which was ""at the end of the range of values at which fatalities have occurred."" She was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death, tests revealed. Nor had she taken a significant amount of any other substances in the hours leading up to her death. Reduced tolerance? The scientist's report notes that people using heroin regularly ""develop a tolerance to the drug, and such individuals can use doses that would be toxic, or fatal, to people with no tolerance."" But it adds that tolerance ""appears to be lost fairly rapidly when users cease to use the drug, and deaths commonly occur in people who have previously been tolerant and have returned to using heroin."" Fotheringham's report concluded, ""There is no indication that any other third party was present or involved in her death and there is no indication that Peaches intended to take her own life or harm herself in any way as she was reported to be of happy disposition and planning for the future with friends and family."" Geldof was 11 years old when her mother died of a drug overdose. Kent police continue to investigate who supplied the heroin to Geldof, but no arrests have been made. CNN's Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: Puncture marks found on Peaches Geldof's arms and one hand, an inquest hears .

"Washington (CNN) -- One hundred and fifty new full-body scanning machines are set to be placed in airports across the United States as federal authorities work to close security loopholes exposed by the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a U.S.-bound airliner. The Transportation Security Administration ordered the scanners before the bombing attempt for up to $170,000 apiece. Plans are also in place to purchase an additional 300 units by 2012, TSA officials said. Forty body scanners are currently in use at 19 U.S. airports. Use of the technology -- considered overly invasive by critics -- is optional, according to the TSA Web site. Passengers who opt out of the screening receive an alternate form of checking, which includes a pat-down procedure. There are two types of full-body scanners. One uses ""backscatter"" technology to produce an X-ray image of a person. The other uses millimeter-wave technology, which shows a detailed photo negative. TSA officials have attempted to address privacy concerns by promising to blur pictures of passengers' faces and delete all images produced. One former TSA official told CNN that a body scanner could have stopped Umar Farouq AbdulMutallab, the man accused of trying to blow up a December 25 Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan. ""I firmly believe in the whole body imaging system as a screening device,"" Charlotte Bryan said. ""I believe that it would have detected that there was something there in that position on his body. It may not have detected it as an explosive, but it certainly would've raised some flags that would have required further detection and a review either by an officer or further scanning."" Critics, however, warn that full-body scanners should not be the only answer to continued airport security problems. ""Right now the system is not working as effectively as it needs to be,"" said Geoff Freeman, a representative of the U.S. Travel Association. ""It's time to hit the pause button and do a wholesale review of what we have today and put in place the policies that will (give) America the most secure and efficient travel process.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities said Friday that an Iraqi man accused of running down his daughter in Arizona because she had become ""too Westernized"" has been taken into custody in Atlanta, Georgia. U.S. Marshals arrested Faleh Hassan Almaleki, 48, in Atlanta, according to spokesman James Ergas. Police in Peoria, Arizona, say Almaleki struck his 20-year-old daughter, Noor Faleh Almaleki, and her friend Amal Edan Khalaf with the Jeep Laredo he was driving in a parking lot in Peoria on October 20. After the incident, Almaleki drove to Mexico, abandoning his vehicle in Nogales, Peoria police said in a statement Friday. He then made his way to Mexico City and boarded a plane to London, England. British authorities denied him entry into the country, and he was put on a plane back to the United States, police said. Authorities arrested him late Thursday afternoon when he arrived at Atlanta's airport, police said, and he is awaiting extradition to Arizona. He will face two counts of aggravated assault, police said. Almaleki was angry with his daughter ""as she had become too 'Westernized' and was not living according to [the family's] traditional Iraq[i] values,"" Peoria police said in a statement last week. The daughter was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and remains ""unresponsive,"" Peoria police said Friday. Khalaf, 43, with injuries that are not life-threatening, is in serious but stable condition, police said. Noor Faleh Almaleki lives with Khalaf, Peoria police said. They did not elaborate on how the two women knew each other. Peoria is about 13 miles northwest of Phoenix.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. military spokesman confirmed the existence Friday of a report on detecting extremism in service members. But he disputed a claim that it was classified only after the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas. Security expert Shannen Rossmiller told CNN she contributed to a 2008 report aimed at helping the military spot signs of extremism among troops. She said the report was unclassified at its inception but is now under wraps. Rossmiller says the military's attitude about the report -- she says political correctness trumped the study -- caused it to fail in its intended purpose of helping the military detect signs that one of its own might pose a threat. On Friday, a spokesman for the U.S. military's European Command, Taylor Clark, said that his command has the report, but he denied that it was classified only after the shootings at Fort Hood. ""The classification of the document hasn't changed since its origination back in August of 2008,"" he said. Rossmiller said closer attention to the study could have helped prevent the November 5 shootings at Fort Hood. She said it was meant to detect signs of extremism like those reportedly exhibited by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who authorities say killed 13 at Fort Hood. Hasan was wounded in the incident and is paralyzed from the waist down. ""These people didn't have to die, and that's why I'm speaking out,"" Rossmiller said. ""It's an atrocity that this even had to happen. ... You would think, eight years after 9/11, we'd be smarter,"" she said. Rossmiller was involved in the case of National Guard Spc. Ryan G. Anderson, a Muslim convert who was convicted in 2004 of trying to pass information to al Qaeda over the Internet. Afterward, she was asked to contribute to the report, ""The Radicalization of Members within DoD"" (Department of Defense). It was completed in April 2008, she said. After the Anderson case, Rossmiller said, the military recognized a need for more awareness to stop radicalization among troops. ""The intent behind the whole report was to provide a useful tool for intelligence officials to spot and identify certain signs of radical behavior,"" she said. At the time it was completed, it was her understanding that it was not classified, she said. She told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360°"" that she understood the report was sent to ""intelligence officials within the defense community as well as the greater intelligence community."" After the Fort Hood shootings, she said she contacted the military after hearing no mention of the study in the media or from military officials. ""I sat quiet for a week,"" she told CNN. ""... People were acting like there was nothing out there that could have been useful."" Rossmiller said she was told the study was now classified. ""The Defense Department report was intended to prevent something like this, and it's just astonishing that this even had to happen after something like that has been prepared as a useful tool."" Watch Rossmiller accuse the military . A key congressional committee opened an investigation into the shootings Thursday, pledging to find out if authorities failed to ""connect the dots"" and could have prevented the attack. Members said they planned to focus on whether senior Army officials appropriately dealt with concerns raised by Hasan's colleagues about his ""mental stability and political extremism."" Among other issues, the FBI has said it was aware of communication between Hasan an Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric who has promoted jihad against the United States and other Western countries. But investigators determined that those contacts were ""consistent with research being conducted by Maj. Hasan."" Also, a memo reportedly written two years ago by Hasan's supervisor at Walter Reed Army Medical Center says Hasan demonstrated ""a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism"" during his residency at the hospital. CNN could not corroborate the authenticity of the memo, which was obtained by National Public Radio. A former classmate has said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, the source said that Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military. ""People are saying that, 'Wow, this is brand new,' but in my travels, in talking with counterterrorism experts around the world, especially in Europe, this whole process of radicalization has gone through a much more in-depth study, a much more professional rigor than I think what we've seen in the United States,"" Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We could have learned from them, and it looks like we didn't."" A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN that when Hasan first came to the attention of investigators because of his communications with al-Awlaki, officials looked at his military personnel file, and nothing was found that raised suspicion. None of the items that have been reported since the shootings -- including the reported Walter Reed memo and the PowerPoint presentation arguing that Muslims in the Army should be allowed conscientious objector status -- were part of the file, the official said, but it was noted that Hasan had done research about Muslims in the military. Rossmiller said she was incredulous when Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a 45-day review of Pentagon policies to see if the Defense Department had fallen short in identifying service members ""who could potentially pose credible threats to others."" That review apparently will do ""exactly what this report encompassed,"" Rossmiller said. ""It's just like, you know what? They need to fall on their sword and we need to fix this."" ""I think what you need to do here is, you need to understand the phenomenon,"" Hoekstra said. ""I think the political correctness here is not about profiling. It is a reluctance to acknowledge that this problem actually exists, to confront it and ultimately, then, to defeat it. I think that we can study this problem.""

"(CNN) -- Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Wednesday signed three gun-control measures into law, including one that will require universal background checks for gun sales. The measures also will make buyers pay for their own background checks and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. The Colorado laws go into effect July 1. What is a universal background check? New York passed new gun-control legislation after the December killings at Newtown Elementary School, but it already had some of the stiffest gun laws in the country. Colorado, where firearms are almost as much a part of the landscape as the Rocky Mountains, is a different case. It's long been a politically conservative state, voting Democratic just once in the 10 presidential elections that followed Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide. But in recent years, its political center of gravity has tilted leftward: It went for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, voted to legalize recreational marijuana last year, and state lawmakers this year voted to allow civil unions for same-sex couples. Then there's also the bloody history of the past decade or so -- the mass shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton and a movie theater in Aurora, both Denver suburbs. Still, it took the December killings at Newtown ""to really wake up America's conscience and realize that there were better solutions,"" said Sandy Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, died at Aurora. Gun-rights advocates call the Colorado bills unenforceable, feel-good measures that are likely to backfire. Nick DeCarlo owns a 2,000-acre bird-hunting preserve in Wiggins, on the prairie northeast of Denver. He says his clients are unhappy with the new legislation, particularly language that limits shotguns to eight rounds. ""They're upset to the point where it's like they feel Colorado is being stereotyped as a gun-control state,"" DeCarlo said. That's going to keep businesses from moving to the state and hunters from visiting, he said. Already, he said, out-of-state customers are telling him they've made their last visit. Richard Taylor, a manager at the Aurora gun store and range Firing Line, said the 15-round restrictions on rifle magazines are ""poorly worded"" and are likely to affect owners of nearly every magazine. He said sheriffs consider the new legislation unenforceable, and the $10 limit on charging individual buyers for background checks is far below the $50 a store typically charges for handling a transfer. Phillips said the obstacles are small compared to the potential price. ""Let's say it takes $10 and 10 minutes of your time, and it's going to protect somebody from getting a gun that they shouldn't have,"" she said. ""Ten dollars and 10 minutes is worth the time that it takes to save a life."" Colorado voted to make background checks for gun-show purchases mandatory after Columbine, when investigators learned that the weapons used by the teenage killers were bought by an 18-year-old at a gun show to avoid a background check. The buyer, Robyn Anderson, later told a state House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been ""too easy."" CNN's Jennifer Feldman and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Governor signs gun-control bills in long-conservative Colorado .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In the single deadliest loss for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in late 2001, 30 service members died early Saturday when a helicopter carrying them went down while they were reinforcing other troops, officials said. Insurgents are believed to have shot down the CH-47 Chinook, a U.S. military official said. The Taliban claimed militants downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. Among the 25 U.S. special operations forces killed in Wardak province were 22 Navy SEALS, considered to be the ""best of the best."" Seven Afghan troops also died. The majority of the Navy SEALs who died belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, though they were not the same men, the military official said. The troops died during a ""quick reaction"" mission to assist military personnel pinned down by insurgents in a fierce firefight, a U.S. military official told CNN. ""It's a big loss"" for the SEALs, one of the officials said. ""The numbers are high."" Reflecting on the sobering loss, President Barack Obama said the deaths were ""a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan."" NATO's International Security Assistance Force said 30 U.S. service members in ISAF, one civilian interpreter and seven Afghan commandos were killed. The nationality of the interpreter was not known late Saturday. Among those killed was Aaron Carson Vaughn, 30, his grandmother told CNN Saturday night. She called him a brave warrior and gentle man. Geneva Carson Vaughn of Union City, Tennessee, said Aaron lived with his wife and two small children in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The SEAL told her in June not to worry about his well-being, she said. ""He said 'I'm not afraid. Because I know where I am going if something happens to me.' "" ""He is with the Lord now,"" she said. ""I will see him again someday."" The U.S. deaths came as NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with the full draw-down expected to take place by the end of 2014. However, no one is talking about withdrawing special operations forces and they are expected to stay on the job. ""We are determined to stay the course, especially in this crucial period when Afghan and international security forces are working closer than ever to make transition a success,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. Special operations forces have been conducting almost daily night-time raids against insurgent targets in rugged areas like Wardak. The Chinook went down as an Afghan and coalition force operation targeted a bomb-making cell leader in Wardak, leading to the detention of numerous insurgents Friday, according to ISAF. It is not clear if the helicopter incident and the raid were connected. Mohammad Hazrat Janan, head of the provincial council, said Tangi village elders reported that insurgents shot at the craft when it was returning from an operation. Officials are being especially tight-lipped because recovery operations at the site are still underway and body identifications and family notifications are just beginning, a U.S. military official said. ISAF has not said how the incident occurred. Spokesman Justin Brockhoff acknowledged the helicopter had been flying in an area where there was reported insurgent activity. ""No words describe the sorrow we feel in the wake of this tragic loss,"" said Gen. John R. Allen, ISAF commander. ""All of those killed in this operation were true heroes who had already given so much in the defense of freedom. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who are now waiting for their loved ones to return home. We will do everything in our power to support them in this time of need."" The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, which said the helicopter went down Friday evening, said ISAF ""is still assessing the circumstances that resulted in these deaths."" Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said it's too early to say if the Taliban caused the crash. He called for an investigation. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Obama and others offered condolences. ""Information is still coming in about this incident. I think it's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions,"" said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""It's also important that we respect the process of notifying family members, no matter how long that takes. We ought to remember that the troops we lose in this war aren't just statistics or numbers on a wall. They were parents and siblings, and someone's child. We need to make sure we do all we can to comfort and support the families whose lives are now forever changed."" Obama was first notified of the incident shortly after 8 p.m. Friday, a White House official told CNN. The president led a telephone briefing midmorning Saturday. The CH-47 Chinook is the workhorse helicopter of the Army, used for decades to haul large numbers of troops and quantities of equipment. The military is looking into whether the helicopter was vulnerable to being shot down. Depending on the configuration, the tandem-rotor Chinook can carry 33 to 55 troops, plus two pilots on the flight deck, according to Jane's Defence Equipment and Technology. It is capable of speeds up to 159 mph. The front rotor turns counter-clockwise while the rear rotor turns clockwise. The SEALs, and other special operations forces, are given dangerous missions and go after insurgents in remote areas. A huge amount of money, training and expertise is poured into their careers. Along with carrying out counter-terrorism assaults on the Afghan-Pakistani border, they conduct training and military missions around the world. The Afghan street is buzzing with reflection about the significance of the incident. ""It shows that the Taliban are very strong and have not been defeated by the U.S.,"" said Kabul resident Saifurahman Ahmezai. But others said the incident is not emblematic of a new-found insurgent strength. ""The Taliban are not that powerful,"" said Hezat, a police officer in Kabul who goes only by one name. ""But if the international forces leave Afghanistan, the situation will get even worse."" Last month, a NATO helicopter was brought down by insurgent fire in the country's eastern province of Kunar. The Taliban also claimed responsibility for that attack, though no injuries were reported. In a separate incident, a NATO service member died Saturday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Afghanistan. Elsewhere, a joint Afghan and coalition force conducted raids in the eastern province of Nangarhar, killing ""several insurgents,"" NATO reported. The operation also targeted a ""Taliban facilitator,"" who NATO said was responsible for supplying ammunition and bomb-making materials to the Taliban. In July, a series of gun battles in Nangarhar between insurgents and NATO forces left at least 10 militants dead. There are 150,000 ISAF forces in Afghanistan, including nearly 100,000 from the United States -- the largest NATO presence in the region since the U.S.-led war began in 2001. David Ariosto reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Barbara Starr and Steve Brusk reported from Washington.","NEW: Grandmother talks of loss of SEAL .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- It began as an annual festival to host local poets in and around Cape Town but thanks to the power of technology the ancient art of African story-telling is spreading around the world. A poetry collective decided to set up Badilisha Poetry Radio, which in Swahili means change. Its aim is to celebrate the spoken and written word through online radio and live performance. Broadcasting from South Africa, poet Malika Ndlovu and her colleagues are spreading their reach far beyond this corner of the continent. ""The reality is that even if you are doing fantastic work and nobody gets to read it or gets to hear you on a mic or gets to see it on a screen you might as well not be doing it,"" Ndlovu said. Ndlovu says the project is the first of its kind. She explains that it is not just for fans of spoken word but also a meeting place for Pan-African poets. As well as the online radio, artists can submit work on the web and listen to others for inspiration. From South Africa to Somalia to everywhere in between there are more than a hundred pod-casts archived on the site in the hope of redefining the way people think about African poetry. Ndlovu and her team work with the poets to help them upload the audio of their work. The archive of podcasts also features the poets profile along with the text of the poem. If it's not in English it will come with a translation for the reader. Ndlovu says until now there have not been enough spoken word role models and a lack of documentation of African poets. She hopes the group will inspire young poets and story-tellers across Africa, as well as providing them with a global stage. ""I think what also Badilisha and a range of other poetry projects are doing is rectifying mis-education, in our continent especially we've had a very Euro-centric diet, on page and only from quite an academic perspective around what poetry is,"" she explained. ""Learn from the pioneers and the skill and the trends that have been there but also what is your voice, what is your indigenous voice and the places you come from, your individuality,"" she continued. South African artist changing lives with street murals . The idea began as a poetry festival in 2008 before becoming an online archive and later an internet radio channel in 2010. Ndlovu says that the festival's reach was too small and a bigger platform was needed. The main idea behind allowing poets to upload their own podcasts was to provide a global stage for African writers, an opportunity that Ndlovu says they haven't had in the past. The group also tries to explore the poetic form as a tool for social activism and provide a space for discussion and debate through expression. ""What I believe I am is a healer, using poetry as my first medium, I come from a theater background, I sing as well and perform with musicians and video artists who do projections, so poetry for me is a very holistic, multiple medium - kind of expression,"" she said. Ndlovu says when she and the other poets founded the collective a few years ago they never thought it would get as popular as it is today. She says she didn't realize there was such a need for an outlet like this. ""African poetry on the African continent is thriving, it's the visibility and the audibility of it that is something I'm hoping we aspire to with Badilisha Poetry Radio,"" she said. ""We can't all fly, we can't all be on every stage, we can't all be in the media spotlight, but how do we recognize the treasure and value of what is here and what is constantly evolving, this medium is immediate, it brings it home and to the globe at the same time,"" she continued.","Badilisha Poetry Radio broadcasts spoken word online from Cape Town .

"(CNN) -- You might know South Africa for Kruger National Park, where you can see the Big Five, or for the gorgeous beaches and wine farms that surround Cape Town. But there's more to see and do around this 1.2-million-square-kilometer (463,000 square miles) country. These 10 destinations help round out a full South Africa experience. 1. Johannesburg . Often shunned by visitors, Jozi (as South Africans call Johannesburg) thrives on new ideas, outrageous talent and bold creativity. It's a city with an energy all of its own -- for that reason alone it's worth exploring. What to do: You can soak up the vibe at Maboneng Precinct, an inner-city neighborhood that's become a trendy gathering place for artists, foodies and performers. Food, accommodation and entertainment are all here. Another creative gathering space is 44 On Stanley. Once a collection of industrial buildings, it's been transformed into space that houses design studios, coffee shops and boutique stores. Where to stay: The Troyeville Hotel is as famous for the artists and political activists who've stayed here, as it is for the hearty Portuguese cuisine it's served them. Operating as a hotel since the 1930s, the Troyeville's intellectually inclined gatherings remain legendary for good food and conversation. 2. Cradle of Humankind . Experts say we all come from an area just hour outside of Johannesburg: the Cradle of Humankind. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has been inhabited by humans and our ancestors for more than 3 million years, providing an incredible look into our development as a species. What to do: The area is divided into two main sections. Maropeng has the official visitor center, built as a grassy dome. From here you can take an underground boat trip. The Sterkfontein Caves have exhibitions and trails into the caves. This is a fascinating area, with world-class interactive exhibitions, requiring a full day to take it all in. Where to stay: To sleep close to where it all began, you can stay at the Maropeng Boutique Hotel. The hotel, which has lovely views across the Magaliesberg and Witwaterberg mountains, is a short walk from the Maropeng visitor center. 3. Free State . The Free State is a province wrapped around the north of Lesotho that bulges into South Africa's interior. It's a province dominated by farm areas -- but in the east, in the foothills of the Maluti Mountains, there's spectacular scenery. What to do: Sunrise and sunset are memorable times at the Golden Gate Highlands National Park, when the sun's rays turn majestic sandstone cliffs into columns of deep yellow and ocher. Game viewing at this park is good -- you can expect to see eland, blesbok, springbok and black wildebeest. Guided horseback rides take in the peaceful, picturesque town of Clarens. Surrounded by sandstone mountains, it's known for art galleries and pottery studios. The Free State is a three-hour drive from Johannesburg -- it's a popular weekend trip for locals. Where to stay: Just outside Clarens, Kiara Lodge has a spa, swimming pool, good restaurant and lots of activities. The views are lovely, and it's a good base for exploring the Golden Gate Highlands National Park and Clarens. 4. The Battlefields . The Drakensberg is one of South Africa's most dramatic mountain ranges, where the land drops through cliffs and valleys and into undulating hills and flatlands that eventually extend toward the east coast. Below ""the Berg,"" the flatlands and hills mingle around the towns of Ladysmith and Dundee, where some of the most epic battles between the English, Afrikaners and Zulus were fought in the late 1800s. Known as The Battlefields, this beautifully wild area was the scene of bloody clashes during the Anglo-Boer and Anglo-Zulu wars. What to do: Hiring a guide helps get the full picture of these dramatic battle sites. Where to stay: Nambiti Hills is an exclusive five-star private game reserve that can be used as a base for viewing both the Big Five and embarking on guided tours of the battlefields. Amphi Backpackers is a budget-friendly option. From here, there are walking or climbing day trips into the Drakensberg. 5. The Midlands . KwaZulu-Natal's Midlands is a popular weekend getaway from the city. The winding roads through the pretty farming area have become home to many top restaurants, cafes, art galleries and guesthouses, most of which belong to the Midlands Meander tourism route. What to do: The Capture Site marks the spot where Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1962. It's possible to fly through the trees at Karkloof Canopy Tours, eat fine food at Hartford House, an award-winning restaurant (and guesthouse) and shop for handcrafted leather shoes at Groundcover. Where to stay: Rawdons is a stately hotel near a town called Nottingham Road. It's cozy and English -- pretty gardens, plush decor, roaring log fires. A highlight for many is the Boar's Head Pub, serving ales and lagers made by the independent Nottingham Road Brewing Company. 6. Umhlanga Rocks . Many have heard of Durban, the city on South Africa's east coast (surfers love it) beloved for its warm weather throughout the year. Not so familiar is Umhlanga Rocks. About 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) up the coast and just 15 minutes from Durban International Airport, upmarket Umhlanga, with wide, sandy beaches, has a permanent vacation vibe. It's packed with big beach houses, blocks of seaside apartments, hotels, restaurants, cafes and bars and the enormous Gateway Theatre of Shopping, reportedly the largest shopping mall in the southern hemisphere. What to do: The Umhlanga Promenade leads to the Umhlanga Lagoon Reserve, a haven for bird-watchers. The luxurious Oyster Box hotel offers an indulgent high tea served with a view of the Indian Ocean. The hotel's Lighthouse bar does a decent line in sundowners. On the last Sunday of the month, the Wonder Market at Chris Saunders Park offers a range of artisan foods and designer crafts and jewelry. Where to stay: A short walk from Umhlanga beach, Teremok Marine is a five-star guesthouse set in a large, old family home. The nooks of this quiet hideaway are filled with South African decor, from bright Ardmore cushions to lampshades made from the pages of books and delicate proteas (South Africa's national flower) crafted from wood. 7. Wild Coast . Located between the Garden Route and Durban, the Wild Coast has rolling hills that drop into the sea and waterfalls that crash into lagoons. Cattle often wander the beaches, where few humans are to be seen. What to do: Spend a few days hiking along the beaches of the Wild Coast and you'll come across skeletons of ships, flocks of sea birds and low-tide rock pools waiting to be explored. You can take surf lessons from a former pro-am world champ at Coffee Bay, or go diving. Where to stay: Bulungula Lodge is a simple eco-friendly establishment, 40% of which is owned by the local village. If you're not spending time on the beautifully wild and remote beach, you can immerse yourself in village life. 8. Garden Route . Knysna is the Garden Route area's flagship town, known for oysters, beaches, lakes and forest. But if you travel ""up"" the Garden Route you'll get to the Tsitsikamma National Park, the less explored ""top tip"" of the route. Up here, beautiful indigenous forests scramble down steep mountains through ravines and rocky crags to a jagged coastline. What to do: The Otter Trail is a spectacular five-day hike that's so popular with South Africans you have to book almost a year in advance. It's a strenuous hike through untouched forests along a particularly rugged and isolated part of the coastline. Visitors can explore the coast from the water on a ""kayak and lilo adventure,"" paddling and floating their way through the sea, and then up the dramatic Storms River. Where to stay: Tranquility Lodge is a three-star guesthouse that's almost on the beach in Nature's Valley, a sleepy town surrounded by the Tsitsikama National Park. This is a good place to base if you want to spend time in the park, go bungee jumping, horseback riding, take boat cruises or visit a bird or elephant park. 9. Cape Town . One of the most beautiful cities in the world, Cape Town is flanked by the Indian and Atlantic oceans and watched over by iconic Table Mountain. Although the Mother City is incredibly popular with tourists, there are still a few secret places. What to do: Lion's Head mountain at full moon is a spectacular experience, especially if it involves a picnic. There are likely be a few hundred people up there, but the vibe (many people take their drums or guitars) and view across the city as the sun sets and the moon rises is something that will be remembered for a long time. The Summer Sunset Concerts are another favorite with Capetonians. Held in the spectacular Kirstenbosch Gardens each Sunday during summer, locals flock with their picnic baskets to listen to some of South Africa's top musicians. Where to stay: The Airstream Rooftop Trailer Park, on top of the Grand Daddy hotel in Long Street, is one of the quirkiest places to stay in the city. The trailers have been decorated by different artists -- themes include Dorothy, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and AfroPunk. 10. Northern Cape . Often just a big ""empty"" place on the map, the Northern Cape is a fascinating area through which to drive. Up here in the Kalahari and Karoo deserts, once home to the San people, towns with wonderful names such as Hotazel, Kakamas, Nababeep and Pofadder pepper the map and provide interesting stopovers in a vast, dry landscape dominated by big sky. What to do: Stargazing in Sutherland is an event unto itself. Often the coldest town in South Africa, Sutherland is known around the world for its clear night skies . The stargazing here is superb, which is why it's home to SALT, the Southern African Large Telescope. In early spring, in the town of Niewoudville, the Namaqualand daisies burst into bloom -- the ocher earth is transformed as millions of flowers paint the landscape orange, pink, yellow, purple and white. Where to stay: Kokeboom B&B on Gannabos Farm is much loved by photographers and hikers: nearby is the world's largest forest of quiver trees -- so called because bushmen use them to making hunting arrows.

"(CNN) -- When leaders get into trouble these days, they often complain that they have too little power to be effective. Yet as debate rages about the NFL's handling of player discipline, the problem for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is just the opposite: He seems to have too much power. While fans continue to flock to games, Goodell and league owners must know that the NFL and its gold-plated brand are in increasing trouble. A poll by the YouGov BrandIndex released this weekend shows that fan scores reflecting positive perceptions of the NFL have plummeted from a yearlong high of 36 to a low of -17. The 53-point decline happened over the four days last week when Goodell struggled to navigate the league through scathing headlines over its handling of evidence that Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice attacked his then-fiancee in an elevator. What Goodell and the team owners apparently fail to recognize is that the NFL is also a big, important business that should be run like a first-class company and is not. The NFL has a brand that is worth $9 billion in annual revenue; if it were an ordinary company, it would rank about 300th on the Fortune 500. Goodell's job is as complex as that of any CEO running a Fortune 500 company, but most of those companies don't handle their human resource issues the way the NFL does. Nearly every big company has to address vexing questions of how to treat employees who get into trouble by violating standards of decency or by violating the law. Outrageous assaults on women and children are not limited to pro football (though they occur there far too often). What CEOs do in those companies is to insist upfront on high standards of behavior -- but, importantly, they also set up credible, independent individuals or committees to investigate and to mete out punishment. Their intention is to keep the administration of corporate justice as fair and as consistent as possible, trying to protect the integrity of the company's reputation while also trying to avoid favoritism or cronyism in the way its employees are treated. CEOs purposely stay out of the middle of individual disputes. But the NFL has structured Goodell's job entirely differently. He has supreme, sweeping power over the organization, players and their behavior. He in effect is appointed the judge and the jury in individual cases, even as he keeps one eye over his shoulder at the owners. For some months now, he has been seen as too harsh, and now he is being seen as too lenient, especially in the way he has twisted and squirmed over the Rice case. Goodell and the owners should figure out how to restructure the commissioner's job -- or soon, he may lose it, and the league's brand will be even more tarnished. The league needs to take a step back and consider that. Not only to protect the credibility of the commissioner's office, but more important, to maintain the value of the NFL brand with fans. A good first step on the road to better practices would be to change some NFL rules, starting with the one that gives the commissioner latitude to react with widely varying responses to player domestic violence arrests and convictions. Compared with Rice, three players accused of domestic violence -- A.J. Jefferson, Dez Bryant and Rod Smith -- received very different treatment from the commissioner's office, ranging from a lifted four-game suspension to no suspension at all and a $25,000 fine. In all three cases, the players continued to play for NFL teams -- a very different outcome from what Rice is facing. Fans may now have a hard time believing any NFL commissioner can be reliably out in front of setting constructive league standards. Most $9 billion companies have an independent employee review and disciplinary system with oversight from departments separate from the CEO's office, like Human Resources, Legal or Compliance. GE, for example, outlines its system in its ""The Spirit & The Letter"" code of conduct: Assign a team of experts, conduct an investigation of all the facts, recommend corrective actions to the appropriate managers for implementation, and provide feedback to the person who raised the concern. That's it. The code is clear and does not call for the CEO to be involved in approving corrective actions. Not so in the NFL, it seems. The NFL Player Code is general on the question of process (""the League may initiate an investigation"") and does not identify who investigates and recommends corrective action. According to press reports, it's not clear who at the NFL was responsible for investigating the Rice affair. But decision-making power is clear and unilateral: ""(T)he Commissioner will have full authority to impose discipline as warranted."" The independent review and discipline group should also have the responsibility and expertise for talking to the press and fans. This would increase credibility with fans and help the league avoid the escalating, and destructive, tit-for-tat accusations we're witnessing right now. It could be a model for other sports leagues including the NBA, MLB and NHL. Over the past two decades, prevention has become the focus of employee conduct, health and wellness. Goodell controls, but has not deployed, the league resources that could help prevent criminal player behavior in the first place. While NFL player arrests peaked in the mid-2000s, most organizations would not sit back and accept that one in 40 of their employees is arrested each year -- mostly for DUI incidents. Corporate prevention programs also mitigate on-the-job injuries. One can only guess if as many players would have suffered, or if the NFL would have faced a $950 million payout to players earlier this year, if player training to avoid concussions had been sponsored by the league. Enshrined in the NFL Code of Conduct is a call to higher standards: ""While criminal activity is clearly outside the scope of permissible conduct, and persons who engage in criminal activity will be subject to discipline, the standard of conduct for persons employed in the NFL is considerably higher. It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime. Instead, as an employee of the NFL or a member club, you are held to a higher standard and expected to conduct yourself in a way that is responsible, promotes the values upon which the League is based, and is lawful."" Great organizations do create standards, partly by standing behind their brand and company values in all kinds of public ways. If he believes in holding the NFL to a higher standard, perhaps Goodell should be looking at starting the NFL Foundation to Prevent Domestic Violence. It would not only be a smart move to leverage a fan base that includes 55% men and 45% women, but a tangible example of the higher level of conduct the league aspires to. The NFL owns a treasured brand, beloved by many Americans, that is the gold standard for world-class sports entertainment. For Goodell, the time has clearly come to use big-league management practices to run the show.","Ray Rice case and others raise questions about NFL player discipline .

"(CNN) -- There are things one has come to expect in New York -- cold winters, sweltering summers, and walking fast through throngs of tourists. Now composting? As you may have heard, San Francisco set a goal to achieve zero waste by 2020; that means sending nothing to the landfill. Thanks to the efforts of our businesses, residents, commuters, schools, city agencies and tourists, our city diverts 80% of all waste from landfill disposal through source reduction, reuse, and recycling and composting programs. New York's announcement to require residents to separate food scraps for collection to be composted by 2016 is a laudable and achievable goal. Since the implementation of San Francisco's mandatory recycling and composting ordinance, composting collection has increased by more than 50% within three years. We went from collecting 400 tons daily to more than 600 tons daily. A thriving composting and recycling effort in San Francisco has not only been good for the environment, but also good for the economy. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, recycling creates nearly five times as many jobs as sending material to a landfill. A study from the Blue Green Alliance also states that if we increased our recycling rate to 75%, 2.3 million jobs would be created nationwide. Decreasing the amount of refuse the city is sending to the landfill is also helping San Francisco reduce our carbon footprint. Waste sent to a landfill produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is up to 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. That's why Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision to begin a composting program this year in New York is music to the ears of those of us in the zero waste movement. Composting has been key to increasing our diversion rate. As New York and other cities roll out their composting collection efforts, there are some lessons learned from the road to zero waste in San Francisco to share. Set a goal: By creating a goal, such as doubling your composting rate, city leaders are able to communicate a vision of success. Our own San Francisco Giants have embraced a zero waste goal, and diverted more than 80% of stadium discards from the landfill in last fall's playoff games. Celebrate your incremental successes toward that goal to build momentum. Make composting simple: Conduct outreach to your businesses and residents to determine the steps needed to make composting easy. We found out that providing residents with free kitchen composting pails as well as providing commercial recycling and composting training were two easy ways to get the community engaged and participating. Teach the next generation: Educating young San Franciscans about what goes in the green composting bin has helped not only increase the composting rates in our schools, zero waste education has helped raise awareness about protecting nature and understanding the source of food. Success does not happen overnight. Behavior change is hard business. In San Francisco, when recycling and composting was mandated, we experienced some initial resistance because of the ""ick"" factor: the idea that composting could be foul smelling and belongs on a farm, not in a city. Overcoming these misconceptions is as easy as reminding people that compostables have been in your kitchen trash can all along. Now, you are separating out your coffee grounds, food scraps, soiled paper and dead flowers and putting them toward a good cause. In San Francisco our good cause is wine and fresh produce. San Francisco has collected more than a million tons of food scraps, yard trimmings, and other compostable materials and turned it into nutrient rich compost that is in demand by local farmers and wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties. Can New York compost? Without a doubt. By setting up an easy to use system, investing in teaching New Yorkers what goes in the compost bin and celebrating incremental successes, New York will be well on its way to making composting second nature, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melanie Nutter.","Mayor Bloomberg in New York wants people to compost. Is that even possible?

"Gleneagles, Scotland (CNN) -- ""That match is the main event in the first round. You know that and I know that."" Tom Watson is rarely wrong, and those words in his final press briefing on the eve of the 40th Ryder Cup proved the U.S. captain remains a shrewd judge. He was referring to a clash involving Rory McIlroy, for whom center stage was clear thanks to a stellar season that helped him double his major tally to four, and the enforced absence of Tiger Woods. But despite cruising into the biennial battle between Europe and the U.S. in supreme form, the world's premier golfer met his match in a wily campaigner who is still in great shape on the course and razor sharp off it. And after a titanic tussle that went right to the final blow after a full five hours on the course at Gleneagles, it wasn't McIlroy who was smiling. By describing Phil Mickelson's career as ""being in the back nine,"" the Northern Irishman clearly stirred something in the 44-year-old, who felt the need to respond with a close range jab of his own. Answering a question about togetherness in the U.S. camp, 'Lefty' referenced an ongoing court battle between McIlroy and his former management company, which counts his Ryder Cup teammate Graeme McDowell as both client and shareholder. It added an extra layer of spice to their face off in Friday morning's fourballs, the two ably flanked by the other half of their current bromances -- Spain's Sergio Garcia and 2011 U.S. PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley. As both groups made their way onto the first tee to a cacophony of noise, it was McIlroy and Garcia that drank in the warmth of not just an early Scottish sun, but also a vociferous crowd. ""You've got Big Mac, we've got little Mac,"" sang a jubilant crowd, gathered in their thousands, in between energetic chants of 'Europe, Europe.' "" McIlroy, playing in only his third Ryder Cup, had spoken of embracing his role as the continent's on-course talisman, reflecting his emerging status in the pantheon of golfing superstars. His 2014 campaign came to life almost the minute he'd announced his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki was off. That same May week, he won the European Tour's flagship event — the BMW PGA Championship. That kickstarted a resurgence in form as he collected the Open Championship crown — his first — the Bridgestone Invitational, then the final major of the year, the U.S. PGA Championship. After whacking his tee shot over 300 yards down the first fairway, the ball almost carrying even further by the roars that chased it, McIlroy matched Bradley's birdie to get the match off to a rapid start. And when Garcia holed an unlikely bunker shot on the fourth hole to help Europe take a one-shot lead, the pair that had lobbied European captain Paul McGinley so hard to be matched together offered the enormous galleries an inevitable fist pump. Read more: More than just a game . McIlroy, paired with McDowell in all but one of his group matches in the previous two Ryder Cup contests, had grown even closer to Garcia as the two went head-to-head for major honors during the PGA Tour's summer months. They were clearly at ease as they traversed the swales and hollows of the centenary course at Gleneagles, helping read each other's putts, fist-bumping good shots, and consoling each other after poor ones. ""Look how far he's hit the ball,"" remarked one spectator to his friend as McIlroy thrashed a driver off the seventh. ""I doubt I'd reach that in three."" But their momentum petered out around the turn, as the other brothers in arms wrested back the initiative. Mickelson and Bradley won all three of their pairs matches at the 2012 Ryder Cup and for good reason. A full 16 years may separate the two but they dovetail neatly, cajoling and carousing in equal measure. After Bradley leveled matters with a birdie on seven, Mickelson edged them ahead on the gargantuan ninth — weighing in at 618 yards — after a fine bunker shot went close. When Bradley holed his birdie putt on 10, it was the American pair with a pep in their step, Garcia and McIlroy trudging behind, buried in conversation. ""Come on Europe, believe!"" urged one fan bedecked in a Union Jack flag, and that belief grew when the pair were gifted a hole on 11, winning it in par -- the ultimate no-no in fourball competition. McIlroy had been quiet, but now he came to life. Two birdies in three holes, set up by accurate, powerful driving off the tee, swung the seesaw towards the blue corner once again. But Bradley found the green on 16 in two well-struck hits and drained an eagle putt to level the contest, now stretching towards its fifth hour as a blustery wind whipped round the Ochil Hills. All flat up the 18th, the final fourball match on the course now commanded a gallery that had swelled to maybe 10,000 or more -- spectators clad in an assortment of colors scrambling up banks and standing on tiptoes in the hope of a clear sight of the stars. And while the quality of golf on the last was average by the group's high standards, bunkers and rough fully embraced, that only added to the intrigue. Chances came and went, leaving the stage clear for Mickleson to tap home, silence the majority of the crowd and maintain his unbeaten record in the company of Bradley. McIlroy removed his cap, shook hands with his victors, and trudged off the side of the green. There was barely time to throw a few platitudes towards the press and wolf down some lunch, before the world No. 1 was teeing it up again in the foursomes, Garcia once more at his side.

"(CNN) -- In ""Happily Divorced"" Fran Drescher plays Fran, a Los Angeles florist who is learning to navigate the dating scene after her husband (named Peter) announces he is gay after nearly 20 years of marriage. In real life, Fran was married to her high school sweetheart, Peter Jacobson, for just over two decades and after they split he told her he was gay. The show starts its second season Wednesday on TV Land and CNN caught up with the Flushing, Queens, native while she was in New York busily promoting the show. The 54-year-old actress may have a strong New Yawk accent and an, um, unique bray, but in reality she isn't anything like the TV Fran. In person she is thoughtful and articulate, a New York Times best-selling author and the visionary behind the Cancer Schmancer Movement. She also has been instrumental in getting laws passed regarding women's health. Drescher talked to CNN about moving on after her divorce, her dating status and how much some folks are willing to pay for her laugh. CNN: So, new season of ""Happily Divorced.""a . Fran Drescher: We're going to go deeper into Fran being a single, middle-aged woman and what that's about, how difficult it may be, trying to make peace with the chapters in her life she may have missed and we'll meet Peter's brother and we're going to expose a part of my body in the premiere episode which has never been seen before. CNN: Which is...? Drescher: Well, should I tell you? (Laughs) It's a little risquÃ©. CNN: Are you using real life experiences for the second season? Drescher: Always, I'm the one that kind of runs the story writing room and the scripts all have origins in real emotions or actual experiences and then we kind of build a sitcom story around it. So yes everything is formed by a base of truthfulness. CNN: You were with your ex for a long time. Drescher: We met when we were 15, we married when we were 21 and divorced when we were around 41, so yes we were together for a long time. CNN: Peter came out to you after you had divorced. Drescher: Yes and he didn't want the divorce. He was very opposed to it and was very mad at me but when he was told I had been diagnosed with cancer, one of the silver linings was that he let go of his anger and we started to rebuild our friendship. CNN: Did you have any idea he was gay during the marriage? Drescher: He was going to therapy and told me he had discovered he was bisexual but had never acted on it. He told me he wanted to be with me, he loved our life and he loved me. I just kept on going forward with him but it was a couple of years after that (confession) I began to feel suffocated in the relationship and I felt like I couldn't find who I was or what I really wanted with him. I needed to be on my own to hear myself think. CNN: So he was very controlling. Drescher: Yes, and in hindsight I think that he realized that was a manifestation of him suppressing his true orientation. CNN: How is your relationship now? Drescher: We're the best of friends. We're in a wonderful place. We're business partners, we're very close friends and you know we believe we're soul mates. Let's hope that you get more than one soul mate in life. CNN: Are you dating anyone now? Drescher: I'm not currently. It's been a couple of months since I broke up with somebody after 3Â½ years together and now I'm back in the meat market. I don't date while I'm working on the show because it keeps me awfully busy, but I do rely on setups and blind dates as a means for meeting people. I certainly can't go on Internet dating sites, so it makes it a little more difficult, coupled with the fact that I'm a celebrity. I wield power and have money, so my success can be threatening to a lot of men. CNN: That must be hard. Drescher: It is a handicap. I have learned the hard way that I need to now date really exclusively men that are more successful than myself. CNN: That's a small market. Drescher: I guess it helps narrow the pool. I don't do married men, I don't do gay men and I need a man who's successful in his own right. CNN: You also have a children's book called ""Being Wendy."" Drescher: It's about a little girl who lives in a very provincial town called Boxville and everybody in Boxville thinks inside of the box and she just can't do it. Her interests are too diverse. At first she's ostracized for being that but in the end her parents realize her specialness is unique and should be celebrated. CNN: Is that how you felt as a kid? Drescher: I think so. I was an over-achiever and ambitious and had big dreams and I grew up in a place where mostly everybody was really not thinking beyond the town we grew up in. I wanted to travel the world and be a journalist and actress and writer and politician and kinds of things. CNN: Your laugh is really one of a kind. Drescher: I know! Sometimes we sell my voice at charity auctions to be somebody's answering message. I think the highest bid was around 15 or 20 thousand dollars. CNN: Isn't that amazing? Drescher: I was told a lot when I was pursuing acting in high school that I couldn't make it with that voice and the first time I met Peter, I said, 'Hiii,' and he thought I was joking but in the end we figured out a way to monetize it and poke fun at it first so other people would feel comfortable laughing along with me.","""Happily Divorced"" starts its second season Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. ET on TV Land .

"(CNN) -- Modern U.S. presidents seem to be in need of neat, catchy labels for the enemy they want to destroy. ""Network of death"" is the latest one. After U.S. President Barack Obama's speech at the United Nations, we now know that it is this network that needs ""dismantling."" Whether or not this new label will help increase the number of countries willing to join the U.S. in the fight against ISIS remains to be seen. Old, trusted allies will doubtless follow. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron has already vowed that his country will ""play its part."" All Cameron needs is parliamentary approval, which is expected Friday -- and maybe his own new label for ISIS. But how will the ""network"" react? How will it strike back? It is of course difficult to see how ISIS could successfully resist U.S. air power in the long run. Yet this conflict is first and foremost a political confrontation. The many wars in the Middle East since 9/11 have shown that messages matter. And in this regard the ISIS ""network"" is bound to continue to do just fine. This is not so much because ISIS and its supporters have created media arms like those radical Islamic groups al-Furqan or al-Hayat. Nor has it much to do with the ability to spread their videos by using Twitter-bots or multiple YouTube accounts, clever hashtags, mobile phone apps or more obscure social media sites to evade counter-measures by police and security agencies. It has all to do with the message itself. If it resonates, it will spread. Goaded into action? ISIS has already portrayed the mere fact that Obama has decided to use military force as a success. Groups like ISIS crave recognition. Acknowledging them as a major threat -- and taking counter-measures -- does just that. It guarantees extensive coverage in traditional media. ISIS' first reaction after the start of the bombardments was to point out that Obama, like George Bush before him, was drawn into a conflict that he could not win. ISIS got what it wanted -- a direct confrontation with the US and an opportunity to link Obama to the widely discredited military strategy of his successor. Provoking and unsettling is a major part of ISIS media strategy. The group knows Western audiences as well as local and regional ones. Hostages are shown in the familiar Guantanamo-style orange jump suits: ""What you did to us, we can do to you,"" is the simple message. Not new, but tried, tested and successful, particularly with local audiences. Recruiting Western Muslims . Most unsettling to Western audiences is that disaffected Muslims from their own nations are drawn to join the conflict. It is hardly necessary for the ISIS leadership to threaten retaliation in Western countries. A few more posts, pictures or videos featuring ISIS fighters with French, British or German voices are sufficient to scare Western politicians and their respective electorates. They might even provoke counter-measures like stricter border controls, passport restrictions and increased surveillance. They might also lead to new types of profiling, which may well backfire and encourage yet more young men to travel to Syria to take up the fight for the self-proclaimed Islamic State, as ISIS has proclaimed itself to be. Western counter-messages and social media offences will hardly prevent this. So in essence, it is as simple as to keep doing what ISIS media people are already doing. Merely resisting U.S. military pressure as long as possible will strengthen ISIS's message. As will the potentially devastating consequences of U.S., French or British bombing raids on civilian populations. Adding variety . Adding a few videos of successful ISIS attacks or evidence of dogged resistance will also help. Hostage videos alone will lose their impact over time, however gruesome they are. A little variation is needed. The new ""lecture series"" of British hostage John Cantlie shows that ISIS is aware of that. Whether Obama's ""network of death"" is the appropriate phrase or not, it is certainly true that ISIS and affiliates form a network. But even if ISIS were to become seriously ""degraded,"" it is difficult to believe that the whole network can be dismantled. At the heart of the current turmoil in the Middle East is a civil war within Islam. Being regarded as the one force that stands up to U.S. and Western military power is bound to boost ISIS's reputation in this struggle. The media prominence ISIS has achieved is also bound to encourage other groups to embark on similar ""media work."" The ""network of death"" is in an excellent position to continue to create ISIS-style media messages. The video of the beheading of French mountain guide Herve Gourdel, posted by the Algerian ISIS affiliate on Wednesday, is only the most recent example.","ISIS has goaded U.S. President Barack Obama into reacting, writes Peter Busch .

"(CNN) -- Fifteen-year-old Audrie Pott got drunk at a party and passed out. What happened next, according to her family, was that she was sexually assaulted by multiple young men, who took photos and circulated them in their high school of more than 1,000 students. Not long afterward, Audrie, devastated and hopeless, committed suicide. In Canada, Rehtaeh Parsons, then 15, was sexually assaulted by multiple perpetrators, according to her family, and photographs were also posted online for the world to see. She was tormented and bullied for more than a year with no legal action taken by the authorities, who stated there was ""insufficient evidence"" to file charges. Rehtaeh also committed suicide. Why did these tragedies happen? The rate of sexual assaults is alarmingly high among adolescents. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Justice finds that 30% to 35% of female sexual assault survivors were first raped between the ages of 11 to 17. Many of these assaults occur when victims are under the influence of alcohol, and a surprising number of adolescent rapes involve multiple perpetrators. A recent study found that 12.4% of sexual assaults committed against 13- to 17-year-old teens were gang rapes. When evidence goes viral . Rape is a crime of power and dominance, and social media provide new ways of asserting that power to hurt victims over and over again. Gang rape takes on a whole new meaning when images and slurs are posted and forwarded and spread endlessly. Adolescent sexual assaults are particularly likely to go viral (more so than instances of adult rape) because of the ""everyone knows everything about everyone"" culture of middle and high school. The ubiquity of cell phones with cameras and the power of the Internet make for faster, farther-reaching gossip, name-calling, character assassination and ultimately despair for the victim. What was once a horrible incident that the victim remembers and suffers in private agony has now become an all-you-can-watch public humiliation event. There's ample evidence that bullying has grown widespread, but the crime of rape has always been around. We live in a culture in which victims are blamed for the assault and made to feel like they are the ones who are criminal and dirty and shameful. Many rape victims are afraid to report the assault to police because they believe the criminal system will not help them. And they're right. A recent National Institute of Justice study found that among adolescent sexual assault victims who did the brave the system -- they filed a police report, they met with investigators, they endured a medical forensic exam and rape kit -- 60% of these cases were not prosecuted by the criminal justice system. These rates are even worse for adult victims: On average, 86% of sexual assaults that are reported to the police are never passed along to prosecutors even to be considered for prosecution. That's 86% that go nowhere. The cases weren't forwarded to prosecutors because police said there was ""insufficient evidence,"" or because they thought the victim was ""making a false report,"" or because the victim ""wasn't credible"" -- despite the fact that all of these victims had a sexual assault medical forensic exam and forensic evidence collection kit (""rape kit""). These cases were closed with either no investigation at all, or minimal investigational effort. A recent report from Human Rights Watch suggests this is an alarmingly common practice. When the criminal justice system doesn't listen, doesn't investigate, doesn't seem to care, it sends the message to rapists: You will not be held accountable for your crimes. Perhaps it is not surprising that several studies have found most rapists are serial rapists. To victims, this inaction sends the message: Your suffering is not our concern. You don't matter. Rehtaeh's case went nowhere. Only now, after her death, will it be reopened. How can this be changed? One, reform the criminal justice system. Train legal personnel on best practices for the investigation and prosecution of these crimes. Challenge law enforcement agencies to start by believing and to investigate, not shelve, these crimes. Demand that police see these images on social media for what they are: not pornographic exploits but evidence of a crime. Two, we must get survivors to the services that can help them. The despair that victims experience can all too quickly consume them and destroy their lives. The federal Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act provide funding to all states and territories for rape crisis hotlines, crisis counseling and victim advocacy programs. These services are provided free of charge. Friends, family, teachers, everyone can help let survivors know that help is available. And finally, we have to do more to prevent cyberbullying. The important truth not to lose sight of is that most teens do not commit sexual assaults and most do not bully. We need to support and empower these youth to speak out and intervene with their peers. The CDC has resources for schools and communities to develop ""bystander prevention programs,"" which teach effective strategies youth can use to prevent violence among their peers. Widespread adoption of these programs is critical. For girls such as Audrie Potts, Rehtaeh Parsons and many untold others, their agony had become too much, and the only solution they saw was suicide. We will never again hear their words, their stories, their voices. But our voices can still be heard, and we must demand solutions to this seemingly intractable problem. We owe all victims justice and compassion.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- When studying up for a trip to the Holy Land, you might come across this warning: Whatever you do, don't take a bear to the beach. Feeding pigeons is illegal in Venice, Italy, and could earn you a fine. Americans expect to experience some difference in laws when they travel the world, but some laws we found just sounded insane. In France, it's illegal to name a pig Napoleon. In Florida, single women can't parachute on Sundays. And in England, you may urinate anywhere in public, including inside a policeman's helmet, providing that you're also pregnant. Granted, most of us can rest easy on the plane ride to our destinations knowing that we won't run afoul of such rules. Plus, many reported laws are just urban legends, and in other cases, anomalies on the books that no one has the time or interest to enforce. (""People here don't keep bears!"" an exasperated Israeli spokeswoman told us. ""Why would they take one to the beach?"") But other laws -- such as keeping your headlights on at all times while driving in Denmark -- are in equal parts surprising and real. Get caught, and the resulting fine could run about $100 (and the entire EU may adopt the law). See a Travel + Leisure slideshow of the world's strangest laws . While some laws seem ridiculous at first blush, they often carry their own logic. Pigeon-feeding is not tolerated (and fine-worthy) in Venice, because the winged troublemakers -- and really, their droppings -- wreak havoc on the city's old, vulnerable buildings. Singapore is infamous for its tough laws against chewing gum and graffiti (remember the 18-year-old American who got caned in the 1990s?). In the Singaporeans' defense, the gum laws -- which have relaxed a bit -- were originally enacted to fight what authorities saw as rampant gum-wad littering. Even so, don't even think about leaving a public toilet un-flushed. It could cost you $100. What should you do if you do break a law, crazy or otherwise, while on vacation? Dick Atkins is a Philadelphia attorney who operates an international legal hotline, helping American travelers who have run afoul of the law in other countries. ""It's always best to try to get an attorney involved,"" he says. Ignoring the issue could result in problems if you make a return visit to that country. Atkins says he commonly deals with college kids who have taken too many liberties with other countries' lower drinking ages, or unsuspecting tourists who get arrested for trying to take home souvenirs (such as old rugs) that end up being antiquities. He says such problems raise the argument for buying travel insurance, or even buying travel assistance packages, which can offer legal help abroad. (To price varying packages, check out US Travel Insurance Association.) Of course, most Americans don't bother with travel insurance. In that case, you can contact the American embassy or consulate for a list of local attorneys. Or you can handle the problem on your own. Robert Siciliano recently stayed at a Mexican resort, and when he and his family rented a car, they were almost immediately stopped by police and accused of swerving dangerously on the road. (Siciliano says he was merely driving around fallen palm braches and coconuts following the previous day's Category 2 hurricane.) ""They started to arrest me because they said all tickets were to be paid at the police station,"" Siciliano says. But when he asked if he could pay the ticket on the spot, the cops agreed. Siciliano handed them a $100 bill and they let him go. He immediately returned the car. ""Total rental car time, 20 minutes. Cost, $155,"" he said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Nine months after his detention by Chinese authorities, a prominent Uyghur scholar charged with ""separatism"" went on trial Wednesday amid tight security, his lawyer said. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to his native Xinjiang, China's restive northwestern region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on Muslim Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. Liu Xiaoyuan, one of Tohti's lawyers, told CNN earlier this week that he expected the trial to be short at the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and a verdict and sentencing would likely be announced at a later date. Liu later tweeted that the hearing would last two days and the government allowed four family members -- including Tohti's wife -- to be present. The authorities cordoned off the street in front of the court Wednesday morning, and the area was teeming with uniformed and plainclothes police, the lawyer said online before the trial began. Although the government charged Tohti only in late July, Xinjiang police said in a statement in January that they had gathered firm evidence of him colluding with overseas forces to ""spread separatist ideas, incite ethnic hatred and advocate Xinjiang independence."" The police statement also said Tohti had taught students about ""violent Uyghur resistance"" in his class and encouraged them to overthrow the Chinese government. Advocate for understanding . Tohti's lawyers have said that the scholar emphasized his innocence throughout his detention. ""He reiterated that he has advocated to improve the rule of law, democracy and ethnic harmony in Xinjiang,"" Li Fangping, Tohti's other lawyer, told CNN earlier. ""Tohti has consistently, courageously and unambiguously advocated peacefully for greater understanding and dialogue between various communities, and with the state,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director of the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch, in a statement. ""If this is Beijing's definition of 'separatist' activities, it's hard to see tensions in Xinjiang... decreasing."" Li, the lawyer, also complained about the treatment of Tohti in jail, saying he was put in shackles again recently after receiving the same treatment for three weeks upon arrival. ""He went on a hunger strike for some 10 days in January after they refused to provide him with Muslim food,"" Li said. ""They also denied him food for about 10 days in March after the Kunming incident,"" he added, referring to the stabbings at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming that left 29 people dead. Uyghur separatists were blamed for the attack. CNN's phone calls to the Xinjiang government for comment went unanswered. 'Waves of Han' Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and education, as well as curtailed religious freedom. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. In late July, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported that a gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians, a police station, government offices and smashed vehicles in southern Xinjiang, killing 37 people. The government called the incident an ""organized and premeditated"" terrorist attack and said police at the scene shot dead 59 people in the mob and arrested more than 200, according to Xinhua. In the region's deadliest single violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing in May killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang. Last week, four people were convicted of plotting the knife attack at the Kunming Railway Station. Three were sentenced to death and the fourth to life imprisonment. In June, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months. Also in June, a court in Urumqi sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October. Defendant names revealed by state media all sounded Uyghur. ""The long-term solution to Xinjiang's unrest is not further repression, but greater understanding of the Uyghurs' grievances and perspectives,"" said Richardson of Human Rights Watch. ""If Tohti -- a peaceful, articulate critic -- is given a harsh sentence, what confidence can any Uyghur have that their very real grievances will ever get a hearing with Chinese authorities?""","Ilham Tohtia, a prominent Uyghur scholar, was charged with ""separatism""

"(CNN) -- The Endreson family lottery pool -- a tradition born out of their mother's long-term dreams -- finally paid off when the 17 siblings won a $20 million jackpot, New Jersey lottery officials said Thursday. The siblings, ranging in age from 53 to 76, began playing the lottery decades ago because of their mother's dream of buying bungalows at the Jersey Shore, where most of the family lives. After the hopeful matriarch, Flossie Endreson, passed away in 2004, the siblings chipped in to pay for funeral expenses and realized they had set aside too much. Instead of taking the remaining money back, the siblings started a new lottery pool in their mother's honor, said family spokeswoman Marie McHenry. ""We're a family of working people,"" McHenry said, ""We just go to work every day like everyone else."" The Endresons' good fortune comes after their share of hardships. Four family members lost their homes during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and one sibling lost his life shortly after the storm. The jackpot winnings ""couldn't have come at a better time,"" McHenry said. The siblings' father emigrated from Norway in the early 20th century, later meeting their mother on the Jersey Shore, where the family remained and settled in Ocean County, McHenry said. The pair had 19 children, according to N.J. lottery. One child died at birth. When asked what their mother would say about winning the lottery, one sibling shouted: ""Hallelujah!"" The total jackpot was $20.1 million with the family opting to take a lump sum payment of $14 million, about $10 million after taxes, according to the New Jersey lottery. Family members would not comment on how they plan to divide the winnings, but said they would share it with the three children of their recently deceased brother. John Endreson, one of the siblings who lost his home during Superstorm Sandy, broke down during the press conference as he talked about the devastation of the storm. The storm ""depleted my savings and now things are looking pretty good. Thanks to the state of New Jersey and my mom. Thank you all,"" he said. Rich man, I am: Yoda fan wins $425M Powerball prize .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles has converted his 38-year-old Aston Martin to run on biofuel made from surplus wine, his office revealed Tuesday. Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on a visit to a whiskey distillery in Northern Ireland last month. The car was a 21st birthday present from Queen Elizabeth, and the prince has converted it to run on 100 percent bioethanol as a way to reduce his carbon emissions, his office, Clarence House, said. The prince has also converted his other cars -- several Jaguars, an Audi and a Range Rover -- to run on 100 percent biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil, his office added. Details of the prince's biofuel use were made public Monday in his household's 2008 Annual Review, which details the prince's income and activities over the past year. The report says Charles and his household reduced their carbon footprint by 18 percent last year after switching to green electricity supplies and reducing their travel-related emissions. Charles, 59, has a strong interest in environmental issues and rural affairs. He is active in environmental charities, and his food company, Duchy Originals, uses ingredients produced at his organic farm in Cornwall, southwestern England. The biofuels are converted and provided by Green Fuels Limited, a British company that previously provided biodiesel to power the royal train, Clarence House said. The wine used for the bioethanol comes from current vintage that remains after English wine producers reach the EU limit for annual wine production, a spokesman for Green Fuels said. The prince uses wine from a vineyard close to his Highgrove Estate, the spokesman said.","Prince Charles' office reveals his car runs on biofuel made from surplus wine .

"(CNN) -- The events on Beijing's Tiananmen Square that resulted in the death of five people and the injury of dozens more were tragic, but are they representative of a serious terrorist threat to the Chinese state as is now being suggested by official sources? According to Chinese security organs, this act of driving a jeep into a crowd of people and setting it on fire was a ""carefully planned, organized, and premeditated"" terrorist attack carried out by a group of Uyghur Islamic extremists from Xinjiang Province. Unfortunately, given the lack of transparency historically in the Chinese state's conviction of Uyghurs on charges of political violence, we may never know whether this characterization of Monday's events is accurate. What we do know is that Chinese security organs claim that the attackers in the truck, all of whom died, were a Uyghur man, his wife, and his mother. Additionally, Chinese state sources claim to have arrested an additional five suspects in connection with the alleged plot. Were these alleged attackers members of a cell belonging to a large transnational Jihadist network like Al-Qaeda? Are they representatives of a well-organized militant movement like Al-Shabaab, which recently led an armed hostage-taking operation at a mall in Kenya? Looking at the crude instruments allegedly used by these people -- gasoline, knives, iron rods, and an SUV, it is difficult to argue that this was the work of any highly organized and well-armed militant group or terrorist network. There were no sophisticated explosives used in the attacks, and the alleged attackers did not even possess guns. Furthermore, although Uyghurs are Muslims, there is no evidence that they have ever been involved substantively in a global Muslim militant movement. So, how do we understand this act of violence if it was indeed carried out by a family of Uyghurs? The obvious answer is to look at what is happening in the Xinjiang itself where such violent acts have been occurring with increasing frequency ever since the ethnic violence between Uyghurs and Han Chinese that spread throughout the regional capitol of Urumqi during the summer of 2009. Life for Uyghurs inside Xinjiang is not like that of most people in the People's Republic of China (PRC). For the last decade, the Chinese government has created a virtual police state within Xinjiang, employing enhanced surveillance of Uyghur citizens, actively repressing Uyghurs' political voices, and greatly curtailing Uyghur religious practices. It has also vastly reduced Uyghurs' access to education in their own language and has limited Uyghur language publications of original reading materials. Officially, the Chinese state explains most of these measures as part of its anti-terrorism measures to protect national security. These measures also regularly include arresting large numbers of Uyghurs on charges of engaging in ""illegal religious activity"" or of having ties to terrorist organizations. In fact, during this month alone, security organs in Xinjiang were involved in the fatal shooting of suspected Uyghur militants on several separate occasions and arrested at least one hundred more they suspected of trying to flee the country. Although the government characterizes its ongoing and expansive confrontation with Uyghurs in Xinjiang as anti-terrorism, it is equally related to the PRC's larger plans for Xinjiang. The region is of critical strategic importance to the state as it is China's primary gateway to the west, both in accessing western markets for Chinese goods and in securing natural resources, such as oil, gas, and uranium from Central Asia and locations further west and south. In this context, the PRC is presently funding enormous development projects in Xinjiang that are also bringing a large influx of Han Chinese migrants and are uprooting Uyghur communities and displacing them from traditional lands. The state may not care to rid Xinjiang of Uyghurs, but it would like the Uyghurs living there to willingly yield their perceived homeland to a Han-dominant state culture. As a result, the future of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region appears destined to be neither Uyghur nor autonomous. With these events unfolding in the region that Uyghurs view as their historical homeland, one feels compelled to question whether Monday's alleged attack was a well-prepared terrorist act or a hastily assembled cry of desperation from a people on the extreme margins of the Chinese state's monstrous development machine. However, given that this is allegedly the first instance that Uyghurs have carried out such desperate acts outside Xinjiang, and in this case in the very symbolic seat of central power, we may also be witnessing a sharp escalation in the Chinese state's confrontation with the Uyghurs. In the midst of this escalation, it is also possible that the PRC's long-maintained, but largely unsubstantiated, claims of a Uyghur terrorist threat are perhaps becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sean R. Roberts .","Chinese government has created a virtual police state within Xinjiang .
Crude instruments used in attack suggest not work of well-organized group .
No evidence Uyghurs involved substantively in a global Muslim militant movement.

"(CNN) Jakarta, Indonesia -- Four people are missing and feared dead after a volcano eruption in Indonesia, according to a National Disaster Mitigation Agency official. Mount Karangetang, on Siau Island, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, according to The Jakarta Globe. In Friday's eruption, about five people were injured, one seriously, said the disaster official, Priyadi Kardono. Sixteen families, about 65 people, were evacuated from their villages to safer ground. At least one house was buried and several other buildings, including a church, were damaged, Kardono said. Rescue and aid teams have been sent to the area. A bridge was also damaged, isolating about six villages with about 20,000 residents. Communication lines are down. Kardono told CNN he doesnt expect the number of deaths or injuries to rise. The villages that are cut off are farther away from the volcano's crater. Volcanologists didn't issue a warning about the eruption, he said, because there were no indications of increased volcanic activity on Mount Karangetang. The eruption wasn't a large one and he said he had received reports that the flow of volcanic debris has decreased.

"(CNN) -- While there's been no shortage of snow this winter, the barrage of winter storms has left many U.S. cities short of one thing: salt. In New Jersey, record amounts of snowfall have left mayors scrambling for more salt to sprinkle on their roads and sidewalks for safety. The salt situation in West New York has been ""very critical,"" Mayor Felix Roque said. In a typical winter, the town's salt silos would normally be at least three-quarters full at this time of the year, he said. Now, they are virtually empty. They've had to mix the small amounts of salt they have left with sand to try stretch resources, Roque said. Mayor Steven Fulop of Jersey City, the second-largest city in New Jersey, said its salt shortage also has been difficult. A delivery of salt arrived in Jersey City on Monday -- an order placed two and a half weeks ago. Normally, salt arrives only two or three days after an order is placed. And the shipment is less than what the city will need, he said. Instead of badly needed salt, the city has been ""using pretty much anything and everything we can get our hands on,"" including sand and liquid brine, Fulop said. But the New Jersey Department of Transportation says it has enough salt for ""several storms,"" noting that its commissioner, James Simpson, has been working tirelessly to acquire more resources. ""In addition to getting salt from our normal channels, the commissioner has reached out to other companies and agencies for salt that we can obtain independently from our normal suppliers,"" said Joseph Dee, a spokesman for the department. Daring motorists urged to smarten up before taking on bad weather . Rules torpedo salt shipment . While coordinating with one of its main salt suppliers, Dee said, the New Jersey DOT learned of a 40,000-ton pile of salt in Maine that had not been spoken for. Its supplier said, ""If you can get a ship to take it, it's yours,"" Dee said. According to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, all commercial goods transported between ports in U.S. waters must be carried on U.S.-flagged ships, but the New Jersey DOT didn't have a U.S.-flagged barge large enough to carry all of the salt in one trip. A waiver of the Jones Act would have to come from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A Department of Homeland Security official said Tuesday that no decision has been made on waiving the requirements of the Jones Act. Dee said his department was seeking a waiver so a larger ship without a U.S. flag could make the delivery, but he got ""indications that the waiver was not going to be successful."" CNN first learned of the 40,000-ton salt supply via Twitter. The New Jersey DOT sent a smaller U.S.-flagged barge Monday night to bring about 9,500 tons of salt to New Jersey and expects it to arrive by Friday or Saturday, Dee said. The barge will have to make multiple trips to carry all of the salt, possibly taking several weeks. Dee did not know if more ships would become available to help transport the salt. Still, Dee says, New Jersey is well-equipped to handle any winter weather. ""Clearly we want the salt, we'd like it as quickly as possible, but we have enough salt on hand,"" he said. Some cities are close to their snowiest winter in history . Shortages in other areas . New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this month that the long, snowy winter had left New York City and Long Island with salt shortages as well, prompting the state Department of Transportation to move 3,500 tons of road salt to those areas from state stockpiles, according to a statement. The state is also mixing sand with salt to stretch resources, a Cuomo spokesman said. Boston has gone beyond U.S. borders in its quest for more salt, receiving shipments from as far away as Mexico, according to a tweet from CNN affiliate WBZ. The scramble for salt has led many in other states to turn to alternatives to keep roads safe, with some methods of snow and ice removal proving to be cheaper than traditional salt. In Polk County, Wisconsin, cheese brine from factories is used for snow and ice control, said Michael Sproul, program manager at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. ""Cheese brine is not an alternative to salt, it's just a cheaper version,"" he said, adding that it's mixed with salt to conserve supplies. ""In Wisconsin, it's a waste product. For us, it can be used on the roads. Someone can give it to us. We ask them to filter and deliver it, and we use it. ... We're doing them a favor. It's just another material that we can use with salt to treat the snow and ice that's supposed to be close to free."" The brine is effective because it works at a lower temperature than normal salt, said Emil Norby, technical support manager at the Polk County Highway Department. In 2011, Bergen County, New Jersey, officials used a mixture of salt and water that resembles pickle juice and costs significantly less than salt, former county Public Works Director Joe Crifasi told CNN affiliate WCBS. The county also had an exceptionally snowy winter this year. Other alternatives to salt have included liquid byproducts, including beer waste and beet juice, according to a study by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a New York state-based environmental group. Some communities are dealing with high costs for both salt and overtime for plow drivers. In Oak Park, Illinois, salt is three times the normal price because of high demand this winter, and overtime for plow workers is adding up. The New Jersey DOT reports that it has spent more than $82 million for snow and ice removal through February 11 of this year, compared with $62 million spent all of last year's winter season. Even before the last storm, more than 372,000 tons of salt had been used in New Jersey this winter, compared with ""last year's 258,000 tons for the whole winter,"" Dee said. 5 reasons climate change is back in the news . CNN's Ross Levitt, Maria Santana, and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.","Salt shortages are hitting cities across the country, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Karen apparently will not become a hurricane, but the storm still means a soggy weekend for parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast. The storm, expected to near land between southeastern Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle early Sunday morning, before it weakens into a depression, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane center canceled a hurricane watch Friday afternoon. A tropical storm watch continued from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Indian Pass, Florida. Coastal residents were warned that storm surges and dangerous waves remain possible. Karen's maximum sustained winds dropped to about 40 mph by midday Saturday. The storm was centered about 130 miles south-southwest of the Mississippi River's mouth about 10 p.m. CT (11 a.m. ET). The mayor of Grand Isle, Louisiana, on Friday ordered a mandatory evacuation for the barrier island town, CNN affiliate WGNO-TV reported. Grand Isle has about 1,300 residents plus tourists. Mayor David Camardelle ordered them to take camper trailers and recreational vehicles off the island. Track the storm . A tropical storm warning is in effect from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the mouth of the Pearl River on the Louisiana-Mississippi line. 3 to 6 inches of rain . The storm is expected to drop 3 to 6 inches of rain over parts of the central and eastern Gulf Coast through Sunday night, mainly near and to the east of the storm's center, the hurricane center said. Isolated storm total amounts of 10 inches are possible. Storm surges also are a concern. If peak surges coincide with high tide, water could reach 3 to 5 feet above ground from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to Alabama's Mobile Bay, the center said. ""The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters,"" the center said. The hurricane center's tracking map shows that the storm could make two landfalls: once over the Louisiana barrier islands Saturday night and again over the Florida Panhandle on Sunday morning. Back to work at FEMA . The storm prompted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to recall some of its workers furloughed during the government shutdown. The agency also reactivated its Hurricane Liaison Team at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. FEMA officials in the Atlanta and Denton, Texas, offices are monitoring Karen. ""At all times, FEMA maintains commodities, including millions of liters of water, millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of blankets, strategically located at distribution centers throughout the United States, including in the Gulf Coast region, that are available to state and local partners if needed and requested,"" the agency said in a statement. The hurricane center said it, too, would be unaffected by the government shutdown as Karen approaches. ""The National Hurricane Center is fully operational ... and has all of its resources available to it,"" spokesman Dennis Feltgen said in an e-mail. ""The government shutdown will not inhibit NHC from providing its mission."" Storm preparations . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared statewide states of emergency. Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 18 counties. A Louisiana law prohibiting price gouging during emergencies went into effect, CNN affiliate WDSU-TV reported. New Orleans officials released a statement asking residents to ""monitor weather conditions and stay alert."" The city is included in the tropical storm watch area. Karen formed between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. CNN's Sean Morris, Eliott C. McLaughlin and David Simpson contributed to this report.","Hurricane watch canceled; tropical storm watch continues .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- I certainly didn't anticipate this turn of events: that more than 200 Nigerian girls, students kidnapped from their hostels in dead of night, would still be missing, and with their abductors, for 100 days in peacetime, democratic Nigeria. The agony of the girls, and more specifically of their parents, has haunted the country since. In those weeks, at least 11 of the parents have died: seven of the fathers were among 51 bodies taken to hospital in Chibok after the terrorists attacked Kautakari, just nearby, and at least four are confirmed to have died of heart failure, high blood pressure and other illnesses. ""One father of two of the girls kidnapped just went into a kind of coma and kept repeating the names of his daughters, until life left him,'' a community leader, Pogu Bitrus told the Associated Press. There is a sense of disbelief among protesters and Nigerians generally -- from across the world. Citizens whisper to themselves in malls, at parties, in the markets, across offices, at newspaper vendor stands and in airport terminals. We knew things were bad; but we didn't know they were so bad that the Nigerian government would be incapable of securing even this symbolic victory over the terrorist Boko Haram for more than 100 days. When did we become the kind of country where this happens? Well, it certainly has been a long time coming. Years of political infighting between the ruling and opposition parties led to a breakdown of trust and cooperation across state and federal government agencies; the one suspecting the other of using the terrorists to win political advantage. The relative inaction has only emboldened Boko Haram, which these days invades communities, taunts Nigerians in videos (including the latest this week by its leader Abubakar Shekau), and hoists flags in villages with the ease of an advancing army. Opinion: Nigeria's kidnapped girls not forgotten . The 100-day marker for the kidnap of the Chibok girls stands as the highest symbol for the failure of the Nigerian state to protect its citizens, to defend its territory, to inspire hope. From the two weeks it took President Goodluck Jonathan to officially acknowledge the scale of the problem to the relentless cross-government attack against citizen protesters, there has been a sense that the authorities are more interested in protecting their offices, than restoring confidence. It doesn't help that it took the President 99 days to even meet the parents of the missing girls and only after a foreigner, Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai had pleaded. It doesn't help that, apparently, the 50-plus girls who escaped captivity have not immediately been taken under the wings of the government. It doesn't help that the country's secret service has taken to harassing leaders of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign at international airports. It has become a broken record: the government says it knows the location of the girls. But this offers little comfort, as little comfort as the lack of information as to how exactly the international community is helping, since it has no boots on the ground. The meeting with the parents on Tuesday hopefully opens a new chapter in efforts to find these people. For one, the much talked about empathy that has won this president the hearts of Nigerians was on display. Whether manufactured or not, it gave at least a ray of hope for a thirsty citizenry -- as we gather Wednesday in marches across the world, from Lagos to New York, Abuja to London. Maybe this will be the beginning of stronger cooperation between the Chibok community and its federal government; maybe it will signify a thawing of relations between the presidency and the opposition state government. Maybe it will finally convince the President that protesters, like the parents, do not wish his downfall, they only want a slice of hope. In a politically charged climate, where everything is interpreted against the backdrop of the coming 2015 general elections, this might be little more than futile hope. But as we ponder the fates of at least 219 young women, caught in the Sambisa forest, surrounded by mosquitoes, spiders, dirty waters, deadly snakes and deranged fundamentalists, hope -- unfortunately -- is all we can afford.

"(CNN) -- After shocking the tennis world at the U.S. Open, teen sensation Catherine ""Cici"" Bellis has set her sights on Ellen DeGeneres' couch. The 15-year-old stunned 12th seed Dominica Cibulkova with a 6-1 4-6 6-4 triumph in her first grand slam match, becoming the youngest winner of a U.S. Open tie since Anna Kournikova in 1996. As is the custom for breakout U.S. sport stars, a talk show appearance is likely to be never far away -- and Bellis knows which host she wants to be sat opposite. ""I love Ellen,"" Bellis, ranked 1,208th in the world, told reporters. ""I think I would want to go on Ellen."" The youngest player to feature at a grand slam for nine years, Bellis had never previously played a WTA Tour match. But the junior world No. 2 was given a wildcard at Flushing Meadows after winning the U.S. national championships earlier this month. The San Francisco-born Bellis shone on the big stage, brushing Australian Open finalist Cibulkova aside in the opening set before battling back from a break down to clinch the decider. Bellis was backed by a partisan crowd on Court Six, including some friends who helped roar her to a famous victory. Next up for Bellis is a second round contest with Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. ""I went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience, but I never thought I would come out on top winning,"" explained Bellis, who is home schooled so she can focus on her tennis. ""I had like four friends that started some of the chants. I was like, 'Oh, my God.' I loved it. It made me play even better."" A first round win at this year's U.S. Open comes with a check for $60,000, not that Bellis will be able to cash in. Her status as an amateur means she is unable to claim winnings, but Bellis is in no rush to turn pro. ""I think I'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college, in case an injury or something happens,"" she said. ""But I'd love to be a pro one day.""","15-year-old Catherine ""Cici"" Bellis win her first ever grand slam match .

"(CNN) -- About 150 U.S. Marines are poised to enter turbulent South Sudan to help evacuate Americans and provide security for the U.S. Embassy, if ordered to do so, two U.S. military officials said Monday. The troops are moving from Moron, Spain, to the Navy's Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. An estimated 100 U.S. citizens are believed to be in South Sudan, where steady violence is stoking fears of an all-out civil war in the world's newest country. ""By positioning these forces forward, we are able to more quickly respond to crisis in the region, if required,"" read a statement from U.S. Africa Command. It cited the example of Benghazi, where an attack last year killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. ""One of the lessons learned from the tragic events in Benghazi was that we needed to be better postured, in order to respond to developing or crisis situations, if needed. These precautionary movements will allow us to do just that,"" the statement read. According to a senior administration official, 380 American citizens and about another 300 third-country nationals have been evacuated. ""Based on registration, there are American citizens in other towns and areas throughout South Sudan. We are trying to track down how many may still be there. Many may have gotten out on their own. We are trying to track that down,"" the official said. On Sunday, all Americans who presented themselves at a U.N camp in the flashpoint town of Bor were evacuated safely, the State Department said. A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out Sunday. U.S. personnel have been working to confirm that no other U.S. citizens remained in Bor in need of evacuation. U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in Bor to Juba, the capital, on Saturday, the same day a U.S. mission to airlift Americans out was aborted when the aircraft came under fire. Four U.S. troops were wounded in the attack in Bor and were to be moved to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Sunday. One of the injured ""went through some pretty serious surgery"" after being taken to Nairobi, Kenya, with wounds from gunshots fired at the aircraft. All four have been able to speak to their families. ""The United States and the United Nations, which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan, took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""The U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan. We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible."" Rebel seizure . Earlier, government officials reported rebels have seized the capital of a key oil-producing state in South Sudan. Military spokesman Phillip Aguer told CNN that Bentiu is no longer under government control after falling to troops loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar, who was ousted from his post in the summer. On its Twitter feed, the South Sudanese government wrote: ""Bentiu is not currently in our hands. It is in the hands of a commander who has declared support for Machar."" Bentiu is the capital of Unity state, the source of oil -- crucial to impoverished South Sudan's economy -- that flows through pipelines north into Sudan for export. Aguer said troops of the Sudan People's Liberation Army were on their way to retake rebel-held towns -- namely Bentiu and Bor, also north of Juba. He said the army had not asked regional powers to assist, saying it was equipped to handle the situation. He would not specify the number of troops being sent in but estimated about 1,500 rebels were in both Bor and Bentiu. President Salva Kiir, from South Sudan's Dinka ethnic group, has accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two men have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. The U.S. special envoy to South Sudan, Ambassador Donald Booth, said Monday that Kiir told him he is ready to begin talks with Machar, without preconditions as soon his counterpart is willing, to try to stop the violence. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum following decades of conflict. Armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. Machar: 'There was no coup' The former vice president said Monday that he and his supporters have no intention of taking power through military means. ""There was no coup. It was a sheer lie, fabrication,"" Machar told CNN's Max Foster. ""There is an uprising in South Sudan, as you well know. The people are uprising. It is because of the security forces that are stamping down on the popular feeling of people. The people of South Sudan are fed up with what Salva Kiir has been doing all this time."" He said he was happy to start talks with the President, but only if Kiir first releases political detainees. ""These are the only people who can dialogue. The army releases them, then the dialogue can start soon, and hopefully we will get a peaceful settlement,"" Machar told CNN. United Nations responds . Up to 40,000 civilians have taken refuge in U.N. bases in the country, the world body says. It estimates some 62,000 people have been displaced, with violence affecting five of South Sudan's 10 states. ""The U.N. stood with you on your road to independence,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday in a message to the people of South Sudan. ""We will stay with you now. I know that the current situation is causing great and growing fear. You are seeing people leave the country amid increasing chaos. The U.N. will stay with you."" He called for reinforcing the U.N. peacekeeping force, which currently has more than 6,800 troops and police in the landlocked country. In a letter, Ban asked the Security Council to boost the force by 5,500 personnel. The United Nations has moved noncritical staff out of Juba across the border into Uganda. The violence, which began in the capital, has spread farther north in one week, killing hundreds of people and displacing tens of thousands. According to the senior U.S. administration official, the United Nations is working up a list of requests for assistance. ""Washington is now in the process of looking at these requests and evaluating how we can be helpful and how we can do that as quickly as possible,"" the official said. Doctors Without Borders 'deeply concerned' Medecins Sans Frontieres said it was ""deeply concerned"" for the safety of those caught up in the violence. The group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said fighting had broken out Sunday in Nasir in the Upper Nile state, and a hospital in the town had received 24 patients with gunshot wounds. The group is also providing assistance in Bentiu and Juba. ""Yesterday while setting up the mobile clinic for the displaced in Juba, there was still a queue of people arriving carrying all their belongings, with their children in tow. With the ongoing conflict in the country, people are unsure of how the situation will evolve and are scared to return home,"" Forbes Sharp, the humanitarian group's emergency coordinator, said in a statement. ""The situation is evolving fast in South Sudan and we are reacting as best we can to the changing landscape of the violence."" CNN's Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N.

"(CNN) -- ""I don't want Jim to have died in vain."" That was the core of the message Friday from Michael Foley, the brother of the American journalist James Foley, beheaded this month by his ISIS captors. Michael Foley told CNN's Anderson Cooper he hopes Western nations get on the same page when it comes to dealing with kidnappers from militant groups like ISIS -- saying that having some European nations pay ransoms while the United States doesn't sends an inconsistent message. He hopes that communication improves, not just among nations, but between governments and captors. He hopes others understand James' passion for journalism, to shed light on stories and truths others may never see. He hopes people honor him by giving to a Marquette University scholarship fund, go.mu.edu/remember-foley, set up in his honor. And Michael Foley hopes others can find comfort -- and strength -- like his family has in how his brother acted in his darkest and final moments, as seen in the horrific video of his killing posted online. ""Jim didn't flinch. He had the courage,"" Michael Foley, 38, said. ""I'm certain that he put himself in a position to be first in line (among the captives to be killed), and he wanted us to be strong. And that is the message that he was sending, without sending it."" Even as ISIS touted the journalist's killing and threatened others, the world has responded -- in words at least. Officials and groups from all over have condemned it. The latest was the U.N. Security Council, ripping the ""heinous and cowardly"" execution, which it said illustrates the growing danger facing journalists reporting out of Syria. The United States hasn't halted its military campaign against ISIS forces in Iraq since the shooting; in fact, it has threatened to step up efforts in Iraq and neighboring Syria against a group that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel described as exhibiting evil ""beyond anything we have seen."" Pentagon issues chilling warning about ISIS . The Foley family has seen it. Their nightmare started with James' November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. It got worse when they got an e-mail from his captors a week ago threatening his death -- a message Philip Balboni, the CEO of the online publication GlobalPost, which hired Foley as a freelancer -- described as ""vitriolic and filled with rage against the United States."" The nightmare ended with the video, posted Tuesday to YouTube, which also showed another U.S. journalist, identified as Steven Sotloff, and an ISIS warning of more dead captives if the U.S. continues its military operations. It's hard for the Foleys, still, to put into words what's happened to this fun-loving uncle, this 40-year-old who found his dream job as a journalist late in life and embraced it to the core, right up to his death. ""Horror is a good word,"" James Foley said. ""It's right out of a Hollywood movie. ""And unfortunately, you're in it."" Brother: ISIS is evil, but airstrikes may not be enough . Could James Foley's story have had a different ending? His brother thinks so; in fact, he says he knows ""that there's more that could have been done."" ""(U.S. officials) hands are tied, in many ways, by the rigid policies that we tend to follow,"" Michael Foley added. Balboni told the Wall Street Journal that the captors originally demanded a ransom sum of 100 million euros, or about $132.5 million, from Foley's family and GlobalPost. Michael Foley noted that several European journalists have been freed, after their captors got paid ransoms -- something Washington refuses to do, saying it won't negotiate with terrorists. Michael Foley says he understands both stances, stressing instead that consistency is key. Expecting a militant to free an American for nothing while freeing a European for cash doesn't make sense. ""I don't have all the answers, but I do think that a more cooperative approach (is needed),"" he said. ""And there wasn't sharing of information. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to get information (on) released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built."" U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue Foley and other hostages held by Islamic militants, a U.S. official told CNN. Several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos from units like Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 flew in aboard helicopters but couldn't find the hostages, including Foley. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser on Friday said the administration was looking at options beyond the current airstrikes in Iraq against the Sunni extremists. ""If we see plotting against Americans, see a threat to the United States emanating from anywhere, we stand ready to take action against that threat,"" Rhodes told reporters. ""... We're actively considering what's going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we're not going to be restricted by borders."" Up until last month, the Foley family thought they had ""made a lot of progress"" toward James' release. But when the United States began hitting ISIS in Iraq, the Foley family knew it wouldn't help -- even though, as Michael Foley acknowledges, what happened to his brother underscores the evil nature of this group. ""I think there's a lot of utility to what's being done there,"" he added. ""It's just horrible what ISIL is doing to the citizens over there and something needs to be done. I'm just not sure that containment and some of these strikes are enough."" CNN's Ray Sanchez and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: Foley's brother says ""rigid policies"" of U.S. hamper efforts to free captives .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least eight people have been killed as Thai security forces declared a ""live firing zone"" in downtown Bangkok on Saturday following days of deadly clashes with anti-government protesters. Saturday's fatality takes the total number of deaths to 25 since a government-backed clampdown on protesters exploded into violence on Thursday. More than 150 people have been wounded, according to emergency officials. In a televised address, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said a small group of protesters among the opposition ""Red Shirts"" was trying to foment civil war. The prime minister urged the citizenry to understand and embrace the government's stance. The country couldn't allow the rule of law to fail, he said, warning that the longer the protests continued, the higher the risk for the public. ""The government proposed a reconciliation plan but it was rejected,"" Abhisit said. ""This benefits no one. It only benefits a small group which wants to harm the country and lead it to civil war. It is unbelieveble that they use peoples lives for political advantage."" Thousands of Red Shirts, who support ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have been occupying a central area of the city for weeks in a show of opposition to Abhisit. The escalating unrest prompted the U.S. Embassy to issue a travel warning Saturday advising Americans to defer travel to Bangkok, spokeswoman Cynthia Brown told CNN. Several other western embassies, including the UK, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands have also advised against travel to Bangkok. Tensions remained high Saturday, with protesters yelling and screaming as they stood behind barricades of tires, spikes and bamboo poles. iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . But a military spokesman said security forces planned to put the protesters under more pressure Saturday as they cordoned off an area of several square kilometers, CNN's Sara Sidner reported. ""In the next few days, they will be stepping up their security measures,"" said Panitan Wattanayagorn, the acting Thai government spokesman. Security forces rolled out razor wire and erected warning signs as they surrounded the area where the protesters have been clustered, CNN's Dan Rivers reported. He said Thai troops had also come under fire although it was unclear who was shooting at them. ""There's been quite a fierce gunfight where we are in the northwest corner of this zone that they have tried to surround a Ratchaprarop Road which has been declared a live fire zone by the army,"" said Rivers. ""There are signs up all along it warning residents to stay indoors, that there is live ammunition being used. We've been effectively pinned down while the army tries to deal with incoming fire. We're not sure who's firing on them but it's certainly been a very volatile situation with lots of explosions and gunfire going on."" Sidner, a few kilometers away inside the security force's cordon reported witnessing two people shot. Both appeared to be unarmed she said. Those present at the scene claimed rooftop snipers were responsible for the shootings, she said. ""The protesters clearly blame the army for the deadly force,"" said Sidner. ""There is no way to know for sure who exactly is doing the shooting but neither of the people we saw injured were armed."" On the scene: Bangkok at boiling point . The Thai capital has been in chaos since Thursday, beset by gunfire, tear gas and stone-throwing that boiled over after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. What are protests about? A government official said Thai forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area, with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters. Among those wounded on Friday was a journalist from a French television station who was shot in the leg. The government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. Wattanayagorn said Friday that security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond. He told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement, which allow them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades. He assured Bangkok residents and foreigners that the forces have no intention of harming anyone. The government, he said, is ""very confident"" it will be able to ""stabilize the situation"" and get it ""under control very soon."" Also, he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms. The United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, has been demanding that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup. Tensions ramped up when Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng, which means Red Commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet Thursday, leaving him in critical condition. Brown, of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said that family members of embassy personnel had been offered voluntary departure. She said the embassy would remain closed on Monday and that staff were assessing the situation ""day to day.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration has released more once-secret national security documents, this time detailing the origins of increased electronic surveillance to collect foreign intelligence in the months after the 9/11 attacks. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Saturday in a statement that the material shows that President George W. Bush authorized spy agencies to collect contents of some overseas communications, as well as the bulk collection of domestic phone calls and e-mail metadata. The 10 documents show deep concern within the U.S. government over the possibility that other terrorist cells were operating in the United States, plotting a domestic attack like the ones that struck New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. One such document, from 2007, explains the government's concern: ""We have numerous reasons to believe al-Qaeda is still plotting another attack on U.S. soil,"" then-DNI Michael McConnell says in a newly declassified declaration as part of an ongoing lawsuit over the telephone records. ""Besides Bin Laden's own statements, his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, issued threats against the United States and its interests and enjoined Muslims worldwide to take up violent jihad in more than a dozen audio or video taped statements in 2006 and at least four thus far in 2007."" McConnell adds, ""The (U.S.) Intelligence Community assesses al Qaeda is most likely employing a diversified operational planning model, involving multiple, probably autonomous concurrent efforts."" The agency over the summer began selected release of documents, following a pledge by President Barack Obama to increase transparency. Large sections of the newly released material were blacked out to ""protect information that remains properly classified for national security reasons and because of the great harm to national security if disclosed,"" said the office of the Director of National Intelligence. The disclosure that the National Security Agency has been collecting metadata has stirred provoked from civil liberty groups worried about the impact on privacy rights. Bush's initial unilateral executive action in 2001 on the metadata collection was replaced by congressionally mandated updates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That revised law said federal judges working for a secret FISA court had to periodically approve the surveillance. Officials have previously said the changes to intelligence gathering and data collection proved key to stopping further incidents of domestic terrorism. ""President Bush issued authorizations approximately every 30-60 days,"" the Director of National Intelligence office said Saturday in a statement. ""Although the precise terms changed over time, each presidential authorization required the minimization of information collected concerning American citizens to the extent consistent with the effective accomplishment of the mission of detection and prevention of acts of terrorism within the United States."" Obama said Friday that he was considering making changes within the National Security Agency, after a panel appointed by him made specific recommendations. Since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of highly classified documents this year, the president and the intelligence community have promised greater public scrutiny of spying and anti-terrorist operations.","The documents detail the origins of heightened electronic surveillance after 9/11 .

"(CNN) -- The French government was dissolved Monday amid turmoil among top ministers. President Francois Hollande asked Prime Minister Manuel Valls to form a new government, which will be announced Tuesday, Hollande's office said in a statement posted on Twitter. French media reported that the upheaval was caused by public calls from Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg for a major reorientation of economic policy in a country where growth has stalled and unemployment remains high. Montebourg's comments were seen as a challenge to the authority of Hollande and Valls. ""The crisis in the heart of the government is clear, and it promises to be bloody,"" reported Le Figaro, a right-leaning national newspaper. Socialist leader Hollande said he wants the new government to be ""a team that is coherent with the course that he himself has set for our country,"" the statement from his office said. Hollande has the worst approval ratings of any French President on record. Valls' popularity, meanwhile, has shown a decline in recent opinion polls. Valls has been in the post of Prime Minister since March 31, replacing Jean-Marc Ayrault. Hollande has held the presidency since 2012, when he defeated his predecessor, the center-right leader Nicolas Sarkozy.

"Washington (CNN) -- Impassioned wrangling over changing the way the military prosecutes sex assaults pits the 20 women in the Senate against each other in a thorny political battle over an institution where chain of command is sacred. A bipartisan measure championed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand that would have removed military commanders from decisions on whether to prosecute subordinates for rape, sexual assault and other serious crimes fell short in a procedural vote on Thursday. Gillibrand, of New York, argued that commanders too often are biased in their decisions on such matters, and proposed placing the responsibility with ""non-biased, professionally trained military prosecutors."" Efforts to defeat Gillibrand's bill were led by fellow Democrat and Armed Services Committee member, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . Gillibrand and McCaskill have fought for months over how best to reform the prosecution process for military sexual assaults. Gillibrand would go outside of the traditional military command structure to force change; McCaskill's approach is to reform from within. Both spoke with sexual assault victims, members of the military and fellow lawmakers. Their competing measures also divided the newly expanded female caucus of senators with most of them, including fellow Armed Services Committee member Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, siding with Gillibrand. A number of women's rights groups also backed her bill. ""Forty five U.S. senators blocked all justice for survivors of sexual assault in the military, and that is a travesty. Today's results show just how pervasive rape culture in America has become, and how hard we will have to fight to overcome it,"" Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, a women's rights group, said in a statement Thursday following the vote. ""We won't stop fighting, and the 45 Senators who voted in support of rape culture today should be ashamed for not fighting with us."" Gillibrand's bill also had the support of several veterans groups. ""This was a missed opportunity for Senate leaders to overhaul the military's broken system of combating sexual trauma. They have turned their back on veterans and service members who pushed for reform,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, chief executive and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a military advocacy group. ""Instead, the Senate has chosen to keep the status quo. Our lawmakers should be able to provide a fair and effective military justice system worthy of our veterans and service members,"" he said. Senate blocks military sexual assault bill . Gillibrand's bill also had the support of the majority of the Senate, including potential 2016 Republican presidential contenders Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Supporters cite a recent Pentagon study that showed an estimated 26,000 incidents of sex assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012, but just over 10% of those were reported. ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,"" Paul said of the argument that that military commanders should be allowed to decide whether to prosecute rapes and sexual assault. However, Gillibrand's measure was staunchly opposed by both the Pentagon and the bipartisan leaders of the Armed Services Committee including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham who had choice words for Republican presidential hopefuls who backed the bill. Rape victims say military labels them 'crazy' McCaskill argued that reforms that became law last year will increase sexual assault prosecutions. Those reforms include: removing the authority of commanders to overturn convictions; providing attorneys to victims; making it a crime to retaliate against a victim; and requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault. The Senate did pass a separate bill Thursday authored by McCaskill that adds to new changes to the reforms adopted last year. The measure, which passed easily with Gillibrand's support, nixes the so-called ""good soldier"" defense, which allows defendants to present evidence of their good military character at sexual assault trials. McCaskill has a measure, co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Deb Fischer of Nebraska, who also sit on the Armed Services Committee that would allow an outside civilian review to weigh in if a military commander and prosecutor disagree on sexual assault prosecution. A vote on that bill is expected next week. Groping allegation against Army officer who helps fight sex crime . The political showdown over the sexual assault measure unfolded on the same day Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, who had been accused of ""forcible sodomy,"" plead guilty to having an affair with that service member -- a military crime -- and to improper sexual conduct with two other subordinates. Additionally on Thursday, news broke the Army was investigating an officer whose job it was to train prosecutors on sexual assault for allegedly groping an Army lawyer in 2011 at a conference. CNN Senior Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Female senators engaged in political back-and-forth over how military handles sex assault .

"(CNN) -- Now that many airlines can't fly over eastern Ukraine due to safety concerns, a Malaysia Airlines flight chose a different route -- over war-torn Syria. The decision to divert a plane from a dangerous route to an equally risky route was a head-scratcher for many. Three days after MH17 was shot down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, another Malaysia Airlines flight -- MH4 from Kuala Lumpur to London -- flew over Syria on Sunday, said FlightRadar24, which tracks air traffic around the world. According to FlightRadar24, the plane passed near Homs, which has been a rebel stronghold and a focal point for attacks in the Syrian civil war. The decision earned the airline some ridicule on social media, but Malaysia Airlines defended the MH4 flight path over Syria. ""MH004's flight plan is in accordance to International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) approved routes,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Syrian airspace was not subject to restrictions. At all times, MH004 was in airspace approved by ICAO."" The company said the ""safety of its passengers and crew is of utmost priority."" In addition to the tumult surrounding the MH17 tragedy, Malaysia Airlines is also grappling with the disappearance MH 370, which was carrying 239 people when it fell off the radar on March 8.

"(CNN) -- Months after a nationwide manhunt helped authorities track down kidnapped California teen Hannah Anderson, she's revealing new details about her conversations with the man who allegedly held her hostage. In an interview with NBC's ""Today"" show set to be broadcast Thursday morning, Anderson describes the time she spent with alleged kidnapper James DiMaggio in his house about an hour east of San Diego. Anderson says DiMaggio sat her down on a couch, handcuffed her, zip-tied her feet and revealed his plan to kidnap her and take her to Idaho. The day quickly took an even darker turn, Anderson told ""Today,"" describing how DiMaggio encouraged her to play Russian roulette with him, using a real gun. Autopsy: Hannah Anderson's mother, brother were beaten and burned . ""When it was my turn, I started crying and, like, was freaking out,"" Anderson said. ""And he said, 'Do you want to play?' And I said, 'No,' and I started crying, and he's like, 'OK,' and he stopped."" Anderson said DiMaggio told her he would eventually get her home. He also told her that her mother and brother were in his house, alive. Police later found the bodies of her mother and brother at DiMaggio's burned home. After evading authorities for a week, DiMaggio was spotted in the Idaho wilderness on August 10, nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred. An FBI agent shot him dead and Hannah, 16, was returned to her family in Southern California. James DiMaggio's sister to Piers Morgan: Hannah Anderson was 'trouble' The nationwide manhunt for DiMaggio drew widespread attention and sparked widespread speculation about the case. Now, the author of a new book is criticizing the teen's behavior and claiming there are inconsistencies in her story, CNN affiliate KGTV reported. An Anderson family spokeswoman told CNN the family has no comment on the book. Anderson, meanwhile, told ""Today"" that thinking about her abductor makes her ""disgusted"" and ""angry,"" according to quotes from the interview published on the morning show's website. But learning more about the Amber Alert issued by authorities as they searched for her, she said, has helped her recovery.

"(CNN)  -- There are thousands of football stadiums around the world, ranging from multi-million-dollar, all-seater arenas to traditional old grounds that could probably do with a bit of TLC and a lick of paint. Everyone knows about iconic structures such as Brazil's Maracana, the mark II Wembley in London and Spain's Santiago Bernabeu and Camp Nou, but many quirkier venues are also worth a visit. CNN has picked out eight that offer something slightly different to the norm. Tell us what you think, is your favorite ground missing off the list? 1. Estadio da Madeira, Portugal  At first glance this 5,500-capacity stadium is not at all unusual, although two ends of the ground are wire fencing with no seats. But the location, high above Madeira island's capital of Funchal, qualifies this venue for attention. Games are often called off for fog and it is no wonder. The only road up to the ground is a narrow twisting track, easy to miss with just a single makeshift sign to indicate the right direction. Driving up the narrow road it is hard to believe you are heading to a ground which has hosted Europa League football, until after a couple of kilometers you can spot the floodlights, high above the tree line like a scene from the film ""The Field of Dreams"" and its imaginary baseball ground. This stadium is for real and boasts good facilities, including the Cristiano Ronaldo football academy, but its surreal setting takes some beating. 2. Braga Municipal Stadium, Portugal . Portugal's second entry in our list was designed by famed architect Eduardo Souto de Moura, winner of the 2011 Pritzker Architecture Prize, and is unique for its rugged beauty. Built in 2003, in time to be one of the venues for Euro 2004, Moura carved the stadium into the face of the adjacent Monte Castro quarry which overlooks the city of Braga. And, since it was built, the team's fortunes on the pitch have improved as well, culminating in them reaching the final of the Europa League last year. Moura received his Pritzker prize this year from a well-known statesman, who said: ""This is Eduardo's most famous work -- he took great care to position the stadium in such a way that anyone who couldn't afford a ticket could watch the match from the surrounding hillside."" That statesman? U.S. President Barack Obama. 3. Stadion Kantrida, Croatia . Situated in the Croatian city of Rijeka and home to the club of the same name, this stadium might be small, holding only 10,000 fans, but is perfectly formed. Like Braga's ground, one side of the arena is dwarfed by a giant cliff face. However, the Kantrida offers visual beauty on the other side as well, being perched alongside the crystal blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. The setting is so beautiful that since 1990 it has hosted some of Croatia's home international matches. 4. Allianz Arena, Germany . No apologies for the inclusion of Munich's new stadium. In an age when impressive new arenas are being built every year, this one takes the breath away for its unusual exterior. Despite the controversy that surrounded its huge cost (reported to be in the region of $400 million) and allegations of corruption and underhand dealings in its construction, this makes the list for its magnificent tire-shaped design that dominates its surroundings. But what really sets it apart is the paneling that makes up the facade, which can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light depending on which team is playing there -- something no other arena in the world can do. The Allianz Arena hosted the 2006 World Cup semifinal between France and Portugal and is the setting for the 2012 Champions League final. 5. Estadio Hernando Siles, Bolivia . Although not officially the highest stadium in the world -- that honor goes to a ground in Peru -- this one makes the list because of its national importance and controversial history. Situated in the capital city La Paz, at 3,637 meters (11,932 feet) above sea level, it is Bolivia's national arena and plays host to three club teams, including the appropriately named The Strongest. For years, international opponents claimed Bolivia had an unfair advantage playing there, and it's hard to argue with some of the results it has spawned. Just two years ago, the mighty Argentina were humbled 6-1 there -- the two-time world champions' worse defeat for six decades -- while Brazil suffered their first World Cup qualifying reverse in 40 years when losing 2-0 in 2003. FIFA has made attempts to ban the stadium from hosting such matches in the past, but the Bolivians fought tooth and nail to fight the suspension and -- in the end -- football's world governing body relented. 6. Stade Velodrome, France . Love it or hate it -- and most people hate it -- Marseille's famous old arena is just plain odd. It's the largest club ground in French football, holding 60,000 fans, and has hosted two World Cup semifinals (in 1938 and 1998) as well as numerous top rugby matches. Yet, despite its location on the windy Mediterranean coast, and repeated proposed renovation projects, spectators must suffer everything that nature has to offer, as the stadium has no roofing on the stands. Finally, work is now in progress to provide spectators with some respite from the elements, with work expected to be completed in plenty of time for when France hosts Euro 2016. 7. Svangaskard Stadium, Faroe Islands . This is a real gem of a stadium. Situated in the village of Toftir, it used to be the permanent home for all Faroe Islands home matches, although it has now been usurped as the national team venue by a newer ground in the capital Torshavn. The Svangaskard holds just 6,000 fans but once been, never forgotten. From afar it looks like it is perched precariously on the edge of rugged rocks and once up close, you realize just how near it is to the sea. Breathtakingly beautiful views surround the ground, so take a camera, and also some very warm clothing because you really will be at the mercy of the north Atlantic Ocean. 8. Cape Town Stadium, South Africa . Possibly the most beautiful stadium in the world for a variety of reasons. Built at a cost of $600 million in time for the 2010 World Cup, not only is it pleasing on the eye, but its location is simply stunning. With the landmark Signal Hill on one side, the Atlantic Ocean on the other and Table Mountain also in the background, it is a stadium that shows off Cape Town's natural beauty with sumptuous effect. And, as if it didn't have enough going for it, the stadium also played host to some of the best matches during the World Cup, with Germany beating Argentina 4-0 and the five-goal semifinal thriller between the Netherlands and Uruguay just two of its highlights.","CNN takes a look at some of the world's most unusual football stadiums .

"(CNN) -- Here's a look at the timeline of events in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, and the ensuing uproar. February 26 . About 7 p.m.: George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain, calls 911 to report ""a suspicious person"" in the gated community called the Retreat at Twin Lakes. Zimmerman says he is following Martin after the teen started to run, after which the dispatcher tells him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursues Martin anyway, before saying he lost sight of him. About 7:10 p.m.: Phone records show Martin was on the phone with his girlfriend around the time he saw Zimmerman while returning on foot from a convenience store to his father's fiancee's home. At a March 20 news conference, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump says the girl heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and Martin asking why the person was following him. The girl gets the impression that there is an altercation, during which the earpiece falls from Martin's ear and the connection goes dead, according to Crump. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman tells authorities that, after Zimmerman briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman says, he reaches for his cell phone, and then Martin punches him in the nose. Zimmerman says Martin pins him to the ground and begins slamming his head into the sidewalk. About 7:25 p.m.: Martin is shot and killed. It is raining. At the time of his death, the teenager is unarmed and carrying a small amount of cash, a bag of Skittles candy and a can of iced tea. Several neighbors of the gated community call 911 to report the incident, with authorities eventually releasing the contents of seven such calls. In one, a man whispers, ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside. There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" Another neighbor says, ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot. Hurry up. They are right outside my house."" In another call, a woman begs dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" About 7:30 p.m.: Zimmerman tells police he shot Martin in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith writes that Zimmerman is bleeding from the nose and back of the head. What witnesses say in the Trayvon Martin case . March 8: Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy Martin, family members and attorneys hold a news conference calling attention to the case. March 12: Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee says Zimmerman has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of the events. Divided town struggles with stigma . March 14: CNN's David Mattingly reports that police have concluded their investigation and turned the file over to the state attorney, who will decide whether to file charges. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, create a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it is the second most-popular petition in the website's history, with 877,110 signatures. The NAACP asks the Justice Department to get involved in the investigation. March 15: In a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, George Zimmerman's father writes that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Robert Zimmerman writes that his son is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family. March 16: Authorities release seven calls to police from the night of the shooting. In one of the 911 recordings, Zimmerman says he is following Martin. Also in one of the recordings, a voice can be heard in the background screaming ""Help, help!"" followed by the sound of a gunshot. March 19: The Justice Department announces that it has launched an investigation into Martin's death. Florida Gov. Rick Scott asks state officials to assist in the investigation. March 20: Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, says nothing in it allows people to ""pursue and confront."" The law allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The Justice Department sends representation to Sanford to investigate and ""to address tension in the community."" Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . March 21: CNN analyzes one of the tapes of Zimmerman's call to dispatch, in which he is purported to have used a racial slur. The results are inconclusive. March 22: Police Chief Lee announces that he is stepping down temporarily as head of the department, which has been criticized for its handling of the shooting. Scott announces that he is appointing State's Attorney Angela Corey of the 4th Judicial Circuit as special prosecutor, replacing Norman Wolfinger. As the petition calling for Zimmerman's arrest reaches 1 million signatures, according to Change.org, civil rights activists, politicians, family and supporters converge on Fort Mellon Park in Sanford to rally for swift judicial action, including Zimmerman's arrest. March 23: President Barack Obama speaks publicly for the first time on the growing controversy, saying the incident requires national ""soul-searching."" March 24: A handful of members from the New Black Panther Party offer a $10,000 reward for the ""capture"" of George Zimmerman. March 26: One month after Martin was killed, demonstrators rally across the country calling for Zimmerman's arrest. In Sanford, the City Commission holds a town hall meeting on the incident and its aftermath. Open Story: Trayvon Martin shooting . March 28: Zimmerman's father, Robert, appears on television and says Martin threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly, Zimmerman was forced to shoot. March 29: Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., appears on CNN and says medical records will prove that his brother was attacked and his nose was broken by Martin before he fatally shot the teen. March 29: A witness, who asks not to be identified, tells CNN of having heard voices, ""opening a window and then seeing -- with two men or two people on the ground, one on top of each other"" on the night Martin was shot dead. March 31: Civil rights leaders join throngs of protesters carrying ""Justice for Trayvon"" signs on Saturday, marching to the Sanford, Florida, police headquarters to demand the arrest of Zimmerman. April 2: Audio experts tell CNN that they don't believe it's Zimmerman who can be heard yelling ""Help!"" in the background of a 911 call. They compare those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a ""suspicious"" black male, who ended up being Martin. April 5: Zimmerman says he whispered ""punks,"" not a racial slur, in the moments before he shot Martin, his attorneys tell CNN. CNN's editorial staffers repeatedly review the tape but can reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. April 9: Special prosecutor Angela Corey decides against using a grand jury in the case. ""We believed, from day one, that they had enough evidence to arrest the killer of Trayvon Martin and now, as the evidence has continued to unfold, we think there has been a plethora of evidence to simply effect probable cause to do an arrest -- not for a conviction, but for an arrest,"" says family attorney Benjamin Crump. April 10: Attorneys for Zimmerman say they have lost contact with their client and no longer represent him. Lawyer Hal Uhrig says Zimmerman has, on his own, called Sean Hannity of Fox News and the office of the special prosecutor appointed to lead the investigation. Uhrig also suggests that Zimmerman has left Florida. Zimmerman's now-former lawyers and friend Frank Taaffe confirm the authenticity of a website as having been launched by the neighborhood watch volunteer to warn supporters about groups falsely claiming to be raising funds for his defense and to solicit donations for himself. April 11: Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, says special prosecutor Angela Corey. ""I say thank you, thank you Lord, thank you Jesus,"" says Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. ""This is a very, very major charge,"" says CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It carries the potential of life in prison. The jury instructions that the jury will receive is he can only be convicted if he showed a depraved attitude toward Trayvon Martin's life. That's a tough burden for a prosecutor to meet. But she has access to facts that we don't."" CNN's Chris Lett and Diane Laposta and the CNN Library staff contributed to this report.","Teenager Trayvon Martin was shot and killed on February 26 .

"(CNN) -- Popular literature would have it that the vampire's preferred habitat is Transylvania (or, if you're under 15, the slightly less glamorous Forks, Washington). But modern day vampire hunters might better focus their attention on a little-known area of northwestern Poland, where earlier this month a suspected vampire grave was exhumed. Slawomir Gorka, who led the dig at a marketplace in the small West Pomeranian town of Kamien Pomorski, told local website kamienskie.info that several unusual aspects of the burial ""indicate that it is a vampire burial"". Teeth had been removed, a fragment of rock was inserted in the mouth, and a leg had been staked (presumably to prevent the body rising from the grave). And this isn't the first time an interment in Poland has been deemed vampiric. Last July, archaeologists uncovered four decapitated skeletons, their heads placed between their legs, at a construction site in Gliwice, southern Poland. Both the Gliwice and Kamien Pomorski graves are estimated to date back to the 16th century. The burials may sound gruesome, but they are befitting of early medieval Polish folklore's particularly grisly interpretation of the vampire myth. ""Specific to Polish vampires is that they are known for eating their own flesh and burial garments when they rise from the dead,"" says Titus Hjelm, who convenes a course on vampires for the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies at University College London. He adds that this may explain the stone placed in the mouth of the skeleton. Fear of vampires was strong among Eastern Europeans in the medieval period. Professor Martyn Rady, a colleague of Hjelm's, posits the folk tales spread from Serbia to surrounding countries following a report sent by Austrian military authorities to their superiors in Vienna. It told of a mercenary soldier who had been turned into a vampire and infected his victims, who when exhumed from their own graves were found to have fresh blood in their cavities. The report was intercepted before reaching the Austrian capital and published in newspapers. The Polish had particular reason to fear vampires rising from their graves, Hjelm explains. ""According to some sources, Poles thought that vampires were born, rather than 'made',"" he says. ""They were normal people who could live normal lives, not aristocrats living in distant castles. The problems only started when these people died. They could come back to live with their families and even impregnate their wives."" This may account for the precautions taken during burial. Hjelm adds the notion of vampires being creatures of the night only appeared relatively recently in the 1922 film ""Nosferatu"". However, some experts warn against presuming all such unconventional burials were because of a fear of vampires. Kamil Kajkowski, an archaeologist with the West-Cassubian Museum in BytÃ³w, northern Poland, admits a number of strange medieval mortuary practices have been discovered during digs in Poland, the most common being those where the body is in the prone position, decapitated, or covered with stones. But the idea is these burials may just as well represent punishment for criminals rather than suspected vampires. That said, Kajkowski concedes the most recent discovery ""is certainly unusual"". ""The pierced thigh-bone and a stone inside the mouth clearly indicate that a range of atypical practices with ritual undertones were performed,"" he says. ""(The stone) might reflect the desire to create some kind of supernatural 'barrier' between the dead and the world of the living."" Such peculiar last rites are not confined to medieval Poland. Kajkowski says the last recorded instance of this kind of deviant burial was in 1913. As with the skeletons found in Gliwice last year, the head had been cut off and placed by the legs. ""Perhaps such a placement of the head ensured the dead would not be able to 'reach it' and put it back on his neck,"" he suggests. Vampiric or not, the strange range of historical graves in Poland indicate the country held deep beliefs around the ritualistic burial of certain citizens. Leszek Gardela, from the Institute of Archaeology at the University of RzeszÃ³w, is currently working on a research project into the phenomenon. ""Unusual mortuary practices have fascinated Polish scholars since the 1950s (when the first were discovered),"" she says. ""But so far they remain unknown to a wider international audience. It is high time to change this."" 6 destinations with a dark side . Send in your best shots from Poland .

"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ten Russian soldiers were detained in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, that country's Security Service said Tuesday, as tensions simmered over the conflict between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels. The Russian soldiers were captured with documents and weapons on them, the Security Service said. Moscow has repeatedly denied claims by Kiev that it has sent troops and weapons over the border into Ukraine, where the Ukrainian military is fighting pro-Russian rebels. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency cited a source in the Russian Defense Ministry as saying the soldiers had been patrolling the border and ""most likely crossed by accident"" at an unmarked point. The development came as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, met for the first time since June. The two Presidents agreed that they need to ""renew our dialogue,"" Putin said, according to a CNN translation. Putin said the meeting was ""positive."" The two leaders are in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks related to the Eurasian Customs Union, a trade bloc made up of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- with the crisis in Ukraine expected to dominate. As the talks started, Poroshenko said ""the fate of the world and Europe"" could be decided in Minsk. ""We must jointly find the only right decision. Peace on the continent depends on it,"" he said, according to his office. Senior European Union officials, headed by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, are also in Minsk for the summit. ""The EU is attending to see if discussions can help create momentum for a new political solution to the crisis in Ukraine,"" said Ashton's spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic. Putin told reporters that Russia couldn't be involved in ceasefire talks because those discussions should be between Kiev and separatists in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is willing to assist, he added. Putin: Military escalation won't solve crisis . Putin was cited by Russian state media as telling fellow leaders that the crisis in Ukraine ""cannot be solved through further escalation of the military scenario."" He said Russia was ""ready to exchange opinions"" on the conflict and urged dialogue to find a peaceful resolution, state news agency ITAR-Tass reported. Earlier, Poroshenko spoke with Ashton about the situation in his country's east and the detention of the 10 Russian soldiers, his office said. He urged the world to support Ukraine and its efforts to secure its border with Russia ""to prevent cross-border infiltration of weapons, military equipment and mercenaries."" This, he said, would swiftly resolve the situation. The conflict was first sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or with Russia. The ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in February was followed by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March and a declaration of independence by separatist leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Poroshenko in June signed a landmark EU trade pact, despite opposition from Russia. On Tuesday, after meeting with Ashton, the President said Ukraine would ratify the Association Agreement with the European Union in September and immediately send the ratification documents to Brussels. The move ""is in no way aimed against anyone,"" Poroshenko said, according to a statement from his office. ""Instead, the agreement will positively affect relations with all our neighbors, especially in the economic sphere. We would like our international partners to accept our decision."" He added that parliamentary elections scheduled for October 26 should not affect the EU agreement. Poroshenko's trip to Belarus comes a day after he dissolved Ukraine's parliament. However, Putin warned that it would cost Ukraine billions of euros to try to meet EU trade standards and that Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan would also lose out. Ukrainian imports would no longer be given preferential treatment, he added. It's not yet been confirmed whether Putin and Poroshenko, who last met briefly during D-Day commemorations in France, will hold bilateral talks while in Minsk. Which Western companies are taking a hit in Russia? 'I just want to survive' Meanwhile, fighting continues for control of Luhansk and Donetsk, both strongholds for the rebel fighters. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said Tuesday that militants and the Russian military have become more active in the east and south of Donetsk, as well as along the border, with 29 clashes in the past day. Rebel fighters continue to cross the border, backed up by the Russian military firing over the border, NDSC spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters at a briefing. Four Ukrainian border guards died and three were injured when two Russian Mi-24 helicopters fired on them, he said. Russia denies direct or indirect involvement in the fighting and says Ukraine's assault against the rebels is precipitating a humanitarian crisis. The besieged city of Luhansk has been without water and power for over three weeks, city officials said Sunday. Shelling has caused major damage there and in surrounding villages over past weeks. Members of the Mahounin family told CNN how they fled their town two days earlier. Intense shelling meant they'd had to spend 24 hours a day in an underground bomb shelter with more than 100 others. ""I don't care what they're fighting for, I just want to survive -- I want my son to survive,"" said Lilia Mahounin. Aid convoy . Lavrov told reporters that Russia hopes to send a second humanitarian aid convoy to Ukraine this week to help civilians caught up in the conflict. Last Friday, a convoy of 227 Russian trucks crossed that country's border into eastern Ukraine without Kiev's authorization, a move condemned by international powers as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Officials in Kiev referred to it as an invasion. The trucks left a day later, having successfully delivered supplies to Luhansk, Russian authorities said. Ukrainian authorities said they suspected the delivery had been used to bolster rebel forces. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, on a weekend visit to Kiev, promised Ukraine loans worth 500 million euros to help rebuild shattered infrastructure and homes.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of Americans have been among the thousands of foreigners who flocked to Syria to take part in its bloody, messy civil war. Yet for the three years, there was only one known American casualty. But, in a few short days, that death toll may have tripled. On Wednesday -- months after a Florida man killed himself in a northern Syria suicide bombing and a day after news broke that Douglas McAuthur McCain, a 33-year-old man reared in Minnesota, died fighting for ISIS -- a coalition of Syrian opposition groups announced that its forces had killed another American in battle. The coalition did not name the fallen American. But it did say he and McCain died as its forces battled Kharijites, a historical reference to fanatical Muslims who rejected moderate teachings and advocated killing those who violated ultraconservative values. The coalition noted that its fighters from groups with names such as Hazem Movement, the Islamic Front, Al-Mujahideen Army, Noureddine, al Zanki Battalion, Faylak Al Sham had joined those from the more moderate Free Syrian Army and more extremist al-Nusra Front. They took on ISIS forces last weekend in and around Aleppo -- which is where McCain was killed. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, who was among those who reported McCain's death, said the U.S. government is ""looking into"" this latest reported American casualty, even if it hasn't confirmed his death. Still, the idea of more Americans fighting for groups like ISIS, and more of them dying, wouldn't be surprising. Syria, after all, isn't exactly a stable place with stable borders. Nor is neighboring Iraq, where ISIS -- under the name it calls itself, the Islamic State -- has made major advances in recent weeks. ""The ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are,"" said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, who had top roles in the State and Defense Departments in President George W. Bush's administration. ""I think we need to understand that there's going to be more of this rather than less of this."" Sources: McCain radicalized gradually . There are no details on the third American casualty, but more is known about the other two. The first was Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old from Florida who joined al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. The group showed a video of him, and U.S. officials later confirmed, taking part in a suicide bombing earlier this year in northern Syria. U.S.: Jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in Florida . And on Tuesday, the world was introduced to Douglas McCain. Friends and relatives described him as a decent man who loved to play basketball and loved his family. His conversion to Islam didn't alarm his relatives, according to uncle Ken McCain, though Facebook posts in support of ISIS did. He'd been on U.S. authorities' radar for some time by then. They become aware of McCain in the early 2000s, due to his association with others -- including one person from Minnesota who died in Somalia, apparently while fighting as a jihadi -- a U.S. official said. Still, there was no indication then that McCain -- who at one point studied Arabic at San Diego City College -- was involved in anything nefarious. Law enforcement sources told CNN that he appears to have radicalized gradually in the years since his conversion. Authorities didn't know about McCain's travels to Turkey until he was already there, a U.S. official said. Turkey was also the last place where, several months ago, McCain was in contact with his relatives. At the time of his death, at least, McCain was on a list of Americans believed to have joined militant groups. Such people would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if they traveled, according to the official. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added that U.S. authorities knew about McCain's ties to ISIS. Psaki didn't say how they approached his case, specifically, though she did lay out the government's general strategy and concerns about cases like his. ""We use every tool we have to disrupt and dissuade individuals from traveling abroad for violent jihad and to track and engage those who return (to the United States),"" Psaki told reporters Wednesday. ""(McCain) is a reminder of the growing concern that the United States has, that many countries in the world have, about the thousands of foreign fighters from 50 nations who are engaged in Syria and who are affiliating themselves with ... extremist groups."" Opinion: ISIS: Is it really a threat to the U.S.? Official: Americans-turned-extremists 'willing ... to die' ISIS, especially, isn't just any extremist group. Its tactics are so brutal that even al Qaeda -- which was behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- disown them. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week called ISIS ""beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. ""This is beyond anything we have seen, and we must prepare for everything."" Who is ISIS? That includes more Americans dying. Some might be like McCain, who went to the Middle East to join the jihad. Or there may be more like James Foley, the American journalist that ISIS beheaded -- a gruesome execution that it videotaped and broadcast, along with the promise of more such killings if the United States doesn't continue to strike ISIS in Iraq. Not only aren't U.S. officials refusing to back down against ISIS in Iraq, they are signaling that they might go after the group in Syria. If President Barack Obama OKs such strikes, he'd be on the same side as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Nonetheless, U.S. officials insist they won't coordinate with al-Assad; in fact, the Obama administration is pushing Congress for funding to train and equip ""moderate opposition"" forces trying to unseat the Syrian leader. Official: Obama weighing options against ISIS in Syria . Military action isn't the only way the United States is going after ISIS, officials say. There are also things like cutting off funding for the group as well as promoting stable and productive governments as an alternative to ISIS. But the U.S. focus isn't just about what's happening in Syria and Iraq. It's also about making sure there aren't people like McCain who join ISIS and end up returning home -- perhaps intending to unleash the group's brutal brand of terror in their homelands. To this point, White House spokesman Josh Earnest insisted Wednesday ""we are working with Interpol and other law enforcement agencies, as well as homeland security agencies ... throughout the West and the region, to try to monitor the movements of these individuals and to mitigate the threats. ""...These are individuals who have been radicalized,"" Earnest said. ""These are individuals who received some military training. And they have demonstrated, as Mr. McCain did, a willingness to die for their cause."" California man arrested, wanted to join ISIS .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tam Chi Tat has driven his bright red taxi for 20 years. Born and raised in Hong Kong, he calls himself not Chinese but a ""Hong Konger."" The distinction is very important to him. ""The difference between Hong Kong and the mainland is that we grew up in a relatively free environment,"" he says. Relative freedom rings in this metropolis on the southern tip of China. There's freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and rule of law. Since the handover from Britain to China 17 years ago, the people of Hong Kong were granted a wide range of civil liberties and a measure of autonomy under the governing principle known as ""one country, two systems."" But many say that way of life is now under threat as Beijing affirms its ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong in a white paper issued by the State Council Information Office. Many in Hong Kong consider the white paper an abrupt missive from Beijing declaring that they call the shots. Political muscles . Albert Ho is a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and organizer of Occupy Central -- a movement of pro-democracy activists who have threatened to ""occupy"" the central business district if their calls are not heard. He tells me this is the message from Beijing: Hong Kong is subordinate to the central government. ""And when the time comes -- if it's necessary and appropriate -- all the powers previously given, dedicated and authorized to Hong Kong, could be taken back,"" Ho adds. China's political muscle flexing comes at a politically sensitive time for the territory, as scores of Hong Kongers demand true universal suffrage to elect their leader. The National People's Congress has said that the election of Hong Kong's top leader may be implemented by universal suffrage in 2017. But will it happen without Beijing effectively screening the candidates? As a hint of what will happen in 2017, Michael DeGolyer, professor and director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, points to how patriotism is emphasized in the white paper. ""Clearly they are saying that (patriotism) is the fundamental requirement,"" DeGolyer says. ""And we have to be assured whoever is being nominated to run is patriotic, according to our definition, i.e. willing to follow orders."" Standing ground . On July 1st in Hong Kong, tens of thousands of protesters -- if not more -- demonstrated for a free and open system to elect their government. After the march, more than 500 protesters were arrested at an illegal sit-in -- including Albert Ho. Prior to his arrest, the pro-democracy lawmaker told me he was willing to go to jail to expand democracy in Hong Kong ""because we have to make it absolutely clear to Beijing that they have to honor their promises given to the Hong Kong people."" But is civil disobedience the only way forward? Douglas Young is Hong Kong-born designer and co-founder of Goods of Desire, a retail business and lifestyle brand that draws inspiration from local icons from old mailboxes to mooncakes. Over the years, Young has courted controversy -- and the attention of Hong Kong police -- with a few eyebrow-raising designs. And yet the rebel designer believes persuasion -- not protest -- should shape the future of Hong Kong. Young addresses Albert Ho point blank: ""I think you are going to create more enemies than supporters."" ""At the end of the day, especially in an Asian society, I don't think people react well with aggression. It's soft power, it's persuasion, that can appeal to them."" True freedom . Like many other business owners in Hong Kong, Young believes demonstrations should take a backseat to dialogue with China to bring about more opportunity. ""We should integrate with China,"" Young says. ""Kids will be able to build their homes and businesses because what we suffer from is the lack of space in Hong Kong."" ""If we can embrace Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dongguan and Macau, Hong Kong will be a great metropolis."" But, as Albert Ho points out, such opportunity requires both sound infrastructure and sound governance. ""We need good government,"" Ho tells me emphatically. ""And that must be based on a truly democratic government."" Hong Kong taxi driver Tam Chi Tat wants his vote to truly count one day. ""I definitely want universal suffrage,"" he says. ""So that we can have a leader who is not as corrupt as mainland officials."" It's the aspiration of a people raised on freedom. But true universal suffrage anywhere on Chinese soil is not something Beijing will easily grant.","Hong Kong governed by China under ""one country, two systems"" model allows the territory more freedoms than the rest of the country .

"(CNN) -- After weeks of vague pronouncements on world events, President Obama finally spoke forcefully Wednesday. He delivered a strong statement about the horrendous beheadings of journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley and spoke about what the U.S. planned to do with ISIS, the terror group which calls itself the Islamic State. ""It's not only that we're going to be bringing to justice those who perpetrated this terrible crime against these two fine young men, but more broadly the United States will continue to lead a regional and international effort against the barbaric and ultimately empty vision that (ISIS) represents,"" he said. ""And that's going to take some time, but we're going to get it done."" In a speech later in the day, the president warned that NATO would respond to Russian aggression. The President needs to to be doing more of this kind of explaining, for both foreign and domestic policy. For too much of the time in recent weeks, he has been too focused on criticizing those who have questioned his policies. Obama has attacked Republicans for being obstructionists. He has taken on the news media for focusing on negative stories and repeating stories that are based on speculation, falsehood, and innuendo. He has even been attacking some Democrats for not being enthusiastic enough about what he has done. Not everything that he says is unfair or inaccurate. Indeed, congressional Republicans have been extremely obstructionist, making it impossible to accomplish virtually anything on Capitol Hill. ""Stop just hating all the time,"" he mockingly said during a speech in Kansas City about domestic policy. The media have their virtues and they have their flaws, but reporters often do inflate crisis stories in an attempt to win over viewers and readers. Often small stories are exaggerated and false stories gain a full hearing on the airwaves. Regardless, these kinds of complaints only go so far. The truth is that every president faces immense challenges: every president faces unfair media, and congressional opponents are usually tough. None of this is really new. To be effective, great presidents still work over these problems to shape public debate and to provide guidance to voters on major issues of the day. At their best, they can be the explainers in chief. In doing so, presidents do not have to be dogmatic, idealistic or simplistic. They can help Americans understand the story even if they don't have all the answers. This is a vital function that we expect of our leaders. Great presidents have done this in the past. During the Civil War, as Southerners and Northerners engaged in a brutal conflict over the institution of slavery, President Abraham Lincoln -- in a very different media age -- offered a series of cogent speeches that reminded Northerners of what they were fighting for while pointing to the need to restore the Union to its whole. ""It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth,"" Lincoln said. As the nation descended into a horrible depression in the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made bold speeches and took to the airwaves through fireside chats on the radio to restore a sense of confidence about how the nation would rebound from hard times. ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" he said in one of the most memorable lines in American political history. His vision of the New Deal offered a powerful road map for how the federal government could flex its regulatory muscle to revitalize the foundation of the economy. President Lyndon Johnson used his flurry of domestic legislation in 1964 and 1965 -- which he called the Great Society -- to help Americans see how they could collectively work their way out of the social conflict and despair that afflicted huge pockets of the nation even in the best of economic times. LBJ, during the part of his presidency where he was popular, relied on legislation to show how the nation could help ameliorate the racial and economic disparities that were causing immense tensions throughout the nation. As Southerners engaged in brutal conflicts over civil rights for African-Americans, LBJ offered a powerful response, including a famous speech about voting rights in 1965 that highlighted how the government would step in to protect the rights of all Americans. ""Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult,"" he told Congress in the wake of the march on Selma, Alabama. ""But about this there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right."" President Ronald Reagan helped inspire his supporters to feel that the economic stagflation of the 1970s would not be permanent. As he took office in 1981, many Americans felt little hope that there would ever be another period of vibrant economic growth or that the U.S. would ever regain its standing overseas. Through his fierce championing of tax cuts, deregulation and anti-communism, the President helped large portions of the public see how the future might be better. Supporters love the ideas of great presidents, opponents hate them. But most importantly, the effective leaders put a set of ideas on the table to help make sense of the inevitable and chronic chaos of world affairs. Obama needs to do more of what we heard Wednesday. With the emergence of ISIS in the Middle East, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and major domestic challenges such as poverty, inequality and race, Obama must step in. He should use the final years of his presidency to help create a foundation for the public to face these challenges and start thinking about a viable and rational path forward in coming years. The costs of remaining silent, of being too cool, are too high.","President Obama speaks out forcefully on Ukraine, ISIS on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster is a poignant reminder of the randomness of fortune and misfortune. But it also serves as a prelude to an emerging security environment marked by irregular warfare, proliferated high-end technology and complex economic and energy dependencies that will complicate decision-making among allied nations and confound coherent approaches to grand strategy. Indeed, the tragedy has underscored the challenges of a new era in which the line between state and nonstate actors is increasingly blurred. From Syria to Iraq, Gaza to Ukraine, nonstate militias and separatists wage shadow wars using sophisticated technologies that were formerly the monopoly of states. This new era is particularly apparent in the case of Flight 17, allegedly downed by a Russian SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Ukrainian rebels. The downing, which killed all 298 people aboard, is a reminder that small groups -- often exhibiting less restraint than state actors -- can acquire high-tech weaponry of great lethality and precision, which can be deployed so quickly people may not have time to make measured decisions. As technology continues to progress and spread, this challenge will become even more acute. With the proliferation of unmanned and, particularly, autonomous systems that will reduce the role of human input, it will be even easier to imagine senseless acts of irreversible killing, either to achieve a political cause (terrorism or insurgency) or out of sheer happenstance and miscalculation. Once missiles and armed drones strike their target, neither the casualties nor the consequences can be undone. The blurring of state and nonstate actors may also increase the difficulty of determining who is responsible, as can be seen in the ongoing Flight 17 investigation. Ironically, in the era of big data, governments may find it harder to identify -- or at least to prove with a sufficient degree of confidence -- who actually pulled the trigger in a given act of armed aggression or political violence. Recent events in East Asia provide further evidence of these developments. While most observers believe that North Korea used a mini-submarine to sink a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, in March 2010, some were unwilling to be convinced even by an exhaustive international forensic investigation. (North Korea denied responsibility.) Conspiracies and propaganda -- disseminated across ever-expanding social media platforms -- fill the void, leaving people to believe what they want. Escalation may be more likely and deterrence may be more susceptible to failure under such conditions. One chilling possibility is that a future attack, perhaps involving a nuclear device, might trigger an interstate war without definitive proof of who really instigated the fateful first blow. In an instant war, moreover, once conflict appears to have started, there may well be an incentive for some actors to ""use it or lose it,"" particularly in the absence of an existential threat of mutual assured destruction. In addition to the challenges highlighted by the Malaysian jet downing, the emerging security environment will be characterized by an unprecedented level of globalization and connectivity. And while the dark side of globalization has long been identified, the connectivity that fuels our century also threatens us. In an era of increasingly capable cyberwarfare capabilities that can be executed by nonstate actors and individuals, malicious and potentially lethal attacks may be facilitated through the Internet. Many of these may be difficult or even impossible to trace back to specific entities, and even when attribution is possible, the political costs of a response may be high. The recent controversial move by the United States to indict five members of China's military on charges of cyber-espionage demonstrates the challenges of imposing costs on a subset of actors without upsetting other and often larger goals, such as cooperative China-U.S. relations. The convergence of these factors will complicate the difficulty of alliance decision-making in the years to come, as differing threat assessments, dependencies, interests and standards for international involvement lead states to pursue competing policies, as in France's decision to deliver Mistral warships to Russia despite broader European calls for an arms embargo. There are many lessons to be learned from Flight 17's tragic end over Ukraine. But perhaps one central takeaway is that we are witnessing the end of an era of traditional state power, and entering a new era that could place us only a few short missteps away from cascading into more lethal and disruptive conflicts.

"(CNN) -- Brazil, Antarctica and Scotland are the top three destinations to visit in 2014, according to the hot-off-the-press Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2014. The rationale: Well the first is pretty obvious since Brazil is hosting the World Cup. It's the centenary of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic expedition, while Scotland's nod is mainly due to it staging the Commonwealth Games in the summer and celebrating the Year of Homecoming for overseas Scottish. A great accent probably also helps. Published this week, Lonely Planet's ninth annual roundup of best destinations around the world for the upcoming year was based on ""scores for topicality, excitement and that special x-factor,"" as determined by their inhouse experts and outside writers. And there are a few surprises. The quiet, peaceful, pretty and sometimes (unfairly) maligned Adelaide in South Australia made the top 10 cities for 2014 (possibly because of some of those adjectives). The ranking prompted this response from an Australian media outlet: Was Lonely Planet drunk when it rated Adelaide? The travel guide went with Paris as the best city next year (it didn't make the top 10 last year), with Trinidad in second place (January marks the 500th anniversary of the foundation of Trinidad) and Cape Town coming in third. In terms of regions as destinations, Sikkim in India was voted the best, for ""showing the way for what could be the future of India's tourism industry."" Some more notable predictions included Hunan region as ""the next big thing"" in China and the Greek Islands as the best value destination due to recently lowered tourism prices and fewer tourist numbers. In addition to the more standard roundups, there are also some more inventive lists ranging from ""10 essential travel destinations for Beatlemaniacs"" (it's the 50th anniversary of the Beatles going to in New York) and ""The cat's meow: top 10 destinations for feline fanatics"" to ""10 Shakespearean sites for travelers"" in honor of the 450th anniversary of the playwright's birth.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Casey Kasem's body was flown to Canada a month after he died, a funeral home director told CNN Tuesday. Kasem's corpse was taken from a Washington state funeral home last week before the radio icon's daughter could enforce a court order against it being removed, according to the director of Tacoma's Gaffney Funeral Home. A lawyer delivered the order a day after the body was sent out of the country, Corey Gaffney said. ""I disclosed to her attorney that the body was no longer in our care,"" Gaffney said. Kasem's wife, Jean Kasem, said she has been ""blackmailed"" by her husband's children for 35 years. ""This is a shakedown and I will not negotiate with terrorists,"" she told CNN. ""I will not give in to their blackmail and attacks."" Casey Kasem's body is missing, daughter says . Daughter Kerri Kasem accuses her stepmother of abusing her elderly father and contributing to his death by taking him from a Santa Monica, California, care facility in May and relocating him to Washington. Santa Monica Police have ""an open and ongoing investigation"" into the elder abuse allegation, Sgt. Rudy Camarena said last week. Kasem, who entertained radio listeners for almost four decades as the host of countdown shows such as ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" died in a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, on June 15. He was 82. Gaffney said Kasem was kept in his funeral home until he was instructed by Jean Kasem to send it to Montreal last week. ""I took Casey to the airport myself, oversaw every detail myself from the moment we brought him into care,"" Gaffney said. He tracked its arrival in Montreal, he said. The death certificate listed Urgel Bourgie, a funeral and cemetery business in Montreal, as the planned destination, he said. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of the death certificate or the arrival of the remains at the Montreal funeral home. Danny Deraney, a representative for Kerri Kasem, said Jean Kasem has the legal right to control her late husband's remains. ""The bottom line is that they want to know where he'll be buried,"" Deraney said. ""I think they have that right."" Kerri Kasem is pushing for a new law in California to give adult children visitation rights with their aging or incapacitated parents. ""There are so many people dealing with the same situation my family is dealing with, and we are receiving so many letters and e-mails,"" she said in a posting on her Facebook page Tuesday.
