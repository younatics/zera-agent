"New York (CNN) -- Mitt Romney spent weeks battling Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich for the Republican presidential nomination, and he faced blistering attacks from Rick Perry and other GOP rivals along the way. And now he is paying the price. CNN Poll: Obama holds 7-point lead over Romney . Romney's failure to surpass Barack Obama this summer stems in no small part from his reluctance to make any bold moves on policy, and this reluctance is a direct product of the beating he's taken from conservative critics for much of the last year. The basic rap on Romney -- who represented, let us not forget, the conservative alternative to John McCain during the 2008 race for the Republican presidential nomination -- was that he wasn't sufficiently conservative. To reassure conservative primary voters, Romney embraced positions on a wide range of issues, from immigration to taxes, that are more popular among reliable Republicans than among swing voters. Opinion: Reid's Romney smears an insult to voters . As the political analyst Sean Trende, author of ""The Lost Majority,"" has argued, the central dilemma facing the Romney campaign is that it has essentially secured all of the low-to-medium hanging fruit for a Republican presidential candidate by condemning Obama's economic record. Yet this hasn't been enough to give Romney a lead over the incumbent president. Indeed, there is at least some reason to believe that the Romney campaign is losing ground. This strongly suggests that the GOP needs a more positive message with crossover appeal. The trouble, of course, is that Romney's efforts to inoculate himself against charges of squishiness have made it very difficult for him to pivot to the center. What might a more daring Romney campaign have looked like? A more populist Romney campaign would spend time and money bashing the big banks. While Romney has called for repealing the Dodd-Frank Act, the centerpiece of Obama's fitful efforts to reform Wall Street, he hasn't provided much in the way of detail regarding how he'd address the too-big-to-fail problem. Given that anger against taxpayer-funded bank bailouts helped fuel the rise of the tea party movement, and in turn the Republican congressional victories of 2010, this constitutes a serious strategic mistake. Recently, the right-leaning Government Accountability Institute, led by Peter Schweizer, author of the muckraking manifesto ""Throw Them All Out,"" issued an incendiary report that accuses the Obama administration of neglecting financial fraud prosecutions because of the deep ties between senior Justice Department officials and the uppermost echelons of the financial sector. This is the kind of argument that might resonate among voters reconsidering their 2008 vote for Barack Obama. Yet this argument would need to be connected to a clear policy narrative about what a Republican president would do to take on the power of the big banks. A number of conservative and libertarian thinkers -- including James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute; Thomas Hoenig, former Fed governor and FDIC director; and Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business -- have called for breaking them up by implementing a modernized version of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that created a strict wall of separation between commercial and investment banking. Sebastian Mallaby of the Council of Foreign Relations, a market-friendly centrist perhaps best known for his exhaustive history of the hedge fund industry, ""More Money Than God,"" has even argued that investors might welcome a bank break-up. Opinion: Will Obamacare raise the price of your pizza? Leaving aside the substantive merits of this and other proposals designed to curb the too-big-to-fail phenomenon, this is an accessible idea that would help Romney play against type. So it has come as a disappointment to many on the right that the Romney campaign has been dismissive of the idea. This could reflect a conviction on the part of the candidate that Wall Street is not in need of a radical overhaul. Or, more cynically, the Romney campaign might be reluctant to alienate influential Republican donors in the financial services industry. Yet the decision to tread lightly on financial malfeasance might cost Romney the election. Romney's evolution on tax policy is also telling. During the 1996 New Hampshire GOP primary, Romney, a private citizen at the time, paid for an advertisement criticizing Steve Forbes' signature flat tax on the grounds that it was a giveaway to the ultra-rich. And his original 2012 tax proposal was a fairly modest one, which called for extending the Bush-era tax cuts while also eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest for married couples earning less than $200,000. The idea was that this would be a prelude to a larger tax code overhaul. But when Romney feared that Rick Santorum might defeat him in Michigan's crucial Republican primary, he released a far more ambitious, and far more expensive, tax cut proposal that is being criticized as pie-in-the-sky. Rather than campaign on a deep tax cut that would benefit high-earners, the Romney campaign might have instead championed a revenue-neutral tax reform that cut taxes dramatically on families with children while effectively raising them on childless high-earners. In effect, this would recognize that parents are making a significant investment in America's economic future and that this investment should be treated favorably. This idea has been championed by conservative policy entrepreneurs such as Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review and Robert Stein, a veteran of George W. Bush's Treasury Department, yet it has met with fierce resistance from The Wall Street Journal editorial board, which sees it as an unjustifiable tax giveaway that is an unhelpful distraction from the need to cut marginal tax rates. In choosing to embrace the Journal's view, Romney may have sacrificed an opportunity to connect with cash-strapped middle class parents, including many independents and Democrats. Recently, Eli Lehrer of the pro-market R Street Institute made another suggestion: Instead of simply attacking federal loan guarantees for clean-tech firms such as Solyndra, the federal government should get out of the business of subsidizing the energy sector entirely. Clean-tech subsidies would go, but so would subsidies in the tax code that benefit the oil and gas industries. It is an idea that could in theory appeal to environmentalists, and it would demonstrate that Romney's criticisms of Solyndra aren't just political posturing. Right now, the Romney campaign seems to believe that it can defeat Obama by running a conventional and cautious campaign. But as the weeks go by and the president's lead remains frozen in place, this is starting to look like a bad bet.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting between Sri Lankan government forces and Tamil rebel fighters, the United Nations reported Monday. A photo supplied by a humanitarian group on Sunday shows civilians allegedly injured in government shelling. ""Verification is, of course, the part of the problem, because humanitarian agencies are denied access to the region,"" U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss said from the capital, Colombo. ""Our understanding is that very heavy fighting took place over the weekend, and there were many hundreds of civilian deaths and many, many more beyond that injured."" The numbers provided by the United Nations pale in comparison with rebel claims. More than 3,200 civilians died from Sunday evening till Monday morning, said Lawrence Christy, the head of Tamils Rehabilitation Organization, according to the rebel Web site TamilNet. The ""Sri Lanka Army (SLA) has stepped up relentless barrage of shelling using all sorts of heavy weapons on the so-called safety-zone (no-fire zone) ... areas where more than 130,000 civilians have sought refuge,"" TamilNet said. The Sri Lankan government denied the allegations and accused the Tamils of ""taking the whole world for a ride with its well-engineered propaganda ploys,"" while turning their weapons on civilians trying to flee the combat zone. Accounts vary widely about how many have been trapped. As recently as last week, a military spokesman put the number at 10,000 to 15,000 civilians. CNN could not independently verify the accounts, because the government does not allow the news media independent access to areas where it is fighting the rebels. Government troops have closed in on rebel forces in a shrinking section of the country's north, and civilians have been caught in crossfire. More than 196,000 people have fled the battle zone, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Tamil Tigers rebels have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by the European Union and more than 30 countries, including the United States.","U.N.: Many hundreds of civilian deaths .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of New Jersey's capital city was arrested Monday on corruption charges after being accused of accepting bribes during an undercover operation, authorities said. The charges against Trenton Mayor Tony Mack, 46, his brother, Ralphiel Mack, 39, and business associate Joseph A. ""JoJo"" Giorgianni, 63, stem from an alleged kickback scheme to sell city-owned land to investors for significantly less than the assessed value. Mack and his brother, the head football coach at Trenton Central High School, both were released on $150,000 bail and slipped into a city vehicle after a court appearance. They were ordered to surrender their passports. ""The evidence appears to be, at this point, weak as far as Mayor Mack is concerned,"" Mark Davis, Tony Mack's attorney, told CNN on Monday evening. ""The complaint is just full of allegations, that's all they are."" A bond hearing for Giorgianni, a sandwich shop owner, was postponed because of unrelated drug conspiracy charges. The investigation ""revealed evidence of a conspiracy among these defendants and others to corrupt certain functions of Trenton City government in favor of purported developer seeking to build a parking garage on city owned property in exchange for cash payments totaling approximately $119,000,"" according to a complaint filed in federal court. From the archives: Ex-mayor in New Jersey gets two years in prison . The three defendants -- who were charged specifically with conspiracy to corrupt commerce by extortion -- employed intermediaries, ""used code words and limited discussions of the scheme over the telephone"" to avoid detection, the complaint said. For example, Giorgianni would use the term ""Uncle Remus"" in conversations with the mayor to connote when he had received a cash payment, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said. The charges stemmed from a two-year FBI investigation that incorporated two informants cooperating with law enforcement. Fishman said at least one of those moles wore a wire to record conversations for the FBI. At a news conference before the bond hearing, Fishman pointed to repeated cases of corruption that his office has uncovered. ""Time and again, we have seen public officials in New Jersey who are all too willing to sell their power and betray the public's trust,"" he said. Any trial related to Mack's case would not likely occur until next year, according to Fishman. Mack's office declined to comment when reached by CNN. But Davis, the mayor's lawyer, stressed his client hasn't been indicted yet and should ""continue to enjoy the presumption of innocence."" Based on discussions they've had, Davis said his ""understanding is that (Mack) is going to remain in his (mayoral) post and continue in his official duties,"" as the legal case proceeds against him. The lawyer said he expects a grand jury will consider the case within 30 days. In a separate complaint that Fishman stressed was not connected to the Macks, the government charged Giorgianni and eight others with conspiracy to distribute the highly addictive prescription painkiller oxycodone. Fishman said Giorgianni used his business, JoJo's Steakhouse, as a front for a drug dealing operation. He's accused of storing the narcotics there, distributing the pills to dealers, then processing the cash exchanged for the painkillers. Two months ago, agents raided the homes of Mack, his brother, and Giorgianni, before raiding Trenton's City Hall the next day. Mack responded to the July raids by saying he had ""not violated the public trust in any way, nor have I violated any of my public duties."" A Democrat who began his term in July 2010, Mack has been beleaguered by questions about public finance and accusations of cronyism. In May, Deputy Mayor Paul Sigmund IV was arrested and charged with heroin possession and assaulting a police officer, which led to Sigmund's prompt resignation. CNN's George Lerner, Greg Botelho, Mark Morgenstein and Khara Lewin contributed to this report.","NEW: The Trenton mayor's lawyer calls evidence presented against his client ""weak""

"(CNN) -- That is my question today. Are you involved in your kid's school? If so, how much? As a new mom in the district, I'm being pitched pretty hard by the PTA. And as a chronic joiner/doer/over committer, I'm intrigued. But I'm also wary. Alex has been in school for a week now. On Monday I went to a breakfast put on by the PTA—I mostly went just to check it out (and to avoid my deadline) but I wound up signing up for six or seven committees. Ack! Many of these ""committees"" are really just one event that you might help with—a Mother's Day plant sale, say—so it's not that crazy. Right? Parenting.com: The sport I'm not sure I'd let my son play . A form also came home in Alex's kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom. I remember my mom being the class mom a lot and I loved the security it gave me to know she was so entrenched in the system. She knew the teachers, she knew the other moms, the kids, the school. She was also the CCD teacher, the Girl Scout leader, the carpool driver and pretty much everything else you'd find under the overarching title of Kick-Ass Stay-At-Home-Mom. I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved. And the PTA seems like a no-brainer, right? That said, I worry about taking on more than I can handle. I'm still feeling the after-effects of my all-encompassing (and beyond worth it) LLS campaign and have already signed up to be a big part of that event again this year. (I'm posting this blog from a café in NYC where I'm spending the day at LLS meetings among other things). My work with the organization is hugely important to me. As is my writing career. And my (limited) free time. Parenting.com: Confessions of an inner-city school teacher . I try not to do anything half assed but I also have a tendency to not say no enough. At all. And so I over commit and then I feel overwhelmed and I hate to feel overwhelmed. Or do I love it? I can never quite tell. Sometimes I think I'm only good at any one thing when I'm doing 12 things. But back to the PTA. Are you involved in yours? What's your experience been like? Is it anything like you see in the movies with cliques and mean-girl behavior? Are there the Claire Dunphys? Parenting.com: Healthy toddler lunch ideas . Bottom line is this: One of the main reasons I left the full-time, editor-at-a-magazine (with benefits and health insurance) world years ago is so that I would be able to have an active role in my kids' day-to-day lives. And, ultimately, their schooling. So I figure I better get started now. A new friend at the bus stop gave me good advice, which was to sign up for the PTA activities that get you face time with your kid—working an event that the kindergarteners will attend, for example, as opposed to something for the older students. Kids get a kick out of seeing their parents at school, right? And also to do things that get you face time with the teacher—staff appreciation, for example—because, well, that one is self explanatory, especially given my worries about Alex's pain in the ass-ness. Parenting.com: 15 unbelievable birth stories . I signed up for several different committees (including something having to do with gardening and one about recycling, which are both in my wheelhouse) and I figure I'll dabble for a bit, get to see what it's all about and then go from there.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sarah Palin may have electrified the 2008 Republican presidential ticket when she was picked as John McCain's running mate, but just four years later her wattage has dimmed on the Republican stage. She was snubbed for a coveted speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Tampa even though McCain, the senator from Arizona who surprised many when he selected Alaska's governor, is scheduled to speak. Other speaking spots were doled out to lesser lights like Rick Santorum, who vied unsuccessfully for the nomination this year. Once the face of the tea party movement, Palin is not among speakers listed for the Tea Party Unity Rally on Sunday. Former presidential candidates Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, and pizza magnate Herman Cain are headlining. Rare opportunity for speakers at GOP convention . With Republicans positioning themselves for a presidential run last year, Palin drew the most attention when she rode into Washington on the back of a motorcycle before launching a bus tour. She eventually opted against a White House bid. Instead, Palin has hit the trail for down-ballot candidates in competitive congressional races, stumping for such political mavericks as Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock and more mainstream politicians like Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. Palin's mission: to recreate the same kind of success she had in the 2010 midterm elections when many of the candidates she endorsed won. Political experts say Palin is also carefully calculating how to wield her burgeoning kingmaker status and star power to position herself for even greater prominence in the party. ""She has a tremendous amount of pull among the people who make up the 800-pound gorilla in the party -- the conservative base of the party,"" said Keith Appell, a Republican strategist and senior vice president at CRC Public Relations. ""She will be a force to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future and beyond."" Tea party candidate to receive prime RNC speaking slot . But first she has to figure out how to get back into the bigger national spotlight, political experts say. During this presidential election cycle, Palin has been relegated to the farm leagues, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" It is a role that she slipped into through her own failure to bone up policy matters, he said. ""I think it's really interesting that she has fallen so far in the last year that they have no interest in having her appear at the convention,"" Ornstein said. ""In a lot of ways this political capital she pretty much squandered by becoming a Fox News commentator and going on reality television instead of deepening her knowledge of policy issues. She decided to focus more on making money than on throwing herself into remaining deeply relevant in politics."" Will GOP talk about Bush, Palin? In her absence, some of the same Republican women who Palin supported as part of her ""Mama Grizzlies"" pack have come to gain broader acceptance by the party's mainstream. In 2010, Palin endorsed New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, calling her a ""Granite State 'mama grizzly' who has broken barriers."" Just two years later, Ayotte will speak during a prime-time convention slot on Tuesday. Palin's relative absence on the national stage also allowed Bachmann ""to fill the vacuum,"" Ornstein said. Politics, parties keep some away from conventions . Palin's persona non grata status is ""more a matter of they can't control her message as they've already learned,"" said Michele Swers, professor of American government at Georgetown University. ""It's always useful when they can showcase Republican women, but they'd rather showcase Kelly Ayotte than Sarah Palin."" Some conservatives feel the party is giving the cold shoulder by not allowing her to speak. ""I think it's a big mistake,"" Appell said. ""If no other reason you would have a very popular voice using prime time to peel the bark off Barack Obama in front of a national television audience."" For her part, Palin is careful in how she has phrased her notable absence from the convention's speaking roster. ""This year is a good opportunity for other voices to speak at the convention and I'm excited to hear them,"" Palin wrote in statement earlier this month. ""As I've repeatedly said, I support Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in their efforts to replace President Obama at the ballot box, and I intend to focus on grassroots efforts to rally Independents and the GOP base to elect Senate and House members so a wise Congress is ready to work with our new president to get our country back on the right path."" But do not count Palin out, political experts say. She still has plenty of pull and will likely bide her time before making her next big move. Drama is rare in modern conventions . ""To say she is irrelevant would be a mistake,"" Ornstein said. ""When she gets involved in a primary it has an impact. That doesn't translate into the broader national role that she could have had. But there are second, third, fourth, and fifth acts in American politics. The fact that she isn't a major factor in American politics now doesn't mean she won't be in 2013 or a subsequent point."" Palin backed Sarah Steelman in the Missouri Republican primary against politically beleaguered Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin. Republican leaders, including Romney, are now pushing Akin to drop out of the highly contested race against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill after the congressman's controversial comments on ""legitimate rape."" During a recent Fox News interview, Palin suggested ""maybe it is a third-party run of Sarah Steelman that I can get behind."" Palin is scarcely twiddling her thumbs while sitting on the sidelines. Her endorsements of congressional candidates have built an army of supporters inside the Beltway. ""If Romney loses by a big margin there will be a move by center-leaning Republicans to recapture dominance,"" Ornstein said. ""But you're not going to see a lot of conservatives saying 'we were wrong about this.' You're going to have another chapter in this ongoing struggle. There will be a vacuum, Sarah could fill that vacuum."" And if Romney wins Palin will be right there on his heels making sure he sticks to his conservative promises, political experts say. She'll be joined by other conservative voices such as Bachmann, Cain, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolinaâ€”all vying for dominance of who represents conservatives. ""If Romney and (Paul Ryan) win, the question is do they implement a series of policies that fit the sharp conservative agenda,"" Ornstein said adding that conservatives will rally to force the Romney administration to keep its promises. ""If (the Romney administration) tack to the center, who's going to be leading that charge ... Sarah Palin."" Memorable convention moments .","Sarah Palin's star has been eclipsed a bit during this presidential election cycle .
Palin's focus on supporting congressional will help bolster her support in the future .
Palin's challenge, political experts say, will be how she negotiates her way back into the national spotlight; relevance ."
"(CNN) -- The nonprofit that pushed last month for Venezuelan officials to investigate reports of a massacre in an Amazon indigenous community said Monday that it now believes there was no attack there. ""Having received its own testimony from confidential sources, Survival now believes there was no attack by miners on the Yanomami community of Irotatheri,"" said Stephen Corry, director of Survival International. The statement comes after Venezuelan state media over the weekend published several reports detailing officials' accounts from the area, also concluding that no massacre had occurred. Venezuelan officials: Reports of indigenous massacre false . An aerial flyover and ground operation to the community in a remote region along the Brazil-Venezuela border showed no signs of an attack, Venezuelan Brig. Gen. Jesus Zambrano told state-run VTV. ""We can testify that nothing happened,"" he said. Investigators ""also visited other communities in the region, before reaching Irotatheri, and also nothing happened there."" On Saturday, Venezuela's government ombudswoman said the report was fueled by second-hand hearsay. ""It was a false, biased report,"" Gabriela Ramirez told reporters. ""The report was made by an indigenous person that heard that another organization had said it."" Last month allegations of the reported massacre trickled out of the area, where unauthorized Brazilian gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups. A declaration on the Survival International website last month said members of a neighboring indigenous community had heard reports of a massacre from Irotatheri's residents. The declaration, purportedly from a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the Amazon, said of about 80 Yanomami people who lived in the Irotatheri community, only three survivors had reportedly been found. Survival International, which advocates tribal peoples' rights worldwide, had described it as an ""atrocity."" In his Monday statement saying that Survival no longer believes there was an attack, Corry said visitors to the area ""had heard stories of a killing in July."" ""We currently do not know whether or not these stories were sparked by a violent incident, which is the most likely explanation, but tension remains high in the area,"" he said. Venezuelan officials said last Wednesday that they were investigating the reports of an attack. Several days later, a top official said visits to the region revealed that reports about the alleged massacre were false. On Saturday, a report from Venezuela's AVN news agency said investigators from Venezuela's air force concluded that ""levels of illegal mining in the area were minimal."" On Monday, Corry disputed that claim, saying ""many illegal gold miners are currently operating"" in the area. ""The Venezuelan government's reaction remains shameful. It has not said, even now, that it will remove the miners, and it immediately denied having found 'evidence' of killings, before even concluding its own investigation,"" Corry said.","Survival International ""now believes there was no attack""

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- I visited the Cambodian Stock Exchange (CSX) last September in the heart of Phnom Penh. It had officially ""opened"" a few months prior but no companies were listed yet. The trading room was filled with new desks and computer monitors, waiting for someone to power them on. Fast forward seven months and the stock exchange is now starting to breathe signs of life -- there is now one company trading on the exchange. On April 18, the Cambodian Stock Exchange started trading with the IPO of the state utility company, ""Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority."" As a frontier market, Cambodia is still a work in progress. The government is trying to woo international investors by throwing open its doors and virtually saying, ""We will make it easy for you."" There are no capital controls. No requirements for joint ventures. International companies can own 100% of their local business in Cambodia. The only major restriction is on foreign ownership of land. With a young labor force that commands cheaper wages than China, Cambodia has been looking attractive to foreign companies. Despite these incentives, there are many challenges for the new stock exchange: . Challenge #1: Short-term Investors . Even with just one company trading, the exchange generated a lot of interest among local and foreign investors. In the first three days of trading, the share price for the water utility rose 60% above its IPO price, but by the following week, short term-investors started selling to take in profits. The stock price came down substantially. ""It's kind of a typical phenomenon for a new exchange. It happened in the Laos market and Vietnam's market. It is no surprise to me,"" says KT Han, managing director of Tongyang Securities which was the sole underwriter of the IPO. ""Some people made a 50% profit within a few days. They tend to be short sighted by this fluctuation in price and it will take some time for them to understand the market and make long-term investments."" Challenge #2: More Companies Need to List . You need more than one company to make a stock exchange thrive. Laos' stock market opened in January 2011 and it still has only two companies trading. The volume of trade is fairly stagnant. That's exactly what investors don't want to see with the Cambodian Stock Exchange. Another company, Telecom Cambodia, is preparing its IPO later this year. ""I don't see any reason why eventually you can't have a dozen companies trading on the stock exchange. A lot of the big banks are listable,"" says Scott Lewis, chief investment officer of Leopard Capital which invests in pre-emerging markets. ""I know some brokers have mandates from garment manufacturers (to prepare to list)."" He also believes the success of the Cambodian Stock Exchange can have a nice domino effect. If it starts to hum, brokers will publish research on both Cambodian and Laos stock exchange-listed companies, generating interest in the region. The key is to get more companies to list and greater volume trading. Challenge #3: Proper Accounting . In order for a company to list on the CSX, it must have at least three years of proper audits prepared by an accredited international accounting firm approved by the Cambodian government. This is a tough challenge for many local, Cambodian companies. When I was in Cambodia last September, one analyst told me that he couldn't think of one large Cambodian company that had audited financial statements. So it will take time for some local companies to get up to speed. Challenge #4: Volatility of a Frontier Market . The government is doing its best to showcase the stock exchange. In one of the busiest traffic intersections of Phnom Penh, there is a large stock market television screen that shows the stock market moves. It generates interest among individual retail investors who can watch the stock price as they sit in traffic. Institutional investors from Japan, Korea and China have also taken a bite of the recent IPO but whether that interest can be sustained is still a big question. Cambodia is new to the game. Risk and volatility are inherent in a frontier market. Corruption is a concern even though the government passed an anti-corruption law in 2010. Han is very frank about the risks. ""In general, the lack of a capital market infrastructure can be a challenge for investors,"" he says. ""The cost of capacity building can be a challenge for investors who are not familiar with a market like Cambodia. In terms of corporate governance (e.g. accounting, business ethics), there's a long way to go for local family-owned businesses. But once you understand the market here, there can be more opportunity than risk.""","The Cambodian Stock Exchange started trading with one company on April 18 .
There are neither capital controls nor requirements for joint ventures .
But despite incentives, the stock exchange faces many challenges ."
"Cairo (CNN) -- Clashes erupted in Cairo on Friday after Egyptian political forces called on President Mohamed Morsy to take a stand for justice after his first 100 days in office. Shops and streets at Tahrir Square were closed as Morsy supporters and critics threw rocks at one another. At least 121 people were injured, a spokesman for the health ministry said. Thousands turned out for the protest, with some groups chanting, ""Leave Morsy."" Protesters threw Molotov cocktails at one another, and firecrackers sounded amid clashes around Tahrir and Talat Harb squares. Read more: Should U.S. worry about Morsy? Witnesses said protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood attacked and destroyed a stage built by right-wing groups that criticize Morsy. The Brotherhood said two of their buses were burned near Tahrir Square and their headquarters was burned in Mahala. The same protesters that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 were scheduled to meet in five locations Friday and march toward Tahrir Square around 3 p.m. ""We want retribution for all the martyrs of the revolution. Those Mubarak cronies released from prison for the camel attack must return behind bars, and we also demand a drafted constitution that represents all factions in a civil democratic language,"" Rami Shaath told CNN, explaining the main demands of the nationwide protest. Shaath, a founding member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, a bloc of secular and religious parties, was referring to the February 2011 ""Battle of the Camel,"" street violence in which regime supporters, backed by men on horses and camels, attacked opposition demonstrators. He says he wants to keep Egypt's revolution going while the media covers Morsy's political maneuvers. The acquittal Thursday of all suspects detained in relation to the battle last year has sparked a wave of discontent among youths and the Islamic movement across the country -- especially since 24 of those suspects were former senior members of Mubarak's regime. Most of the officers charged with killing more than 800 protesters during the uprising have not been convicted. ""We also want the retrial of Mubarak, his Minister of Interior Habib El Adly and the seven chief police officers accused of killing the martyrs,"" Shaath said. Many people relate the latest wave of acquittals to the removal of General Prosecutor Abdul Majid Mahmoud on Thursday night. ""The general prosecutor submitted his resignation to the president, and he appointed him as an ambassador to the Vatican,"" presidential spokesman Yaser Ali told CNN. Mahmoud's removal has been a top demand during the many ""million-man"" protests that followed Mubarak's ouster. In a tone of defiance, Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's official spokesman, released a statement saying that the prosecutor has not resigned and that he will continue his business as usual, as the judicial system bans the president from firing the general prosecutor. iReport video: Clashes in Tahrir Square . ""He is a corrupted man appointed by Mubarak, and it would be a disgrace to the Vatican if this is true,"" said Mohamed Farhat, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Many people who followed the revolution know the vital role the young revolutionaries took in sparking the uprising against Mubarak. The same personalities that toppled the regime have been discreetly applying pressure by mobilizing laborers to demand more rights and better pay. Activist Gigi Ibrahim and her husband, Hossam El-Hamalawy, a member of the Socialist movement, have supported the laborers and helped them strike against the government, including this week's action by doctors, in which people in hundreds of public hospitals took part in a partial strike and demanded higher wages. More than 30,000 people took part, the Ministry of Health said. ""If the government does not provide to the people, we may see a 'revolution of the hungry' next,"" Ibrahim said. The political duo, along with certain right-wing groups, also aided last week's general transportation strike. ""They all wanted to revolt demanding better pay, so we helped them by providing lawyers, organizing meeting points and involving media to pressure Morsy to accomplish what he promised to do"" Ibrahim told CNN. Morsy on Wednesday announced a presidential decree to pardon all those arrested between the January 25 uprising and June 2012. The revolutionaries welcomed the decision with some reservations. ""What are the criteria they are using to identify the true revolutionaries from the thugs? No cop has been convicted for killing us, and now, Mubarak's former NDP (National Democratic Party) members are loose after they hired men on camels who charged into Tahrir Square, beating us with whips and sticks,"" Shaath said. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Wednesday to remember the 27 protesters killed by the army on October 9, 2011, in what has become known as the Maspero Massacre. Protesters demanded the arrest and trial of Gen. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the former head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which was running the country then. Dozens of political parties and movements, along with the Muslim Brotherhood, say they will join the protests. Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a former presidential candidate, has announced that members of his party will protest on courthouse steps across the nation. Morsy, in his latest presidential speech, announced that he had completed 75% of his promises in regards to security, traffic and garbage removal. A court ruling this month is expected to dissolve an assembly appointed to draft a new constitution. Islamic movements hold 80% of the seats, according to lawyer Sameh Ashour, a member of the assembly. ""If the court dissolves the assembly, then President Morsy will appoint the new team. I hope he does not please his Muslim Brotherhood supporters and remain fair for all sects -- women, Coptics and legal constitutional experts,"" Shaath said.

"(CNN) -- Zara married for love, against her family's wishes, more than a decade ago in the Middle East. Shortly after the marriage, she and her husband, along with their two children, moved to Britain for work. There, she says, her husband began to drink, heavily. He became violent, holding a knife to her throat, she says. ""He started raping me, which affected me mentally, lots of stress and the relationship between me and my sons. I couldn't speak out because I learned that to speak out against your husband to anyone outside, it is big shame."" ""So, I was struggling between eastern culture with what I learned and western culture where I should live freedom, equality, justice. I found it difficult."" She still finds it difficult. Zara is not her real name. She spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, saying she fears for her life. During her marriage, she says, the violence continued. She showed CNN police reports she eventually filed, but she decided not to pursue a case, and her husband was never charged. Roughly eight years into the marriage, she ran away and met another man. She decided to ask for a divorce. Opinion: Condemn the powerful elite over 'honor' murders . ""I told him I want a divorce. I don't want to cheat on you. The relationship is broken. I said, all I want is relationship with my sons."" She says her husband initially agreed but insisted they both go back to their home in the Middle East, to explain to their families. ""He gathered all his family in his house. And I was shocked to see 60 or 70 people at his house. His mother called me by very bad names. She called me a prostitute in front of my sons. ""I remember when my mother-in-law looked at my face and held my sons in her hands, big hands. She told me: 'My son is a doctor. You should hold your head up. Who are you to cheat on my son? Who are you?' ""After that, she told me: 'I will look after them, you don't deserve to be a mother. And my sons were looking at me.'"" Then, Zara says, her husband issued a death sentence, calling her father in the neighboring town, demanding she be killed for dishonoring her family -- an ""honor"" murder. ""He told my father, if you are a man, clean your shame. If you are a man, kill your daughter."" Her sister warned her not to return home, she says. But she called her father to hear his voice one last time. ""He told me: 'I miss you, I want to see you.' He didn't tell me what he heard from my husband [about ordering her death]. Because he knows I would run away. I was scared. He said 'come, I want to protect you.'"" Zara was ready to flee her home in the Middle East. But she decided to see her father one last time, even though she knew it might have been a trap. A part of her, she says, almost wished for death. ""I felt rubbish. Just rubbish! I wanted to die. I wanted to disappear because I didn't want my father, or my brother, or my cousin to kill me. My son will carry my shame. ""My father told my mother: 'The problem, I know, she didn't cheat on her husband. The problem is she brought us shame, shame that cannot even be cleaned by blood. I know she's innocent. But we can't clean this shame."" Faced with this impossible choice, Zara says her father realized he had no alternative. 'Honor' murderer boasts of triple killing . ""My father sent me away because he knew that I would be killed by my uncles or my cousins. There is no other option. He doesn't want to get rid of me. But he wants to get rid of shame ... that I brought my family because of my stupidity, to be honest with my husband that I love another man. That's my crime."" So Zara's father banished her from their home in the Middle East and sent her back to Britain. Meanwhile, Zara's husband filed for divorce in the Sharia court of the couple's hometown in the Middle East. This meant she was separated from her children, she says, without her knowledge or consent. Much of Zara's story is hard to verify with her former husband. CNN has seen court documents and her applications for asylum, but Zara's case workers with a British women's aid agency say we cannot ask her husband for a response, for fear it may trigger a violent reaction. Zara has not returned to the Middle East since leaving five years ago. When she left, her sister wrote to her imploring her never to return. ""It will be your grave,"" she wrote. Zara has now gained residency in Britain and has chosen to leave Islam, a decision that has cut her off from her children, who are now teenagers. When she last spoke to them, she says they told her they wanted no more contact with her. ""They don't want to hear my voice. It was very painful to hear that. I felt like I got divorced twice: From a husband and my sons. I'm not angry with them. I don't know. But I'm tired. I'm tired of culture and religion. I'm very tired to be a woman. I'm very tired to be a mother."" She is defiant when asked if she believes she will see her sons again. ""I gave birth to my sons and I am a mother. I will not give up my right as a mother. I will fight until the end. They will be proud of me and I will be proud of them. I am sure about this."" Zara says she does not hate her husband or her own relatives, even though she still fears they may kill her for bringing shame on the family. She sees them all as victims -- like her -- of a brutal, unrelenting tradition, one that leading Muslim thinkers insist has no place in Islam.

"(CNN) -- Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., the son of executed Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, spoke exclusively to CNN's Becky Anderson about Shell's $15.5 million payout to settle a lawsuit accusing the oil giant of complicity in the deaths of Saro-Wiwa and other activists. Following is a transcript of the interview. Saro-Wiwa said the settlement would allow the families of the victims to draw a line under the past. Q: What does this settlement mean to you and the other plaintiffs? A: Well, I think in the end it enables us to draw a line under the past and actually face the future with something tangible, some hope that this is the beginning of a better engagement between all the stakeholders in this issue. Q: Would your father have been pleased do you think? A: Yes, I think he was always a pragmatic kind of guy, someone who was always insistent that individuals should serve the collective at every point, and I think this is something that speaks to that. Q: Why did you settle? A: Because it offered the opportunity, as I said, to draw a line under the past so that we can move on with our lives and you have to remember there are 10 people involved in this plaintiff, all with varying experiences and aspirations. So we had to collectively agree what we wanted and engage with the terms and the offer on the table and it was exhaustively debated amongst ourselves, individually and collectively, and with our own attorney, so it was a very, very complicated and convoluted process and it didn't just happen overnight. It's been a long, long time. Q: According to many experts, environmental abuses continue in Nigeria. Do they? A: Yes, I think...  Look, there's a separate issue; this was a human rights violation case. Already Shell has admitted that there are environmental challenges there and it's committed to doing a study to ascertain what the damages are with a view to remediating the environmental problems there so already that issue has been addressed by a separate forum. But this case was purely about human rights violation. Q: Is this justice do you think for the Ogoni? A: Well, for the Ogonis, we were offered this and we felt that this represents some kind of restitution for what we've suffered but more critically I think also it offers a chance for us to face the future and the community to see that. We aren't speaking on behalf of the community, these are just 10 cases. Q: What does the future hold for the Ogoni people? You say you are not speaking on their behalf but certainly you must have a feeling for them going forward? A: Yes, I think we're part of that collective... but remember part of the settlement gives the bulk of the settlement to a trust and that trust is going to fund some particular initiatives which are going to be development initiatives decided by Ogoni people themselves. Some of the demands that we wanted in the early 90s in the Ogoni Bill of Rights such as using Ogoni resources for Ogoni development, I think some of the settlement speaks to some of that. Q: The fund will also, one assumes fund other civil cases? A: No it won't. It's very specific, the menu of things it can achieve, it seeks to do something very, very specific. Q: What are the broader implications do you think of this settlement for the oil industry and for multinationals in general, particularly in Nigeria but perhaps we should talk about Africa on a wider scale? A: It very clearly sets a precedent that corporations have to be very careful when they operate in places like Africa; this sets a precedent that you can be brought to trial in America for violations in Africa... It took 13 years to go through the legal process but clearly before we started this, corporations felt they can almost operate with impunity but now I think the legal landscape has changed. Q: But it did take nearly 13 years, consequently what sort of precedent does that really set at the end of the days? If people didn't have your effort, as it were to call on? A: Well, I mean law is always hard won, justice is always hard won. You know unfortunately we were the templates or the precedent if you like and one never knows what impact this will have in the boardroom but certainly the headline issue is that you can't operate with impunity; you can get caught and you will be taken to court and you will have to face a trial. Q: Why was it filed in New York? A: Because of the Aliens Tort Claims Act; it's an old piece of legislation which lawyers have been using to bring cases against human rights violations in foreign jurisdictions so there was that opportunity to use that Act because the corporations involved were incorporated in the U.S. and the provisions of ATCA as its called enables aliens to bring American corporations to trial for violations in foreign jurisdictions. Q: You are currently an advisor to the Nigerian government on international affairs. I'm assuming consequently you know the government and its ministers as well. How will they react to this case? A: I think a lot of them privately have been very supportive. They felt that this needs to be done and I think there's also the possibility this sends a message out to the wider Niger Delta that dialogue is important, that it's a way to achieve some of the things that you actually want individually and collectively and I think we need that because of course the messages that we're getting now are very grave messages. We don't want a situation where violence is rewarded and non-violence is punished. The Ogoni people have always prosecuted their struggle in a non-violent platform and we fervently believe that that's the way to go and the government is committed to dialogue and I think that's where we need to go; all the stakeholders have to come together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement to produce and it just can't be on the terms of the corporations.","Ken Saro-Wiwa's son says Shell payout will let families move on with lives .

"(CNN) -- Africa's growing economies should put jobs creation at the heart of their development policies, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow, Christine Lagarde said that youth unemployment is one of the biggest challenges facing Africa's countries. ""There is a vibrant youth that is expecting the leadership of those countries to actually open the economy so that they can actually express their talent and find ways to get integrated in the job market,"" she said. According to the IMF chief, a major re-engineering is currently taking place between the developed and developing world economies -- a number of African countries have enjoyed higher growth rates than Europe and the United States in recent times as many western nations remains mired in financial turmoil. ""Emerging markets are playing a role that is much bigger, much more important in terms of leadership than they did, say, 10, 15 years ago,"" she says. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: More than ever the Eurozone crisis has put it to African leaders that they have to look East. How significant is that? Christine Lagarde: All countries are interconnected. There is no question that a crisis in one particular part of the world is going to affect those countries, but also all of the countries, especially if there's a large volume of trade between those countries. Four reasons Africa is rising . When I look at South Africa, I know there is about 30% of trade going to Europe, so if something goes wrong in Europe it will have an effect on South Africa which is why any solution will require the cooperation of all players and I understand perfectly that South African authorities are concerned about the way the Europeans are dealing with their crisis and are trying to address solutions. CNN: Many people here have watched with fascination how Portugal has turned to Angola for some sort of financial help. Do you see this shifting perhaps the power relations on a global scale? CL: There is at the moment a major re-engineering between advanced economies, emerging markets, developing countries and clearly emerging markets are playing a role that is much bigger, much more important in terms of leadership than they did, say, 10, 15 years ago. So there is a re-organization happening as we speak, which is good in the main, because there were massive imbalances and those imbalances are not good for the global economy, but it is difficult and it's a transition phase that is complicated to deal with. CNN: Do African economies have a role to play that's positive? Is there something to be learned from African economies over this? CL: Well, first of all, the African continent in and of itself has had a growth rate that was significantly higher than that of Europe, than that of the United States, lower than some of the big emerging markets such as China, India or Brazil, but in the range of 6% lately. I think that's one reason to be optimistic about Africa. African growth? It's complicated . The second reason to be optimistic about Africa is that it holds significant commodities, raw materials that are so needed for the growth of other countries -- if you look at the volume of trade between, say, China and some African countries such as South Africa, or the volume of trade amongst African countries in terms of intra-regional trade, that is growing as well. So those are alternatives sources of growth that differ from the traditional trade links with, say, Europe and these are new opportunities for African countries to actually develop and strengthen. CNN: What are the warning signs and concerns about African economies? What are the critical issues for you? CL: The first message that I gave to both the Nigerian, the Niger and the South African authorities is to rebuild the buffers that had been used during the financial crisis wherever they could to have reserves available and be able to either use fiscal policy or monetary policy to make sure that growth is maintained and is sustainable. Africa's 2020 growth vision . The second message is make sure that the growth that you encourage, by whichever ways are available to you, it's a growth that is inclusive, that is creating jobs, because jobs are really at the heart of any development policies at the moment in South Africa, but in other countries as well. CNN: Easy to say that. CL: Yes, I know, but it's a question of identifying for each and every country, what are the impediments to job creation? What are the impediments to growth? And whether it's the infrastructure projects that need to be financed, that need to be developed, that need to be monitored, whether it's education and vocational training programs that need to be put in place. That is going to be different, whether you're in Nigeria, whether you're in South Africa, whether you're in Tunisia, but in all places there is a vibrant youth that is expecting the leadership of those countries to actually open the economy so that they can actually express their talent and find ways to get integrated in the job market.","Christine Lagarde is the head of the International Monetary Fund .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- As Zimbabwe battles a cholera epidemic that has already killed hundreds, one company thinks it may have found a potential solution to the world water crisis. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. Element Four, a small Canadian firm, has applied its water technology to create the WaterMill, a novel electricity-powered machine that draws moisture from the air and purifies it into clean drinkable water. The compact WaterMill, which goes on sale in the spring, is designed for household use. More crucially for countries such as Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Element Four is also working on another device, the WaterWall, which could potentially supply an entire village in the developing world. The team at Element Four shares an ambitious goal: to quench the world's growing thirst for water. Now the 10-person company is taking on a challenge that global multinationals have struggled to meet. Rick Howard, the CEO of the company, says it was at a U.N. conference on water in New York last summer that he realized just how revolutionary Element Four's technology might be. ""There we were on the same stage as GE, Dow Chemical and Siemens, and it was a complete shock to us when we heard the solutions they were offering. We realized we had something that could effect change,"" Howard tells CNN. The WaterMill draws in air through a filter and then cools it into water droplets. This water then passes through a special filter and is exposed to ultraviolet light, which rids it of bacteria. The product Element Four is designing for the developing world is called the WaterWall and is constructed by taking several of the water-making cells of the consumer appliance and hooking them up in series on a wall. The U.N., which has declared 2005-2015 the International Decade for Water, expects 1.8 billion people to live in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. It's no wonder then that Element Four is being closely watched by the tech world. The WaterMill is being displayed at the Wired Store in New York, a temporary store the magazine opens every holiday season that showcases the future of technology. About one in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, and shortages pose serious health problems for much of the developing world. Lack of clean water, coupled with poor sanitation practices, can lead to outbreaks of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, which in turn, can cause life-threatening forms of diarrhea. More than 500 people have died in Zimbabwe. Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of death from infectious diseases, and the majority of those deaths are among children under the age of 5, according to the WHO and UNICEF. Most of those deaths could be prevented if improvements to sanitation and drinking water were made. But can an invention like the WaterWall really help ease the world's water shortage and help prevent health disasters like the outbreak in Zimbabwe from occurring in the future? ""There are some brilliant inventions out there, but they are expensive and difficult to get hold of,"" says Paul Jawor, an emergency water and sanitation consultant with international aid organization Doctors Without Borders. The WaterMill retails for about $1,300, but Howard estimates that a pared down version -- without the bells and whistle -- for use in places like Africa would cost about $300. The biggest challenge of a product like the WaterWall, Howard says, is the power consumed by the water-making cells. To counter that, the product is designed to turn on in stages so it doesn't overload fragile power grids. In comparison to solutions like desalination, which can cost billions of dollars to develop, that's cheap. ""For about $300 we can start saving lives. Ours is a very scalable product,"" Howard says. But there are skeptics. Frank Lawson, an engineering adviser at international charity WaterAid, said the solution Element Four is devising wouldn't be appropriate for the charity's projects. For one, the technology doesn't work in very dry climates. The machine only functions at or above about 35 percent relative humidity levels. Furthermore, it requires an energy source. ""Our technologies have to be within the capacity of the benefiting community -- both technically and financially,"" Lawson says. WaterAid uses a number of low-cost and sustainable solutions, such as rainwater harvesting and hand-dug wells, to help communities in more than 17 countries access water. But those solutions depend upon the availability of water in the area, and fresh water supplies worldwide are feeling the squeeze from population growth, pollution and climate change. Howard admits the company needs to focus on growing its business first, so it may be some time before the Element Four's products make their way to the developing world. ""We quickly came to realize that if we didn't first build a business to perfect the product and application, then we weren't going to be able to get to a point where we could have a significant humanitarian impact,"" he says. But Howard and partner Jonathan Ritchey are in various stages of discussions with several humanitarian groups in the field. Howard declined to name the organizations. It's early, but the company's core principle is ""to do good as we do well,"" he says. ""That's part of truly what drives us -- knowing that at some point we will be able to do some significant good.""","Element Four has developed a machine that creates clean water out of air .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The commercial heart of Thailand's capital is still at risk of flooding, with the next 10 days likely to be crucial in the battle to keep dry. So far the Central Business District, or CBD, has been shielded by a series of flood defenses backed up by huge pumps which suck the floodwater seeping down from the north of the city into the canals. From here the water is funneled into the main Chao Phraya River, where officials say it then fans out toward the sea. Floods in Thailand have killed more than 500 people since July, affecting about a third of the nation's 77 provinces. The country of 67 million is also home to electronics manufacturing and automotive companies that have had to stop production because of the flooding, causing a ripple effect through the industry. According to Seri Supparathit, a water engineer who has acted as consultant for the government during the crisis, Bangkok's central business district will survive the watery onslaught as long as the pumps keep working. ""If we can maintain the system for the next 10 days, then we can keep the CBD free from floods,"" he said. ""But if the pumps break down, we could see more major flooding. We don't know the condition of the pumps."" Supparathit added that China and Japan have now provided pumps as well as valuable expertise. The pumping stations are the front line in this war against the filthy torrent. The giant pumps sit at the side of canals on the fringes of central Bangkok, acting as the boundaries between the dry land on one side and the flood-hit city on the other. The business . Aside from the huge volume of water, those manning the pumps 24 hours a day have their hands full clearing out huge amounts of debris floating into the system and threatening to clog it up. It's back-breaking work as city workers carry baskets full of foul-smelling rubbish to the convoy of trucks pulling up nearby. ""The system hasn't broken yet,"" said one of the workers optimistically when asked how the pumps were holding up. According to Bangkok's Irrigation Department, this year's devastating floods in northern Thailand created an estimated 14 billion cubic meters of run-off. The Bangkok Post quoted spokesman Boonsanong Suchatpong as saying about three billion cubic meters of this water is in the Chao Phraya River, with 3.5 billion cubic meters in the fields in the central provinces north of Bangkok. The rest, he said, has penetrated flood walls and inundated many parts of the capital -- with depths of up to three meters (9.8 feet) reported in northern districts, such as Rangsit and Lumlukka. But with about 400 million cubic meters of water being drained into the sea every day, the floodwater could be drained out of the capital in 11 days, he said. Despite this optimism, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is throwing up more flood barriers to protect the center of the city. A system of half-ton sandbags known as ""Big Bag"" dikes stretching 6 kilometers (3.72 miles) is almost complete along the main Rangsit Muang Ek road, which snakes out to the north of Bangkok. But Supparathit warned that some angry residents in the worst-hit areas of northern Bangkok have been destroying flood barriers because they feel their districts have been sacrificed to protect the CBD. ""Upstream the flood level is three meters, while further downstream it is less than 0.5 meters (1.6 feet),"" he explained. ""So the people upstream say this is unfair for them."" He said these people needed better information from the government. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Yingluk Shinawatra appealed for people to consider their actions. ""Please don't destroy the big-bag dike and other barriers,"" Yingluck wrote on her official Facebook page. ""Please think about the overall benefit so we can get through this problem together."" ""But what should we do?"" asked Romeo Romei, a factory owner from Rangsit. ""We are just left to deal with water that is going nowhere."" Many Bangkok residents opted to to defy government advice to evacuate and remained behind to protect their homes. As a result they are worried about tainted water, disease and sanitation, as massive piles of garbage stack up around them. Tide marks on the walls of many of their houses in this part of the city show that the water level has dropped only slightly in almost a month, which suggests the 11-day prediction for the floodwaters to drain out of Bangkok may be ambitious. ""It will take at least a month,"" said Supparathit of Thailand's worst floods in 50 years. But that of course depends on those mighty pumps.","A series of flood defenses are preventing flooding in Bangkok's central business district .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Militants continue to use a material not designed for use as a weapon against people to strike international forces in Afghanistan, the U.S.-coalition said Tuesday. U.S. mortars using white phosphorous target Taliban in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley, October 28, 2008. White phosphorus, a smoke-producing agent commonly used to hide military operations, can cause severe burns. Groups such as the Human Rights Watch and other watchdogs oppose its use in civilian areas. The coalition's assertions come on the heels of criticism of international military activities that affect civilians in Afghanistan and claims that coalition forces have used the chemical against people, a charge the United States denies. Militants on Tuesday ""mortared"" a NATO-led ""combat outpost with white phosphorus and high explosive rounds"" in Paktika province, the coalition said. No injuries and damage were reported. On Saturday, troops found white phosphorous mortar rounds in Bamiyan and a white phosphorus rocket in a military base in Nangarhar province. The U.S. military earlier this month declassified a report of 44 events in Afghanistan in which it said insurgents ""used or stockpiled"" munitions made of white phosphorus. ""The data, obtained from incident reporting from February 2003 through the present, show that insurgents have stockpiled and used white phosphorus against personnel in both indirect fire attacks as well as improvised explosive devices,"" the military said. The Taliban has alleged that U.S. forces used the chemical in fighting insurgents May 4 in Farah province and injured civilians, but that assertion has been denied by the U.S. military. ""We've checked our reports again, and no munitions containing white phosphorous were used by coalition forces in Farah,"" a senior official said. ""It is U.S. military policy to employ white phosphorous for illumination, marking targets or destroying buildings, but to abstain from using it against people.""","U.S.-coalition: Militants using white phosphorous against coalition in Afghanistan .

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement that a buildup of steam in certain Chinese-made Mr. Coffee Single Cup Brewing System models can force open the brewing chamber and spew the contents. Importer Sunbeam Products Inc., doing business as Jarden Consumer Solutions based in Boca Raton, Florida, said it had received 164 reports of the malfunction and claims of 61 burn-related injuries. The coffeemaker priced between $60 and $80 comes in black with silver, red or white trim. It is 11 inches tall and has a Brew Now/Off button and a removable drip tray. The consumer agency said the water tank is on top of the unit toward the back. The model number is printed on the bottom of the brewer. The coffeemaker was manufactured in China and sold from September 2010 through August 2012 nationwide at a number of stores including Bed Bath and Beyond, JC Penney, Kmart, Target and Walmart. Consumers who have the brewer should stop using it and contact Jarden Consumer Solutions for instructions on obtaining a free replacement. The models in the recall include: . BVMC-KG1 .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a classic ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, Christopher Walken plays a music producer with just one message for his bands: ""More cowbell! I gotta have more cowbell!"" Sometimes you wonder if Walken is producing this year's election, too. In Mitt Romney, the GOP has nominated its least ideological candidate since Richard Nixon. At every turn, the party has demanded, ""More ideology! I gotta have more ideology!"" With the selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Romney has now acceded to that wish. The least ideological Republican candidate since 1968 has committed himself to the most ideological Republican program since 1964. Democrats must be stunned. The first battle in every election is the battle to decide what the election is about. What's the question voters must answer? Romney's choice of Ryan energizes two sides . In 1992, for example, Republicans wanted the election to be about George H.W. Bush's steady leadership in a dangerous world: the end of the Cold War and victory in the Persian Gulf. Democrats countered, ""It's the economy, stupid!"" This year, an incumbent even more embattled than George H.W. Bush has his own preferred election theme. He doesn't want to debate his own record, which is pretty dismal. He wants to debate the record of the congressional Republicans elected in 2010, a bunch radically less popular even than the president himself. You'd imagine that Romney's job was to refuse the Democratic invitation, to choose his own ground for the election, and to keep his distance from the congressional GOP. You'd imagine, but you'd be wrong. Romney has instead chosen to bolt himself to the House Republicans. He has chosen as his running mate Paul Ryan, the House Republican leader -- not their formal leader, but their intellectual leader, the person who set their agenda. He has effectively adopted Paul Ryan's agenda as his own: big immediate cuts in spending, a dramatic cut in the top rate of income tax to 28% and a bold reform of Medicare for those 55 and under. Obama's message in 2012: ""Forget the economy. It's Medicare, stupid!"" The Romney-Ryan response? ""We agree. Medicare it is."" William Bennett: Why Paul Ryan? The Romney-Ryan team will tell you that fixing Medicare is crucial to their plans for economic growth. By assuring markets that Medicare costs will grow more slowly after 2023, a Medicare fix -- it's argued -- will ignite job creation in 2013. In the meantime, federal spending cuts and upper-income tax cuts will restore business confidence. Will voters accept this argument? Possibly, although relatively few economists will do so. Most economists would draw a distinction between the government's fiscal problems over the medium term and the economy's problems in the near term. The economy's near-term problems can be traced to the housing crisis. Americans assumed crushing levels of debt in the 2000s to buy expensive homes, homes they assumed would continue to rise in price forever. In 2007, household debt relative to income peaked at the highest level since 1928. (Uh oh.) When the housing market crashed, consumers were stranded with unsustainable debts, and until those debts are reduced, consumers will drastically cut back their spending. As consumers cut back, businesses lose revenue. As businesses lose revenue, they fire employees. As employees lose their jobs, their purchasing power is reduced. As purchasing power is lost throughout the economy, housing prices tumble again. Rinse and repeat. Opinion: Is Paul Ryan for or against Ayn Rand? Since 2008, the debt burden on households has declined somewhat, partly because of increased saving, mostly because of mortgage default. But household debts have declined nowhere near enough, and the pace of household debt reduction is slowing. The result: slow recovery of the private economy, weak consumer demand, paltry job growth -- considerably offset by continuing job shrinkage in the public sector. Paul Ryan's various plans and road maps contain many interesting elements for the reduction of government in the decades ahead. They do not respond to the most immediate and urgent problem: prolonged mass unemployment caused by heavy household debt. Why not? There's why the ideology makes itself felt. Conservatives ardently believe that big future deficits are the cause of today's unemployment. They feel it. They know it. And they don't want to hear different. When naysayers worry that the Romney campaign has over-indulged the ideology, the answer quickly comes: ""Well, Reagan was ideological in 1980 -- and he still won. Why can't Romney do the same, especially since the economy is even worse now than it was then?"" Opinion: Ryan will shift the campaign dynamic . Fair answer. Here's the difference: Although Ronald Reagan was a highly ideological candidate, he did not run a highly ideological campaign. Quite the contrary! Precisely because party conservatives trusted Reagan's ideological commitment, they allowed him space to move to the center. Seeking the GOP nomination in 1976, Reagan had pledged large immediate cuts in federal spending ($90 billion, at a time when that was a lot of money). In 1980, Reagan emphasized an easier-to-swallow message of tax cuts, not spending cuts -- and indeed promised that he'd protect the Medicare program he'd opposed when it was created in the mid-1960s. No such leeway for Mitt Romney. He has been constrained first to endorse Paul Ryan's budget plan (which he did in December 2011 after months of attempted evasion), to endorse a cut in the top rate of income tax to 28% (March 2012), and now finally to choose Ryan himself as his running mate. No leeway -- and now no exit. Conservatives exult that the GOP will now offer the country ""a choice, not a referendum."" That phrase does not make a lot of sense. (What is more of a choice than a referendum?) But there's good reason why conservatives say it. They are looking for a rephrasing of the slogan uppermost in their minds: ""a choice not an echo"" -- the title of the best-selling manifesto that helped persuade Republicans to follow Barry Goldwater to disaster. Opinion: Why Ryan pick won't help Romney . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Conservatives have pushed for a more ideological approach to the campaign .
He says that in Paul Ryan, conservatives get their wish but it may come back to haunt them .

"(CNN) -- Some of Britain's most influential former military figures are under investigation after allegedly boasting about their ability to secure arms contracts for private firms in violation of British law. The ""generals for hire"" scandal broke late Saturday following the publication of a Sunday Times investigation that used hidden cameras to capture the alleged claims by the men, all recently retired military officers. The Ministry of Defence moved quickly Sunday to distance itself from the alleged actions of the retired generals, saying an investigation was under way. ""Equipment is procured in the interests of our Armed Forces and not in the interests of retired personnel. Former military officers have no influence over what (ministry) contracts are awarded,"" said Philip Hammond, the defense secretary. In Britain, military personnel are required to wait two years after leaving the service before taking a job where their former position may give their employer or clients an advantage. The Sunday Times says its three-month investigation focused on ""the revolving door between the Ministry of Defence and private arms companies."" Among those named in the newspaper's investigation was recently retired Lt. Gen. Sir John Kiszely, a Falklands war hero and former head of the Defence Academy. Kiszely allegedly confided to a reporter posing as a representative of an arms firm that he could use his role as president of the Royal British Legion to push his clients' agenda with the prime minister and other senior officials. Another retired military official, Lt. Gen. Richard Applegate -- a former ministry procurement chief -- was captured on video allegedly describing a secret lobbying campaign in parliament on behalf of an Israeli arms company. Kiszely, Applegate and two other high-ranking former officers denied the claims, saying they did nothing wrong and always had the best interests of the services at heart, the newspaper reported. In a statement released following the publication of The Sunday Times investigation, the Ministry of Defence said it was ""looking to see if any of these individuals have broken any rules."" ""Former chiefs acting in a commercial capacity should not have any privileged access to the (ministry) and we will put in place measure to ensure this,"" it said. Journalist Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.","An undercover Sunday Times investigation secretly filmed retired military officials .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's impact on pop culture is indelible. But perhaps his biggest legacy will be how he changed the music industry. Jackson's impact on the music business still reverberates today. ""As a performer he changed history ... his singing, his songwriting, his choreography, his dancing, his business acumen,"" said Howard Bragman, a public relations expert who worked with Jackson to launch the singer's shoe line with L.A. Gear. ""He rewrote the history of the entertainment industry in his time,"" Bragman said. Jackson crossed color lines and broke down barriers between musical genres. He followed in the footsteps of Elvis and the Beatles to create a transnational fan base that prefigured the era of globalization. And Jackson became a canny power broker who helped lead artists from stage performers into major boardroom players. ""That gets lost in the last five and 10 years, with all the litigation battles -- what he did the first 30 years to set the landscape for these other artists,"" said James Walker, an entertainment attorney. ""Michael transcended race before Michael Jordan, before Oprah, before Tiger Woods, before Barack Obama. ""You can't underestimate what his did for black artists -- and artists as a whole -- as a business man,"" Walker added. His 1982 album ""Thriller"" has sold more than 50 million records worldwide -- a record that, considering the decline of record sales in the wake of new media, is likely to stand for some years to come. ""Records just don't sell that much anymore. The industry has changed. ... Now it's in shambles because of technology,"" said Gideon Yago, head of the IFC Media Project and a former correspondent for MTV News. Videos that accompanied the album became landmarks that set the industry standard, as MTV and cable television began to proliferate, creating ready outlets for a growing marketing tool. At the time, Jackson's label had to fight to get onto MTV, which then featured only rock artists. ""Walter Yetnikoff (former president of CBS records) drew a line in the sand and said, 'We believe in this guy and you're going to play his videos or we're going to pull all our videos,'"" Walker said. ""What he did was so cutting-edge regarding videos; he defined the video age as we know it,"" said Tommy Mottola, who succeeded Yetnikoff as head of CBS. Though his personal finances were in disarray at the end of his life, Jackson made some canny business decisions at the height of his power -- most notably buying half the Beatles music catalog in 1985 for $47.5 million. ""When you look at his royalties and his copyrights, he's probably got a half a billion to a billion (dollar) catalogue,"" Walker added. The current value of his estate is unclear. His debts stood at about $500 million, according to a Wall Street Journal story earlier this month. As the music industry model moved more toward live events in the face of dwindling album sales, two billionaire businessmen stepped in to bank on Jackson's comeback with a series of concerts scheduled in London. Tom Barrack, head of hedge fund Colony Capital, teamed with Philip Anschutz, owner of AEG Live, to plan a third-act comeback for Jackson, with a sold-out 50-date stand at AEG Live's O2 arena scheduled to begin next month. Future business plans included a world tour, a Broadway musical and even a ""Thriller"" casino. ""You are talking about a guy who could make $500 million a year if he puts his mind to it,"" Barrack told The Los Angeles Times in an article last month. ""There are very few individual artists who are multibillion-dollar businesses. And he is one."" Billboard magazine estimates $85 million in ticket sales from the sold-out concert series. Additional packages, merchandise and secondary market sales could have raised the total to $115 million. AEG Live declined to comment. ""There will be a process put in place for ticketing (refunds). I don't know what it is at the moment,"" said Lucy Ellison, spokeswoman for O2 stadium. ""We'll leave it for his family to say what they want to say before we discuss ticketing information."" Jackson was expected to earn $50 million from the London shows. CNN's Pauline Chiou contributed to this report .","Jackson transformed the role of artists as power brokers .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is responding well to treatment for bipolar depression, the Mayo Clinic said Monday. The Rochester, Minn.-based clinic said Jackson is regaining his strength but offered no further information on his condition. In early July, the congressman's office announced he was ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder."" A few weeks later, his office said he was undergoing an ""extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues"" at the Mayo Clinic. Jackson's wife, Sandi, said earlier this month her husband had ""good days and bad days"" and doctors were increasing his depression medication to ""therapeutic levels."" Wife: Rep. Jackson still 'very depressed' The Illinois Democrat and son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May. Jackson and his family have not said much about his ordeal, though his father told The Huffington Post that when he visited his son in Washington in June, he learned the junior Jackson hadn't slept in three days. What the family thought was exhaustion, the Rev. Jackson said, was ""something much deeper, much broader, and it lasted much longer."" Sandi Jackson has firmly denied her husband had attempted suicide or was receiving help for alcohol or drug addiction. She said earlier this month it was unclear when he might return to work -- including whether he would be at the Democratic National Convention in early September. What is bipolar II disorder? Jackson's illness comes as the House Ethics Committee is examining allegations that in 2008, he or one of his associates offered to raise money for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson being appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he was elected president. The congressman has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. Blagojevich was convicted last year on corruption charges in connection with his efforts to profit from appointing the successor to the Senate seat. He began serving a 14-year sentence in March. Bipolar disorder is a treatable condition that affects parts of the brain controlling emotion, thought and drive, the Mayo Clinic says. Many Americans suffer from it, and it is most likely caused by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors, it says. Medical experts are still weighing whether gastric bypass surgery that Jackson underwent in 2004 for weight loss might have helped trigger his depression, his wife said. The Mayo Clinic said that type of surgery is increasingly common in the United States and can change how the body absorbs food, vitamins, nutrients and medications.

"(CNN) -- Australia's national intelligence agency acknowledged Friday that its public website may have encountered problems after hackers said they had subjected it to a sustained campaign of cyber attacks. The Australian Security Intelligence Organization ""is aware that there may have been some technical issues with its public website,"" a spokesman for the organization said. But the site ""does not host any classified information and any disruption would not represent a risk to ASIO's business,"" the spokesman added, using the agency's abbreviated name. The hackers, who appeared to have links to the loose collective Anonymous, said they had been launching attacks on the ASIO site and those of other Australian government agencies over the past few days, according to Twitter accounts under the names Anonymous Australia and OperationAustralia. The ASIO site ""has been down for some time now, And will be for the rest of the day!"" OperationAustralia tweeted Friday morning, Sydney time. The site appeared to be functioning normally about seven hours later. The OperationAustralia account, which uses the Twitter handle @Op_Australia and has about 400 followers, suggested the attacks were motivated by controversial proposals by the Australian authorities to have Internet users' web histories stored. In recent years, Anonymous has been involved in some of the most high-profile cyberattacks on the Web -- hobbling the websites of governments and businesses, hacking into sites to reveal private data and, along the way, getting dubbed cyberterrorists by the authorities in the United States and elsewhere. The network's motto is ""We are Legion,"" and it describes itself as ""a decentralized network of individuals focused on promoting access to information, free speech, and transparency.""

"Brain scans may identify which patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, are likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease, and who will probably not develop the disease, according to a new study. The findings, published in April 2009 issue of the journal Radiology, could help in developing new drugs for Alzheimer's. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, about 3.5 million have mild cognitive impairment. What did the brain scans show? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: This was a small but significant study in the fact that it may lead researchers to determine who will develop Alzheimer's disease and who may not. I had a chance to view the brain scans used in this study and they were truly fascinating. The images of patients with Alzheimer's showed many areas throughout the brain where the cells and tissue have begun to deteriorate or have already died. We know Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease and when the cells die, patients begin to experience loss of cognitive function. Although all the patients with MCI experienced mild memory problems, not affecting their daily life, inside their brains looked very different. One group looked very similar to the brain of the Alzheimer's patients. The other MCI group showed very little cell damage. What does this mean for patients with MCI? Gupta: What this tells us is no two patients with MCI are the same. And some may progress to an Alzheimer's diagnosis in less that a year. These researchers looked at follow-up imaging a year later and found 30 percent of the group whose brains showed signs of cell loss were now Alzheimer's patients. This is a potential clue in trying to figure out who is most likely to develop Alzheimer's later on in life. Not ready for prime time yet, in terms of patients having access to these scan results, but it could be available a few years from now. Is there anything people can do as they age to keep their brain strong? Gupta: Yes, various cognitive exercises and memory activities can help keep your brain healthy and maintain cell production. But there isn't a lot of evidence showing that it can somehow reverse the effects of cell loss after getting an Alzheimer's diagnosis. What I found even more interesting, is something I started to incorporate into my own life: simple physical exercise. I am not talking about necessarily strenuous exercise, but simple, regular daily activity. Studies show it has a way of fueling your brain and even ward off Alzheimer's. I would say cognitive and physical activity is your best bet for now.","Key structural changes seen in brain scans of some patients with memory loss .
One year later, many patients with brain changes had developed Alzheimer's .
Memory-loss patients without these changes were mostly stable one year later .
Brain scans could identify who gets Alzheimer's, help with drug testing .
The bottom line: The average person can't run out and get an MRI that shows if they're on the road to Alzheimer's just yet. But these findings could help drugmakers as well as patients in the future."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The MTV Video Music Awards competed with Vice President Joe Biden's convention speech Thursday night, offering Olympic gold medal gymnast Gabby Douglas doing flips and rapper Lil' Wayne stage diving. MTV moved the East Coast broadcast of the Los Angeles show up an hour when programmers realized they would be up against President Barack Obama's acceptance speech unless they ended the two-hour show by 10 p.m. One Direction claimed the most screen time, winning three ""Moon Man"" trophies and performing their pop hit ""One Thing"" in the show. The UK boy band won for best new artist, best pop video and the ""most shareworthy"" video. The 2012 version of MTV's big show passed without a major faux pas, such as happened three years ago when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance of the best female video award to say it should have gone to Beyonce. Who were the big winners? Beyonce lost again, this time to Nicki Minaj for her ""Starships"" video, but Kanye was not in the house to object this year, choosing to be in New York with girlfriend Kim Kardashian instead. Rihanna, who also lost to Minaj, took the night's biggest honor later in the show, winning video of the year for ""We Found Love."" Rihanna opened the show performing a ""Cockiness/We Found Love"" medley with A$AP Rocky. While Swift was left out of the trophy handouts, she did close the show by dancing and singing ""We Are Never Getting Back Together,"" and ending with a stage dive into the crowd. Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown looked all business in a dress suit as he took the stage to accept the best male video award for ""Turn Up The Music."" In winning, he beat hip hop rival Drake, who was also on the other side of an infamous bar fight earlier this year. Host Kevin Hart joked about the Brown-Drake nightclub clash, telling both artists ""Nip it in the bud, guys. I'm tired of it. Fix it tonight."" Drake got his own ""Moon Man"" statue when his ""HYFR"" won for best hip hop video. That video ""is about being me being black and Jewish,"" Drake said in his acceptance. It was dedicated ""to any kid that's ever had a long walk home by yourself."" Drake's recording partners 2 Chainz and Lil' Wayne got the Staples Center crowd on their feet with a rap performance that the television audience did not get to completely hear. The censor cut frequent expletives in their lyrics, leaving viewers to hear a song punctuated with frequent silent gaps. Lil' Wayne, who entered on a skateboard, ended with a dive off the stage. In contrast, singer Frank Ocean delivered the most subtle performance of the night with a rendition of his ""Thinkin' About You."" Other performances included P!nk doing aerial acrobatics as she sang and Green Day, who set a record for the most VMA performances with ""Let Yourself Go."" The ""Fierce Five"" U.S. women's gymnastics team took the stage to introduce Alicia Keys, who performed her newest song, ""Girl On Fire,"" with Minaj. Gold medalist Gabby Douglas did flips while Keys sang. MTV gave the Twilight film franchise cast -- minus Kristen Stewart -- the stage to introduce a 90-second clip from ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" As the show ended -- and presumably as most viewers prepared to change channels to see Obama's speech -- Hart put in a plug for them to take the time to vote in the election. ""It's in our hands,"" Hart said. Who had the best performance? CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.","One Direction claims three ""Moon Man"" trophies and performs ""One Thing""

"London (CNN) -- Jasvinder Sanghera was eight years old when she was promised in marriage to a man she had never met. When, six years later, her mother showed Sanghera a photograph of her intended husband, the 14-year-old reacted with horror. The pressure on the youngster mounted as Sanghera's Indian-born mother tried to involve her in the wedding arrangements. When she refused to marry the man, saying she wanted to finish her education in her hometown of Derby, in the English Midlands, her family held her prisoner in her bedroom until she relented, she said. ""In the end I said yes, but started to plan my escape,"" Sanghera, one of seven sisters, recalled. Her parents released her, and she promptly ran away from home. She was just 15 years old. ""My mother told me I couldn't come back until I agreed (to the marriage) or I was dead in their eyes. My family disowned me to this day. ""I'd shamed them and dishonored them. I don't talk to any of them any more. It's been 29 years since then."" When Sanghera left, her younger sister had to marry the man to whom she had been promised. ""That was the only way [my parents] had to save honor, in their eyes,"" she told CNN. Her parents, who have subsequently died, also forced her other sisters to enter into arranged marriages, she said. ""As a young person growing up in Britain, going to their houses, you'd see horrific stories of them being beaten and abused,"" she said. ""Yet my mother's response was to tell them to stay there because it was their duty to make the marriage work for the sake of our honor."" Sanghera wept as she recalled the fate of one of her sisters, whom she said was beaten by her husband. ""She went to my family, for help. But at the age of 24 she set herself on fire and committed suicide. CNN's attempts to locate the husband to seek comment have been unsuccessful. ""Her death was a time for me where I recognized just how important honor is to a family."" Sanghera added that for her parents, ""losing a daughter in such a horrific way"" had dishonored them. Sanghera now uses her experience to campaign in British schools against arranged marriages and so-called ""honor"" crimes, and has set up a network for victims, called Karma Nirvana. The charity, which is partly funded by the British government, takes 500 calls a month from both men and women who have concerns. Sanghera described the different kinds of people who ring: ""Typical calls include a teacher having to deal with an eight-year-old girl saying I'm going to Pakistan to get married. Our call handlers are trained to handle this. ""Many professionals are trained to be culturally sensitive in Britain, but this means we have to help them overcome their fears of being called a racist, because that is what perpetrators will use to get them to turn a blind eye."" The issue of killing people to preserve a family's honor was brought to wider attention earlier this year when three members of a family of Afghan immigrants were convicted in Canada for the killing of four relatives. The defendants were sentenced to life in prison. Two of them admitted during their trial they were angry about the victims' western attitudes. Experts say the case has lifted the lid on just how common so-called ""honor"" murders are around the world, and in places some would not suspect. ""It's definitely a problem that happens in many different places: the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and among immigrant communities in North America,"" said Nadya Khalife, a researcher on women's rights in the Arab world for Human Rights Watch. Several Arab countries and territories, including Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, have laws providing lesser sentences for so-called ""honor"" murders than for other murders, Human Rights Watch says. Egypt and Jordan also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for ""honor"" crimes, the group says. Reliable figures of the number of honor murders are hard to come by, Khalife said, but she pointed to a United Nations Population Fund estimate of 5,000 per year. The triggers for an ""honor"" crime can be varied. ""It can be anything that you take for granted, such as being a normal adolescent teenager or being a bit rebellious,"" Sanghera said. ""That can be having your nose pierced, dyeing your hair pink, having a mobile phone, going on social networks -- these are the things that can be perceived as being dishonorable to a family that operates an ""honor"" system. ""They are the things that can put a victim at risk of a forced marriage, 'honor abuse' or even murder. I've seen cases where girls have been murdered for passing their driving test, having aspirations after school, for being seen kissing a boy at a Tube station, asking for divorce. These are all triggers."" Experts say the practice should not be blamed on Islam. ""It's not linked to religion; it's more cultural,"" said Khalife. ""There have been several Islamic scholars who have issued fatwas against 'honor killing.'"" Islam doesn't justify 'honor murders,' experts insist . Sanghera agreed, but said South Asian communities in Britain needed to do more. ""No religion, be it Islam or Sikhism supports this. In fact they support what I'm saying, but those religious leaders don't say that. ""I'm not trying to embarrass those communities, but they should be ashamed because it is happening and they're not taking a stand."" CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Jasvinder Sanghera ran away from home aged 15 to escape arranged marriage .

"(CNN) -- An ax murder. Then, jail time. Sounds like a morbid crime story. Yet this tale has taken a sudden and unexpected twist: The killer got a pardon and a hero's welcome. That has stirred fears of a war. The parole has exacerbated long-standing tensions over disputed land between Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics that are nestled in the Caucasus region near Turkey, Iran and Russia. The nations fought a war two decades ago over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azerbaijani territories. Much of the area is now occupied by Armenia. A return to warfare could suck in world powers, analysts warned Wednesday. Thomas de Waal, an expert on the Caucasus with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN world energy markets would be disrupted in a conflict since an oil and a gas pipeline carrying Caspian oil curves around the conflict zone in Azerbaijan. Mosque shooting, suicide bombing hit Russia's Caucasus region . The ax killing happened in 2004 at a NATO center in Hungary, where troops from Armenia and Azerbaijan were getting training. Ramil Safarov, a soldier from Azerbaijan, killed Armenian officer Gurgen Margarian. Both men were studying English. Safarov was sentenced to life in prison in Hungary, but that country recently extradited him to Azerbaijan with the understanding that he would serve at least 25 years of the sentence. Not long after Safarov arrived in Azerbaijan, though, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev pardoned him. Armenians recoiled at what happened next: The killer got an apartment and a promotion. ""Mr. Safarov has been glorified in Azerbaijan as a national hero at all levels -- including the top level,"" said Zohrab Mnatsakanian, Armenia's deputy minister of Foreign Affairs. ""This is a blow to the conscience of Europe, to the civilized world."" Azerbaijan's Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Twitter that the ""issue must be considered in the context of aggression and ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijan by Armenia."" The United States, meanwhile, was among those nations objecting to the pardon. It expressed ""deep concern"" and asked Hungary for more information on why it extradited Safarov. ""We are communicating to Azerbaijani authorities our disappointment about the decision to pardon Safarov,"" a spokesman for the National Security Council, Tommy Vietor, said in a statement the White House released. ""This action is contrary to ongoing efforts to reduce regional tensions and promote reconciliation."" Sabine Freizer, director of the International Crisis Group's Europe program, said world powers have taken note. ""There is an awareness among government officials, both in the United States, Russia, and among European officials, that this conflict is getting worse. There should be something done to stop it,"" Freizer said. ""This takes us a whole step downward,"" said the Carnegie Endowment's de Waal. The tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh reflect strong cultural attachments for both peoples, what Sergey Markedonov, visiting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, likens to a ""Jerusalem for both societies."" Animosities over the disputed territory have simmered since the end of World War I. The Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s triggered a war from 1992 to 1994 that killed 22,000 to 25,000 people and uprooted more than a million others. The war ended ""with a shaky truce,"" the International Crisis Group said. The disputes between the countries over Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories remain an ""unresolved conflict of the Soviet period,"" Freizer said. Amid the creation of newly independent countries after the Soviet collapse, she said, ""no one was focused on the conflict."" ""The kind of support for Yugoslavia,"" whose breakup led to major wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, was ""never given to this region."" Over the years, violence has flared. Both countries occasionally talk tough about each other. And Azerbaijan's oil and gas wealth is making its way into the budget for a military preparing for war, Freizer said. ""Since 2011, we feel the situation has gotten worse,"" Freizer said. The killer's pardon prompted a certain outrage factor, she said. ""People were shocked by this."" Hungary defended its extradition and said it received assurances the killer would carry out his term. But the country criticized the ""sudden and unexpected release"" and called it ""unacceptable."" Armenia suspended its relations with Hungary. The disputes are unfolding in a tough neighborhood. Turkey has been mired down in fighting with Kurdish rebels. Russia fought a brief war with Georgia four years ago and has battled Islamic insurgents in its northern Caucasus region in recent years. Iran supports Syria's government in its civil war. ""Russia is a military ally of Armenia. Azerbaijan has strong military links with Turkey and they (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are both on the border with Iran,"" de Waal said. Also, he said, the Armenian-American community ""will beat the drum"" and push for U.S. action. Markedonov said a deteriorating conflict could spawn an arms race. The incident reflects a lack of willingness among many citizens to compromise and get back to peacemaking, Markedonov said. This could play into upcoming elections, with both Aliyev and Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan seeking to look strong for the voters. De Waal also wrote in a column that the BBC published Tuesday that Hungary negotiated the extradition ""for reasons that have yet to be fully explained."" He called the events a ""black week"" for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and said it's ""now a full-blown state-to-state row, with as yet knowable consequences."" He cites worries that ""a fanatical Armenian will try to commit a revenge attack."" ""From the political perspective, to call the Azerbaijani government's actions a mistake is an understatement. It is a worrying indication of the quality of advice that President Ilham Aliyev is receiving from his inner circle."" De Waal said diplomats must work harder now. When there is no peace process, he told CNN, ""the vacuum is filled by war talk."" ""If there is any silver lining to this dark episode it could be that the international community pays more attention to the dangers of a new Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh,"" de Waal wrote in his column.

"(CNN) -- ""Alien oceans could be detected by telescope,"" headlines a Web report about an article in The Astrophysical Journal Letters by Tyler Robinson and colleagues at NASA. The report projects that the $6.5 billion James Webb Space Telescope will be capable of such an impressive feat when it is launched some time after 2014 as a more powerful successor to the venerable Hubble Space Telescope. I will be the first to admit that I have been awed by the images of our universe that Hubble has provided over the past two decades, and by the mind-bending scientific discoveries that have ensued. But when it comes to observing our own oceans, we spend only a small fraction of what is allotted to the astronomy community. Why? Our Earth is running a slight fever from inhaling excessive amounts of carbon dioxide for the past few centuries, and the oceans are the largest reservoir for absorbing all this excess CO2. But at present, we have very limited ability to monitor the health of our patient, understand the impacts all this carbon dioxide will have on its chemistry and its inhabitants, and predict the future course of the ""infection."" The ocean needs a global monitoring network to provide real-time information to climatologists, as well as to oceanographers, who worry about the consequences of all this additional carbon for the health of the ocean's chemistry and biology. The Earth needs a Hubble for its oceans. The National Science Foundation has taken an encouraging step in this direction by funding the new Ocean Observatories Initiative through the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. This initiative will comprise an array of deep-sea moorings outfitted with sensors, along with seafloor cables, gliders and autonomous underwater vehicles. These devices will measure and transmit real-time information not only on basic properties such as temperature, salinity and current flow, but on biological, chemical and geophysical properties as well. The project shares many similarities with Hubble. Both must operate in remote, extreme environments -- vacuum and extremes of temperature and radiation in space, compared with crushing pressures and highly corrosive seawater in the cold, dark depths of the sea. Hubble must be able to point accurately and hold position with gyroscopes for lengthy exposures, while the ocean project's moorings must be capable of positioning a wide range of sensors and samplers at precise depths in a water column that is often miles deep, and in the face of currents and surface waves. Both require complex communications networks and control centers to monitor the instruments and direct operations while collecting and analyzing the torrent of data. Both are long-term observatories expected to operate for decades, and both require servicing missions to replace and upgrade damaged or depleted components. But there is one important difference. While the Hubble and its planned successors like the Webb are endowed with billions of dollars, the Ocean Observatories Initiative began its initial construction in September 2009 with $106 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and has an overall construction budget of only about $387 million. Because of this comparatively low level of funding, the project is limited in initial scope and will be blind to critical features of the ocean environment that will be essential to our ability to track the flow of carbon and its confinement in deep waters. It is essential that we more accurately measure the ocean's primary productivity -- the consumption of CO2 by microscopic phytoplankton that use it to create oxygen and energy. This process drives the ocean food chain upon which billions of us ultimately depend for significant portions of the protein in our diets. We further need to understand the composition and dynamics of this community of phytoplankton and the animal forms of plankton that feed upon them, as well as the complex ocean chemistry surrounding them. Given the current realities of oceanographic budgets for projects of this size, however, one can anticipate squabbling over priorities and scarce dollars. But the community instead should be galvanized to champion the need for a century of ocean observation -- deploying the truly global array of sensors that will be necessary for our comprehensive understanding of carbon flow in the oceans. Our Hubble for the sea needs a budget commensurate with the importance of its mission. And I, for one, would gladly wait a bit longer to learn of oceans on distant planets in return for the ability to see our own precious seas with the clarity and detail that will be required to insure the continued existence of life on this planet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Ulmer.","Kevin Ulmer: Billions are being spent for space telescopes that explore the universe .

"(CNN) -- All eyes were on the opposition candidate as word of the election results spread. After tireless campaigning and vows of victory, what would he say to throngs of fired-up supporters? Would he snap, after months of keeping his cool as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez sprinkled speeches with insults aimed at him? On the night after the election, Henrique Capriles Radonski was quick to concede after official results revealed he had lost by more than 10 percentage points. New Venezuelan VP seen as possible successor to Chavez . ""To know how to win, you also must know how to lose,"" Capriles said. ""The word of the people is sacred."" His words, analysts say, reveal a strategy that could play a key role in how Venezuela's opposition evolves. ""It was very magnanimous and, I think, very constructive,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""I think that's a real model for Venezuela and for other countries."" After any vote, the way the losing candidate responds can have an impact far beyond Election Day, said Barbara Kellerman, a lecturer on leadership at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ""This is much more about the future than it is about the present,"" she said. 'The country is not waiting for my insults' On the campaign trail before masses of supporters, and in state television interviews broadcast nationwide, Chavez described Capriles as a ""dirty swine"" and a ""fly"" who was not worth chasing. He called him a ""little Yankee"" and assailed him as a member of the bourgeoisie. ""He never acknowledged his name, just talked about the rich kid, and taunted him, as Chavez tends to do,"" Shifter said. ""Capriles defended himself. But there wasn't the rhetorical back and forth, the tit for tat."" From the outset, Capriles said he wanted to take a different tone. ""They insult me, hey, I am not going to respond with an insult. The country is not waiting for my insults. The country expects my commitment,"" he said in a February interview with the Televen network. ""The country expects me to offer them a future."" Going head to head with Chavez was a tactic opposition politicians had unsuccessfully tried in the past, Shifter said. Chavez slams Venezuelan opposition after election victory . ""He's such a master at it. If you start to criticize him, then he'll come back with more,"" Shifter said. ""He's demonstrated over 14 years that he plays this game better than anybody ... (and) he emerges stronger than ever."" Chavez still triumphed in Sunday's vote, Shifter said, but Capriles -- with more than 45% of votes -- came closer than any past presidential election opponent has come to defeating Chavez. ""It obviously resonated with over 6 million Venezuelans,"" Shifter said. The opposition candidate was quick to reassure his supporters and stressed that he did not believe there was fraud at the polls. He compared the election to the way diehard fans feel when Venezuela's national soccer team loses. They are devastated, he said, but they don't stop going to the stadium. ""Look, I am on my feet. I got up, as I am sure the great majority of Venezuelans got up today. You have to learn from every process. You have to reflect always on every contest,"" he said Tuesday. ""This path that we started to build together, this path continues, not against anyone but in favor of a better future."" Maintaining a unified front may prove difficult for the opposition coalition that backed Capriles, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Latin American history professor at Pomona College in California. ""The one thing that brought them together was the figure of Chavez,"" he said. Stephen Johnson, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Capriles' reaction after Sunday's vote may help the opposition stick together. ""Conceding quickly and doing so in an honorable way is helpful in maintaining civility on the opposition side,"" Johnson said, ""and also in moving beyond the elections."" A different approach . You don't have to look far, Shifter said, to see an example of an opposition candidate who took a different approach. After official results indicated he narrowly lost to Felipe Calderon in Mexico's 2006 presidential election, leftist presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accused authorities of fraud and never conceded. In the years that followed, Lopez Obrador referred to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico"" and continued campaigning around the country. His supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. Memories of the upheaval stuck with many Mexicans. This year, when Lopez Obrador was once again a candidate, it didn't play well at the polls, Shifter said. ""It didn't really help his image very much nationally. I think he may have done a lot better this time. I don't know whether he would have won,"" Shifter said, ""but I think people remembered the way he acted in 2006, and that was a real liability for him."" This year, election officials have repeatedly ruled that Enrique Pena Nieto won July's presidential vote. Lopez Obrador has not conceded. Looking toward the future . That's not the norm, Kellerman said. ""The democratic tradition is to concede defeat graciously, so that whatever your future ... you are seen as a grown-up person who can accept this in the gracious spirit of an adult democracy,"" she said. In the United States, for example, candidates often bounce back after an election loss, she said. ""We have a real tradition of people who've been defeated once coming back to win the next time over,"" she said, noting that Capriles could have a similar comeback in mind. Kellerman, who analyzes global leadership trends on her blog, ""Lame Leaders/Fed Up Followers,"" described Chavez as a ""bully"" and said a nation's people tire of such tactics over time. ""Eventually, the temper of the times is such that it's moving toward relatively greater levels of democracy and civility,"" Kellerman said, ""and relatively lower levels of autocracy and bullying."" Shifter said Capriles' post-election comments struck a ""perfect pitch."" Venezuela's political landscape will inevitably change at some point, he said. ""Chavez is not going to last forever, and the concern is always that given the tremendous polarization in the country, and tremendous rancor, there's always the potential you can't rule out for some instability and some violence,"" he said. ""The discourse that Capriles used during the campaign, but especially after he lost, is very helpful to reduce those tensions and to point to a path of reconciliation, which is what the country will need to heal."" Even with the election results in, political uncertainty remains in Venezuela, with questions about Chavez's health lingering. Over the past year, the 58-year-old leader has been visibly weakened by cancer surgeries and treatment. He has kept secret the kind of cancer he has and his prognosis. In May, speculation intensified over who would succeed Chavez when he named 10 people to the highest circle of his advisers. But in July, he said he was cancer free. Since Sunday's vote, he has pledged to push forward with his socialist reforms in his next six-year term and ""be a better president every day."" That hasn't stopped speculation that the situation could be more dire than the president lets on. ""Who knows how long it will be before the next presidential election, given the president's current health?"" Johnson said. No matter when the next election is, Johnson said that ""going forward, it remains to be seen"" whether Capriles will be able to win more support and maintain the opposition's momentum. On Thursday, CNN affiliate Globovision reported that the opposition candidate filed paperwork to run in December's election for governor in the state of Miranda -- a post he held until February, when he resigned to run for president. He will face former Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua, who has been a key member of Chavez's inner circle. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Henrique Capriles Radonski conceded quickly after Venezuela's election .

"(CNN) -- Apple CEO Tim Cook had to apologize for the buggy new Maps app in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 on Friday, saying that his company ""fell short"" of making a ""world-class product."" It was a gracious and humble admission of a major mistake -- a sign that Apple takes its customers seriously and conducts itself with integrity. ""We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused,"" Cook said in a letter posted on the company's website. ""We are doing everything we can to make Maps better."" That relentless focus on treating customers right is why Apple has been the undisputed leader of the technology business for the past decade. But while the apology is commendable, the maps mistake was entirely Apple's fault. Previous versions of the iPhone and iOS used Google Maps, which are the industry standard. No one was complaining about Google Maps. Sure, they're not perfect, but we're all used to their errors and gaps. But Apple broke its contract to use Google Maps a year earlier than expected because of corporate politics. Google is a competitor, and Apple wanted to break ties and control its own maps. That's an extra year in which Apple could have improved its own maps â€” an extra year which was apparently sorely needed. Opinion: Maps app is not the only Apple misstep . The timing of the move surprised even Google, which is scrambling to build its own maps app for the iPhone and iPad. It reportedly won't be ready until the end of the year. Until then, Apple is stuck telling unhappy customers that they can visit Google Maps in the iPhone's Web browser or download other map apps like MapQuest or Bing. Needless to say, it's more than a little strange for Apple to suggest customers to try a Microsoft product. To be fair, Apple's new maps add important features Google wasn't willing to share. The iPhone 5 has built-in, turn-by-turn directions, and the maps are faster and prettier. But for most people, the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits. What good is voice navigation if it gets you lost? Who cares if the 3-D map is prettier when it thinks the Brooklyn Bridge has been demolished and the Statue of Liberty destroyed? These aren't questions anyone is used to asking about Apple products, because Apple doesn't usually ship broken products. Apple's failures are magnified by the company's track record of perfectionism â€” perfectionism that comes from putting customers first. Apple CEO: ""We are extremely sorry"" for Maps frustration . It's understandable why Apple felt it needed to switch away from Google. Being dependent on a competitor isn't great for any company. Apple likes to control its own destiny. Cook has said the company needs to ""own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make."" Maps are without question a critical feature for smartphones and tablets, and it makes sense for Apple to build its own. But it doesn't make sense to switch away from Google before Apple's own product is ready, and it's doubtful iPhone 5 sales would have been even slightly affected because the Google Maps app on Android is slightly better. Now it's fair to wonder if potential upgraders and switchers aren't holding back because they don't want to be forced into using inferior maps. Google: No plans 'yet' for iOS 6 mapping app . Apple deserves praise for being forthright and direct in its apology, but no company wants to be praised for its apologies. It's more important for Apple to understand its mistake and try to prevent it from happening again. Apple is the most valuable company in the world because it has always fought battles for the consumer, not for the company. But in its race to win a corporate victory over Google, Apple seems to have gotten a little bit lost. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nilay Patel.","Apple CEO Tim Cook had to apologize for new Maps app on iPhone 5 and iOS 6 .

"(CNN) -- The chief of staff to the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement resigned Saturday amid allegations that she helped create a culture of sexual discrimination against men. Suzanne Barr, chief of staff for ICE Director John Morton, voluntarily stepped down last month and had been on paid leave. In a letter to Morton, obtained by CNN, Barr called the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit"" and said she was confident her reputation would be restored. ""In recent weeks, I have been the focus of unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation, but of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,"" she wrote. ""As such, I feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work."" ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Morton has received Barr's resignation. ""We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors,"" he said. The move comes on the heels of a job discrimination lawsuit filed by the head of the ICE office in New York against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. In the suit, New York ICE chief James Hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women, some of whom used to work for Napolitano when she was governor of Arizona. As part of his lawsuit, Hayes cites behavior by Barr in an attempt to prove an alleged culture of sexual discrimination against men, according to Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Maryland. Hayes said Barr ""created a frat house-type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees."" When the lawsuit was filed, ICE spokesman Hale said the allegations were under review and that Barr had voluntarily placed herself on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. That review is ongoing, according to a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""We are obviously very pleased with the agency's first step in rectifying this situation by accepting Ms. Barr's resignation,"" said Fischer, Hayes' attorney. ""Now is the time for the agency to move forward and make restitution to the individuals harmed."" Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Barr's resignation ""raises the most serious questions about management practices and personnel policies at the Department of Homeland Security."" The committee will continue a review of the case and the personnel practices of the DHS in general. In his lawsuit, Hayes blames Barr for ""sexually offensive behavior."" In one alleged incident, Hayes said Barr called a male employee at a hotel and screamed at him, using crude language to say she wanted to have sex with him. Hayes also said that Barr moved the office contents of three male employees into a men's bathroom at ICE headquarters in 2009. After his client's lawsuit was filed, Fischer said, he was contacted by other federal employees who had heard about Hayes' claim. They provided affidavits to Hayes and his lawyer alleging more sexually charged comments made by Barr, according to Fischer. ""We've been getting calls and e-mails from all over the country from people who want to come forward with information that may be helpful on this case,"" the attorney told CNN. In an affidavit provided to CNN, another ICE employee describes a 2009 meeting in the office of ICE Director Morton, during which employees were discussing personal plans for Halloween. The male employee says he overheard Barr ask a ""senior ICE employee"" about the size of his genitals. ""You're a sexy mother-(expletive),"" she allegedly said. Over 17 years, Hayes rose through the ranks from Border Patrol agent to a top position at headquarters in charge of Detention and Removal Operations, overseeing a $2.5 billion budget, his lawsuit states. Hayes claims he was removed from that job because of gender discrimination. He is suing to recover $335,000 in moving costs and lost bonuses he says he incurred when he was transferred in 2009 to New York from Washington. His lawyer says other ICE employees have been reimbursed for similar expenses. Hayes' lawsuit also claims he faced retaliation after threatening to file an Equal Opportunity Claim against DHS and cites six internal investigations that were all unfounded. However, all but one of those investigations against him involving complaints by fellow employees were initially filed before Napolitano took office in 2008. In court documents, Hayes said the complaints were reviewed after he began complaining. DHS has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied allegations of discrimination and retaliation. Its attorneys argued that the ""unfounded allegations"" made against Barr are ""irrelevant"" and an ""attempt to embarrass or harass senior government officials."" According to a federal official who defended ICE as an agency of ""dedicated law enforcement professionals,"" Hayes' lawsuit is filled with ""false and unsubstantiated"" allegations against Barr and other DHS employees. The allegations ""do not align with the fact that Mr. Hayes has routinely held high-ranking assignments, including his current position as head of ICE's second-largest field office in New York, the official added. CNN's Ross Levitt and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Suzanne Barr calls the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A will from Michael Jackson written in 2002 has been located, but it may be one of several, the Jackson family lawyer said Tuesday. Though a 2002 Michael Jackson will has been located, the family's lawyer says there may be others. ""We need a certain amount of time to look at that,"" lawyer Londell McMillan said, referring to whether other wills exist. ""I don't personally know, but it's possible."" Until now, the Jackson family has said it has not seen a will for the singer. Without a legal will, the division of his estate would be decided in court. The 2002 will surfaced Monday after a Los Angeles judge gave the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, temporary control of her son's ""tangible personal property."" The pop icon's three children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- were also placed under the temporary guardianship of Katherine Jackson. McMillan said he has seen the will but would not disclose its details. ""There is a process called 'probating the will' that will validate any will in due course,"" he said. Probate is the legal process to prove whether a will is authentic and valid. The process is used to pass on items in the will from the deceased to the beneficiaries. The biological mother of Jackson's two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, will be invited to a hearing Monday in which the judge will consider who should have custody of them. She has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge the Jacksons for custody. CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this story.","Attorney says singer's will could be one of several .

"New York (CNN) -- A man who allegedly threatened police officers with a knife was shot and fatally wounded Saturday afternoon near Times Square in Manhattan, authorities said. The 3 p.m. incident, which occurred in an area popular with shoppers and tourists, began when officers approached a man because he was smoking what appeared to be a ""marijuana cigarette,"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. The man, 51, became agitated and brandished a knife, which had a 6-inch blade, near Seventh Avenue and 44th Street, said Browne. iReport: ' looked back saw him holding the gun...' Additional officers responded and pepper-sprayed the man six times, to no effect, when he menaced police with the knife and refused to drop it, according to Browne. ""He advanced on uniformed officers, refusing officers' repeated commands to drop his weapon,"" the deputy commissioner said. The man was shot at Seventh Avenue between 37th and 38th streets by two officers after he refused to drop his weapon, according to police. The unidentified individual was transported to the hospital, where he died. It remained unclear Saturday evening whether the suspect injured any pedestrians prior to being shot.

"(CNN) -- You would think surgeon Marty Makary might have a lot of doctors and hospitals gunning for him. His new book, ""Unaccountable: What Hospitals Won't Tell You and How Transparency Can Revolutionize Health Care,"" is an eye-opening look at the culture of medicine. And it's not pretty. Makary describes: . -- Dangerous doctors, who keep practicing because of a code of silence among their colleagues. -- ""Fred Flintstone"" doctors, who are woefully behind the times in their skills, but won't tell you. -- Profit-hungry doctors and hospitals, who take ""sales commissions"" from drug and medical device companies for using a certain drug, or implanting a certain device in patients. Hear the stories behind the book on the CNN Radio Soundwaves blog . But for every doctor who has called him a traitor, Makary says, five have thanked him for telling the story behind the statistics, which show that one of every four patients who is hospitalized is harmed by a medical error. Aside from errors, experts say 20% to 30% of medical care is unnecessary. Makary is a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. He says he wrote the book because he wants to change the system from the inside out. He doesn't think the government can solve the broken health care system, and he doesn't think the marketplace can either. ""It's the patients who can change it,"" he says, by pushing to change the way doctors and hospitals do their jobs. Patients can do that, he says, by becoming sharp consumers of health care -- the way they might be with any other product or service they buy. Makary gives some tips on how to do that: . -- If you don't know who's a good doctor and who's not, ask hospital employees. -- Use the Internet to learn what you can about your condition, and your options. Some helpful websites include PubMed.gov; HospitalCompare; and Vitals.com. -- When a doctor proposes surgery, ask questions: What happens if I don't do this? What other options do I have? What are the risks and the benefits? -- Get a second opinion.","A surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital has some ideas about what is wrong with medicine .

"(CNN) -- Felix Baumgartner jumped from the edge of space. James Cameron plunged to the ocean's lowest depths. Baumgartner broke the sound barrier. Cameron discovered an ""alien world."" Call them daredevils, explorers, neither or both. No matter what, their record-breaking solo feats, backed up by teams of specialists, literally raised and lowered the bar for human achievement. So, for others aspiring to chart new terrain, what's next? We asked for your ideas. Journey to the center of the Earth . Martin Samuels and John O'Connor wrote us on Facebook, saying it's time to work on getting lower. Way, way lower. ""Journey down in to the center of Earth,"" wrote Samuels. O'Connor added, ""Jules Verne for real!"" That may be a very, very, very long way away, but downward steps are already being taken in that direction. A new $1 billion mission plans to drill 3.7 miles beneath the sea floor to reach the Earth's mantle, a nearly 1,900-mile-thick layer of slowly deforming rock between the crust and the core, which makes up the majority of the planet. What we learn below can go a long way toward showing us what's above. The deepest crack found in the Earth's crust, on the Caribbean Sea floor, included signs of life -- which could indicate that alien life could exist on other planets, according to NASA. Walk on Mars . ""Obviously, the first person to set foot on Mars is the next big story,"" wrote Matt James Tiberius Kazan. Again, a far jump (ha ha) from anything Baumgartner and Cameron have done, and more in the realm of astronauts' incredible achievements -- but, again, a big new goal explorers are working on. In fact, it could happen within 20 to 30 years, according to Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""I think engineering-wise, we know how to do it to some level. We still need a lot of development and a few inventions to do that,"" Elachi told CNN. ""So at the end it would become a question of national will if we want to keep our exploration, expand our vision and expand our exploration in the next 20 to 30 years."" In the meantime, NASA is celebrating the success of the Mars rover Curiosity. Individual Atmosphere Re-entry . Much closer to home, Andrew Creech writes, ""the next step is individual atmosphere re-entry. That would be an amazing feat!"" It would -- and Baumgartner's jump may have gotten experts closer to making that happen. ""The long-term hope is that we can one day develop a suit that would allow a human to reenter the atmosphere from space without the help of a spaceship,"" Forbes wrote. In a blog post before Baumgartner's jump, Forbes said if the event was successful it would ""be a big step forward."" Re-entering Earth's atmosphere can be like splashing into a lake, the Federal Aviation Administration explains. It's ""a dense, fluid medium, which, at orbital velocities, is not all that different from a lake's surface."" Astronauts have to hit the atmosphere at a precise angle and speed to avoid ""a big 'splash,' which would mean a fiery end,"" or a too shallow entry, which could send them skipping ""off the atmosphere and back into the cold of space. This subtle dance between fire and ice is the science of atmospheric re-entry.""

"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit. G-8 leaders wait for an aide to remove toe markers as they pose for a family photo in L'Aquila, Italy, on July 8. The G-8 countries -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 to try to prevent the Earth's atmosphere from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Obama said. Thursday's meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said. ""Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building,"" said the declaration from Thursday's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. The declaration stopped short of setting targets for the developing nations. Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.  Watch report from CNN's Ed Henry » . He called the commitment of the emerging economies ""an important stride forward"" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront. Environment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome. Joanne Green, head of policy at Cafod, told the Press Association: ""Agreeing that average global temperatures should not rise by more than two degrees is forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what was needed."" And Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: ""Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world's emissions, agreed for the first time that it'd be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees. ""While G-8 countries continue to speed in the opposite direction, towards a cooked planet and climate catastrophe, poor people want to know whether rich coutries will now actually turn around before it's too late."" The vast majority of climate change scientists warn that warming above the 2 degree Celsius threshold would mean potentially catastrophic impacts on Earth. U.N.-led negotiations on a new global climate change treaty are aiming to conclude with an agreement among 192 nations in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. In the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law. A House bill that recently passed has the same target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050, but Senate passage of a measure remains uncertain.  Watch as leaders tour quake zone » . Republican opponents contend the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage by setting firm targets when China and other emerging economies would be free to pollute without limits. Some Democratic senators also fear harmful effects on fossil fuel industries in their states. The Major Economies Forum led by Obama included the G-8 countries along with Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and others. The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Its declaration Thursday outlined a range of actions including funding mechanisms for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping nations and ecosystems adapt to global warming, along with more money to pursue alternative energy sources. The declaration said the world's emissions should peak as soon as possible and then start going down. It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the creation of an institute to study and advance so-called clean coal technology intended to reduce the harmful pollution from coal-fired energy. In addition, the declaration recognized ""that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development.""  Watch what's on agenda at G-8 summit » . Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels. He called those steps ""significant,"" but conceded they fell short of binding commitments to meet specific reductions goals. However, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the ""underpinning"" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries. Obama acknowledged the United States has previously failed to meet its responsibilities regarding climate change, and he pledged a renewed commitment and leadership. In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States. Obama will meet Friday with Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the G-8 meeting, lambasting ""grave deviations and failures"" and calling for a ""profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise."" The pope challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development. ""Above all, the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods,"" Benedict said Wednesday. After his meeting with the pope, the first U.S. African-American president will make his first trip as chief executive to Africa, traveling to Accra, Ghana. Obama's father was a native of Kenya.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- The SEACOM cable being promoted as a computer lifeline for Africa will contribute to social upliftment but not immediately, a telecommunications analyst says. Seacom cable in the Red Sea . James Hodge, who specializes in competition and regulation, says initially SEACOM will predominantly benefit those already connected. Hodge said it will not initially change the lives of those poor people, sitting in the rural areas without lights or electricity. He added that because of the competitive climate surrounding SEACOM, it will lead to cheaper connectivity, making the Internet more affordable for more people. And that will contribute to social upliftment in the long-term, Hodge says. SEACOM plans to provide African customers with access to inexpensive bandwidth via 15,000 kilometers of undersea fiber-optic cables. SEACOM is the first cable supplying east Africa, which until now has been reliant on satellite connections. Hodge pointed out people in South Africa have already benefited. Service providers have reacted to the imminent arrival of the SEACOM cable by adjusting their prices, and more cuts are seen, as the local providers respond to the increased competition, he said. SEACOM is owned by a lot of divergent companies, all competing amongst each other. Strong competition within the cable itself should drive prices down and avoid any price collusion among the various providers, Hodge said. He added that would please the cynical South African consumer and help liberalize South Africa's communications industry, long seen as lagging behind everyone else in connectivity due to lack of competition.

"(CNN) -- Mississippi, the most obese state in the United States, needs to shed pounds. A former pro football player turned fitness coach wants to make it happen. The Magnolia State has an adult obesity rate of 33% and has the highest rate of overweight and obese children in the country, but Paul Lacoste said he's inspired to help his home state get fit. ""It's time for Mississippi to get in shape and show the world we can beat obesity,"" said the 36-year-old coach from Madison. Lacoste attended high school in Jackson, played football at Mississippi State University where he was an All-SEC and All-America selection in 1996, and then had a brief career in the NFL, CFL and XFL . He said his football career provided him with the tools he needed to be in top physical shape and he now wants to share these lessons with his home state. He is leading a 12-week fitness program and invited state government leaders from both sides of the aisle, employees from the governor's office, state workers and civilians to participate in the ""2011 Paul Lacoste Sports Fit 4 Change Challenge."" Lacoste said this battle is personal for him, because he no longer wants his home state to be famous for being obese. ""We are literally the heaviest people on the planet and it's not something to brag about, so why not turn it into an opportunity to make our state better?"" Lacoste said. Lacoste said he has watched friends struggle with their weight after their football careers ended, so he knows how challenging it is to stay fit. He said he also fights this battle daily, because if he were to stop working out, he could get out of shape, too. The fitness coach's program was launched after he was able to convince lawmakers he had the right plan to help Mississippians shed pounds. Some 200 participants in Lacoste's 12-week program are part of teams that compete against one another, and obesity, at Jackson State University's Walter Payton Health and Wellness Center. The ultimate goal is for members to get healthy, and to encourage Mississippians to do the same. Why is Mississippi overweight? For one thing, the state is the poorest one in the nation -- 21% of its residents live below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""When you don't have a lot of money, you eat more calorie-dense foods because it's cheaper and often more accessible than healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables,"" said Dr. Mary Currier, the state health officer for Mississippi. ""For some residents, grocery stores are too far away and the nearest business to buy food is the local gas station, where nutritious food options are lacking,"" she noted. Although poverty puts people at risk for obesity and other problems, Lacoste said it doesn't have to determine their fate. Since January 11, the fitness coach has led program participants through intense one-hour workouts, four days a week, and it is paying off. In the first six weeks of this year's challenge, participants have lost a combined total of 2,017 pounds. That's more weight dropped than last year's entire program, which was the first year of the event. ""I'm really passionate about this program and I train these guys as intensely as I would train a pro athlete,"" said Lacoste. ""We work on cardio, building strength, speed agility and quickness training and we have tough workouts,"" he said. A nutritionist from the Mississippi Department of Health provides information to participants about healthy eating options to help compliment the program. State Rep. Steve Holland, a 55-year-old Democrat from Plantersville, said he dropped from 359 pounds to 216 as a result of last year's program and is participating again this year. ""Like many people, I let myself go and gained a lot of weight over the years,"" said Holland. ""I used to have a lot of health problems when I was heavy, but now that I've dropped my weight, I'm as healthy as an ox and feel great,"" he said. Holland said he made a commitment to change his lifestyle during Lacoste's program, and hopes other Mississippians will be inspired to do the same. In addition to dropping pounds, some lawmakers, like Holland, say they are bonding with legislators from both sides of the aisle. ""We feel good, I'm even loving Republicans right now,"" said Holland. ""When you get together at 5 a.m. to work out with other lawmakers, it has this phenomenal way of permeating over at the 8 a.m. meeting and bringing both sides together,"" he said. State Sen. Perry Lee, a Republican from Mendenhall agrees. ""In addition to getting in shape, the exercise program has provided great time for fellowship and allowed us the opportunity to get to know and connect with each other in a different avenue,"" said Lee. Various sponsors have joined the effort to help Mississippi lose weight by funding the challenge. At the end of the fitness program, participants will run a 5K race in Jackson to prove that they are ""fit for change."" The race will end at the state capitol and Lacoste is hoping he can attract celebrities from Mississippi like Oprah Winfrey, Faith Hill and others to be there to cheer on the runners from their home state. ""True change takes place when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change and that's what's happening here,"" Lacoste said. ""I'm inspired to continue this fight and inspired to keep pushing and get as many people involved in our training as I can,"" he said. The coach said he plans to organize a program for Mississippi teachers, schoolchildren and their parents later this year, then to ultimately take the fitness program to Washington. ""My ultimate goal is to get our U.S. Congress on board and encourage them be a part of this fitness challenge, too, so they can show the country and the world what is possible,"" Lacoste said.","Mississippi has an adult obesity rate of 33 percent .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Seven members of an exiled Iranian opposition group have been killed in clashes with Iraqi police at a refugee camp over the past two days, authorities said Wednesday. A woman protests the takeover of Camp Ashraf by Iraqi forces in front of the White House on Wednesday. Security forces attempted to establish security control at Camp Ashraf in Iraq's Diyala province Tuesday and continued Wednesday to square off with members of the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran. The camp, which has housed Iranians since the mid-1980s, has been a refuge of the People's Mujahedeen. Regarded as a terrorist group by the United States and Iran, the group allied with Saddam Hussein in Iraq during the 1980s with the goal of toppling the Iranian regime. Since Hussein's overthrow in 2003, Iraq has established good relations with the Iranian government. Iran wants to see the camp shut down, and the Iraqi government has said it would close the facility after it got control of the camp from the United States this year. Residents in the camp are concerned about being forcibly turned over to Iran. People there said they would be willing to go back to Iran but only if there are assurances that its members won't be mistreated. An Interior Ministry official said that nearly 100 other People's Mujahedeen members and 45 police officers have been wounded. Maj. Ibrahim Abdullah, riot control commander in Diyala province, said that hundreds of People's Mujahedeen members fiercely resisted security forces as they tried to enter the camp, using stones, knives and sharp tools to fight them. Abdullah himself had been wounded and spoke from a hospital in Baqouba. People's Mujahedeen is the largest member of the National Council of Resistance to Iran, an umbrella group of Iranian opposition organizations. The secretariat of the council also confirmed seven deaths since Iraqi forces raided the camp Tuesday. It said Iraqi forces wielding machine guns ""opened fire on the defenseless residents"" of the camp Wednesday. It said Iraqis ""demolished all facilities, bungalows and residences"" at the camp's northern wing. The council said camp residents have been shouting ""Allahu Akbar,"" which means ""God is great."" ""For what reason were they killed?"" the people chanted. On Tuesday, the council accused the Iraqi police officers of firing pepper gas and beating the refugees while demolishing the walls and fences around the camp. About 3,500 people live at Camp Ashraf, most of them members of the People's Mujahedeen for about 25 years after fleeing Iran. Also known as Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran was formed to oppose the shah of Iran but fell out of favor with the Islamic Revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after 1979. People's Mujahedeen, an Islamist group that promotes a Marxist government for Iran, for years waged a violent campaign against the fundamentalist Islamic Tehran government, including bombings that killed politicians, judges and Cabinet members.","Security forces try to establish control at Camp Ashraf in Iraq's Diyala province .

"(CNN) -- The American people should sue Washington's chattering class for whiplash. Just a few days ago, when Paul Ryan was selected by Mitt Romney to be his running mate, there was a burst of media euphoria. The nomination was a game changer. Ryan was an ideas guy. He would elevate what to date had been a lackluster campaign. He had killer abs. But within 48 hours, the so-called ""narrative"" had changed. The narrative is not actual facts. It is how those facts look after they've been run through the political spin cycle. Thanks to modern technology, the whole process of spinning narratives that once took weeks, now happens in the blinking of an eye. Twitter, in its manic frenzy, hopped up on bite-size bits of emotion-filled social interaction, condenses months into hours, news cycles into moments, but without any of the perspective that time or thought brings. Within a few ticks of the clock of Ryan bounding down the gangplank of the USS Wisconsin, he went from ""It boy"" to calamity. Comments about his hair and his missing necktie were so rapidly and extensively commented upon that they had become clichÃ©s before they could be written about in the next morning's paper. Saturday, he was a bold stroke. By Tuesday, Ryan was a potential liability. Old people were sure to hate him. And once an America that's a bit on the chubby side took note of his 6% body fat, he would be a goner. Ryan Rages Against the Machine . What had promised to be the beginning of a long overdue debate about ""big ideas"" was now seen, often by the same commentators who were upbeat days earlier, as a trigger for more hopelessly divisive bickering. Meanwhile, seemingly cooler heads sniffed that this wasn't much of a story in the first place. After all, this was all about a vice presidential nomination. John Nance Garner's quip about the vice presidency not being worth ""a bucket of warm spit"" was dusted off as it is every four years, this time with a little more seeming relevance since Garner was, back in 1932, the last sitting House member to ""ascend"" to veepdom. Ezra Klein, writing for The Washington Post, suggested it was likely the pick didn't ""much matter at all,"" asserting ""that's usually what happens with vice presidential picks."" So, let's take a step back now that we have the Olympian perspective half a week offers. Does the pick matter? Could it? How? First, the conventional wisdom that vice presidential picks don't matter is just wrong. For more than half a century, vice presidents and vice presidential nominees have had a huge impact. Dwight Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, became president. John F. Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson, became president. One of Nixon's vice presidents, Spiro Agnew, was at the center of a scandal. His next one, Gerald Ford, became president. Jimmy Carter elevated the vice presidency into a real position of policy-partnership, giving Walter Mondale an unprecedented role, which led him to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984. Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, became president. Bill Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, was a true policy partner, won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election and later picked up a Nobel Prize. George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, was the most powerful vice president in history. Joe Biden is both a policy partner and, as his ""back in chains"" gaffe showed, he is still a headline grabber. And even losing nominees for the office, from Lloyd Bentsen to Jack Kemp to Joe Lieberman to John Edwards and Sarah Palin, have had a lasting impact. Ghitis: Will Romney take the U.S. to war? Thus, even if Ryan were not one of the leaders of perhaps the single most influential new political movement in America in the past decade, the tea party-aligned deficit hawks of ""the New Right,"" he, as a vice presidential pick, would immediately vault to the forefront of U.S. politics. Already his budget plan is one of the defining documents of that movement, and thrust him to the forefront of it. Naturally, this makes him a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats -- even though in the past, Democratic budget experts such as Ron Wyden and Erskine Bowles praised his command of the numbers -- but could also be the trigger for a debate that Democrats, if they believe in their principles, should welcome. Demagoguery is the temptation for both camps and seems preferred by most of their hired guns and super PAC supporters. But they don't have to rule the day. A top Democratic donor friend of mine, former Loral Space & Communications chief executive Bernard Schwartz, sees an alternative approach. ""I see an opportunity,"" he told me, ""for the two candidates to present their adversarial cases as best they know how on the basis of principles rather than irrelevancies like how many years of tax disclosure has been made."" He went on to add, ""Let's view this selection of Ryan as the beginning of the development of a true Republican national viewpoint and let's view it as a challenge to President Obama to stop going after Romney personally and to speak to the core issues. Both sides have to have the courage to own their ideas, defend them and make the case for the sacrifices any serious approach will entail. This could help elevate that and the debate and give the American people the kind of true choice they deserve right now.""' Encouragingly, this is a view echoed in the comments of thought leaders in the Republican Party such as commentators David Brooks, Charles Krauthammer or Bill Bennett. That's significant because as important as the vice presidential pick actually is, the greater vices with which we must contend in contemporary politics are the tendency to demonize our opponents and to chase after the rapidly moving but ephemeral targets set by the social-networking shouting match. Paul Ryan's Gen X sensibilities an asset . This is not just dangerous because it's vapid, alienates voters and sheds no light on anything. It's dangerous because sometimes in their zeal for the spotlight or their love of scorched earth politics, candidates, campaign advisers and partisan commentators forget that both sides in this contest are us. In the end, as appealing as substantive debate is, it's not enough. Because debate that is not followed by the cooperation required for action is wasted. That is why we must hope that both sides see the possibilities for turning this vice presidential pick, like him or not, into a catalyst for the change in the character of our politics that our times require. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Pundits whipsaw on Paul Ryan -- first he's game changer, then liability .
He says VP picks matter; historically VPs influential, sometimes become president .
He says Ryan pick could spur needed debate, clarify choice in election .

"Queens, New York (CNN) -- Kellie Phelan doesn't mince words when she looks back at herself five years ago. ""I was basically a crackhead,"" Phelan said. ""I literally was getting arrested every other week. I got pregnant by a drug dealer. ... I was seven months pregnant, and I was still smoking crack."" When she finally gave birth to her daughter, Phelan was behind bars, serving a 90-day jail sentence for possessing crack cocaine, violating her probation. It was a wake-up call. ""That was the most traumatizing experience of my life,"" Phelan said. ""To go see my beautiful, healthy baby girl in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs and shackles ... I was embarrassed that was the way I brought her into this world. ""I knew I was changing my life. I just didn't know how I was going to change my life."" Fortunately, Phelan connected with Hour Children, a nonprofit that reaches out to convicted mothers at five correctional facilities in New York. Now, at 38, she says she is drug-free, has a job she loves and is raising her daughter in an apartment of her own. ""When you see what (these women) can do with support and love and education, it's miraculous, really,"" said Sister Teresa Fitzgerald, who founded Hour Children. ""They don't believe in a future and are hung up on the mistakes of their life. And life is not about a mistake. We all get a gift of life, and we have to live it."" Over the past 25 years, Fitzgerald's group has provided life-changing assistance to more than 9,000 mothers both behind and beyond bars. Its goal is to reintegrate former inmates into society by helping them with common post-release stumbling blocks, such as reuniting families and finding safe, affordable housing. It also provides the women with free counseling, education and employment support. ""Everybody loves children, and they're an easy sell,"" Fitzgerald said. ""But the mothers, for many of them, their lives were so horrific growing up, and they didn't have what children deserve. They ended up on the negative side of life. ""If you don't get the support and tools, you can't give it to your child. ... It's a dead end all around."" Hour Children -- named in part because jailed mothers get only an hour at a time to visit with their children -- begins counseling women at least three months before their release. Women are referred to the group by corrections workers, or they can reach out directly. Most have family histories of substance abuse, physical abuse, mental illness and other types of trauma, Hour Children says. According to the New York Department of Corrections, 29% of the state's female ex-convicts are eventually re-arrested. But Hour Children says that for women in its program, that rate drops to 3%. ""No woman comes out of prison and says 'Gee, I really want to mess up again,' "" said Fitzgerald, 65. ""You talk with these women ... about the skills that they need and the perspective and the possibilities of change. That's the key here: that change can happen."" Do you know a hero? Nominations for 2012 Heroes close August 31 . Phelan admits she initially had little faith that Hour Children would live up to its promise to meet her upon her release from Rikers Island in New York. But the organization picked up her and her baby and brought them to one of its transitional homes in Long Island City. ""From the moment I walked through the doors, it was like home,"" Phelan said. ""I knew I was going to be OK from that point on. ... ""If I hadn't found this organization ... my family would have taken my baby. ... I'd be dead, in prison, smoking crack or doing heroin. No doubt about it."" In Long Island City, the group maintains several affordable, sober-living transitional homes as well as permanent homes and offices. Hour Children also offers affordable day-care and after-school programs, a food pantry, a community garden, thrift stores and a salon -- all of which are open to the general public. These opportunities can mean a great deal, because women leaving prison have limited options. Reuniting with children who've been in foster care can be contingent upon the mother finding income and a stable home, but some ex-offenders aren't eligible for public housing in New York. And offenders on state work-release programs have eight weeks to find work. ""Employment and housing can be daunting because so many doors are closed to our mothers,"" Fitzgerald said. ""We all know who they are, so they don't have to defend the fact that they have been in prison. Women without that help, going out there on their own, have a huge challenge."" Fitzgerald knew nothing about the prison population in 1985, when a fellow nun asked her to escort a young child to Rikers Island so she could visit her mother. Witnessing the consequences of the forced separation on the child, mother and family moved Fitzgerald to rededicate her life to repairing and strengthening broken bonds. She and four other nuns began taking in children who were born behind bars and raising them until their mothers' release. This work continues today, with children regularly placed with Hour Children community members who coordinate regular visitations with moms inside. Each visit an inmate receives offers her greater incentive to make a change. ""Little steps matter,"" Fitzgerald said. ""They sit in prison, and they can hardly imagine how to get from here to there. ""Nothing happens in isolation. When you come out and you have a community of support that encourages you to use your time well to make little steps that turn into big steps, you see the hope there. ... They show each other they can do it."" Women applying for housing are required to enroll in the group's employment and training program. They must also be willing to comply with sober and communal living restrictions and responsibilities. They're welcome for as long as they feel they need support and continue to progress. Some have stayed for a few months, others as long as 15 years. ""We welcome people in,"" Fitzgerald said. ""When they are here and it's clear they are not using the services and progressing, then you can say to them: 'We invited you. If you're not utilizing what we offer, you have to move on.' We hold them to their commitment."" The group functions on private donations and small grants and says that more than 60% of its staffers, including Phelan, have come through the program themselves. Phelan runs the group's youth mentoring program. She says that thanks to Fitzgerald, she's proud of who she is today. ""I want people to admire me, and I want to help people the way she's helped me,"" Phelan said. ""If I could know I'd change a life like she changed mine, it gives purpose to the years I ran the streets. ... It makes it all understandable then. Because God put me through it for a reason."" That's precisely the dignified spirit that Fitzgerald says carries this population forward. ""They admit to their mistakes, and I admire that because I know a lot of people on the outside who don't,"" she said. ""But they want to move beyond the mistake. And they want to rise up almost from the ashes and say: 'Wow! Look at me. I can do it.' "" Want to get involved?

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Michael Jackson collapsed at his rented mansion last month, the singer's arms were riddled with marks and their veins had collapsed -- both characteristics found in intravenous drug users, sources told CNN on Tuesday. A source says Michael Jackson had ""paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt."" The revelations add to the speculation that prescription drugs played a part in Jackson's death on June 25. The exact cause is pending toxicology results that aren't due for at least another week. A source involved with the investigation into Jackson's death told CNN that Jackson had ""numerous track marks"" on his arms -- and that those marks ""could certainly be consistent with the regular IV use of a drug, like Diprivan."" The sources did not want to be identified because the investigation is ongoing. The source said investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in the singer's $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills, but he would not confirm whether Diprivan was among them.  Watch what sources say on condition of Jackson's body » . He also cautioned that it was too soon to say whether an intravenous drip of Diprivan caused the track marks. Some appeared fresh; others older, he said. The new ones could have resulted from the IVs that paramedics used when they tried to revive Jackson after he was found unconscious. Another source with knowledge of the case said Jackson's veins were collapsed in both arms, suggesting frequent intravenous drug use. The first source said Jackson's body was ""lily white from head to toe,"" perhaps the result of vitiligo -- a condition that causes the skin to lose melanin and produce slowly enlarging white patches. The second source said Jackson had ""paper white skin. As white as a white T-shirt."" The singer also did not have any hair -- a lingering effect, possibly, of an accident in 1984 when Jackson suffered burns to his scalp while shooting a commercial for Pepsi. Also, said the second source, Jackson was emaciated -- despite the vigor he's seen displaying in a taped rehearsal clip shot two nights before his death. The drug Diprivan, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a general anesthetic. Last week, a nutritionist -- Cherilyn Lee -- said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects, because he had difficulty falling asleep. Sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during a world tour in the mid-'90s. The California state attorney general's office is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in Jackson's death investigation. The office confirmed it is investigating some doctors who treated Jackson over the years. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is also looking into the role of drugs. Los Angeles police have interviewed Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They impounded Murray's car, saying it might contain evidence, possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Through his lawyers, Murray has released several statements, saying he would not be commenting until the toxicology results from Jackson's autopsy are released. Dr. Neil Ratner, the anesthesiologist who accompanied Jackson during the HIStory tour in the mid-'90s, also refused to comment, although he acknowledged Jackson suffered from a sleep disorder. CNN's Susan Chun contributed to this report.","Source cites ""numerous track marks"" on Jackson's arms when medics came .

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador celebrated his first victory since returning from a doping ban as he won his home Vuelta A Espana for the second time on Sunday. The Spanish rider, who was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France and 2011 Giro d'Italia victories after testing positive for a banned steroid, finished one minute 16 seconds clear of compatriot Alejando Valverde in the third and final grand tour of the cycling season. Valverde won the Vuelta in 2009, but has like Contador just returned from a two-year suspension after being involved in the Operacion Puerto blood doping scandal. The 29-year-old Contador completed the three-week, 3,300-kilometer event in 84 hours 59 minutes 49 seconds to follow up his 2008 success and hold onto the red jersey. ""Thanks to all of you who have been there, both in good and bad times! This victory is yours!"" the Saxo Bank team rider wrote on his Twitter page after finishing 54th in the peloton in the 21st stage along the streets of Madrid. Movistar's Valverde came home sixth to deny third-placed Joaquin Rodriguez the points classification jersey, while German sprinter John Degenkolb came home first to earn his fifth stage win. It was the second year in a row that Rodriguez was denied the points jersey on the final day. The race marked the end of the careers of France's David Moncoutie, a four-time winner of the Vuelta's mountain classification category, and fellow veteran Grischa Niermann of Germany, who were allowed a honorary run at the front of the field for the first intermediate sprint. The field lacked many of the top names from July's Tour de France, which was won by Bradley Wiggins, but his Team Sky colleague Chris Froome did take part and finished fourth overall -- more than 10 minutes behind Contador. Contador is one of cycling's biggest stars, and his controversial ban for use of clenbuterol -- small amounts were found in tests during the 2010 Tour de France -- was another blow for the sport, which has been plagued by drug scandals. Seven-time Tour champion Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his titles after last month refusing to defend himself against doping charges laid against him by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.","Two-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador wins Tour of Spain .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Six people were killed in Pakistan on Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, local police said. Pakistani human rights activists in Lahore protest on Saturday the anti-Christian violence in Gojra village. Police said Muslims were enraged over an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran at a Christian wedding last Saturday, and held a rally to protest. The Quran is the Muslim sacred text. The Muslims went to the Christian community in Gojra City, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore, and burned 40 to 50 houses. Muslims and Christians exchanged gunfire. Police said efforts to settle the concerns with dialogue so far have failed. On Thursday, 15 Christian houses in the region were also torched. Pakistan is predominantly Muslim but has a small Christian community. Meanwhile, police in Islamabad reported Friday that an al Qaeda member thought to be involved in several attacks was arrested. Bin Yamin, a senior police official in Islamabad, identified the suspect as Rao Shakir Ali. Police believe he was involved in strikes on targets such as the Danish Embassy, a rally of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chauhdary, police, and a hotel. The suspect is a resident of Sargodha, which is 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) northwest of Lahore and has a house in Rawalpindi that has been used to facilitate insurgent acts, police said.

"(CNN) -- A Guinean court has filed charges against an army colonel for his alleged role in mass rapes and killings after security forces opened fire on protesters in 2009. Lt. Col. Moussa Camara is the highest ranking official charged in the attacks on demonstrators gathered in a Conakry stadium to protest the military rule in the country at the time. More than 150 people died in the ensuing chaos and 109 women were sexually abused, the United Nations said in a statement. ""Women were raped by soldiers in the stadium. I saw them,"" former Guinean prime minister Sidya Toure said at the time. Toure led the country from 1996-1999, and was participating in the peaceful demonstration in the capital. The Guinean government has said most of the victims were crushed as the crowd stormed the stadium doors. ""The recent charges are a welcome step in the right direction. They signal that no official is above the law, and no citizen is below it,"" said Margaret Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative on sexual violence in conflict. Wallstrom highlighted the need to protect survivors while prosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity. ""There remains an urgent need to assist the survivors and bring the remaining perpetrators to justice,"" she said. ""It is equally crucial that all victims, other witnesses and their families are afforded full protection and that no effort is spared to ensure their safety throughout this process."" Tens of thousands of people had gathered to protest the rule of Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in a bloodless coup.

"TOKYO, Japan (Reuters) -- Ordered to sacrifice themselves for the nation by crashing their planes into U.S. warships as Japan vainly battled to stave off invasion in the final months of World War Two, some young pilots instead returned alive. Young pilots from the Japanese Royal Navy drink cups of sake before their kamikaze suicidal attack mission. As a documentary released in Japan on Saturday shows, not all the young men trained for the suicide missions that struck terror into U.S. servicemen faced their almost certain death gladly. ""I wanted to live,"" Kazuo Nakajima, one of the now elderly 'failed cherry blossoms' tells the filmmakers with an embarrassed laugh. ""I didn't want to die."" Japanese-American director Risa Morimoto sought out former kamikaze after discovering her much-loved uncle had been among those prepared to carry out what were called ""special attacks."" Instead of finding the fanatics she had expected, she met a group of gentle, elderly men who confessed their mixed emotions about the past, she says on the film's Web site. One veteran even criticized the emperor, treated as a living god until Japan's defeat, for failing to surrender sooner. The film, ""Wings of Defeat,"" has already been shown to some surviving crewmen of the U.S.S. Drexler, a destroyer sunk by kamikaze near the end of the war. ""They said, 'We were told we were killing madmen. We were lied to,'"" producer Linda Hoaglund told a recent news conference. She and Morimoto have arranged for two 81-year-old U.S. survivors to meet some of the former kamikaze in Japan next week. The film struck a chord with one elderly Japanese man who said he trained in the same suicide unit as one of the pilots in the documentary. ""It was exactly like that. We thought we were fighting and giving our lives for our families and our comrades,"" said Masaaki Kobayashi, 79, after watching the film with a group of his former comrades. ""As soldiers, that was the only thing we could do."" The film's release coincides with controversy over efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other conservatives to shed what they consider a masochistic attitude to Japan's wartime past. Last month, lawmakers from the southern island of Okinawa -- site of a bloody 1945 battle that killed some 200,000 civilians and soldiers -- blasted the government for deciding to tone down school textbook references to soldiers ordering civilians to commit suicide rather than surrender to U.S. personnel in the war. Abe also drew criticism when he denied that the military or government had hauled Asian women away to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers before and during the war, although he has said he stands by a government apology to the women who suffered. The documentary is being shown two months after a feature film on the kamikaze penned by Tokyo's nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara, celebrating the young kamikaze as heroes. Many Japanese say wartime reality should be taught to a younger generation too young to remember. ""We shouldn't beautify it, but we shouldn't forget it either,"" said a 34-year-old system engineer who watched the film. Vice-Admiral Takejiro Onishi conceived of the the desperate kamikaze strategy when Japan was on the verge of losing the Philippines to U.S. forces. The first attack took place off the coast of the island of Leyte in the Philippines in 1944 and its success inspired Onishi to recruit more young men for suicide missions. Roughly 4,000 kamikaze pilots died and 34 U.S. ships were sunk in the last few months of the war, according to the filmmakers. ""They thought they were doing it for their country, but if you think about it now, they never should have adopted that strategy,"" said one 82-year-old woman, who served as a nurse during the war and cried as she watched the film. ""Everyone knew Japan was losing. They should have surrendered sooner."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- ""DJs are the new rock stars,"" Simon Cowell recently declared when announcing that he -- along with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith -- will be developing a new reality competition to find the next great DJ talent. While the former ""American Idol"" and current ""X Factor"" judge is known for his provocative statements, he's not usually wrong. And it looks like this time is no exception. One of the most anticipated races at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards this Sunday is among the dance/electronica artists, including chart-topping DJ and producer David Guetta (Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling""), festival and stadium headliner Deadmau5, and the year's breakout star, Skrillex. Skrillex (born Sonny Moore), the 24-year-old dubstep producer best known for his album ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites,"" is the first-ever DJ nominee in the best new artist category, where he's up against Nicki Minaj, The Band Perry, Bon Iver and J. Cole. He scored a total of five Grammy nominations, more than the biggest pop acts like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry combined. ""I almost don't even know what it means in terms of the big picture,"" he recently told MTV News. ""This whole year has been insane, and these are surprises beyond my wildest fantasies because we've come a long f---ing way, man. People didn't believe in us and it's pretty awesome just to get that acknowledgment."" But Skrillex admits he's not in it for the glory. ""If I didn't get (these Grammy nominations), I would still do the same exact thing,"" the DJ said in a chat with Artisan News. If I were to win a Grammy, I just hope it opens doors to everyone else that's amongst my peers and the people I've grown up doing this with."" Despite his newfound success, not everyone ""gets"" Skrillex. Reactions to his music range from generation-based bewilderment to genre purists' outright hatred. ""A few hundred people might be b----ing on a message board, but you can go to a festival and find 100,000 people dancing to my music,"" he said. ""No one gives a f--k."" In the best dance/electronica category, Skrillex's ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"" will compete against Deadmau5 (born Joel Zimmerman) and the house grooves of his ""4x4=12"" and Guetta's ""Nothing But the Beat,"" which spawned ubiquitous club songs featuring Rihanna, Usher and Nicki Minaj among others. Rounding out the nominations is artist Robyn for ""Body talk, Pt. 3."" Those who follow the genre definitely have their thoughts. Doug Elfman from the Las Vegas Review-Journal put his chips down for Deadmau5. ""Deadmau5 is, at this point, the big dog of DJ-producers,"" Elfman wrote. ""The guy makes phenomenal songs in the studio, and he sold out to capacity this year during DJ gigs at Encore Beach Club (a fair set) and at Body English at Hard Rock (a terrific set)."" And, in another first for the genre: Guetta and Deadmau5 will be performing live in a special electronica/dance segment on the Grammys stage alongside Foo Fighters (their single ""Rope"" was remixed by Deadmau5) and ""Nothing But the Beat"" collaborators Lil Wayne and Chris Brown. Guetta, the veteran of the of the new crop of rock star DJs, with countless radio hits and two past Grammy wins already under his belt said, ""I'm very happy that not only me, but also the dance community and DJ culture is getting a lot of attention in America now finally. It's wonderful. It's becoming a big deal and I'm happy about it.""","One of the most anticipated races at the Grammys is among the dance/electronica artists .

"(RollingStone.com) -- At her MDNA tour stop in St. Petersburg, Russia, on August 9th, Madonna challenged the city's gay pride ban by giving away pink wristbands and speaking out at her show, according to The Hollywood Reporter. St. Petersburg prohibits the ""propagation of homosexuality"" and ""promotion of gay lifestyles,"" and authorities had warned Americans of violent threats. Despite several protests, the pop star handed out pink bracelets to concert attendees in opposition to the city's policies. A sign above the stage informed concertgoers that the bracelets showed ""tolerance for the gay community"" and encouraged fans to wear them. Madonna demanded ""respect, tolerance and love"" for the LGBT community during the show, saying, ""We want to fight for the right to be free."" Though she asked the crowd to raise their bracelets in support, the audience reportedly showed a mixed reaction. Later, Madonna revealed the words ""No Fear"" written on her back and waved LGBT flags. Madonna's MDNA tour has caused plenty of controversy. Last week, Elton John ripped the pop star, calling her career ""over."" She displayed World War II-era footage of the Warsaw Uprising at a tour stop in Warsaw, Poland, in response to protests earlier this month.

"(CNN) -- Two Norwegian citizens were sentenced to death Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for espionage, murder and attempted murder, Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed to CNN. Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland have been sentenced to death and have five days to appeal. Asked about the sentence, Lambert Mende Omalanga, Congo's minister of communications, told CNN, ""We don't have a habit of commenting on judicial decisions."" However, Omalanga said, his country has not carried out the death penalty in 10 years. He said lawmakers in parliament are in the process of trying to take the law off the books. A military court in Kisangani found Tjostolv Moland, 28, and Joshua French, 27, guilty on all charges, Norwegian TV2 reported. The court also ordered the pair to pay $60 million in damages. The men have five days to appeal their sentence, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN. It was not clear why the men were in Congo. ""I have earlier made absolutely clear that these two have not been conducting business for Norway in any shape or form,"" Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Store told Norwegian state television NRK after the verdict. ""We will now read through the sentence to see exactly how it is written,"" Store added. Norwegian authorities have been following the trial closely on television, and have tried to keep a balance between respecting the judicial system of a different country and helping Norwegian citizens in trouble, Store told NRK. The two men were found guilty of spying for Norway and for killing a driver in May, according to NRK. In an earlier statement on the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, the ministry said that if the two Norwegians were to receive the death penalty, Norwegian authorities would immediately try to seek assurances from Congolese authorities that the death sentence would not be carried out. ""Norway has a very strong stand on the death penalty, and we are very much against it,"" a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman told CNN. Images on NRK TV showed that after the sentence against the two men was read, applause broke out in the courtroom.

""I'm accepting the challenge to lead this fight,"" said Noynoy Aquino, the state-run Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Twin car bombs exploded near three Iraqi government buildings Sunday in central Baghdad, killing at least 132 people. It was the deadliest attack in the country in more than two years. More than 500 people were wounded. The blasts had ripple effects throughout the country, triggering questions about the state of Iraqi security and about national elections planned for January. No one immediately claimed responsibility. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki vowed to punish ""the enemies of the Iraqi people who want to spread chaos in the country and derail the political process and prevent the parliamentary elections from taking place as planned."" Surveying the carnage shortly after the explosions, al-Maliki said holding the elections as scheduled would send the strongest response and message to the ""enemies of the political process who are supported from the outside."" ""The cowardly attack that took place today should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party and the terrorist al Qaeda organization, who have committed the most heinous crimes against the civilians,' "" al-Maliki said in a statement. Iraqi and U.S. officials had warned of a possible increase in violence ahead of the balloting. President Obama condemned the ""outrageous attacks against the Iraqi people."" In a statement, Obama called the bombings an attempt to ""derail Iraq's progress"" and pledged that the United States would be a ""close friend and partner"" as Iraq prepares for elections. According to the statement, Obama spoke Sunday with al-Maliki and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support. The area struck Sunday is close to the heavily guarded Green Zone that also houses the U.S. Embassy. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, condemned the bombings, which came a day after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, visited the country for the first time. ""We will assist the Iraqi government in any way we can to ensure that those individuals or groups responsible for such horrific acts be pursued and brought to justice,"" they said in a joint statement. The European Union condemned ""this terrorist attack"" and sent its condolences to the families of the victims, the Swedish presidency said in a statement. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., as the Iraqi work week began, an Interior Ministry official said. Among more than 500 people wounded were three American security contractors, the U.S. Embassy told CNN. The embassy would not give any more details. One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building. The other was outside the Justice Ministry, about 500 meters (1,600 feet) away. The nearby Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works also sustained severe damage. Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites of the attacks as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewn with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete from damaged buildings. Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged. It was the deadliest attack on Iraqi civilians since August 2007, when three truck bombings targeted Iraqi Kurds, killing hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. In August, more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings in Baghdad in what Iraqis have dubbed ""Bloody Wednesday."" Those attacks shook confidence in the abilities of Iraqi security forces who took over securing urban areas from U.S. troops over the summer. Security was tightened around Baghdad in the wake of the August bombings. Blast walls were erected around the city and more checkpoints were set up. Susan Rice, the ambassador, completed her two-day visit to Iraq on Saturday that included a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry, one of the sites attacked in August. Iraqi journalists grilled officials on TV on Sunday, demanding to know how the most recent attacks could have taken place given the new security measures. An Iraqi official said the government was working to bolster security, but regional cooperation was needed to help fight suicide bombers. ""We are calling on international and U.N. envoys to come and find out why Iraq is being targeted this way,"" said Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman. He said Iraq's setbacks are mainly caused by a fledgling intelligence that has ""not been completed."" The Iraqi government has blamed Syria for harboring former Baath party members who it said planned the August attacks, and asked for their handover. Relations between the two neighbors were strained after the bombings. Each withdrew its ambassador from the other's country. Sunday's bombings came on the day Iraqi officials were due to try to break a logjam holding up a new election law. Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16, but Parliament still has not passed the legislation, putting the balloting in limbo. The original deadline for parliament to pass the law was October 15, because Iraq's electoral commission says it needs 90 days to organize the process. Iraq's parliament failed Wednesday to reach agreement on a new electoral law, so the issue was supposed go to the Political Council for National Security on Sunday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Pirates holding a Taiwanese-flagged ship off the coast of Somalia fired on a U.S. Navy helicopter Wednesday as the aircraft monitored the ship, the Navy said. The Maersk Alabama was targeted in an April hijacking that ended with Navy snipers killing three pirates. The helicopter was not struck and all crew members were safe after the incident, the Navy said in a news release. The incident highlights the ongoing piracy problem in that region even as U.S. and coalition ships patrol the waters to deter pirates. Somali pirates hijacked the M/V Win Far on April 6. Navy officials said the vessel is being used as a ""mother ship,"" or a floating base, to launch attacks on other ships, including the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama. The Alabama was targeted by pirates in an April hijacking that ended with U.S. Navy snipers shooting dead three pirates who were holding the captain of the ship hostage. According to the Navy's news release Thursday, the flight crew on the SH-60 helicopter ""noticed activity"" on the ship but could not determine if the pirates had fired at them. When the helicopter returned to the USS Chancellorsville, a review of its infrared camera showed the aircraft was fired on. The helicopter did not return fire, according to the release. Since the start of the year, dozens of ships have been attacked or hijacked, according to statistics from the International Maritime Bureau, an organization that monitors piracy around the world.","Helicopter was not struck, all crew members safe .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003, the prosecutor in the case told CNN. The Americans did not appear for trial and are not in custody, but the ruling could effectively make them international fugitives. The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often sent suspects to countries that practice torture. Washington acknowledges making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. The case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric, Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar. He was seized on the streets of Milan, Italy, in 2003, transferred to Egypt and tortured, he said. He was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency. Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials. The verdict ""shows governments and institutions that the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with the law. There are no shortcuts,"" Spataro told CNN. Those who were found guilty were ordered to pay Abu Omar 1 million euros ($1.48 million) and his wife 500,000 euros. A total of 22 Americans were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction. Another -- Robert Seldon Lady, whom prosecutors said was the CIA station chief in Milan -- was sentenced to eight years in jail, prosecutor Armando Spataro told CNN. Cases were dismissed against three other Americans, including Jeff Castelli, the man assumed to be the CIA station chief in Rome at the time, because they had diplomatic immunity from prosecution. Spataro said he may appeal that ruling. Cases were also dismissed against the former head of Italy's intelligence service and his deputy because of state secrecy provisions. Two other Italians were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot. Sabrina De Sousa, one of the American defendants, was ""saddened, angered and dismayed"" by the ruling, her lawyer told CNN. She felt the U.S. government had ""stabbed her in the back,"" Mark Zaid said. ""We understand why the Italians did what they did. They were following their laws. But at the end of the day, representatives of our United States government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government."" De Sousa, a career diplomat, is suing the State Department over the case, Zaid confirmed. She has never said she worked for the CIA. CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday: ""The CIA has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding Abu Omar."" But U.S. officials confirmed to CNN when the case first broke that the CIA was involved in the rendition of Abu Omar from Italy to Egypt. The officials never disclosed the number of Americans involved or their names. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded to the verdict as it applied to an Air Force officer, Lt. Col. Joseph Romano III, who was among the Americans sentenced. The Pentagon had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, a position that the Italian minister of justice supported, Morrell said. ""We are clearly disappointed by the court's ruling,"" Morrell said. ""Our view is that the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lt. Col. Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges."" The American Civil Liberties Union, a persistent critic of Washington's extraordinary rendition program, demanded the United States match Italy's actions. ""The decision in Italy underscores the need for the United States to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the 'extraordinary rendition' program. It is shameful that the first convictions of this kind came from a foreign justice system, where those convicted are not likely to serve their time,"" said Steven Watt, staff attorney for the ACLU Human Rights Program. Italian authorities originally indicted 26 Americans and five Italians in 2007 for kidnapping in the matter. The Italians included the former head of Italian intelligence, Nicolo Pollari, and one of his deputies. They testified in preliminary hearings that Italian intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction. None of the Americans is in custody in Italy and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition; they were tried in absentia. Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer told CNN in the past that the Italian military secret service had approved the operation involving Hassan, and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction. The Italian government of the day -- which was led by Silvio Berlusconi -- vigorously denied having authorized Hassan's kidnapping, which it called illegal. Berlusconi has since returned to power.

"(CNN) -- A brazen, daylight suicide bombing on the African Union's peacekeeping mission in Somalia's capital has killed at least 21 people, mostly peacekeepers, the mission said Friday. The attack came days after U.S. special forces killed Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan, pictured, in southern Somalia. Suicide bombers, disguised in two U.N.-marked vehicles, Thursday rammed through the security gate of the mission's headquarters, which is attached to Mogadishu's airport. They detonated their explosives just as Somalia's transitional government and mission representatives concluded a high-level meeting inside the compound, said the African Union's special representative for Somalia, Nicolas Bwakira. The attack killed four Somali civilians and 17 Ugandan and Burundian soldiers, including the mission's second in command, Burundian Maj. Gen. Juvenal Niyonguruza, he said. The force commander, Ugandan Maj. Gen. Nathan Mugisha, was among the 40 wounded. He assumed command of the African Union Mission in Somalia -- known as AMISOM -- last month. The bombs struck a building that also housed the offices of DynCorp International, a U.S. military contractor that supports the peacekeeping operation, according to Bwakira. It is unclear if any of DynCorp's employees were among those wounded in the strike, and a company representative could not be immediately reached for comment. After the bombings, insurgents fired mortars at the African Union compound in an effort to maximize the number of casualties, Bwakira said. Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the African Union. The strike happened days after U.S. special forces targeted and killed a senior al Qaeda operative in southern Somalia. Analysts immediately hailed the death of Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan on Monday as a major blow to al Qaeda's efforts to work with Al-Shabaab to try to gain a foothold in the lawless country. Days later, however, Al-Shabaab struck back at the most prominent Western-linked target in Mogadishu -- the African Union peacekeeping mission. The African Union has a 3,400-member peacekeeping force in Somalia, made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda. It operates under a U.N. mandate to support Somalia's transitional federal government. The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. It is the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government. Thursday's bombing was the deadliest attack on African Union peacekeepers in Mogadishu. It was also a show of force by Al-Shabaab to the West, particularly after the death of Nabhan, who was considered the main link between al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab. Bwakira said he hoped it would ""galvanize the international community ... to do more and do better"" in helping restore order to Somalia. ""The international community needs to do more, we are not happy with what we have today,"" the African Union ambassador said. ""We need more financial support, military support and the international community needs to deliver that support -- not just deliver lip service."" Suicide bombings have become more common as Al-Shabaab strengthens its ties with al Qaeda, but the bombers rarely are able to penetrate security as deeply as the attackers apparently did Thursday. Western countries vowed not to let the attack deter their mission. The United Nations, European Union, Arab League, United States and others issued a joint statement vowing ""not be deterred by such criminal acts and (to) continue all our efforts to ensure the return of peace and stability in Somalia."" France helped evacuate 17 of those wounded in Thursday's bombing to a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, its foreign ministry said Friday. Other wounded victims were taken to Nairobi by the Nairobi-based charity group AMREF. France and the United States have been supporting Somalia's transitional government on security issues. The United States is supplying arms to Somali forces. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report .","Seventeen soldiers, four civilians killed in attack on African Union base .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Republicans got first serve in their convention last week. Can Democrats break serve, or will the presidential race go to a tiebreaker in November? Here are five things to watch for at the Democratic National Convention: . 1. New man on the big stage -- Most Americans have never heard of the mayor of San Antonio. They will after Tuesday night when Julian Castro becomes the first Latino to give the keynote address at a Democratic convention. Past keynote speakers such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made it to the White House. Maybe that's raising too many expectations for Castro, but his speech will be looked upon the same way. 2. 2016 contenders -- Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan gave blockbuster speeches at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's keynote address didn't go over as well. All three could make bids for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 if Mitt Romney doesn't win in November. So which Democrats are waiting in the wings? Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Brian Schweitzer of Montana and John Hickenlooper of Colorado all have an opportunity in Charlotte. 3. Turncoats -- Is Charlie Crist the Artur Davis of this convention? Davis, the former Democratic congressman from Alabama who seconded Obama's nomination four years ago, had a high-profile speech at the Republican convention. Now it's Crist's turn. What will the former Republican governor of Florida, who could possibly run for his old office as a Democrat, say when he gets in front of the podium in Charlotte? 4. What will Bill Clinton say? -- There's probably more anticipation, and questions, around the former president's Wednesday prime-time address. Once former adversaries when Hillary Clinton was running against Obama, Bill Clinton has become one of Obama's strongest advocates. But the big question is what will Clinton say when he nominates Obama for re-election Wednesday? Obama campaign officials said they haven't seen Clinton's speech yet, but they said they are ""not worried"" about what he'll say. 5. The ticket -- The traditional role of running mate is to be the attack dog. Will Vice President Joe Biden slam Romney as much as Ryan attacked Obama? And how much of what the president will say in his acceptance speech is a defense of his first term and how much is an outline of what he wants to do over the next four years?","San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro will give the keynote address .

"(CNN) -- An image on the website of Pura Vida Studio, in the picturesque Maine town of Kennebunk, shows 18 smiling women and one man flushed after an arduous dance workout. But that's not the full picture, authorities say. Prosecutors say 29-year-old fitness instructor Alexis Wright was paid to have sex with customers in her Zumba studio. She allegedly got help from her business partner Mark Strong, a 57-year-old insurance salesman and private investigator. Wright is accused of having sex with dozens of men and videotaping many of the encounters. Strong's lawyer, Dan Lilley, tells CNN that prosecutors have given him a list of 150 patrons and a computer hard drive with some videos, with erotic titles, that are part of the investigation. Neither Wright -- whose studio is ""now closed,"" according to its website -- nor her attorney, Sarah Churchill, returned calls from CNN. The local district attorney declined to comment on the case. Both of the accused pleaded not guilty this month to prostitution-related charges: 106 against Wright and 59 counts against Strong. Attorneys act to conceal names in Zumba sex case . According to Kennebunk police, authorities were tipped off in September 2011 to illicit activity at the studio. A subsequent investigation, with help from Maine's State Police and the Drug Enforcement Agency, led to the execution of search warrants on February 14. Police arrested Strong on July 10, making the case public for the first time. That was followed by indictments against him and Wright. And the whole case has fueled debate, in Kennebunk and in the courts, about whether the alleged clients should be publicly shamed. Today, the town -- a stone's throw from the tourist haven and rocky shores of Kennebunkport where, among others, former President George H.W. Bush has a seaside home -- is on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Police have been handing out summonses to those accused of soliciting a prostitute; all who receive one would then have to appear in court to answer the misdemeanor charges. According to Lilley, the Johns include lawyers, accountants and even a local TV personality. The Kennebunk Police Department routinely detail who in their community has been charged, with what crime, on its website. But the names of those accused of paying to have sex with Wright have not been published -- at least not yet. In a notice posted online, the department said Friday it is waiting to release names pending an appeal made to the state Supreme Judicial Court of a lower court ruling denying a temporary restraining order to block the identities from getting out. Kennebunk Police plan to hold off releasing further information until the high court weighs in on the case. Until then, tensions are high in Kennebunk about what might happen if some of its most prominent townsfolk are publicly shamed. Josh Raymond, who works at a bakery in the town of just over 5,000 residents, said customers are talking about the scandal, but in hushed tones. And local radio host Stan Bennett said about half his listeners support outing Wright's alleged clients, while half think it's not worth the pain it might cause their children. Despite public pressure not to, the York County Coast Star has signaled its intention to publish the names -- like they would anyone else charged with a crime -- once police release that information. The newspaper's editor, Laura Dolce, wrote the decision to do so wasn't easy, understanding ""many in the community... would prefer we not print the names at all."" But she said listing the names was the right thing to do, making it clear who authorities believe was and was not involved. ""There are people in this community who have had their names dragged through the mud for months because people believe they are on the list,"" Dolce said. ""We also believe that printing the names of those charged with engaging a prostitute is the fair thing to do... to help set the record straight and put to rest the ugly rumors that continue to circulate throughout town.""

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- At least 31 people were dead after two days of torrential rains triggered flash floods in northwestern Turkey, sweeping cars into the sea and sending gushing water into homes and businesses, authorities said Wednesday. A Turkish woman awaits rescuers on her balcony following heavy morning rain in Istanbul. Twenty-six people were killed in Istanbul province and five in neighboring Tekirdag province, according to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Nine people were feared missing, he said. Among the fatalities in Istanbul were seven female textile workers who were trapped in their minivan, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. Witnesses in the city of Istanbul said the flash floods hit at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, washing through an industrial zone situated in a low-lying valley. Dozens of cargo trucks flipped or were ripped to pieces, the wreckage attracting crowds who watched the chaotic scene from nearby hilltops.  See photos of the devastation » .

"(CNN) -- Costa Rica suffered World Cup heartbreak as the United States salvaged a last-gasp 2-2 draw in Washington to deny the visitors an automatic place at next year's finals. Costa Rica's Michael Barrantes was left dejected after the U.S. snatched a late equalizer in Washington. Jonathan Bornstein scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time on Wednesday night to leave Los Ticos needing to beat Uruguay, the fifth-placed team from the South American group, in order to qualify for South Africa. Honduras clinched the third automatic place from the CONCACAF zone on goal difference from Costa Rica after ending their campaign with a 1-0 victory over El Salvador in San Salvador. The U.S. finished top of the six-team group as second-placed Mexico were also held to a 2-2 draw in their final match against bottom side Trinidad and Tobago, with the top two teams having already qualified last weekend.  Football is on the rise in the U.S. Costa Rica had seemed set for a place in the finals after taking a 2-0 lead after only 24 minutes in the American capital, with both goals from Bryan Ruiz. The striker, who plays for Dutch club FC Twente, beat U.S. defender Steve Cherundolo and fired past goalkeeper Tim Howard for the opener in the 21st minute, and then curled in a superb left-foot effort soon after for the second goal. Michael Bradley pulled one back for the hosts in the 72nd minute after captain Landon Donovan's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Keilor Navas, but the U.S. suffered a big blow when defender Oguchi Onyewu was stretchered off with a knee injury nine minutes later. The AC Milan player is expected to be sidelined for three or four months after suffering a torn left patella tendon, the setback coming a day after U.S. forward Charlie Davies was severely injured in a car crash which may rule him out of the finals starting in June. The U.S. had already used all their substitutes when Onyewu went off, so had to finish the match with 10 men. Costa Rica coach Rene Simoes was sent off in time added on before Bornstein headed in a cross from Robbie Rogers to mean the visitors have yet to win a qualifier on U.S. soil in 24 years. ""We put a lot of numbers in the box,"" Bornstein told FIFA's official Web site. ""I don't usually go up for that, but it was last-shot time. No-one marked me. I just snuck in there and the ball landed on my head."" Honduras qualified for only their second finals, 27 years after their debut appearance in Spain, thanks to a 63rd-minute winner from the Central American nation's all-time leading scorer Carlos Pavon. The 36-year-old striker rose highest at the far post to head his 55th goal in 92 internationals and banish bitter memories of the weekend, when he missed a penalty and another late chance from close range as Honduras lost 3-2 to the U.S. at home.","Costa Rica suffer World Cup heartbreak as U.S. salvage last-gasp 2-2 draw .

"(CNN) -- British guitarist Eric Clapton added a few million pounds to his fortune Friday, when a painting out of his private collection garnered a record sum at auction in London. ""Abstraktes Bild (809-4)"" by German painter Gerhard Richter sold for more than $34 million, the highest price ever for work by a living artist, Sotheby's said. The record sum ballooned the monetary value of the painting by over tenfold from its previous auction price in 2001, when it sold within a group of three paintings from the 809 series that together fetched a total of $3,415,750. In a five-minute bidding battle, an unnamed caller beat out two competitors, who also phoned in their offers, to take Richter's work, which translates into English as ""Abstract Picture (809-4)"", for up to double the sum the auction house estimated it would take. Clapton memorabilia auction nets $1.77 million . Sotheby's originally placed the current value of the 1994 oil on canvas work at anywhere between $14 and $19 million, well below the final record bid of $34,190,756. The old record for a work by a living artist was set in May 2010, when American artist Jasper John's painting ""Flag,"" a depiction of the Stars and Stripes, sold for $28,642,500 at Christie's in New York, the auction house said. The record-breaking painting is one in a sequence of four. Another from Richter's 809 series, ""Abstraktes Bild (809-2)"" fetched $3,119,403 at the same auction on Friday, Sotheby's said. Two additional artists achieved career record sums for their works at the auction, though nowhere near the mammoth figure Richter's 809-4 took. A painting titled ""MLR"" by German artist Isa Genzken went for $425,355 and ""Endless Knott"" by Tibetan artist Gonkar Gyatso pulled down $271,409. Richter, who is 80, is famous for dreamlike photo realistic paintings but also for colorful abstract works. He created his 809 series by painting abstract images with mainly primary colors then scraping over them with a squeegee-like object. Richter has compared art to ""the religious search for God,"" in a collection of his quotes published on his website. Richter holds all artists in the highest religious esteem: ""Now there are no priests or philosophers left, artists are the most important people in the world,"" according to a quote on his website from 1966.

"London (CNN) -- Eight female badminton players were disqualified from the Olympics on Wednesday for trying to lose matches the day before, the Badminton World Federation announced after a disciplinary hearing. The players from China, South Korea and Indonesia were accused of playing to lose so they could face easier opponents in future matches, drawing boos from spectators and warnings from match officials Tuesday night. All four pairs of players were charged with not doing their best to win a match and abusing or demeaning the sport. The Indonesian and South Korean pairs appealed the decision, the federation said. But the Chinese sporting authorities accepted the decision and the head badminton coach apologized for the players' behavior. The charges result from two lackluster contests in London that angered the watching crowds as the doubles pairs appeared to be serving into the net on purpose. Live blog: Read live updates on London 2012 . The eight players concerned had all already qualified for the quarterfinals of the tournament before the final matches of the group stage Tuesday night. British sports fans going into the Olympic Park on Wednesday called the scandal ""shocking"" after seeing parts of the matches on television. ""It's not in the spirit of the thing,"" said Kevin Button of Ashford, in Kent, just outside London. ""And it's so disappointing for the people who came to see it,"" said his wife, Tina. ""It leaves a bit of a sour taste."" The disqualifications mean the world's No. 1 pair, Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang of China, are out of the competition. In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which ""neither side seemed to be exerting themselves,"" the official Olympic news service said. After several serves by both pairs went into the net, the tournament referee, Torsten Berg, was called to the court, the news service reported, ""where he warned all four players amid a chorus of boos from the crowd."" Five things to watch for Wednesday . The South Koreans eventually won the ""repeatedly interrupted match,"" securing first place in their group, according to the news service. But that puts them in the same side of the draw as Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei, a Chinese duo who are ranked No. 2 in the world. The second match in question took place about an hour later, pitting South Korea's Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung against the Indonesians Meiliana Jauhari and Greysia Polii. Play in that contest was ""sluggish early on,"" the Olympic news service reported, and Berg was called onto the court at least twice ""with the crowd calling for the players to be sent off."" Former badminton player Andy Goode, who represented Team GB at the 1992 Olympics and managed the team four years later, said the disqualification was the right call for the sake of the sport. ""It was a decision they had to make, and they had to make quickly,"" he said. ""I've never seen any sporting event, any major event, where two players or two pairs just stood on a court and haven't tried."" The best photos from the Olympics . But Goode said the kind of tactical play seen Tuesday ""does go on,"" especially in countries where the team ethic is very important. ""These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games,"" he said. The world champion Chinese pair, Wang and Yu, ""were going for gold, and this was just part of their journey to get to that gold."" They probably didn't see anything wrong with what they did because they were focused on the next round and winning medals for their country, he said. Goode said he hoped the furor would not have a negative effect on the racket sport longer term, given the swift response by its governing officials. ""They've come clean, they've disqualified them straightaway, they've done the good thing, because sports like badminton rely on being in the Olympic Games,"" he said. ""If the image of badminton is tarnished and they are taken out of the Games, the European badminton countries will suffer, because without the funding to get into the Olympics, there is hardly a circuit to be able to make enough money to play full time."" Ye Shiwen's 'unbelievable' swims are talk of the Olympics . The Chinese Olympic delegation ""fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish"" its athletes, it said in a statement. ""The actions of Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli on the court have violated Olympic principles and the spirit of fair athletic competition. The Chinese Sports Delegation feels saddened,"" it said. The delegation is investigating the Chinese players' conduct, it said, ""and will make appropriate rulings based on the result."" The head coach of the Chinese badminton team, Li Yongbo, expressed contrition for what had happened. ""As the head coach, I owe the fans and the Chinese an apology,"" he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. ""Chinese players failed to demonstrate their fighting spirit of the national team. It's me to blame."" The debacle has prompted wide debate on social media, with opinion divided on whether the players were exercising tactical nous within a poorly designed system or were guilty of failing the Olympic spirit and bringing the game into disrepute. Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London Olympic organizing committee, was clear where he stood on the controversy, describing the spectacle as ""depressing "" and ""unacceptable."" ""I mean, who wants to sit through something like that?"" he asked. He predicted that the badminton federation would take the apparent match-throwing ""really seriously."" The game of badminton dates back centuries but has been an Olympic sport only since 1992. Competition has been dominated by China, Indonesia, South Korea and Denmark, according to the federation. Although not widely played in the United States, badminton -- viewed as one of the fastest racket sports -- is popular in many European and Asian nations. OfficialBadminton.com says it is played by 200 million people worldwide and is the national sport of Indonesia and Singapore.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Airline pilots and cabin crew across Europe are holding demonstrations Monday to protest over rules governing their flying hours which they say are putting the lives of passengers at risk. European pilots and cabin crew are calling for shorter flying times to protect passenger safety. Organized by the European Cockpit Association (ECA), and the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF), protesters are demanding that European Union rules on flying times are brought into line with scientific evidence. The Moebus Report -- mandated by the EU in September 2008 -- recommends that an airline crew should not operate for more than 13 hours during the day and 10 hours at night. Current EU rules stipulate pilots work up to a maximum of 14 hours during the day and nearly 12 hours at night. Are you concerned at the hours worked by airline pilots? Tell us. Speaking from one of the protests outside the European Parliament in Brussels, Captain Martin Chalk, President of the ECA told CNN: ""At the moment, the EU level is not adequate. That's not our view that is the view of experts employed to review the EU's own level of protection."" Chalk said that despite being in possession of the report, the EU completely ignored the recommendations when they produced new fatigue proposals in January 2009. The ECA and the ETF have printed over 100,000 dummy airline tickets which they will hand out to airline passengers. The tickets contain cigarette-style warnings giving details on crew fatigue and an explanation as to why the EU current legislation needs to be changed. ""All we are trying to do at this stage is raise public's awareness. We're not trying to get in anyone's way,"" Chalk said. Hundreds of protesters are attending events taking place at 22 airports across Europe. 400 ECA members are expected to attend the protests at Madrid airport. ""What we are saying today is that they need to listen to the safety review,"" Chalk said. ""It was conducted by the best scientists in this field in Europe. It was commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and therefore it should not be ignored when writing the rules."" Francois Ballestero, Political Secretary of the ETF echoed Chalk's concerns. ""Flight safety is the core mission of every cabin crew member. But EU law is insufficient to ensure that air crew can perform their safety role in an alert and effective way,"" he said. But the EASA were critical of the protests and their timing. ""This is jumping the gun. It is not a constructive contribution to a debate which is yet to happen,"" Daniel Hoeltgen, EASA communications director told CNN. Hoeltgen believes that the pilots are simply setting up stall for an industrial debate between the unions and the airlines. ""It's got nothing to do with safety regulations.

"(CNN) -- The popular site Twitter crashed again on Wednesday morning. The microblogging site was down for about an hour and a half, with service restored at about 8 a.m. ET. During the outage, the site's users saw an ""extremely high volume of whales,"" the company said in a blog post.  When Twitter breaks, a cartoon whale -- nicknamed a ""fail whale"" -- pops up on computer screens instead of the functioning site. The fail whale has become an iconic symbol for Twitter, and a way for the company to try to embrace and make light of its shortcomings. ""A sudden failure coupled with problems in switching to a backup system produced a high number of errors for around 90 minutes,"" Twitter wrote in a post to its status blog. ""This made the site largely inaccessible. No data was lost or compromised during this outage."" Wednesday's down time was the first major outage at Twitter since it and other sites were attacked in early August, according to reports. ""Reliability has been an ongoing project for Twitter as the service has scaled up to handle growing traffic,"" Rich Miller wrote on the blog Data Center Knowledge. Mashable's Ben Parr wrote that news from Haiti may have contributed. ""What exactly took down the microblogging service, we don't know (some speculate that a wave of tweets due to this morning's 6.1 earthquake in Haiti could be partly responsible),"" he wrote. On Twitter, some users made light of the situation after service was restored. ""@BillGates joined the twitterverse,"" one user wrote. ""Rough seas out here, I hope the Fail Whale won't eat him :P :D"" Twitter, a Web site where users post 140-character messages to their public followers, was founded in May 2007. It grew at breakneck pace last year and experienced a number of outages as a result. Some online writers have speculated that the Web site's traffic has started to slow or decline in recent weeks. In a Twitter post on January 12, company CEO Evan Williams wrote that the site continues to grow. ""Across all metrics that matter, yesterday was Twitter's highest-usage day ever. (And today will be bigger.),"" he wrote.","The popular site Twitter crashed on Wednesday morning .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- When Jimmy Wales visited the headquarters of Hudong.com last month, he had one question for its founder: is it possible for Wikipedia to be the number one online encyclopedia in China? Don't call me Jimmy: Pan Haidong, head of Hudong.com, the largest Chinese encyclopedia website. ""Absolutely not,"" was the response of Pan Haidong, head of Hudong.com, the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia website. ""Because there is Hudong here in China. Of course we are a copycat of Wikipedia but we have a lot of innovations, and we do a lot of work here in China so it is totally different actually,"" Pan told CNN. It's been a year since China's government lifted its ban on the Chinese version of U.S.-based Wikipedia yet it remains unclear whether Wikipedia has gained any share of the country's massive Internet readership. Shortly after Wikipedia was launched in China in 2002, the country's Internet censors began to intermittently block access to both Chinese and English versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years. In recent months, Wales has held a series of meetings with officials from the State Council Information Office, the government body charged with internet censorship in China, to establish a dialogue between the Wikipedia community and Chinese government. He says they have not discussed why the website was banned. ""We have a friendly relationship,"" Wales told CNN. ""But in terms of getting down to the nitty gritty of what happened, I have no idea. It is not really a big concern."" What is a big concern for Wales is whether Wikipedia can compete with the country's two homegrown encyclopedia websites that emerged while Wikipedia was blocked: Hudong.com and Baidu Baike, an online knowledge sharing site launched by Baidu, the No. 1 search engine in China. One challenge Wikipedia faces is it lacks the brand recognition in China that is otherwise nearly universal. ""I had an English-speaking, college-educated tour guide [in Beijing], and he asked me what I do?"" Wales told CNN. ""I said, 'I am the founder of Wikipedia.' He had a blank stare. He had no idea what Wikipedia was. This would not happen anywhere else in the world. Everyone knows Wikipedia if they are using the internet."" Wales said he is trying to mobilize the local Chinese Wikipedia community to spread more awareness about the online encyclopedia but otherwise has not outlined a specific strategy to beat its more entrenched domestic competitors. ""I think I am going to have to come to China a lot and do interviews so people can learn about Wikipedia,"" said Wales. ""Once people come to understand it that will be helpful for our cause."" 'No reason for China to use Wikipedia' Yet Wales' star power alone may not be enough to convert China's 300 million internet users into Wikipedians, or volunteers who run the website. ""There's, in fact, no reason for China to use Wikipedia, a service based 'out there,'"" Baidu's chief scientist William Chang said at a 2008 internet conference in Beijing. ""It's very natural for China to make its own products."" And it is also very natural for Chinese to use domestic encyclopedia websites that some say are better suited to the online habits and informational demands of the country's exploding population of internet surfers. ""We know the market better,"" said Pan, founder of Hudong.com. ""That is why we can get a bigger share of it."" Hudong has more than 3 million articles and 1.7 million registered users, according to its website. Baidu Baike has nearly 2 million entries; Chinese Wikipedia has just 280,000 and over 700 thousand members. English Wikipedia has more than 3 million articles and over 10 million volunteers. ""We have the largest team here who are more familiar with the wiki concept and wiki operations in China,"" Pan told CNN. ""Of course we are more focused on the wiki community, which means we need to get a lot of people involved to make it grow."" Hudong.com utilizes a range of social networking functions to attract Chinese internet users, including chat forums, fan groups, short messaging services and bulletin boards. Nearly 100 million Chinese netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards, according to research from China Internet Network Information Center. The website rewards members through a ranking system where users are upgraded to a higher status on the site based on the points they earn. Members also can win prizes, like laptops and iPods, for high participation on the site. Baidu Baike has a similar model. Wikipedia uses a reputation system to promote its members based on their participation on the website and the quality of the content they contribute. Promotion is subject to peer approval, and the site's volunteer administrators are elected by the community. ""The entry barrier is really high on Wikipedia for Chinese users,"" said Pan. ""We don't have a very hierarchical structure to say who is managing this or who is managing that."" Instead both Hudong.com and Baidu Baike have a centralized management structure. Paid staff are charged with mobilizing the community to contribute to certain topics as well as filter out content that might offend the Chinese government. Saying 'no' to censorship . Wales has refused to comply with Chinese censorship rules, which means certain pages containing sensitive information on both English and Chinese Wikipedia remain inaccessible. ""The question is how comfortable is China about just describing the facts?"" said Wales. ""In some cases that is not completely clear, so right now there are certain pages that are filtered from Wikipedia. We don't support that but we also can't do anything about it. But it is far better than just blocking the entire site. Far better for China and for us."" Since Hudong's and Baidu Baike's business operations are based in China, the companies have little choice but to comply with government policy or face the same fate as Wikipedia. ""If there is something that the government doesn't want, we don't talk about it,"" said Pan. ""We just follow the law."" Which is why in the long run many Chinese Wikipedians say their website will win. ""I don't think they can become a reference book like Wikipedia because they don't have a serious community focusing on improving the quality of content as well as trying to respect neutral point of view,"" said Isaac Mao, a Chinese Wikipedian and blogger. ""They have to follow the hidden rules and you never know what those are."" However Pan said Hudong's content, in time, will improve if the Chinese government continues to gradually loosen its grip on the internet. ""I have been seeing a lot of improvement,"" said Pan. ""So we should be glad for that, of course."" Wales also said Wikipedia's reemergence in China, albeit at times unreliable, is a sign that Beijing's web policy is changing. ""We are hopeful,"" said Wales. ""Wikipedia has been open for more than a year, and we are hoping that will continue. We would like for Wikipedia to have as much impact in China as it has in other places around the world."" Pan's doesn't believe it will happen. ""There is no way,"" said Pan. ""I don't want to be the Jimmy Wales of China. I just want to say that we want to do something good for society. That is our dream actually.""","Home-grown online encyclopedias much more popular than Wikipedia in China .

"(CNN) -- In a world of politicians who memorize sound bites and regurgitate them like robots, Joe Biden is different. Biden says it as he sees it. And, yes, that philosophy can lead to a few gaffes. OK, in Biden's case, a lot of gaffes. But that's the risk with being real. Maybe Joe Biden isn't always ""presidential"" as that word has come to be defined, but isn't it about time we revised the definition of that word? Sadly, it has come to mean a staid, reserved person who shows almost no emotion -- almost like Spock from ""Star Trek."" But presidents and vice presidents are still human beings and should be allowed and encouraged to act like it. Look at Biden at Thursday night's vice-presidential debate: He laughed, he almost cried, he got angry, he looked to the heavens, he laughed some more. Joe Biden gave us a veritable one-man show. It was a tour de force. After Biden retires from politics, he should seriously consider touring the nation with a show: ""Being Biden"" or ""Say it ain't so, Joe."" Opinion roundup: Feisty Biden, wonky Ryan . Mitt Romney may now be finally learning how to ""let Mitt be Mitt,"" but that has never been Biden's problem. Joe Biden wears Joe Biden on his sleeve. Biden is a mix of Bill Clinton and Clint Eastwood. He's warm and relatable like Clinton, but also you get a sense of unpredictability as we did when watching Eastwood at the Republican National Convention. (My dream debate is Joe Biden versus Clint Eastwood. Add the empty chair and you have the makings of a hit reality show.) Debate coach: It's the Biden show! There has been a lot written about whether Biden went too far at the debate. Did he laugh too much? Was he too impassioned? Too animated? (One of my favorite moments occurred early in the debate when Ryan was answering a question and Biden turned to the camera a la ""Ferris Bueller"" and gave us a look of: ""You've got to be kidding me."") But does anyone doubt that those were organic reactions by Biden? People can debate all day whether Biden should have reined in his feelings, but those were his true emotions. Romney hammers Biden on Libya remark . Instead of media pundits and the public attacking people like Biden when they show honest emotion, we should applaud it. In fact, we should demand it from all of our presidential candidates. There should be one presidential debate that is not about the dry figures of deficit reduction or oil company subsidies, etc., but about heart. Gergen: Partisans are fired up on both sides . We need a debate that that reveals who they really are beneath their expensive suits with the American flag pins on their lapels. Questions that raise issues that aren't black and white, but hundreds of shades of gray. Such as, what would you to say to the parents of a child who was killed in a war that you pushed for? What do you tell a family that is scraping by to make ends meet about why you think millionaires shouldn't have to pay slightly higher taxes? What would you say to a young woman who doesn't want to have an abortion, but you are advocating cutting the government funding that she needs to raise her child? Opinion: Like a father-son brawl . How would Mitt Romney or President Obama do in response to those type of questions? Probably OK. Obama would be law professoresque but trying to fake some emotion. Romney would give us a memorized answer that has been sanitized by consultants after a gaggle of focus groups. Neither horrible, yet neither compelling. But there is no doubt that Biden would be the big winner. Look, if you want ""Candidate-enstein"" or ""Franken-tician,"" a creature designed by high-priced political consultants from the spare parts of past political campaigns, be my guest. There are boatloads of them. But there's only one Joe Biden. And that is truly a shame. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Joe Biden displayed full range of emotions, expressions in debate .
He says Biden is one of the few authentic personalities in our political world .

"(CNN) -- Filipino government officials and Muslim rebel leaders are set to sign a landmark peace deal Monday aimed at ending a long-running insurgency in the nation's troubled south. The ""framework agreement"" paves the way for a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims in Mindanao, President Benigno Aquino III announced earlier this month. ""We're very hopeful of this particular agreement,"" presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte said in a radio interview, according to a report Sunday from the state-run Philippine News Agency. The deal sets up mechanisms to tackle issues such as power structure and revenues in the southern region, which will be named Bangsamoro. The new region is expected to replace the current one by 2016, when the president's term ends, according to officials. ""It deserves a name that symbolizes and honors the struggles of our forebears in Mindanao, and celebrates the history and character of that part of our nation,"" the president said. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines, having been blamed for a host of attacks and skirmishes that have left tens of thousands dead. Yet even as this violence unfolded, rebels have been negotiating for 15 years with officials from the Manila-based government. Aquino has said the agreement ""brings all former secessionist groups into the fold,"" and that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is no longer seeking to form a new nation. The latter group's chairman, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, is set to witness the agreement's signing at Malacanang Palace in Manila, the official home and workplace of the Philippines' president. His group is estimated to have 12,000 members, but military sources say it may have been splintered when government troops conducted offensives in 2000. Some leaders of another group, the Moro National Liberation Front, are also expected to attend. Its head, Nur Misuari, had opposed the pact, feeling it wasn't in sync with previous peace deals agreed upon in 1976 and 1996, the state news agency reported. Dean Marvic Leonen, chairman of the government peace panel, explained that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is a rebel group while Moro National ""is a political organization."" Even as preparations continued for the 1:30 p.m. signing, fresh security concerns emerged after a weekend explosion just east of Manila. A ""fragmentation grenade"" exploded 1:15 a.m. Saturday in the basement of a San Juan building, a report on the president's website said, though there were no reports of injuries. After the blast, Valte said there are no known terror threats but the Philippine National Police are on ""full alert"" status ahead of Monday's signing and visits by several foreign dignitaries, including Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak.

"KURUTHU, India (CNN)  -- In a single, tragic day, Chandrasekhar Sankurathri lost everything he loved. More than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed at Chandrasekhar Sankurathri's eye hospital. ""Nobody should go through what I've been through in my life,"" he says. Sankurathri's wife and two young children were flying on Air India Flight 182 from Ottawa, Canada, to Bombay, India (now known as Mumbai), in 1985 when a bomb exploded, killing everyone on board. ""I used to think maybe they landed someplace. Maybe somebody rescued them, you know,"" he says. For three years he stumbled through his daily routine as a biologist in Ottawa, not wanting to believe the truth. ""I was really lost,"" he remembers. After considerable soul-searching, Sankurathri made a decision few others might -- to turn his personal pain into an opportunity to help those less fortunate. In 1988, he quit his job, sold his home and returned to India, where he was born, and where he believed he could do the most good. ""India has so many problems,"" says Sankurathri, 64. Two in particular caught his attention: a lack of school attendance and rampant blindness. With the money he had, Sankurathri created a foundation in his wife's name, and in turn, built a school and an eye hospital in the small rural village of Kuruthu, not far from his wife's birthplace. Today, his foundation's efforts to empower the poor through education and health care are having significant success. Since it's creation in 1992, Sarada School -- named for the 4-year-old daughter Sankurathri lost -- has grown from one grade to nine. More than 1,200 students have graduated and many of them have gone on to high school and college. Sankurathri keeps in touch with past students. ""We act like a big family,"" he says. In a country where the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates the national primary school dropout rate is more than 50 percent, Sankurathri proudly says that not one of his students has ever dropped out.  Watch Sankurathri talk about the school he started in memory of his family » . The same buses that pick up students for Sankurathri's school in the morning are often used later in the day to bring eye care patients from other rural areas to the Srikiran Institute of Ophthalmology, Sankurathri's eye hospital, named for the 7-year-old son he lost. Since the hospital's opening in 1993, more than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed, 90 percent of them free. ""We see close to 350 outpatients a day and perform 80 surgeries per day,"" he says. ""Our mission is to provide quality eye care with compassion, which is equitable, accessible and affordable to all."" But Sankurathri has found that getting patients the care they need often requires educating the public first. ""In India, people are so ignorant. They think cataract blindness is not curable,"" he says. ""They are not aware that it is curable and that it is a simple operation."" In fact, about 75 percent of India's estimated 15 million blind people could avoid blindness with prevention or medical treatment, according to Vision 2020 India. Sankurathri is amazed and delighted by the transformation that occurs after each cataract surgery.  Watch Sankurathri explain how he is helping the blind to see again » . ""Just within a few hours, you make their lives totally different,"" he says. ""Their whole life changes -- the way they walk, they act, they smile."" The goal, Sankurathri says, is not only to help the blind see again, but also to lead a better life. Sankurathri has been back in India for almost 20 years. He insists his work does not make him special. ""I'm just an ordinary human being trying to do my best to help others.""  Watch Sankurathri explain how he turned his personal grief into the gift of sight for thousands » . He also believes his journey to honor those he loved has not been a solitary one.

"(CNN) -- It was a sight Andy Murray's hordes of British fans had longed to see -- the world No. 4 celebrating on Wimbledon's Centre Court after defeating Roger Federer in a final. Murray's emphatic straight-sets triumph over the world No. 1 in the men's singles gold medal match at London 2012 showed that, despite tasting defeat in four major finals, the Scot could finally be ready to win his first grand slam title at the U.S. Open. That is the view of former major winners Mats Wilander and Goran Ivanisevic, who have tipped the third seed to break his major hoodoo in New York -- where Murray was beaten by Federer in the 2008 final. Clijsters ready for U.S. Open farewell . ""My prediction for the U.S. Open is Andy Murray winning,"" seven-time grand slam champion Wilander told the ATP Champions Tour website ahead of next week's opening matches in the two-week tournament at Flushing Meadows. ""I'm not saying that just because he won the Olympics, it's because I think that he's a different man. ""I think that Ivan Lendl has helped him tremendously. He's becoming better physically all the time, he hits his forehand better, but the biggest difference is emotionally. ""He's more even-keeled, he's more positive, and there's not as much pressure for him at the U.S. Open as there is at Wimbledon."" Murray, who will play American Alex Bogomolov Jr. in the U.S. Open first round, won the Flushing Meadows event as a junior in 2004 but has so far been frustrated in three grand slam title matches by 17-time grand slam winner Federer -- including in last month's Wimbledon final. He lost to former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in last year's Australian Open final, but defeated the Serbian in the Olympic semis this month. Wilander, who won the U.S. Open in 1988 as he topped the world rankings, believes the 25-year-old Murray can produce his top form on his favorite hard-court surface. ""The hard courts in New York are a little quicker than in Australia, which suit him,"" said the Swede. ""I do think Andy Murray is one-up against Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic after the Olympics -- he knows that he can beat them back-to-back now. ""I think five-set matches, with the attitude he has now, are going to favor him and when he plays well with a good attitude he is at least as good a player as the other top three."" Murray is bidding to become the first British male to win a grand slam title since Fred Perry in 1936, and he is more confident than ever he can deliver a long-awaited success. ""I think in the short term (my confidence has grown), certainly,"" Murray, who became the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final since 1938, told the U.S. Open's official website. ""But things change in tennis and in sport really, really quick. In the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments, normally you'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches."" Murray also hailed the impact of coach Lendl, who knows what it takes to win grand slams having claimed eight during an 18-year playing career in which he topped the world rankings. ""Tactically, for sure, he's very good,"" Murray said of the Czech-born American. ""Very minor technical things. But also just his experience, knowing how to schedule your tournaments. A year like this year is incredibly busy, very different to what we're used to with the Olympics. ""Having someone like him around who understands that, can also pass on his experiences to not just me but the rest of my team, as well, he's been a huge benefit. ""Also, after I lost Wimbledon, having someone like him who's been through that before to talk to, the best ways to deal with it and move on from it, all that stuff's helped. That's why I wanted to work with him. Not just me, but my whole team's enjoyed having him around. I hope he's enjoyed it, too."" One man who knows all about waiting for a first grand slam title is Ivanisevic. The Croatian did not play in a major final until his remarkable run to the Wimbledon title as a wildcard in 2001 -- 13 years after turning professional. The former world No. 2 doesn't see the absence of injured 11-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal as having any bearing on Murray's chances. ""I think Andy is ready, with or without him,"" said Ivanisevic. ""He has beaten Rafa before anyway. If Andy plays well, he can win it. ""I would really like to see him win it -- he deserves it. He played a really great Olympic Games and I think this will give him extra motivation and confidence. The U.S. Open is his best surface so I think he will do it.""

"London, England (CNN) -- China will execute within a few hours a British man convicted of smuggling heroin, his family said Monday. Akmal Shaikh, 53, has been informed by the Chinese authorities that he will be executed, said Seema Khan and Latif Shaikh, first cousins of the condemned man. The relatives told CNN that Shaikh's mother had not been informed of his execution, scheduled for Tuesday morning. ""We are keeping the news away from her,"" Khan said. ""We don't feel she can take the news and bear the brunt of it."" Shaikh has exhausted all his legal appeals. The Chinese government is not known to give 11th-hour reprieves. But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless ""hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion."" Shaikh's supporters maintain he is mentally ill and that Chinese officials did not take that into account when trying him. A United Nations official has asked China not to go forward with the execution. Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, has said it would be a ""major step backwards for China"" to execute a mentally ill man. ""Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty,"" Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve, a British legal group. ""I very much hope that the government will grant clemency in this case."" Britain too has asked China not to execute Shaikh. ""The British Government has been doing and will continue to do everything within its power to secure a fair trial and clemency on the death penalty for Akmal Shaikh,"" a Downing Street spokesman said Monday. ""The prime minister has intervened personally on a number of occasions: he has raised the case with Premier Wen (Jiabao), most recently at the Copenhagen summit; and has written several times to President Hu (Jintao). At every level ... the government has raised its concerns, made clear our opposition to the death penalty, and requested a full mental health assessment. We will remain engaged in the coming hours."" China says it has followed the law. ""This case has always been handled according to law. During the trial, the defendant has been guaranteed his legal rights,"" Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said last week. ""Everyone knows that international drug smuggling is a grave crime."" Shaikh was convicted of carrying up to 4 kilograms (almost 9 pounds) of heroin at the Urumqi Airport in September 2007. His final appeal -- to the People's Supreme Court -- was rejected a week ago. He would be the first European Union citizen executed in China in 50 years, Reprieve said. The organization says Shaikh may be suffering from bipolar disorder, which is characterized by delusional and manic behavior. The group says Chinese authorities have refused requests for Shaikh to be examined by a doctor and for his mental condition to be taken into account during his trial and sentencing. ""We deeply regret that mental health concerns had no bearing on the final judgment despite requests by Mr. Shaikh's defense lawyer and repeated calls by the prime minister, ministers, members of the opposition, as well as [the] European Union,"" the British Foreign Office said last week. A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN in October there was no evidence of mental illness. ""The British Embassy and a British organization proposed to have a psychological exam but could not offer any proof of mental illness,"" the spokesman said. ""The defendant himself said that his family does not have a history of mental illness."" Shaikh said he was given a suitcase to carry by another man who had duped him into believing he was traveling to China to become a nightclub performer, and was unaware that the bag contained drugs. Reprieve campaigners have revealed details of Shaikh's erratic lifestyle prior to his arrest -- including traveling to Poland to start an airline and then on to Central Asia to become a pop star. While living in Poland, Shaikh was approached by a man who helped him write a song that Shaikh believed would bring world peace, according to Reprieve. The man said he knew people in Kyrgyzstan who could help Shaikh become a pop star. Once there, Shaikh was introduced to another man called Okole, who told him he owned a nightclub in China where they would launch his singing career. The pair traveled together to Tajikistan, staying in a five-star hotel. Okole then told Shaikh he would have to travel on to China himself because there was only one seat available on the plane -- and gave him the suitcase to carry, according to Reprieve. Forensic psychologist Peter Schaapveld said he suspects Shaikh is suffering from a severe mental disorder. Schaapveld traveled to Urumqi this year for Shaikh's appeal hearing but was unable to meet Shaikh or attend the appeal. He said British consular staff told him court officials had been ""bemused and amused"" by Shaikh's ""incoherent"" testimony. Schaapveld also examined hundreds of pages of rambling e-mails sent by Shaikh to the British Embassy in Poland and various public figures, including then-U.S. President George W. Bush and former Beatle Paul McCartney. He said the evidence ""very clearly"" suggested Shaikh was ""probably suffering from bipolar disorder and may also have an additional delusional psychosis."" CNN's Jo Ling Kent in Beijing and Zain Verjee and Simon Hooper in London contributed to this report.","China will execute British man convicted of smuggling heroin within hours, his family says .

"(CNN) -- A member of a politically powerful family in the southern Philippines pleaded not guilty to dozens of murder charges filled against him in connection with a November massacre in Maguindanao province, Philippine news outlets reported. Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. pleaded ""not guilty to all the 41 charges,"" Leila de Lima, chairwoman of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, told reporters at Camp Crame where the trial is being held, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN said. Ampatuan could face an additional 16 charges in the Nov. 23 massacre that killed 57 people. Authorities have said the killings were part of a politically motivated attempt to keep an opponent of the politically powerful Ampatuan family from running for governor. Thirty journalists were among those killed. Authorities raided a warehouse and ranch belonging to the Ampatuan family last month and confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindanao command, said at the time. Following the killings, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law on Dec. 4 before lifting it eight days later, saying it had achieved its objectives. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. pleads not guilty to murder charges .

"(CNN) -- Much of the East Coast was digging out Sunday after a monster winter storm caused record snowfall in some areas, disrupting holiday travel and shopping and leaving at least four people dead. But the worst of it appeared to be in sight. Winter storm warnings for New York and Long Island expired at 11 a.m. ET Sunday, and warnings for the Boston, Massachusetts, metro area and much of southeastern New England expired at noon. By early Sunday, Bethesda, Maryland, had recorded a whopping 23 inches of snow, and Medford, New Jersey, had seen 24 inches. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received its second-highest snowfall in a single event, with 23.2 inches. Is wintry weather affecting you? Share stories, photos or videos . Washington's Dulles International and Reagan National airports saw snowfall of 18 inches and 16.4 inches, respectively -- the highest one-day totals ever for December. The previous record at Dulles was 10.6 inches in December 1964, and at Reagan National, it was 11.5 inches in December 1932. East Coast travelers again were warned to expect treacherous roads Sunday and face flight delays and cancellations. Dulles was accepting flights and had one runway open Sunday, said Tara Hamilton of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. A runway opened at Reagan National just before 1 p.m., and flights began taking off. New York's LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark airports were all open Sunday morning, according to the Port Authority of New York. However, air traffic was light, said spokesman Steve Coleman. ""The runways are good to go,"" he said. But 1,200 flights had been canceled by the airlines at the three airports, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. JFK airport canceled the most flights, with 550 grounded. American Airlines canceled 160 flights Sunday and has canceled another 20 set for Monday, said airline spokesman Charley Wilson. The 20 Boston and New York flights were grounded because of the backlog of flights the airline has to manage in the wake of the storm. See flight delay info on the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site . Elsewhere in New York, the Long Island Railroad was running limited service, but train service was suspended on several branches. Two people were killed in weather-related crashes, the Virginia State Police said Sunday, and ""there are two additional deaths that are likely related to the winter storm."" See traffic and road closure information . Virginia Gov. Timothy Kaine authorized up to 1,000 National Guardsmen to assist in response to the storm, which had dumped up to 18 inches of snow in parts of the region by Saturday evening. Through 8 a.m. Sunday, Virginia State Police had responded to more than 6,100 calls for service, nearly half of those for traffic crashes and disabled vehicles. The storm, known as a nor'easter, blanketed the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated I-95 corridor. However, the interstate itself was in good shape Sunday morning, reported CNN producer Xuan Thai, who drove to Washington from Philadelphia. She said while traffic was extremely light, snowplows were out and the roads were cleared. Meanwhile, people in western North Carolina were digging out from the powerful storm. About 28,000 households had no power into Sunday night, including 24,118 in Asheville's Buncombe County, said Drew Elliot, spokesman for Progress Energy. That's down from 50,000 in Buncombe on Saturday. Power has been restored to 39,000 households, according to Elliot, but new outages continue as trees or branches fall on power lines. While the majority of customers should have electricity by Monday, ""We don't see full restoration until midweek,"" Elliot said. The weather delayed the start of two National Football League games Sunday. The Chicago Bears-Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers-Philadelphia Eagles games began at 4:15 p.m. ET instead of 1 p.m. to allow crews to clear streets and walkways in and around stadiums. The weekend storm could rival the Knickerbocker blizzard of 1922, which dropped between 28 and 33 inches of snow in the Washington area, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. ""I don't know that it will be a record-breaker, but this is significant,"" Maginnis said. ""This is a really bad storm."" The foul weather prompted an emergency declaration in Washington, stranded hundreds of motorists, shut down airports, caused power outages and threatened to keep hordes of holiday shoppers indoors. New York City sanitation staffers worked all night to dig out, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Sunday. The heaviest snow fell in the eastern part of the city -- 12 inches in the Rockaways, he said, as opposed to 6 inches in the Bronx. Officials were focusing on clearing the highways and bus routes before surface streets, he said, but it estimated most streets would be cleared by Sunday night. Authorities reported ""no major snow-related incidents,"" Bloomberg said. Virginia State Police reported travel was still hazardous in several areas Sunday, saying, ""Virginians are still discouraged from traveling unless absolutely necessary."" Slick road conditions, disabled vehicles and crashes were reported on I-81 through the New River Valley west of Roanoke, authorities said, and U.S. 29 was also hazardous. Numerous vehicles were pulled off I-81 overnight Saturday and early Sunday. On I-81 Saturday night, authorities moved motorists to shelters because of traffic stoppages, said Bob Spieldenner, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. Those people were being taken back to their cars and put back on the road Sunday, he said. About 73,000 utility customers were without power Sunday, he said. Washington Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is ""perhaps the biggest we've seen in several years."" ""We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the District open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend,"" Fenty said as he announced the snow emergency. But he also urged residents to stay put in their homes. ""We urge everyone if you don't have to go anywhere, wait. This snow should end early tomorrow morning with a 24-hour cleanup,"" Fenty said. ""We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday. And, hopefully, all of it done between Monday and Wednesday."" Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and city snow plow collided, a Washington fire official said. The injuries are not considered serious. The storm also halted above-ground Metrorail operations in the District because of the ""heavy snowfall that is covering the electrified third rail,"" according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin on Saturday declared a state of emergency and ""authorized the use of the National Guard to assist with snow removal and emergency assistance and operations."" Manchin said West Virginia is working to help stranded motorists, clear roadways and restore power outages. Farther north, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency after forecasts of up to 15 inches of snow with 30-mph winds between Saturday night and late Sunday morning.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI canonized five new saints Sunday, including a 19th-century priest who worked with ostracized leprosy patients in Hawaii before contracting the disease himself and dying from it. Pope Benedict XVI canonized five new saints Sunday in a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Jozef De Veuster, better known as Father Damien, was elevated to sainthood along with the four others in a solemn Mass that was moved indoors from St. Peter's Square to the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City because of an early morning thunderstorm. Thousands attended, including the woman whose cure from cancer was attributed to her praying to Damien. The church counts her cure as one of two miracles the priest performed -- a key requirement for sainthood. The others who were canonized Sunday are: . -- Zygmunt Szczesny Felinski, a Polish bishop who kept championing Catholicism after Russia shut down Polish churches in retaliation for the Polish uprising against Russia in Warsaw in 1861. -- Jeanne Jugan, a French nun who set up an order that runs homes for destitute around the world. -- Francisco Coll y Guitart, a Spaniard who founded an order of Dominicans in the 19th century. -- Rafael Arnaiz Baron, another Spaniard, who wrote extensively about spirituality before his death at age 27. Damien was born in Belgium and went to Hawaii in the 1870s in place of his ill brother. At the time, the kingdom of Hawaii banished its leprosy patients to Kalaupapa, a 5-square-mile village on the island of Molokai. Because of the stigma attached to the disease, doctors refused to treat patients and society ostracized them. Damien volunteered to serve as pastor there, and did so for 16 years. He died at age 49 after contracting leprosy, which is now called Hansen's disease. Today, Kalaupapa is a national park and home to 25 residents, there because of the disease. All of them are cured, but have chosen to stay because it is their life-long home. Hansen's disease is a bacterial disease characterized by skin sores, nerve damage and gradual debilitation. Though it was once feared as highly contagious, it is not particularly transmissible and is easily treated with antibiotics. The Catholic Diocese of Honolulu had long sought canonization for Damien. Sainthood is bestowed only after a thorough examination of the person's life and requires two documented miracles. In Damien's case, the church considered the overnight healing 100 years ago of a French nun who was on her deathbed from an intestinal ailment. It also considered the case of Audrey Toguchi, a public school teacher, who fully recovered from liposarcoma in 1999 after she prayed to Damien, she said.","Five new saints canonized by Pope Benedict XVI .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN)  -- Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri died overnight, several state-run Iranian news agencies reported Sunday. His son, Ahmad, told the official IRNA news agency that his 87-year-old father passed away due to cardiac arrest at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, Press TV reported. The semi-official ILNA agency said he died at his home in the Iranian holy city of Qom. Montazeri -- a key figure in Iran's Islamic Revolution 30 years ago -- was perhaps the most prominent cleric who publicly criticized the presidential elections last June that returned hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidency. On his Web site, Montazeri described the street protests that followed the polling as a challenge to the ""very legitimacy of the Islamic Republic."" His death is ""a terrible blow for the (reformist) green movement and everybody who has been active these past few months,"" said Mehrdad Khonsari, a senior research consultant at the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies in London. In the last six months, Montazeri had become the voice of the green movement on key foreign policy issues, Khonsari said. The cleric was able to comment more freely than reformist presidential candidates. ""He was a very senior grand ayatollah with very good revolutionary credentials, and a very vocal critic of the ruling establishment,"" Khonsari said. ""He was a major thorn in the back of (Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei. He was a bastion for all the people opposing the excesses of the system,"" even within the ruling establishment, he said. Montazeri, for example, took a public stand against nuclear weapons in October, issuing a fatwa, or religious edict, declaring them to be ""un-Islamic"" and instructing Muslims to take the lead in banning them, said Nazenin Ansari, diplomatic editor of the weekly newspaper Kayhan in London. Iran's nuclear program has been the subject of intense international concern, with the United Nations considering expanding sanctions against the Islamic state despite its insistence it does not intend to build a bomb. Montazeri's upcoming funeral must be a cause for concern for the authorities in Tehran, Ansari said, but because of his standing, they cannot ban it. ""Already there are people starting to march towards his home,"" she said she had heard from sources inside Iran. ""He has a very large public following especially since the June elections and all his statements in favor of human rights."" It is not clear whether his death sparked demonstrations, as some reports said. CNN producer Shirzad Bozorgmehr saw no unusual activity in the vicinity of Tehran University, at Haft-e-Tir Square or Revolution Square in Tehran on Sunday. Montazeri's Web site called for a funeral procession from his home to the Massoumeh Shrine in Qom, the holy city where he lived, starting at 9 a.m. on Monday (12:30 a.m. ET). Any demonstrations resulting from the burial could spill over into the capital, Ansari said. ""Qom is very close to Tehran and this is a major event,"" she said, adding that it is difficult to predict what would happen. ""It would be questionable how a lot of the foot soldiers of the revolution would react."" The timing of his death could also be significant, she said, since it comes in the month that first saw the demonstrations that spiraled into the revolution that toppled the monarchy and brought the Islamic regime to power. Montazeri was once a confidant of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran for a decade after the revolution. He studied under Khomeini and then acted as his representative in Iran after Khomeini was exiled by the shah for criticizing the monarchy, Ansari said. Montazeri, too, was jailed and exiled. After the revolution, he was the heir apparent to Khomeini, and played a key role in writing Iran's constitution as the first chair of the powerful Guardians Council. He was also the leader of Friday prayers in Tehran, one of the most public and influential pulpits in the country. But he was supplanted by the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and was placed under several years of house arrest in 1997. ""His problems with Khomeini started in the summer of 1988 when they started executing... thousands of leftist prisoners,"" Ansari said. ""He never was in agreement with that, and then he started to fade"" from power. ""Once Khamenei became leader, Montazeri objected,"" she said. Montazeri said Khamenei ""was elevated above his (religious) qualifications,"" pointing out that he had not earned the title of ayatollah. ""It was then he was arrested."" Recently he has objected to the current regime's characterization of his one-time mentor Khomeini as a saint, she added. And following the disputed elections in June, ""he issued a ground-breaking fatwa articulating the policies of the (reformist) green movement to the world. ""Given the dynamics of the political situation in Iran, the regime will have difficulty controlling his funeral and where it might lead,"" she said. Montazeri had been equally critical of the parliamentary electoral process in 2004, arguing in favor of reformist candidates. Sitting behind his desk with a government minder in the room, he said then that Iran's Islamic revolution had lost its way. ""Even I, who used to be a leading figure in the revolution, have not the right to speak out,"" he said. ""Authoritarianism will never last long. The gentlemen in power must submit to the wishes of the people, or they will be swept away.""","Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri has died .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- You don't find many churches making theatrical films. You especially don't find many churches making films starring Kirk Cameron about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn. Kirk Cameron stars in ""Fireproof,"" a film he was attracted to for its many themes, he said. But that's the case for Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. In fact, the film, ""Fireproof,"" was the church's third movie. It was also an unexpected hit. In September it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, eventually bringing in $33.5 million and spawning two books: a novelization, also called ""Fireproof,"" which is in The New York Times' best-seller list's Top 20; and a companion journal to the movie, ""The Love Dare,"" which has sold more than 2 million copies. Last week ""Fireproof"" debuted on DVD and climbed to No. 3 on Billboard's DVD chart, beating out ""The Hulk"" and ""Saw V,"" among others. ""You don't often see movies made by churches do big numbers,"" said Billboard's Anthony Colombo. ""Having [distributor] Sony behind it helps. Having Kirk Cameron helps, but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [DVDs] in its first week is pretty impressive."" ""It should not be working,"" said Alex Kendrick, one of the pastors behind the film. ""All I can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor God."" Kendrick said that Sherwood's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked God to give them an idea for their next movie. They were just coming off making ""Facing the Giants,"" a movie shot entirely in Albany on a $100,000 budget. It starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made $10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on DVD, launching the church into the national spotlight. The church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships. ""Families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it,"" said Kendrick, recalling the idea's genesis. ""God give us the idea. We had no clue what would happen with it."" ""Fireproof"" began with a $500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member/actors, but the film got a left-field boost when Cameron, best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the TV series ""Growing Pains,"" read the script and asked to get involved. ""All throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications, money, sex, addiction, porn, extramarital affairs, feeling respected at work but not at home, feeling respected by friends but not at home,"" Cameron told CNN. The themes resonated with the actor and devout Christian, a husband of 17 years, and father of six, he said. That and the ""cool action scenes,"" he added. The makers of ""Fireproof"" tapped into the church market, arranging screenings for the National Baptist Pastors' convention before release and using word-of-mouth among church leaders. However, says Cameron, the film was pitched to general audiences, not necessarily Christians. ""'Fireproof' was never marketed as a Christian movie. This is a movie about marriage,"" Cameron said. ""The fact is, though, the gospel is presented, is done well, and it's a central part of the storyline."" Although many critics panned ""Fireproof"" -- ""as sincere, uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture,"" said Variety -- audiences embraced it. ""There's a huge market out there that's underserved. That market is there and a lot of people don't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market,"" Cameron said. Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com, said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend. ""With 'Fireproof,' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board,"" he said. ""They didn't follow traditional marketing methods but they didn't need them for this film. ... Maybe that's why it worked out so well."" He added, ""You're talking about a very successful property. ... The powers that be that put this together are really on to something."" Churches are using ""Love Dare"" and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool, says publisher B&H Publishing's Andrea Dennis, who calls ""Fireproof"" ""a marriage movement."" For Valentine's Day more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film, many displaying the admonition ""Fireproof Your Marriage"" on their signs. B&H believes ""Love Dare"" could hang around on the best-seller list -- where it's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of Rick Warren's ""The Purpose Driven Life."" And the filmmakers have kept their success close to home. Alex Kendrick said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town, equipped with eight tennis courts, eight basketball courts and an equestrian area. A baseball diamond is on the way. He's confident ""Fireproof"" will remain a successful brand. ""When something grows the only reason it happens is people say it worked and you should try it,"" Kendrick said. ""When it works and there's a legitimate impact, people want to be a part of it.""","""Fireproof"" about a firefighter having marriage problems .

"(CNN) -- Julian Juarez Baena, a police officer in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, had just finished his shift. It was just after 9 p.m. last Saturday, and he was driving home. But the 35-year-old would never reach his destination. At an intersection near his home, he was ambushed and shot to death. Investigators found 34 bullet casings at the scene. Juarez was found facing down with multiple bullet wounds in his head, chest and left side of his body. His death made headlines in the Mexican city across the border from El Paso, Texas. Not only was the victim a police officer, but he was also the eighth member of the force to be murdered in two weeks. In the weeks prior to Juarez's death, banners had appeared in Ciudad Juarez threatening to kill one officer per day unless Police Chief Julian Leyzaola resigned. Leyzaola, some of the banners claimed, was only targeting members of one cartel while its rivals roamed free. Leyzaola, a former military officer who has been on the job for less than a year, says he's not stepping down. ""We have to show them (criminals) that they can't be above the law or above authority. They're criminals and they should be isolated; isolated in jail or buried in the cemetery. They can't keep on intimidating or kidnapping people,"" Leyzaola said the day after Juarez's death. The murders of police officers have taken their toll on morale in the department of 2,500, and forced authorities to take unprecedented measures. Ciudad Juarez Mayor Hector Murguia Lardizabal made the decision to temporarily house most of the police force in hotels, with 24-hour police protection -- the police department protecting its own officers.. ""I had to respond to reality,"" Murguia said. ""I also decided that we were going to allow police officers to keep their duty weapons after their shift ended. We decided to send them to the barracks after the eighth death. We needed to do something about it."" The attacks against officers haven't stopped. A shootout between officers and their attackers earlier this week left three dead gunmen and produced three arrests. According to police, attackers tried to ambush the officers Monday as they were fueling up their cars. Three police officers suffered minor wounds in the shootout. In the blue Ford Explorer the suspects used in the attack, investigators found two high-caliber rifles, two handguns and a fragmentation grenade. Mayor Murguia has stopped short of calling the situation a crisis. Responding to a reporter's question about the recent deaths of police officers, Murguia became visibly impatient. ""It would be stupidly naive not to expect deadly attacks in an open war against organized crime,"" Murguia said. ""What would you have us do? Do you want us to send messages to the criminals asking them to please put their AK-47s (assault rifles) down and stop committing crimes?"" Three years ago criminal groups successfully used the same tactic of killing police officers to force the Juarez chief of police then to resign. Roberto Orduna Cruz stepped down after his assistant chief of police, Sacramento Perez, and two of his bodyguards were gunned down in an ambush. Investigators found more than 150 bullet casings at the crime scene. Just before that incident in February of 2009, anonymous banners had appeared throughout the city of 1.2 million warning that if Orduna didn't resign a police officer would be murdered every 48 hours. By at least one measure Leyzaola, the current police chief, has been successful. The number of violent deaths in Juarez dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. There were 1,933 murders in 2011, compared with 3,117 in 2010, the all-time record. But Leyzaola says he is not done yet. Leyzaola, who also served as chief of police in Tijuana, is credited with bringing a significant decline in crime in that border city. His goal, he says, is to do the same in Ciudad Juarez. Journalist Edgar Roman in Ciudad Juarez contributed to this report.","Eight police officers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have been killed in recent weeks .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- For the past few months, I have been trying to figure out why Mitt Romney is so unlikeable. It can't be because he's rich, because there are a lot of rich people we like. Hell, President Obama's rich and 56% of the country views him favorably. It can't be because he's Republican, because Republicans don't like him either. Last month, when a woman reportedly asked House Speaker John Boehner, ""Can you make me love Mitt Romney?"" he said, ""No... the American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney."" The latest CNN/ORC International Poll found that 48% of Americans view him unfavorably, which isn't exactly breaking news because Romney's been unable to get much likeability traction since announcing his first run at the White House five years ago. For a sex scandal-free politician, that's got to be a bit perplexing. But then last week, the reason for the bad vibes about Romney became clear. You see, he's been zipping across the country using President Obama's ""You didn't build that"" quote out of context for an analogy about a student who worked hard in school and made the honor roll. He used it again when he introduced his running mate, Paul Ryan last weekend. Frum: Romney does Obama a huge favor . What the president said was: . ""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business â€” you didn't build that."" He also said, ""The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together."" Romney spins it to make it sound as if the president is totally discrediting an individual's hard work, summing it up this way. ""I realize that he got to school on a bus and the bus driver got him there, but I don't give the bus driver credit for the honor roll,"" he said. ""I give the kid credit for the honor roll."" Nothing's wrong with that statement by itself. The problem is, we don't live by ourselves. This analogy epitomizes what makes Romney so unlikeable to so many people, regardless of party, race, gender or socioeconomic status. In his mind, the world is full of bus drivers and honor roll students and the two are independent of each other, which is why he can characterize President Obama's desire to help those less fortunate as creating a ""culture of dependence."" What rubs so many people the wrong way is Romney's inability to see that society is interdependent. There are moments in some of Romney's speeches in which he comes across like the guy who doesn't wave when you let him into traffic, because in his mind, he was able to merge on his own. Few people ever like that guy ... and this is why less than 50% of Americans like Romney. Opinion: Is Paul Ryan for or against Ayn Rand? Growing up, I rode the bus to school. We only had one car and both my parents had to work. So if it wasn't for the bus I would have had to attend the neighborhood schools that were within walking distance as opposed to the special schools for high academic achievers that were an hour's ride away. I worked hard to get accepted into the programs. I worked to stay there. But I would not have been able to do any of those things if it weren't for the bus drivers who made sure I got to school safe and on time. When you genuinely live life through a prism of gratitude, you don't use analogies that minimize the impact others have on your life. When you live life through that prism, you don't see voters and delegates, you don't see the budget as just a bunch of numbers you have to make work. You see the lives. Romney doesn't irk us because he was born into privilege. He irks us because he behaves as if being born into privilege had nothing to do with his success. His wife, Ann, was supposed to make her husband more appealing. It didn't work. Now the question is: Can Paul Ryan make Mitt likeable? I doubt it. When men like Ryan or Obama or Vice President Joe Biden roll their sleeves up to talk to blue collar voters, it feels real because it's coming from a real place inside. When Romney rolls his sleeves up, it's clear he's trying to send a message -- because his sense of entitlement and social disconnect prevents him from being the message. That doesn't mean people won't vote for him in November. It's just that they won't be doing so because they like him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Polls show Americans favorable on Obama, not favorable on Romney .

"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Critics and supporters of the Obama administration alike, others concerned foremost about national security, the so-called whistle-blowers of WikiLeaks, and both U.S. allies and enemies believe the released diplomatic documents contain significant revelations about U.S. foreign policy. But is this perception accurate? This convergence of opinion from such conflicting groups is based on the premise that a document stands on its own. Read a memo, and you have the whole story. But if historians and other scholars believed raw data mean nothing more than what appears on the page, they would have little need to write analyses creating or challenging conventional wisdom, nor would they need to spend long shifts in archives poring over aging documents. In fact, revisionism of any sort would be unnecessary unless, of course, new documents emerged. The influence of social forces, economic interests, history, bureaucracy and the many other factors responsible for shaping information would be relegated to the margins or unconsidered. WikiLeaks and The New York Times, among others, claim they must analyze documents before publishing them to determine which names and facts to redact and how much context to provide. This is not how historians practice their craft, and the absence of careful analysis may prove to be as harmful to national security as the revelation of sensitive material. Historical analysis cautions against accepting a single document as a smoking gun. It compels the investigator to study primary and secondary sources, and it is a reminder that what is left unstated in a document may be far more revealing than what is stated. I confronted this when I delved into the private papers of President Reagan nearly 15 years ago. Nancy Reagan gave me access to her husband's papers on the end of the Cold War, but that research took a sharp detour when I discovered thousands of pages of Reagan's handwritten drafts covering more than 70 years of his life. Before the publication of my co-authored books on Reagan's writings, it was not widely known that the 40th president wrote thousands of letters throughout his life. One letter, written in November 1986, illustrates the importance of historical context. Frustrated by accounts in the press, Reagan wrote to William Rusher, then publisher of the National Review: . ""I'm really upset by what so many of your contemporaries have done. D--n it yes we sold them a few spare parts and weapons but the stake was a contact that could give us a chance at a relationship with Iran and we were succeeding. A plus on the [other] side was return of three hostages and could have been five if the media hadn't blown our cover."" If you read only this letter, unaware that it had already been revealed that the United States had sold arms to Iran in hopes that the Iranian government would cease support for terrorism and thus facilitate the release of U.S. citizens held hostage in Lebanon, and that Reagan had publicly discussed the issue on several occasions, you might see the quote as revelatory. It has significance, but not in the sense of it being news never heard before. Under a mountain of readily available information, we are gradually losing the art of understanding. We face a different kind of threat to national security, perhaps the most dangerous threat of all. The historian's craft must be part of the public debate about the documents released by WikiLeaks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kiron K. Skinner.","Kiron Skinner says historians know raw data need to be analyzed and put in perspective .
Primary and secondary sources and historical context must be considered, she writes .
She says undifferentiated WikiLeaks material doesn't make sense without analysis .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British journalist was killed and a second wounded in Afghanistan when the vehicle in which they were traveling struck an improvised explosive device, the Ministry of Defence said Sunday. Rupert Hamer, defense correspondent for the Sunday Mirror newspaper, and photographer Philip Coburn were embedded with the U.S. Marine Corps and were accompanying a patrol near Nawa in southern Afghanistan when the explosion occurred Saturday, the ministry said in a statement. ""Despite the best efforts of medics at the scene, Mr. Hamer died of his wounds,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Coburn remains in a serious but stable condition."" A U.S. Marine was also killed in the explosion, the ministry said. Five U.S. Marines were seriously wounded. The ministry said earlier Sunday that a member of the Afghan National Army was also killed, but later said no Afghan nationals were killed or wounded. ""Both Rupert Hamer and Phil Coburn accompanied me on my most recent trip to Afghanistan,"" said British Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth in the statement. ""I got to know them well and I was impressed by their hard work and professionalism. My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the families, friends and colleagues of both men at this extremely distressing time."" The Mirror said in a statement that Hamer, 39, and Coburn, 43, had flown to Afghanistan on December 31 for a trip that was to have lasted a month. Hamer is survived by his wife and three children, ages 6, 5 and 19 months, the newspaper said. He had been with the Mirror for 12 years. According to his Mirror blog page, Hamer had covered the British armed forces since 2004 in the Middle East, central Asia, Oman, Bahrain, Iraq and Afghanistan. Coburn has been with the paper for eight years and has previously worked with Hamer in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Mirror said. His previous assignments for the paper have included events in Rwanda and Hurricane Katrina in the United States. ""Rupert believed that the only place to report a war was from the front line, and as our defense correspondent he wanted to be embedded with the U.S. Marines at the start of their vital surge into southern Afghanistan,"" Sunday Mirror Editor Tina Weaver said in the statement. ""He was a seasoned, highly regarded and brave journalist who had reported from both Iraq and Afghanistan on many occasions. It was his fifth trip to Afghanistan, and he had forged friendships with a number of the soldiers serving out there."" Hamer was affectionately known as ""Corporal Hamer"" in the Mirror office, Weaver said. ""He was a gregarious figure, a wonderful friend who was hugely popular with his colleagues."" Coburn, she said, is a consummate journalist ""and brilliant photographer ... He and Rupert made a dedicated team, working together around the world, sacrificing personal comfort countless times to record the reality of wars. We wish Phil a speedy recovery and send our warmest wishes to his partner and family."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a statement, ""I was deeply saddened by this tragic news, and my heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are with the families, friends and colleagues of Rupert and Philip. Their courage, skill and dedication to reporting from the front line was incredibly important and ensured that the world could see and read about our heroic troops. Their professionalism and commitment to our forces will not be forgotten."" In recent weeks, the ministry had worked with Hamer on a special Christmas edition of the Sunday Mirror, containing messages for deployed personnel from their families, Ainsworth said. ""The sacrifice of service personnel is well documented and rightly respected, but this news demonstrates the risks also faced by journalists who keep the public informed of events on the front line,"" he said. Hamer is the second journalist to die in Afghanistan in recent weeks. On December 30, Calgary Herald reporter Michelle Lang, 34, died along with four Canadian soldiers when a roadside bomb struck their armored vehicle in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar. According to a tally kept by Reporters without Borders, Hamer would be the 20th journalist to die in Afghanistan, and the 12th foreign journalist, since September 11, 2001.","Sunday Mirror's Rupert Hamer was embedded with U.S. Marine Corps .

"(CNN) -- Tennis bosses have told the sport's stars that a boycott of the 2013 Australian Open over prize money would not be backed. Players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds. British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that they were planning to start a rebel event, possibly in Dubai, if pay is not increased for the Melbourne tournament in January. But the ATP, which represents the interests of male players, has denied it would help players in organize any such action. ""The ATP has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will not organize a boycott,"" it said in a statement. ""Instead, ATP Management and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues. ""The grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues, and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the ATP World Tour."" How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues . The Australian Open, held in Melbourne every January, is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. In 2012, first-round losers at the year's first major tournament were given $21,600, compared to $22,500 in France and $23,000 in the U.S. and Britain -- the latter three having increased by 20%. The biggest disparity is in Australia, which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner's check of almost $2.4 million. ""We are pleased that the discussions initiated by the ATP with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012,"" the men's ruling body said. ""We remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation for 2013 and beyond. The players remain unified and passionate about this issue."" Australian Open boss Craig Tiley, in New York for the U.S. Open which began on Monday, attempted to quell boycott fears. ""We are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career, the top 250 players need to make a good living,"" he told Australian news agency AAP. ""The top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf. So that could be a good benchmark for us. And the PGA Tour's prize money has increased more than the ATP Tour's has, so we have to address that too. ""Our relationship with the playing group is very, very strong. It's in everyone's interests (not to strike). We're very confident that whatever needs to be resolved will be.""","ATP rule out backing a tennis players boycott of the 2013 Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of supporters rallied Sunday behind cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who said he wanted to root out corruption and ensure rich and poor alike prosper in Pakistan. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party rallied in Karachi, where Khan, 59, said he wanted to make economic and tax reforms. Standing with him amid party banners and Pakistani flags were career politicians who recently switched to Khan's party. Speaking in cricket terms, Khan said, ""One more wicket fell today -- as Pakistan People's Party member Sardar Assef Ahmed has joined the PTI."" Ahmed is a former minister of education. Khan said if elected prime minister next year, he would bring a team that would help transform Pakistan into a welfare state and ensure equality. ""In Tehreek-e-Insaf's rule, a civil system will be introduced which will ensure justice and equality is followed on all fronts -- in which even Imran Khan's car is stopped for speeding,"" he told the crowd, promising corruption would be ended within 90 days of an election. Khan also is an opponent of U.S. drone strikes in his country. Khan, who led the country's cricket team to the 1992 World Cup trophy, founded the Movement for Justice party in 1996 and served in parliament from 2002 to 2007. His party boycotted the 2008 elections. The opposition politician also spoke of agricultural reforms, promising free seeds and discounted fertilizer for farmers. Khan said a Chinese company wanted to bring a $19 billion dollar investment to Pakistan, but did not because of concerns over security. Although he appears to be gaining traction, Khan's party has seen little success in the past. During previous parliamentary elections, Khan's party failed to win any seats; many within the country have referred to him as a man who changes positions. He has garnered support from his former wife, Jemima Khan, a British journalist. Pakistan's next national elections are in 2013.","Former cricket star holds rally in Karachi ahead of 2013 elections .

"(CNN) -- International aid workers scrambling to get into Haiti face a series of obstacles, from an airport that is already overwhelmed to blocked roads and a lack of communication, electricity, food and water. And, as if that weren't enough, they will encounter a serious crime problem,  a veteran disaster relief specialist told CNN. ""Security now in this particular crisis has already been raised as a major, major issue,"" said Paul Sherlock, a senior humanitarian representative for Oxfam. ""If you'd been in Haiti 25 years ago, even in Papa Doc's time, it was a pretty nasty dictatorship, and lots of people were killed. But infrastructure and services worked better then than they do now,"" he said. Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier was president from 1957 to 1971. ""It was safer to use public transport then than it was last year, certainly in terms of crime,"" he said. ""Over the last 10, 15, 20 years, the gangs and the drug culture have taken hold of Haiti, and that is why over the last four to five years, the United Nations has been trying to administer security in the capital and all the provincial cities as well,"" he said. Nongovernmental organization workers ""have not been using public transport or taxis because of the security risk they face. International aid workers certainly didn't."" Aid workers on their way to Haiti now are not sure how to ensure their safety, he said. Some are ""probably using U.N. military as escorts, but many NGOs are uncomfortable using any military escort. They have been going to the police, but I don't know, after what has happened, whether the police are in any better position to provide it."" Security isn't the only thing that has deteriorated in Haiti over the past few decades. The Organization for American States put it starkly when launching a development project for its poorest member: ""There is no national building code in Haiti."" When the devastating earthquake hit the Caribbean nation Tuesday, many concrete structures simply crumbled. Days after the quake, there is no clear idea how many people are dead, or how many are trapped in the rubble, still alive. Even before the tremors slammed Haiti, it was a difficult place to live. ""People are building very close to each other on land that may not be supportable for buildings,"" said Bill Canny, director of emergency operations for Catholic Relief Services. ""A lot of squatters build illegally. Perhaps some 2 million people have built on land where there is no legal document that they own it. ""Building codes are not enforced in Haiti, so contractors can build as they wish, cut corners,"" he said. And safe housing was not the only concern. ""Haiti is on a short string for fuel,"" Canny told CNN by phone, minutes before boarding a plane for Haiti. ""There have been shortages for the last six months. If a single ship is slowed down, the whole country begins to suffer a shortage."" Fuel powers not only the national electrical grid -- such as it is -- but also ""thousands of generators that provide energy to hospitals, homes and businesses,"" Canny said. Food and water are also a problem. ""Haiti has a tremendous shortage of good drinkable water,"" said Canny, who lived there for three and a half years until just two months ago. ""There are some companies that provide cleansed water in bottles. If those companies have been crippled, you will have a shortage of potable water, if you don't already. ""We also saw in the flooding in 2008 that after four or five days, if you do not have foodstuffs coming in by port, plane and by road, there will be shortages,"" said Canny, noting that Haiti produces only about 45 percent of its food needs. Haitian Ambassador to the United States Raymond Joseph told CNN on Thursday that his country's communication system was heavily damaged, so he had not received much new information about the situation there. ""The major thing is that help is starting to arrive, but we have a problem with the roads,"" he said in a phone interview from Washington. ""Now we are asking for help from the U.S. government to clear the roads, so the first groups ... the Marines are bringing heavy equipment."" Athena Kolbe of the University of Michigan did a survey last summer of nearly 1,000 households in three highly populated neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Just over half the people in those neighborhoods had access to electricity -- when it was available at all -- the survey found. Most used public or private water kiosks as their main source of drinking and cooking water, and most used shared pit latrines rather than bathrooms, Kolbe found in her study for the Small Arms Survey. Few families had water piped into their homes. More than nine out of 10 used charcoal for cooking; the others used gas. Adults had an average of just over two and a half years of formal schooling. Eighty percent of Haiti's 9 million residents live under the poverty line. More than half -- 54 percent -- live in abject poverty, according to the CIA Factbook. In 2008, four tropical storms damaged the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sector, on which two-thirds of Haitians depend, mainly as subsistence farmers. Haiti's infrastructure was among the world's worst even in the best of times, Joseph said Tuesday. ""It was a catastrophe waiting to happen,"" Joseph said shortly after the earthquake. ""Sadly, it has happened."" CNN's Alanne Orjoux and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Housing, food, electricity, reliable transportation were in short supply before earthquake .
Growing influence of gangs, drug culture have destabilized security in Haiti .
It is unclear who aid workers can turn to as escorts in the country .

"During CNN's ""Going Green: Green Light for Business"" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Anders Eldrup, CEO and President of DONG Energy, tells us about the company's plans to switch its reliance from fossil fuels to renewable energy. There are many reasons as to why coal today is the dominant fuel in power generation. In coal many countries found a way to alleviate the extreme dependence of Middle East oil after the 1970's oil crisis. Horns Rev II will be the world's largest offshore wind farm when it opens on September 17, 2009. But the solutions of yesterday are not necessarily the solutions of today. We now know that fossil fuels are the prime contributors to global warming. Today 85 percent of DONG Energy's production comes from fossil fuels, whereas 15 percent comes from carbon-neutral sources. DONG Energy wants to turn the numbers around within one generation, so that 85 per cent of our energy production is carbon neutral. We call the vision 85/15. At present we are formulating the strategy through which our vision will be achieved. The strategy is to create growth and reduce CO2 emissions at the same time, and key elements will be increased efficiency and more biomass and wind energy. Efficient power plants Energy efficiency is an often overlooked method of reducing emissions. DONG Energy's power plants rank among the most efficient with efficiency rates of up to 47 percent and we constantly work to improve efficiency. Furthermore, the central power plants are combined heating plants that channel excess heat from power production to consumers for domestic heating. Such use of energy elevates efficiency rates to 94 percent. Biomass in power plants To further bring down emissions high efficiency must be supplemented by renewable fuels such as biomass. Already today, Danish power plants use half of the straw from Danish agriculture in our power plants along with increasing quantities of wood chips and wood pellets. Wind power works Today, DONG Energy has built half of the world's offshore wind mills and wind energy will be an important contribution to achieving the 85/15 vision. Off the coast of Western Denmark, DONG Energy is completing the construction of the world's largest offshore wind farm, Horns Rev II. When it opens on the 17th of September this year, its 91 windmills will generate enough power to supply 200,000 households. The offshore wind farm, London Array, in the Thames Estuary, will be another testimony to the potential of wind energy. DONG Energy owns 50 percent of the 1GW London Array project, which will be the world's largest offshore wind farm, powering 750,000 homes. First phase of the London Array is due to be completed by 2012. Green transport The uneasy companion of large quantities of wind power is great variation in power production due to the intermittency of wind. Electric cars can help absorb the surplus power production when energy production is high because of strong winds and when energy consumption is low at night. More electric cars simply mean more wind energy. In addition, electric cars can reduce the rapidly growing CO2-emissions from the transport sector. DONG Energy is developing the infrastructure and technology that will allow for cleaner and more intelligent forms of transportation. But the approach to the transport sector has to be broad based. DONG Energy is building one of the world's first demonstration plants for second generation bioethanol in Denmark. Contrary to first generation bioethanol produced from food crops, second generation bioethanol is based on residual products from forestry and agriculture. The plant will produce 5.4 million liters of clean and affordable second generation bioethanol each year. The role of politics These are key elements in our strategy to simultaneously pursue growth and reduce CO2 emissions. But politicians must contribute by creating a political framework that aligns economic growth and climate mitigation. Concerns over growth and over climate change mitigation should not have to be balanced. They should be integrated. On one hand, politicians must create economic incentives by ensuring a high price on CO2 and a global carbon trade system shared by all developed countries. On the other hand, politicians must formulate ambitious car-emissions standards, building codes etc. The first step towards aligning growth and climate concerns has to be taken in Copenhagen in December this year.","DONG Energy aims to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to produce energy .

"(CNN) -- A man arraigned Tuesday on multiple firearms charges had an arsenal of high-powered weapons and a map of U.S. military base in his New Jersey hotel room, authorities said. Lloyd R. Woodson, 43, has been charged with two counts of unlawful possession of weapons, possessing prohibited weapons, possessing large capacity ammunition magazines, two counts of defaced firearms, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest. Authorities say he has no apparent ties to terrorist activities. Woodson also is being charged as a convicted felon in possession of firearms, Gregory Reinert, a spokesman for the the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey, said. Somerset County Judge John Pursel set bail at $75,000, and Woodson is expected to appear in court again by the end of the week. Woodson appeared angry and withdrawn in court, according to CNN's Deb Feyerick, who attended the arraignment. His hands and feet were shackled and he was escorted by two guards. Woodson kept his head down and barely acknowledged the judge, except for responding ""yes"" when asked if he understood English. Woodson, of Virginia, was arrested Monday after police responded to a call about a suspicious man in the Quick Chek convenience store in Branchburg, New Jersey, said local prosecutor Wayne J. Forrest. The suspect was in possession of an automatic .223 rifle converted to a .50 caliber rifle with a laser sight; five customized magazines, each fully loaded with hollow-point .50-caliber rounds and a military bulletproof vest when he was taken into custody, the New Jersey Regional Operations Intelligence Center (ROIC) said. At his hotel room, investigators found a Bushmaster .308-caliber semiautomatic rifle with a defaced serial number, a rifle-mounted night vision scope, a 37 mm Cobray grenade launcher, a ballistic vest, a police scanner, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, military pouches and garrison equipment, and a detailed map of Fort Drum, an Army post in upstate New York. Earlier, Forrest said authorities had also found a Middle Eastern-style headdress, but no such item was mentioned in ROIC's statement or in an FBI agent's affidavit. Woodson waived his rights, according to the affidavit, and told investigators that all the weaponry was his, that he'd bought the guns on the streets of New York and that he had ""obliterated"" the serial numbers. He has a prior conviction for criminal possession of a weapon from Kings County (New York) Superior Court in 1997. The ROIC statement also said Woodson ""expressed anti-law enforcement sentiments"" stemming from run-in with police regarding domestic disputes. He has no ties to organized groups, the statement said, echoing what federal agents said earlier in the day. Michael Murphy, the senior vice president of Quick Chek, said the employee who called 911 ""prevented a bad situation and possible tragedy down the road."" The company is protecting her identity for safety reasons, he said. Murphy said Woodson did not buy anything in the store and may have drawn suspicion because he looked like he wanted to shoplift. When officers arrived, Woodson ran into the woods but was subdued after wrestling with officers, Forrest's statement said. Preliminary findings indicate that Woodson has no ties to known terrorist groups or a specific terrorism plot, said FBI Special Agent Bryan L. Travers in a statement Tuesday. Federal investigators from the FBI and ATF are assisting local law enforcement. Woodson spent a brief time in the Navy, according to U.S. Navy spokesman Lt. Justin Cole. In February 1988, he served on board the USS Orion, a submarine tender, Cole told CNN. He deserted the ship eight months later, Cole said. Woodson was taken into Navy custody in 1996 and discharged a month afterward, Cole added. CNN's Deb Feyerich and Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.","FBI on Tuesday said no ties to any terrorist group or specific plot had been found .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths. Barack Obama? This time, he couldn't overcome a weakness he has shown before, a tendency to distance himself from the audience, and this kept him from connecting and making a good showing. But both have a track record of debates showcasing their strengths and weaknesses, and they are both good debaters. This is only the first of three performances. Many of their old habits emerged again, both good and bad. They will need to study their take-home lessons. Let's begin with Romney. Three of of Romney's debating strengths are being smooth and knowledgeable and having excellent first-line answers to questions. Wednesday night? Opinion: Romney was hungry, Obama was flat . Check. Check. And check. Listen, Mitt Romney can handle these debates. He was strong in all areas Wednesday night. And y'all shouldn't be surprised that he performed so well. For him to falter, the moderator is going to have to do a much better job than Jim Lehrer. Poor, steamrolled Jim Lehrer. Romney talked over him so often that I swear one time I saw Lehrer slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at Romney and muttered, ""Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler."" Romney has potential weaknesses: This smoothness has sometimes gotten in his way, which is how he got the ""Slick Mitt"" moniker. But he corrected the potential error and instead had a solid, conversational manner in the debate. He was believable. Romney's other potential weakness is where he shined the most. In the Republican primaries, Romney wasn't a great debater when he was trailing in the polls. But not Wednesday night. He debated to win instead of ""not to lose"" (which is what Obama did). Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies. Romney stuck to his theme of too much government overstretch during the Obama administration, whether on energy subsidies, health care, taxes or increasing the deficit. He kept the debate on the economy and jobs while flatly stating that it was overreach of federal government power that was what has inhibited our economy from recovering. And he made the point well. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race . As for Obama, one strength is that he is solid at picking a theme and sticking with it. Wednesday night was no different. But what a difference four years makes. Against John McCain in 2008, Obama focused on the economy as his theme and hammered away at George W. Bush and McCain. This time, Obama clearly presented his theme. The problem was that the new premise lacked bite. What was it? That Romney has no specific plan. Obama mentioned this time and time again: taxes, deficit reduction, entitlements, regulations to Wall Street and health care. Romney has not specified the details of how he will govern in all these important areas. The problem was that Obama needed to couple that theme with something else. Just stating it over and over is hardly a scathing indictment. And it failed to put Romney on the defensive. Reasoning is another strength Obama has shown in previous debates, but he was unable to use it in any significant way. Near the beginning of the debate, he mentioned that arithmetic proved Romney's plans unworkable. While I thought this was an excellent point, it should have been much more forceful. Which brings us to Obama's weaknesses: I wrote two days ago that his detachment was one weakness, that he can appear dispassionate and distancing to the audience. Unfortunately for the president, he didn't correct this. In fact, it was worse. Indeed, this was probably his poorest showing at trying to connect with the American people. Being emotionless can work either for or against you. For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president. If our economy isn't fully recovered and we're in hard times, our president should at least show more empathy. Offer strong examples to show that he understands. Couple that with Obama's failure to tie Romney to anything related to the famous 47% comment, and I'd call it a glaring error in the debate. Opinion: It wasn't just Romney who won . You know it's bad when at the end of the debate, uber-wealthy Mitt Romney seems like he cares more about the middle class and even the lower class than the sitting Democratic president of the United States. Both candidates get almost two weeks off before their next debate. Here's what they each need to do in the meantime in their preparation. Obama needs to find a much more effective way to pin Romney down to a specific policy. Although he is correct that some of Romney's numbers simply don't add up, Obama must do a better job of wrestling the details out of him. He simply has to put Romney on the defensive more often and provide arguments (and passion) that will resonate with voters. He can't let opportunities slip by to tie Romney to the 47% comment or even to the old policies of George W.Bush. This will be no easy task, since Romney was able to fend off most criticisms with ease in his many Republican primary debates. Obama will need to stick to one subject over a series of exchanges. If he doesn't, Romney will be like Teflon, and nothing Obama says will stick to him in these debates. And the president should utilize the backward-step-pivot-forward technique as often as possible. Since Romney will continue to put him on the defensive (and this is guaranteed), Obama must turn potential flaws into strengths. It's easy enough to predict Romney's attacks. Now, the president must figure out rhetorically how to turn those criticisms into benefits. Opinion: Romney wasn't stellar, but Obama fell short . And for goodness sake, Obama, show more energy and passion. Speak with conviction. For Romney: Steady as she goes. He needs to keep debating precisely like Wednesday night. It wasn't a fluke, and he can prove it. Romney was assertive (compared with Obama's passivity). And it worked. But there's a fine line between assertiveness and aggression. Romney was assertive in this debate without being aggressive. If he decides that his bullying technique of the moderator was effective (it worked Wednesday night, but I wouldn't push my luck if I were him), then he risks alienating voters. The same is true with his demeanor toward the president. Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago. He must stay on the offense. But don't overdo it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Romney played to his strengths, Obama to his weaknesses in debate .

"San Diego (CNN) -- We start with the obvious question: Why do the media, political observers and presidential campaigns spend so much time talking about the Latino vote? Many Americans resent the implication that some votes are more important or have more impact than others. (No one is saying that's the case.) Still, why don't we talk with equal enthusiasm about voting by African-Americans or white evangelicals or left-handed senior citizens who live in Rhode Island? Here are four reasons: . 1. The number of Hispanic voters has been increasing steadily -- by 2 million since the last presidential election. An estimated 12 million Latinos are expected to cast ballots in November, up from 10 million in 2008. That could account for as much as 10% of the total number of ballots cast across all demographic groups. 2. Latino voters live in swing states that pick presidents. They are a major presence in four battlegrounds: Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. While they are also a force in blue states such as California and New York and red states such as Texas and Arizona, their real influence is in the purple states. 3. Hispanics are up for grabs, more than African-Americans who vote overwhelmingly for Democrats and white conservative Christians who usually support Republicans. While the majority closely identify with the Democratic Party -- a December 2011 study by the Pew Hispanic Center said 67% call themselves Democrats and 20% Republicans -- Hispanics have in the past shown a willingness to support Republicans with moderate views on issues such as immigration. 4. The Hispanic population will become more important and politically powerful. According to the 2010 census, the number of Hispanics in this country grew 43% in the last decade. Only one group is growing faster: Asian Americans. By 2050, Hispanics are projected to number 132 million and represent 30% of the population. What questions would you like to ask the candidates? Share a short video question. It's a new world. Look no further than the 23rd Congressional District in Texas, where Republican Rep. Francisco ""Quico"" Canseco and Democratic challenger Pete Gallego recently faced off in a debate in San Antonio. The debate was entirely in Spanish, a show of respect in a district that is 66% Latino and where 53% of residents speak a language other than English at home. Unfortunately, there are still remnants of the old world. For that, we can thank both political parties who put their own interests ahead of everyday Americans -- with Latinos being no exception. In this nation of immigrants, the federal government and local law enforcement officers now work hand-in-glove to round up and deport the undocumented. And this isn't just happening in Republican-controlled Arizona. Thanks to a program called Secure Communities, which requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally (read: Hispanics), that kind of cooperation is now standard operating procedure from sea to shining sea. The program was started at the end of 2008, but it has been ramped up during the Obama Administration as a way of increasing deportation figures. Latinos, according to the Pew study, are nearly twice as likely as the general public to support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In the presidential matchup between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Latinos have a Hobson's choice between a Republican challenger who talks about getting tough on illegal immigrants and a Democratic incumbent who already has. Of course, there is always the chance that Latinos don't consider immigration a top priority. But we have already been assured that they do. By whom? Why, by Democrats who use the issue to attack Republicans, and Republicans who use it to attack Democrats. Back in the world of bad choices, if Latinos fall in line behind Obama, despite his record 1.5 million deportations and the dividing of hundreds of thousands of families, they will send the president a clear message: ""Do with us what you will. We have no real influence and no power because we have no principles and no integrity. You can wipe your feet on our concerns, and we'll still support you."" If they vote for Mitt Romney despite his harsh rhetoric in the primary, they'll be saying: ""It's OK to propose simple solutions, to demagogue the immigration issue, to twist your opponents' positions and to caricature immigrants as takers and a burden on society. We'll still take a chance on you as a better alternative to what we have now."" If Latino voters go down either path, there could soon come a day when we won't have to worry about discussing the power of the Latino vote -- because there may not be much power to discuss. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Four reasons why so many are focused on the Latino vote this election .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rapper Nicki Minaj and Australian country singer Keith Urban will join the ""American Idol"" judges panel when the TV competition's 12th season starts in January, the Fox network said Sunday. The panel is growing from three to four judges next season, with singer Mariah Carey, hired in July, and ""Idol"" original Randy Jackson sitting with Minaj and Urban, the network said. The judges immediately jumped into action Sunday, auditioning singers at New York's Lincoln Center. Rocker Steven Tyler and singer Jennifer Lopez left the show at the end of last season, after judging for two seasons. Jackson's return was made official after weeks of speculation he would move to a mentor role on the show. Earlier speculation also included the names of Latin singer Enrique Iglesias and former ""Idol"" contestant Adam Lambert as possible judges. The official announcement noted Minaj's ""unique performance style and iconic fashion."" ""Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,"" it said. Minaj, 29, ""represents a different side of the music industry, who has now crossed into mainstream culture with her unique artistry, style and flair,"" Cecile Frot-Coutaz, the CEO of ""Idol"" owner FremantleMedia, said. Urban, 44, is a four-time Grammy Award winner and has recorded 14 songs that topped the country music charts. He's ""one of country music's true stars who brings with him charm, wit and knowledge about the industry,"" Frot-Coutaz said. ""It's really an honor to have been invited to be a part of the 'American Idol' family,"" Urban said in a statement to CNN Sunday.Â ""I'm looking forward to working with everyone and to seeing the same passion that I have for music in all of the participants.""

"(CNN) -- Fanatical Manchester United fan Usain Bolt has been offered the chance to fulfill a boyhood dream and turn out for the famous Red Devils. The fastest man in the world has often spoken of his wish to play for the English Premier League giants and used his Twitter blog to badger United star Rio Ferdinand to get him a trial at Old Trafford. Bolt was also a guest at United's EPL home game against Fulham and went on the pitch to show off his Olympic gold medals to the crowd. Now manager Alex Ferguson has hinted Bolt could indeed turn out for the club. ""He's a bit of a character and a big United fan. But it's interesting he says he'd like to play in a charity game,"" Ferguson was quoted on their official website. ""It could be brilliant and next year, when we play Real Madrid's Legends again, there could be opportunities to bring him up and see how he does. ""The people from these small islands, like Dwight Yorke from Trinidad & Tobago, they all play football and he probably played at school level or youth level or something like that. It'd be nice to get him up here, I think it'll be good."" Bolt, who has won six Olympic gold medals in the last two Games, would certainly add pace to the United attack and in the past has been to their training ground to pass on his expertise. ""He's been to Carrington a couple of times,"" Ferguson added. ""And he did help Cristiano Ronaldo with his sprinting, like he said. He took him aside one day."" Ferguson is a big fan of the Jamaican, describing his performances at the London Games as ""phenomenal."" Bolt could take heart from the feats of one of his British opponents in the 100m at the 2012 Olympics. World junior champion Adam Gemili narrowly missed out on running against him in the final, having turned to athletics after playing professional football for fourth flight Dagenham and Redbridge.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- In 1982, they were young men serving their obligatory military service -- Argentine conscripts who fought against the British that year during the Falklands War. More than 25 years later, many of those former combatants are in a legal battle against their former officers, alleging torture, starvation and murder at the hands of their own military. An Argentine war cemetery near Darwin, Falklands. A lawsuit alleges officers killed some soldiers. A federal judge in the southernmost province of Tierra del Fuego, which under Argentine law claims jurisdiction over the Falkland Islands, recently ruled that the officers were responsible for crimes against humanity and human rights abuses. The testimony presented to Judge Lilian Herraez included accounts of a soldier who was shot to death by a corporal, four soldiers who starved to death, and 15 alleged cases of torture in which conscripts were staked to the ground as punishment, according to Argentine media reports. The Falkland Islands are a British territory located 670 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the coast of Argentina. Argentina has claimed sovereignty over the islands since they were occupied by the British in 1833. The collective lawsuit by some 23 former conscripts garnered attention in a country that is divided over how to apply justice to the acts of the so-called Dirty War of the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which an estimated 9,000 to 30,000 people ""disappeared"" under a military dictatorship. Argentina's loss in the Falklands War is credited in part with creating the movement that ended military rule. A contentious point of the national debate is whether to prosecute former military officers. A long-standing law providing amnesty to former officers was repealed in 2001. Against this backdrop came the ruling of Herraez, who considered the lawsuit that combined 80 allegations of human rights violations. She found the cases constituted crimes against humanity. Attorneys for the more than 70 officers and noncommissioned officers named in the lawsuit immediately appealed. They argue that a military court, not a civil court, should hear the case. ""This is a regrettable and interesting case,"" Argentine legal analyst Ricardo Monner Sanz told CNN en Español. ""I say regrettable because it would've been the best if it never had happened. Interesting, because it is a new look at the horrors that everyone knew Argentinean soldiers suffered, not at the hands of the British, but at the hands of their superiors."" Ernesto Alonso, who fought in the Falklands War as a conscript, said he witnessed many such abuses. ""Those who were supposed to protect us were in many cases our own executioners,"" Alonso told CNN en Español. ""It was inconceivable that we denounce murders, torture and humiliation knowing that we were at war with a real enemy like the British."" The case is the biggest, but not the first that has levied accusations of human rights abuses against conscripts who fought in the Falklands War. In February, another federal judge ruled that the case of a soldier who had been staked to the ground at a military base in the days leading up the war was an act of torture and an abuse of his human rights, the Clarin newspaper reported. CNN en Español's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","Falklands War soldiers say officers tortured, starved and murdered .

"(CNN) -- The ever-expanding outbreak of life-threatening fungal meningitis in back pain patients linked to steroid injections prepared by a compounding pharmacy, which so far has sickened at least 214 people and killed 15 in 15 states, is a public health catastrophe. What is particularly tragic for those who have been sickened or killed by the tainted drug and for their loved ones is that this situation was completely avoidable. Since federal laws were enacted in 1938 and 1962 giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority to ensure that all brand name and generic drugs were both safe and effective, compounding pharmacies have traditionally filled a very narrow health care niche in which they prepared, in response to physicians' prescriptions, individually tailored preparations of drugs for patients having unique medical needs that could not be met by a commercially available standard drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical company. While the FDA has long considered the compounding of drugs to be subject to FDA regulations, the agency has recognized the important health care role for such compounded medications. Therefore, it has used ""enforcement discretion"" to allow compounding pharmacies to produce these drugs without complying with FDA regulations, generally deferring regulatory oversight to state pharmacy boards. News: What is a compounding pharmacy? However over the past two decades, many so-called compounding pharmacies began large-scale production of drugs and moved from the traditionally narrow role filled by such pharmacies into a realm that clearly involved drug manufacturing and distribution of standardized drugs. In many cases, the drugs have been sold in multiple states, thus involving interstate commerce. The steroid medication linked to the current fungal meningitis outbreak was produced and widely distributed by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, one of many compounding pharmacies across the country that has crossed the line between traditional compounding and large-scale drug production. The injectable steroid medication produced at the center was never approved by the FDA and was not manufactured in accordance with the FDA's rigorous manufacturing standards designed to ensure that drugs are sterile and uncontaminated with such germs as bacteria or fungi before being sold and distributed. As a result, as many as 14,000 patients in 23 states were exposed to potentially contaminated steroids and need to be monitored for signs of fungal meningitis or other infections. Many people rightly are asking how the disastrous outbreak could happen in the United States and who is to blame. While numerous probes and investigations are just getting under way and litigation targeting the producer of the tainted drug and health care providers who used it will certainly take years to resolve, blame for this disaster will undoubtedly rest with many parties. Among them are the compounding pharmacy that produced the contaminated steroid drugs, health care facilities and providers who chose to use a dangerous drug lacking approval by the FDA and evidence that the products were sterile, trade associations and professional groups representing compounding pharmacies that have vigorously resisted federal regulatory oversight of their members, state and federal regulators, and Congress. A key player at the federal level deserving a significant amount of blame is the FDA. Loud alarm bells were sounded on December 4, 2006, when the FDA issued warning letters to the New England Compounding Center and four other compounding pharmacies, directing them to stop producing standardized versions of medications that, according to the agency, were being ""marketed for general distribution rather than responding to the unique medical needs of individual patients."" the center was cited for violations of FDA regulations in marketing four different drugs, including repackaged doses of the cancer drug Avastin into syringes for treatment of macular degeneration. News: Injectable drugs from Mass. facility suspect . Clearly, the FDA considered the center and the other compounding pharmacies to be engaged in drug manufacturing. The pharmacies, like any other drug manufacturer, were therefore subject to the safety and effectiveness standards required for approval of new drugs, as well as the rigorous manufacturing standards designed to ensure that drugs are sterile and uncontaminated with such germs as bacteria or fungi before being sold and distributed. However, following its warning letter, the FDA subsequently dropped the ball and failed to take the actions necessary to ensure the center adhered to these drug standards, which are essential for protecting the health of patients. For whatever reason, whether inattentiveness or lack of compliance and legal resources, by not aggressively enforcing the regulations related to large-scale drug manufacturing and interstate commerce, the FDA allowed the company to shift its wide-scale manufacturing and interstate distribution operation to injectable steroids. On Thursday, the FDA attempted to deflect criticism for its failures by asserting that it lacked authority to take action earlier. This flies in the face of the agency's long-stated position that it had legal authority over such activities and its prior enforcement activities against the New England center and multiple other compounding pharmacies. While no one wants to be viewed as being responsible for a preventable public health catastrophe, American citizens should express their outrage and demand that all parties responsible for this tragedy -- including the FDA -- be held accountable. Otherwise history will repeat itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Carome.","Michael Carome: The current deadly meningitis outbreak was completely avoidable .

"(CNN) -- Two Ian Poulter-inspired victories offered Europe a glimmer of hope in their quest to retain the Ryder Cup after another day dominated by brilliance from the United States. Despite Poulter's heroics, David Love III's team took a commanding 10-6 lead with only the 12 singles match to come on Sunday. The last time a team came back from such a large deficit was at the infamous clash at Brookline in 1999 when Justin Leonard capped a superb fightback for the United States. But after taking five points from a possible eight on offer, Love's side are firmly in the driving seat and on course to record their first victory since 2008. Day Two of the Ryder Cup as it happened . Sunday would have been a procession had it not been for England's Poulter, who revels in the matchplay format in the Ryder Cup and kept European captain Jose Maria Olazabal's dream alive. He made five straight birdies on the final five holes as he and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy wrestled a point from Zach Johnson and Jason Dufner. And his ten foot putt on the final hole to secure victory was greeted with wild scenes of celebration from a European team that had looked down and out at one stage on Saturday. ""It comes from within,"" Poulter said of yet another strong performance in the Ryder Cup. ""If we can do anything to get our hands on this trophy, with Seve (Ballesteros, who died in 2011) looking down on us, you've got to do what you've got to do. ""We've got a chance and that's all we could've done. We've got to take it to them tomorrow - it's that simple. I want to go out early tomorrow."" McIlroy said of his afternoon partner: ""We needed something to happen, some sort of spark, and after 13, Ian took over from there. ""All the credit needs to be put on this man. We can feed off his positivity, for sure. We clawed it back thanks to some incredible golf from Ian."" Shortly before Poulter and McIlroy's victory, Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia held on for a narrow victory over Steve Stricker and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods, who has now lost all three matches he has played in Chicago. But in the afternoon's other two matches Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson trounced Justin Rose and Francesco Molinari 5&4 while Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson defeated Paul Lawrie and Nicolas Colsaerts one up. Earlier, Poulter and Justin Rose spared Europe a humiliating whitewash in the morning foursomes. The English pairing edged past Watson and Simpson, grabbing a precious point on the 18th green. ""It was absolutely key. Jose put us out number one for a reason and that was to get a point,"" Poulter said. But it was the high point on an otherwise miserable morning for the European team. Lee Westwood and Luke Donald were hammered 7&6 by Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson with Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson heaping on further misery with a 2&1 win over Nicolas Colsaerts and Sergio Garcia. Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell were also unable to stem the U.S. tide conceding defeat to Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker on the final green. Despite their two dramatic victories on the 18th green, Europe still have a mountain to climb on Sunday, needing eight points from the 12 on offer to retain the trophy.","United States of America lead Europe 10-6 going into final day of 39th Ryder Cup .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Foxconn Technology Group -- the world's largest electronics manufacturer and supplier to companies like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft -- admitted that interns as young as 14 worked at one of its Chinese plants. ""An internal investigation carried out by our company has confirmed media reports in China that some participants in the short-term student internship program that is administered at our campus in Yantai, Shandong Province are under the legal working age of 16 years,"" the company said in a statement. ""This is not only a violation of China's labor law, it is also a violation of Foxconn policy and immediate steps have been taken to return the interns in question to their educational institutions."" The underage interns had worked at the plant for about three weeks, the company said. No evidence was found at other plants in China, the company added. Opinion: U.S. misses full truth on China factory workers . Foxconn is one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry. Much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland China, where it assembles a range of products including Apple's iPhone and iPad, Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox. Interns represent about 2.7% of Foxconn's 1.2 million employees in China. The report was the latest in a string of incidents for Foxconn. Earlier this month, workers rights groups and Chinese state media reported work stoppage at a Zhengzhou plant regarding ""overly strict demands"" for production of Apple's iPhone. The company disputed reports of a ""strike,"" but admitted employee ""disputes."" Last month, a factory in Taiyuan was shut down for a day after a large-scale brawl sent 40 people to the hospital. Working conditions at Foxconn factories have been under the spotlight since a 2010 spate of worker suicides at its plants. Foxconn said it had increased workers pay, introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats. The Fair Labor Association -- an industry-funded labor watchdog whose membership includes Apple, a large customer of Foxconn -- released a report in August that Foxconn has moved to bring working hours including overtime down to below 60 hours per week ""with the goal of reaching full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week, plus an average of 9 hours of overtime per week while protecting worker compensation."" ""Immediate health and safety measures"" had been made, such as enforcement of breaks, changing equipment design to reduce repetitive stress injuries and testing of emergency equipment like eyewashes and sprinklers, the August report said. An explosion last year at a Foxconn plant that makes Apple's iPad2 in Chengdu killed four people and injured 18 more. Chinese officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop. That incident followed a report by a labor group alleging that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks.

"Honiara, Solomon Islands (CNN) -- Prince William and Catherine, the duchess of Cambridge, will file a criminal complaint against the photographer who took topless pictures of her, the palace said Sunday evening. The complaint will be given to a French prosecutor on Monday, Britain's Press Association reported. Earlier, the palace said Britain's royal family will go to court Monday to stop the publication of more topless photos. Lawyers for the royals will be seeking damages and a Paris court order preventing the photos from being published again. They also want existing photos taken offline, the palace spokesman told CNN. The French magazine Closer ran photos last week of Catherine sunbathing topless in private. Chi, an Italian gossip magazine owned by the same company, has said it will put out a special edition on Monday with photos of William and Catherine on vacation. Kate upset about topless photos . The royal couple is not pursuing legal action in other countries currently, the palace spokesman said, although the photos have also been published in Ireland. The palace expressed outrage last week that the French magazine published the pictures, comparing the invasion of privacy to those suffered by William's late mother, Diana, princess of Wales. William and Catherine were said to be ""hugely saddened"" by what palace officials called a ""grotesque"" invasion of privacy while they were on a private vacation. But the Irish Daily Star went on to print the pictures on Saturday. Palace officials slammed the newspaper's decision as driven only by greed. But editor Mike O'Kane told the BBC that outrage over the images was only felt in Britain and that readers in the Republic of Ireland wanted to know what all the ""kerfuffle"" was about. He was ""a little taken aback by the reaction in the UK,"" he said, saying the newspaper was treating Catherine no differently from any other celebrity. ""She's not the future queen of Ireland so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the UK,"" he said, suggesting that the British press were behaving with some hypocrisy. O'Kane said the Irish Daily Star was reproducing the images as published in Closer on Friday rather than buying them directly. The pictures are not being published in the Northern Ireland edition. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. Pacific welcome awaits William and Kate . The latest controversy comes only three weeks after the British royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of William's younger brother, Prince Harry, partying naked in his Las Vegas hotel room with a group of girls. In a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become, a co-owner of the Irish Daily Star, media group Northern & Shell, said it in no way backed the newspaper's decision to run the pictures of Catherine. In a statement, the company -- which runs the Irish Daily Star in a joint venture with Independent News & Media, but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was ""profoundly dismayed"" by the move. ""We abhor the decision of the Irish Daily Star to publish these intrusive pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which we, like St James's Palace, believe to be a grotesque invasion of their privacy,"" Northern & Shell's communications director Mimi Turner said. Northern & Shell also owns the Daily Express and the Daily Star, among other British publications, which have not run the pictures of Catherine, nor of Prince Harry. William, who is second in line to the throne, and his wife are on an official tour of southeast Asian nations. They were due in the Solomon Islands Sunday on the next leg of a tour that has been overshadowed by the furor over the photographs. Catherine was ""upset"" with Closer magazine, a palace source told CNN. Mondadori told CNN it plans to run 26 pages of photographs of William and Kate on vacation in an ""extraordinary"" special edition to go on sale in Italy on Monday. Chi's front cover will also feature three revealing pictures of Catherine, according to a copy of the page and statement sent by Mondadori spokeswoman Carmen Mugione via e-mail. ""It is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love,"" Chi's editor-in-chief, Alfonso Signorini, is quoted as saying in the statement. ""The fact that they happen to be the future king and queen of England certainly makes it more interesting and current, and in line with today's concept of monarchy."" A St. James's Palace spokeswoman said: ""Any such publication would serve no purpose other than to cause further, entirely unjustifiable upset to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who were enjoying time alone together in the privacy of a relative's home."" Opinion: British privacy should start with British press . According to Mondadori's website, Closer has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000, while Chi sells more than 340,000 copies a week. Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has been chairwoman of the media group since 2003. Legal analysts suggest the company hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales, thanks to the revealing pictures. The grainy pictures published by Closer in France appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau belonging to William's uncle in Provence, in southern France. The new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of Diana, as she fled photographers in Paris 15 years ago. Laurence Pieau, editor-in-chief of Closer in France, defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV, saying: ""We were just doing our job."" Pieau said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos, and that they show the royals ""are just like any other couple in love."" UK tabloid prints naked Prince Harry pictures . On Saturday the management of Closer said the photos ""are in no case degrading."" French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against this kind of behavior, Briitsh lawyer Charlotte Harris said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. But even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree, Harris said, the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge. No UK newspaper has so far published the photographs of Catherine. The British media is currently under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses. The conclusions of an independent judge-led inquiry, which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms, are expected by the end of the year.

"(CNN)  -- Sudan on Tuesday signed a framework peace accord with rebels from the nation's volatile Darfur region, state media reported. The framework agreement is considered the first step towards the achievement of a lasting peace accord in Darfur. The signing of the cease-fire agreement with the rebel Justice and Equality Movement coincided with a four-way summit in Doha, Qatar, the state-run SUNA news agency said. Participants at the summit include the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani; Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir; the president of Chad, Idris Deby; and Eritrean President Assais Afwerki, SUNA reported. The participants are expected to discuss means of achieving peace in the region, welcoming the steps for realizing peace in Darfur, progress of the relations between Qatar, Sudan, Chad and Eritrea and other issues of mutual concern, SUNA said. Tahir al-Fati, chairman of the Justice and Equality Movement's legislative assembly, told CNN on Saturday that a preliminary document for the framework agreement was signed Saturday in Chad between representatives of the two sides. A permanent cease-fire -- which, according to this preliminary accord, is to be signed before March 15 -- will be a final step, al-Fati said. Last year, Sudan's government and the JEM rebels signed a confidence-building agreement in Qatar, a step toward ending the six-year conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands. Qatar has been mediating talks between the two sides in the Darfur conflict, which erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government. The government launched a brutal counterinsurgency campaign, aided by government-backed Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. Al-Bashir is under pressure to end the fighting, particularly after the International Criminal Court charged him with genocide last year in connection with the government's campaign of violence in Darfur. In the past seven years, more than 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, the United Nations says. An additional 2.7 million people fled their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and allied militias. CNN's Jennifer Z.

"(CNN)  -- Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich pledged Thursday to make his country ""a bridge between East and West"" after being sworn into office in Kiev. Yanukovich, who was ousted from office in 2004 in the pro-West ""Orange Revolution,"" beat Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in a bitterly fought election earlier this month that has left the country deeply divided. Yanukovich enjoys support among the Russian-speaking people living in eastern Ukraine, while Tymoshenko is mainly supported by the Ukrainian speakers in the western part of the country. There is concern Yanukovich will move the former Soviet state more closely into Moscow's orbit and many fear further political turmoil. But in his inaugural address, Yanukovich said it was in Ukraine's interest to build close relations with Russia, the European Union and the U.S. ""Being a bridge between East and West, an integral part of Europe and the former Soviet Union at the same time, Ukraine will choose a foreign policy that will allow our country to get the most out of the development of equal and mutually beneficial relations with Russia, the European Union, the United States and other countries that influence development in the world,"" he said. Yanukovich also said he would put Ukraine on a ""path of accelerated development"" to save Ukraine from socio-economic collapse and called for cooperation between president, parliament and government. In one of his first action as presidents, Yanukovich said he had reduced the costs of maintaining a presidential administration by 20 percent. The money saved would go to the fifth of Ukrainians living in poverty, according to a statement from his office. Yanukovich was declared the winner of the presidential election in 2004, but the legitimacy of the vote was questioned and he faced accusations of stealing the race. Yanukovich's win was annulled following the Orange Revolution uprising, with former President Victor Yushchenko winning the revote. Tymoshenko stood alongside Yushchenko during the Orange Revolution, but later political infighting broke down their alliance. In a recent interview with CNN, Yanukovich attributed his dramatic comeback to the current economic situation, saying people voted for him because they believe he can improve the economy. ""I want to tell the people of Ukraine ... we will repay the arrears of wages and pensions, what the current government never managed to do,"" he said Thursday. ""Given the dire situation in public finances, we will do this by reducing the costs of (the) bureaucratic system. We will start with ourselves.""","Yanukovich pledges to make country ""a bridge between East and West""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An Italian and an Iranian were among nine dead from a terror attack at an eatery popular among expatriates in the western Indian city of Pune, authorities said Sunday. Pune Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh identified the two as Saeed Abdul Ghani of Iran and Nadia Materinia of Italy. Saturday's blast at the German Bakery wounded 60 people, including a dozen foreign nationals from several countries, including Yemen, Sudan, Taiwan and Germany. Home Secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters Saturday that the explosives were packed in a bag noticed by a waiter at the eatery, located in northeast Pune's Koregaon Park. The explosion occurred at about 7:30 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) Saturday. Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram described the incident, which occurred in the yard outside the building, where people were eating, as a terrorist act. ""It is a first significant terrorist incident in 14 months,"" he told reporters, referring to the 2008 Mumbai assault. In that brazen series of attacks, gunmen took over three luxury hotels and a Jewish center and shot up several other places, including a restaurant, over three days. In all, more than 160 people were killed and hundreds more wounded. India blamed the attacks on the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which the United States regards as a terrorist organization. Pillai, the top bureaucrat in the Home Ministry, told reporters in New Delhi that nearby Osho Ashram was one of the sites surveyed by Lashkar-e-Taiba suspect David Headley, a U.S. citizen facing terror charges in the United States. Headley, a Chicago resident, faces six counts of conspiracy to bomb places in India, and to murder and maim people in India and Denmark; and of providing material support to foreign terrorist plots and providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba. Headley faces an additional six counts of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in the Mumbai attacks in which six Americans died. Headley, who is in U.S. custody, has pleaded not guilty and is cooperating with authorities. Chidambaram noted that the German Bakery -- a restaurant specializing in Western food -- is frequented by foreigners and Indians and is also near Chabad House -- a welcoming center run by Jews for people of all faiths -- and an ashram. Chidambaram, however, cautioned reporters not to ""draw any conclusions"" about who may have been behind the blast. Rabbi Betzalel Kupchik, whose Chabad house is about 100 meters from the blast site, expressed doubt that his organization had been targeted, but said his response would be to redouble his efforts to do good. ""Every time that happens something not good in the world, we have to make more goodness and kindness because you cannot fight the darkness, you have to make the light,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""We have to make more goodness and kindness."" The Osho Ashram -- about 500 meters from the restaurant -- describes itself as a 28-acre ""tropical oasis where nature and the 21st century blend seamlessly."" The commune and meditation center was founded by the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who returned to India from the United States in the 1980s. ""We don't know who they were looking for,"" said Chen Amiel, who was meditating inside the ashram when the blast occurred. ""I was meditating very deep,"" he said. ""I heard something, but I couldn't identify it."" Afterward, he approached the site of the blast and surveyed the damage. Though windows were blown out, the structure appeared intact, he said. ""All the yard was destroyed,"" he said. Initially, authorities thought a cooking gas cylinder had exploded, but all cylinders were accounted for, according to sister network CNN-IBN. An anti-terrorism squad is assisting in the investigation, Chandra Iyengar, home secretary for Maharashtra state, told CNN. Saturday's blast comes a day after Indian and Pakistani officials agreed to meet in New Delhi later this month in a bid to resume their dialogue frozen by the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The officials will meet in the Indian capital February 25, according to India's External Affairs Ministry. India suspended its fragile peace process with arch-rival Pakistan in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The planned meeting follows a trip last month by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to South Asia. During his tour, he warned that a terrorist syndicate operated by al Qaeda aimed to spark a conflict between India and Pakistan. He praised what he saw as India's restraint in the wake of the Mumbai strikes, but cautioned it may wear out in the event of another such attack. CNN's Harmeet Singh and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Police say Saeed Abdul Ghani of Iran and Nadia Materinia of Italy among dead .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hollywood star Will Smith led a London crowd of 46,664 in a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" to Nelson Mandela on Friday at a party for the South African prisoner, president and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Nelson Mandela had a smile and a message. Smith introduced Mandela to the London crowd celebrating Mandela's life with the words ""The one, the only, the birthday boy, Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandelaaaaaaaaaa."" London was the scene of a concert 20 years ago to celebrate Mandela's 70th and to raise awareness of his imprisonment. Mandela told cheering fans, ""Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we can stand before you free. ""We are honored to be back in London for this wonderful occasion. ""But even as we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. ""Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done. Our work is for freedom for all.""  Watch Mandela at the party » . As Mandela walked on stage, Smith led the crowd in a chorus of ""Happy Birthday."" Proceeds from the concert in London's Hyde Park will go toward the 46664 Campaign, which Mandela founded in 2003 to raise awareness about the impact of AIDS, especially in Africa, and to promote HIV-prevention measures around the world. The name of the charity represents Mandela's prison number when he was incarcerated at Robben Island. Organizers put 46,664 tickets up for sale. The finale of the concert saw Queen, Amy Winehouse and Jerry Dammers performing ""Free Nelson Mandela,"" a 1980s hit from the Specials that quickly became an anti-apartheid anthem, with pretty much every act joining them on stage.  Watch stars perform for Mandela » . Dammers was also one of the driving forces behind the London concert in 1988 to awareness of Mandela's long imprisonment by the South African authorities. The former South African president turns 90 on July 18.  Watch the crowd celebrate » . Speculation surrounded whether Winehouse would perform after being  hospitalized with lung problems last week. More than a dozen African artists, including Johnny Clegg and the Soweto Gospel Choir, performed. Smith, music legend Quincy Jones and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton were among the stars introducing acts. Other guests at the concert included British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former U.S. President Clinton, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and actor Robert De Niro. Mandela served as his country's first democratically elected president from 1994 to 1999. In recent years, he has campaigned on behalf of HIV and AIDS awareness and has long called the battle against AIDS a basic human right. In 1964, a court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland. While in prison, Mandela became recognized as the most significant black leader in South Africa, and he became a potent symbol of resistance in the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom. South African President F.W. de Klerk released Mandela in February 1990 after 27 years in prison. Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress the following year, and in 1994, he was elected president of his country.","Celebrities, statesmen gather in London to celebrate Mandela's 90th birthday .

It may take several hours for officials to determine whether anybody won the enormous national lottery drawing, which is held in 42 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia. Why you keep playing the lottery . The prize swelled Saturday after no one hit all six numbers. The game's largest prize to date was $365 million, which was awarded in 2006 to a group of eight co-workers at a Nebraska meat-packing plant. In 2005, a group of four in Oregon won a $340 million jackpot -- considered the second largest. Those record drawings happened when the cost for a Powerball ticket was $1. In January, the price increased to $2, with officials saying it would lead to an increased number of large jackpots. At the same time, the odds improved somewhat because officials reduced the number of red balls -- the powerballs -- from 39 to 35. Earlier this year, Louise White, an 81-year-old Rhode Island resident, came forward as the winner of a $336.4 million prize, the third largest in the game's history.

"(EW.com) -- Betty White's recent roast was handled with more delicacy than most. After all, America's adopted grandmother is 90 years old. That said, she's still intimidating, considering her boundless energy and eighth-decade career resurgence. Indeed, even Uggie from ""The Artist"" showed signs of stage fright during an interview with roastmaster Barbara Walters. From the red carpet to the roasting dais, the stars mostly kept it clean for the beatific blonde, but never fear. I'll skip the sanitized bits and get right to the good stuff. Click through to find out who was best, worst, and most surprising at White's roast. Most pleasant surprise: Bethenny Frankel. That's not to say the Skinnygirl's jokes lacked bite. She ran down a list of things she and White have in common. Among them, alcohol: ""I invented the Skinnygirl Margarita. She invented Prohibition."" Still, it was nice to see the reality maven use her razor tongue to get a laugh instead of to bust her husband's b***s. Even better, before Frankel even began, White asked to borrow the youngster's sky-high stiletto, pointed at the heel, looked at the audience, and improvised, ""This is longer than most of the men here."" Zing! Least pleasant surprise: Lisa Lampanelli. And I mean that as a compliment. The brassy comic, who was just fired from ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" showed up unannounced to school the rest of the roasters on how an insult is really dished out. Most cringe-inducing roast: I love ""The Office's"" Oscar Nuñez, but his out-of-nowhere jokes about how the last living ""Golden Girl"" is a racist abortion addict were met with uncomfortable silence. He would have done better to give White the same lap dance he gave to Sandra Bullock in ""The Proposal."" Go-to audience morale booster: Abe Vigoda reaction shots. Obviously. Best topical references . -- There were not one, not two, but three shout-outs to John Travolta's recent sex scandal, the best of which was in a pre-taped bit by David Letterman. In his ""Top 10 Little Known Facts About Betty White,"" No. 4 was ""Has been known to make inappropriate advances on male masseurs."" -- Joy Behar joked that Walters ""tried to turn on [""View"" panelist] Elisabeth Hasselbeck by dressing up as Mitt Romney"" and ""tying the family dog to the roof of the car."" -- Roast fixture Jeffrey Ross called White ""the only person who truly saw Titanic in 3-D"" and said that she thought ""50 Shades of Grey"" was about her hair...down there. Requisite Kardashian reference: About White's Snickers Super Bowl ad, Ross quipped that he ""thought Kim Kardashian was the only one who got famous for putting chocolate in her mouth."" Oddest musical interlude: Liza Minnelli sang a penis-pun-filled riff on Cole Porter's ""You're the Top."" That is all. Classiest act: Walters. She summed it up best with her opening jab: ""Yesterday, I was talking to the president of the United States. Today I'm talking to a bunch of second-rate comedians and a dog."" Walters stuck to ""This is what it's come to"" eye rolls and dry-as-a-bone jokes over the tawdry topics that tend to populate these ceremonies. Speaking of which... Least surprising joke trend: ""Betty White is an old slut."" These words were never actually uttered, of course, but the writing was all over the wall. Not to say the jokes weren't hilarious. Some highlights: . -- Walters, in a rare copulation joke: ""[Betty was] the first woman to do Shakespeare in the Globe Theater — literally, she did him in the balcony."" -- Hot in Cleveland costar Jane Leeves: ""Betty is so old, she babysat Larry King. [Valerie Bertinelli on seeing King on the dais: ""Oh, I thought he was a leftover Halloween decoration.""] . -- Larry King: ""Betty, at your age, it's a fine line between a roast and a cremation.... Betty is so old, she remembers the first days of Pompeii. She's so old, she thinks I'm jail bait."" -- Lampanelli: ""Betty is a Renaissance woman -- she was born in 1543.... On her first game show, the grand prize was fire."" -- Ross: ""The Friars Club is the only place where Betty can meet older men. Who did your make-up? Tim Burton? Where do you shop? Forever 71?... More men have died on top of Betty [who had three husbands], than Mount Everest. Her tramp stamp is in Sanskrit."" - Freddie Roman: ""The Last Supper was the first roast you attended."" Best passive-aggressive retaliation: Rounding out the ceremony, White skipped the traditional chance to fire back at her roasters (because Lampanelli ""stole all [her] material""). Instead, she gave a grandma-appropriate speech, complete with backhanded compliments like, ""I really had a good time...and I didn't expect to."" Touché, Betty, touché. See the full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox's parents are hopeful that an Italian court's decision not to re-evaluate the evidence against their daughter means she will be found not guilty of killing her roommate. Edda Mellas and Curt Knox say they have never believed their daughter was guilty. ""We asked for the independent review because we were sure that anybody [who] independently looked at it would support our position,"" Edda Mellas, Knox's mother, told CNN's Larry King in an interview to air Friday night. ""Now, maybe the court decided that they don't even need that support. That our arguments have already been good enough."" Knox, of Seattle, Washington, has been in an Italian jail and on trial for nearly two years on charges that she helped murder her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox's defense lawyers had asked the court for an independent review of the evidence, which can be requested if there is contested or contradicting evidence. Prosecutors say a kitchen knife, allegedly the murder weapon, has Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's DNA on the blade. The defense disputes that, but last Friday, the court denied the request for a review. Closing arguments in the trial are expected at the beginning of November, and Knox's parents hope a verdict will finally vindicate their daughter.  Watch Curt Knox say why he thinks his daughter was arrested » . Her father, Curt Knox, told CNN that he thinks Amanda Knox was targeted as a suspect from the beginning. Within days of Kercher's murder, Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were questioned and portrayed in the media as the undisputed killers. ""I believe that there was a huge mistake made very, very early on by, you know, having a -- literally a 'case closed,' you know, presentation by the police over there,"" he said. Prosecutors held news conferences weeks after the killing, declaring the case solved. Knox, Sollecito and bar owner Patrick Lumumba were believed to have killed Kercher during a sexual game gone horribly awry. Knox was criticized in newspapers and tabloids around the world for her demeanor after the killing, which included photos of her and Sollecito comforting each other as crime scene investigators looked for clues in her house. Knox's mother told King that those headlines couldn't be further from the truth. ""You know, she's very much a person who internalizes,"" Mellas said. ""She was extremely upset, and her roommate testified that when she found out it was Meredith that was killed, she was very upset. She cried; she did all of that. But by the time those photos were taken, it was hours later, and she was being comforted by Raffaele."" As the investigation went on, the scenario of what happened changed. Lumumba was released because he had an airtight alibi, and DNA evidence from the crime scene soon pointed to a different suspect: Rudy Guede. Guede was sentenced to 30 years for the murder in a separate trial and is appealing the verdict. Knox's parents believe that Guede is the sole killer, but because the prosecution hammered the idea that Knox and Sollecito were guilty, they couldn't back away from it. ""They were just too far into it, and they've been trying to press it ever since,"" Curt Knox said. Knox's family and friends insist that the girl they know wouldn't kill anyone. Her parents say they never believed that she was guilty. After the murder, Mellas said, friends and family told Knox to leave Italy -- to either come home or stay with relatives in Germany -- but Knox refused because she wanted to help find the killer and prove that she had nothing to do with it. ""Many people asked her to leave, but she said no. 'I'm going to stay. I'm going to try and help. I'm going to try and finish school,' "" Mellas said. Looking back, her parents wish Knox had left. Now, all they can do is wait -- and hope things turn out how they believe they should. ""We have to believe that what they're hearing in court -- and it's so clear that she had nothing to do with it -- then they'll come out with the right answer,"" Curt Knox said. ""I mean, that's -- that's what we have to believe.""","Knox is on trial in Italy, accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher .

"(CNN)  -- European champions Spain underlined their credentials as one of the favorites for the World Cup with a 2-0 victory over France at the Stade de France on Wednesday night. FIFA's top-rated nation scored first half goals through David Villa and Sergio Ramos to deflate France, who were playing their first match since their controversial qualification for South Africa at the expense of Ireland. The emphatic win increases the pressure on French coach Raymond Domenech, whose popularity continues to plummet while Thierry Henry, whose infamous handball helped eliminate the Irish, was jeered when he left the field in the second half by a frustrated home crowd. It all added up to a night of misery for the French with their supporters taking to cheering every pass completed by the stylish Spanish side. France did make a good start and Franck Ribery impressed on the right side of midfield, but in the 21st minute David Silva dummied Andres Iniesta's through pass and his Valencia teammate Villa easily beat Hugo Lloris. The vital second goal arrived just before halftime as Real Madrid's Ramos was given too much time and space to cut inside and curl home a shot with his left foot with flicked off Julien Escude and past Lloris. Barcelona midfielder Xavi and Liverpool's Fernando Torres were given run outs by Spain in the second half and Sevilla winger Jesus Navas almost made it 3-0 in injury time as his shot went narrowly wide. Domenech's men had to wait until the 80th minute to seriously threaten the Spain goal as Chelsea's Florent Malouda headed against the post after a cross from fellow substitute Djibril Cisse. In the other prestige friendly on Wednesday between traditional powerhouses, Diego Maradona's Argentina beat Germany 1-0 in Berlin. Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higuain scored the only goal just before halftime as he beat onrushing home keeper Rene Adler to a through ball and rounded him to score. Veteran midfielder Juan Veron almost added a second with a 40 meter effort. The Netherlands edged past the United States 2-1 win with goals from Dirk Kuyt from the penalty spot and Klaas Jan Huntelaar, while Uruguay came from behind to win 3-1 in Switzerland. Gokhan Inler's penalty put the hosts in front, but Diego Forlan equalized before further efforts from Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani.","European champions Spain beat France 2-0 in friendly at Stade de France .

"(CNN) -- Former Miami Dolphins player Chad Johnson is to be arraigned Thursday on a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, prosecutors in Florida said Wednesday. Johnson is charged with first-degree misdemeanor domestic battery in the alleged head-butting last month of his new wife. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail, according to the Broward State Attorney's Office. A day after the alleged incident August 11 at his home in Davie, Florida, where he lived with his wife, Evelyn Lozada, the Miami Dolphins released the longtime NFL wide receiver. He played a preseason game the day before the incident, but had not participated in a regular season game with the team. No reason was given for his release. Johnson and Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show ""Basketball Wives,"" married on July 4. Their time together was to be featured in a new series on that network. Lozada files for divorce . That reality show, ""Ev and Ocho,"" was canceled shortly after the alleged head-butting, VH1 said on its website. According to the arrest report that the Davie Police Department released last month, Lozada returned to the couple's home from grocery shopping shortly after 7 p.m. August 11 and noticed a receipt with a charge for a box of condoms. The couple then began talking about the sales receipt and their marriage, according to the arrest report. ""As they were talking, Johnson became upset and without (his wife's) permission, grabbed her and butted her on the forehead, causing a laceration,"" the police report said, giving her account. After trying to calm down a screaming Johnson, his wife said she ran ""to a neighbor's house to get away from"" him. A Davie police officer soon responded and found Johnson's wife with an approximately 3-inch cut in the middle of her forehead. Officer Christopher Epps then questioned the football player, the arrest report said. Johnson confirmed there had been an argument, saying his wife had been yelling and that ""she then head-butted Johnson."" Johnson did not have ""visible marks or bruises,"" the arrest report said. His wife indicated she wanted to press charges, signing an affidavit of complaint, according to police. She was taken to Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, Florida, to be treated. The football player was known as Chad Ochocinco -- a Spanish-language take on his jersey number, 85 -- before his marriage. The prolific tweeter, with four posts on August 11 alone, though none about the incident, is known as much for his vibrant personality as his play on the field. He starred in VH1's ""The Ultimate Catch,"" a 2010 reality dating show in which he considered potential female mates in a tournament-style format.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar's ruling junta announced Wednesday a new election law that disqualifies pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from participating in upcoming national elections. The Political Parties Registration Law, announced in state-run newspapers, excludes electoral participation by any member of a political party who has been convicted in court. A Myanmar court convicted Suu Kyi, 64, in August for breaching the terms of her house arrest after American John Yettaw swam uninvited to her lakeside house in Yangon and briefly stayed there. Her ongoing detention was extended to November 2010, and in February a court rejected her appeal for release. Suu Kyi's supporters have said the conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has spent 14 of the last 20 years under house arrest. The new law forces Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the election. The party has 60 days to decide its course of action, but party spokesman Nyan Winn said Wednesday that the party would not comply with the new law. Suu Kyi, the face of democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, was placed under house arrest in 1989. The next year, her party won more than 80 percent of the legislative seats in the first free elections in the country in nearly 30 years. But the military junta disqualified Suu Kyi from serving because of her house arrest and never recognized the election results. The junta has promised to hold elections -- which would be the first since 1990 -- later this year, touting them as a step toward democracy. No polling date has been set. At the United Nations, a spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement that the organization was studying the laws. ""The indications available so far suggest that they do not measure up to our expectations of what is needed for an inclusive political process,"" the statement said. In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the law makes a mockery of the democratic process. ""Given the tenor of the election laws that they've put forward, there's no hope that this election will be credible,"" P.J. Crowley told reporters. ""We are deeply disappointed with the political party law which excludes all of Burma's more than 2,000 political prisoners from political participation,"" he said. ""We are also troubled the law appears to bar National League of Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from running. It may also prohibit her from membership in her own party. This is a step in the wrong direction."" Still, he said, ""We will continue our outreach and our dialogue, not because we expect it to solve this instantly. Burma has to figure out how it wants to advance. It's obviously struggling to do that."" If Myanmar wants to build its credibility with the rest of the world, ""it has to find a way to have a process where it has meaningful dialogue with ethnic groups and other political movements,"" he said. Amnesty International urged Myanmar to overturn the new law. ""There are at least 2,200 political prisoners in Myanmar, most of whom are in prison simply because they tried to exercise their rights peacefully,"" said Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher. ""Instead of passing laws that strip away more of their rights, the Myanmar authorities should immediately release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and remove restrictions on their political activity."" The new government stipulation is the latest political hurdle for Suu Kyi. She was already banned from becoming president by Myanmar's recently amended constitution, which prohibits presidents and their parents, spouses and children from owing allegiance to another country. Suu Kyi was married to British academic Michael Aris, who died in 1999, and had two sons with him. The United States considers Myanmar's military regime repressive for cracking down on political opponents, the most prominent of whom is Suu Kyi. However, after years of refusing direct talks with the reclusive nation, Washington has recently indicated a possible re-engagement.

"(CNN) -- Three Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police officers were shot to death while responding to a 911 call of a domestic argument triggered by a urinating dog, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case. Law enforcement from several jurisdictions respond to a shooting standoff at Pittsburgh home Saturday. The officers were the first department fatalities since 1995, according to the department. Police said following the shootings Saturday that Richard Poplawski, 22, would be charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and other charges. Poplawski, who was shot in the leg during a four-hour standoff with police, was hospitalized at an undisclosed location, police said. Details of the incident were included in the police complaint seeking an arrest warrant for Poplawski. The complaint says Margaret Poplawski called 911 about 7 a.m. Saturday to report that her son was ""giving her a hard time.""  Watch officers respond at the scene » . She told police she awoke to discover that ""the dog had urinated on the floor,"" and awakened her son ""to confront him about it."" The two had an argument, and Margaret Poplawski told her son she was calling police to remove him from her home, according to the complaint. When officers Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III arrived, she opened the door and let them in. ""Mrs. Poplawski reported that as the officers entered approximately 10 feet into the residence, she heard gunshots, turned and saw her son about six feet away with a long rifle in his hands, at which point she fled downstairs after asking him, 'What the hell have you done?'"" the complaint said. Margaret Poplawski reported she stayed in the basement during the standoff, and heard her son yell, ""Yeah, I've been shot,"" and ""I'm standing down, come in and help me,"" according to the complaint. Police Chief Nathan Harper identified the dead officers as Eric Kelly, Mayhle and Sciullo. Kelly was a 14-year veteran of the department; the other two had worked there for two years each.  Watch prayers for fallen officers » . The chief said Sciullo was the first to approach the home, and was shot in the head as he entered the doorway. When Mayhle tried to help his fellow officer, he also was shot in the head. Kelly arrived at the scene and was shot before he could aid the other two officers, Harper said. Harper said the suspect fired from a bedroom window, shooting at an armored vehicle carrying a SWAT team -- preventing those officers and medics from reaching the wounded policemen. Two other officers, Timothy McManaway and Brian Jones, were injured. McManaway was shot in the hand and Jones, who was trying to secure the rear of the house, broke his leg trying to get over a fence, Harper said. Rescue units from other jurisdictions also were met with gunfire, the chief said. McManaway told police he responded to the scene after a report that officers were being fired upon, according to the complaint. As he arrived, he saw that Kelly was ""lying supine"" by his personal SUV, as Kelly had just completed his shift and apparently was on his way home when he responded to help the other officers. Kelly raised his arm for help, and McManaway said he ran to Kelly, who was wounded and said he could not breathe. As he was trying to help Kelly, shots rang out from the home, injuring his hand, he said, according to the complaint. McManaway returned fire, and told authorities he pulled Kelly behind the SUV, where the two remained until SWAT officers arrived. Kelly was taken to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries. Margaret Poplawski told police her son had enlisted in the Marine Corps a few years ago, but was discharged for assaulting his drill sergeant in basic training, according to the complaint. Since his discharge, she told police, he had been ""stockpiling guns and ammunition, buying and selling the weapons online, because he believed that as a result of the economic collapse, the police were no longer able to protect society. Mrs. Poplawski reported that her son only liked police when they were not curtailing his constitutional rights, which he was determined to protect,"" the complaint said. Autopsies showed that Kelly died of gunshot wounds to the trunk and lower extremities, Sciullo died from gunshot wounds to the head and trunk, and Mayhle was shot in the head, the complaint said. ""We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty on one call,"" Harper, the police chief, said. ""They have paid the ultimate sacrifice."" Authorities believe Poplawski, wearing a bullet-proof vest, aimed more than 100 rounds at police, using an AK-47, Harper said Saturday. Harper said some neighbors were evacuated during the standoff. Police had responded to calls from the home two or three times previously, Harper said.","The officers were the first department fatalities since 1995 .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, escaped an apparent assassination attempt in the capital, Mogadishu, on Wednesday, just two days after being selected as the troubled country's new leader. According to a presidential press officer and several journalists at the scene, early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, where the president was having high-level meetings. At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in the attack, according to journalists at the scene. CNN affiliate KTN reported that Kenyan Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Ongeri was in the hotel at the time of the blast. Mohamud, a political newcomer who has worked for the United Nations and several other international organizations, was voted in by Somali lawmakers Monday. Somalia picks political newcomer as president in landmark vote . His election marked a milestone for the nation, which plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. Somalia has not had an effective central government since then and has mostly remained under a shaky transitional federal government. On Tuesday, the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab, which has been fighting to overthrow the authorities, released a statement dismissing the elections and calling them a Western plot. It vowed to oppose the newly named government. Al-Shabaab ""does not regard the so called elections as being in the interests of the Somali people.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham suffered an Achilles tendon injury before Clarence Seedorf scored in the final minute to give AC Milan a 1-0 win over Chievo on Sunday, a result that moved them to within a point of leaders Inter at the top of Serie A. Veteran England midfielder Beckham hobbled off the pitch in tears, reaching down to nurse his left heel, with TV network Sky Sports Italia reporting that he had suffered a suspected ruptured Achilles tendon injury. If that proves to be the prognosis, it would leave Beckham's hopes of appearing for England at this summer's World Cup finals in tatters. One sports physician has said Beckham has no chance of playing in the World Cup in South Africa, according to the Press Association. ""It's remotely possible he may be running in three months,"" said Dr Tom Crisp. ""The chances of him being fit to play for England are non-existent."" Beckham's injury soured Milan's eventual win, achieved with just 10 men as all three substitutes had already been deployed before the former Manchester United midfielder was forced to limp off. One of those substitutes, Seedorf, was to score the only goal of the game, firing home a superb long-distance strike. ""This was an important victory, but this injury prevents us from really enjoying it. It's an important injury and we need to be able to judge how serious it is,"" Milan coach Leonardo told Sky Sports Italia. The win means Milan move to within a single point of leaders and city rivals Inter at the top of the table. Elsewhere, Juventus managed to waste a three-goal advantage, with all their goals coming in the opening 10 minutes, to draw 3-3 at home to Siena. Alessandro del Piero netted two of Juve's goals, but Abdel Kader Ghezzal also hit a double for the visitors to leave Juventus coach Alberto Zaccheroni stunned. Roma remain in third position, six points behind Inter, after they were also held to a 3-3 draw, this time at struggling Livorno -- for whom Cristiano Lucarelli scored a hat-trick. A dramatic weekend in Serie A began on Friday night when leaders Inter had Sulley Muntari sent off in a shock 3-1 defeat at Catania.","Clarence Seedorf scored a last minute goal to give Milan 1-0 win over Chievo .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police in the Pakistani city of Karachi have opened a murder case against the owner of a garment factory where a fire killed more than 250 people this week, a senior police official said Thursday. Also under investigation are the two sons of the factory owner, whose name is Abdul Aziz; the managers of the factory; the shareholders of the factory; and any government official who failed to enforce safety regulations at the factory, said Amir Farooqi, a senior Karachi police official. The announcement means police officers will investigate the fire -- one of the worst industrial accidents in Pakistan's history -- gather evidence and submit their findings to prosecutors who will then decide whether to charge the individuals. Farooqi said police have opened a murder case because the exit doors of this factory were locked, preventing many people from escaping the blaze that swept through the building during Tuesday night and continued to burn Wednesday. Nobody has been arrested in the case yet. Police officers are still looking for Aziz and his sons, who are believed to be ""hiding,"" Farooqi said. Other charges in the case may eventually include causing bodily harm, negligence and destruction of property, he added. At this phase in the investigation, police do not have to name all of the accused. That's why they're not identifying any government officials or factory managers at this point. Earlier Thursday, Karachi authorities lowered the death toll from the blaze to 258 from 289 previously. The higher toll reported Wednesday became inaccurate because of the rapidly rising number of deaths and confusion amid multiple rescue and recovery operations, according to Karachi Fire Department Chief Ehtesham Salim and Shabih Saddiqi, a local government official. Salim said the latest death toll is based on the number of bodies and remains recovered from the factory. Several people are still missing and recovery crews are working to find them. Salim said investigators are still trying to establish what caused the fire. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Karachi authorities lower the death toll from the fire to 258 from 289 .

"(CNN) -- With all sides vowing politicking isn't in order, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got a close-up view Friday of the devastation caused this week by Hurricane Isaac -- days ahead of a visit by his November foe, President Barack Obama. Romney went to Louisiana's Jefferson Parish, glimpsing the flooding and downed trees along with Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sen. David Vitter, both fellow Republicans. The former Massachusetts governor, accompanied by his wife, Ann, said the trip was ""to learn and obviously to draw some attention to what's going (on) here... so that people around the country know that people down here need help."" Hours earlier, the White House announced that Obama canceled a trip to Cleveland and would instead head Monday to Louisiana. Obama will meet officials dealing with Isaac's impact and ""making sure that unmet needs are being met and that the federal response led by FEMA is helping citizens in the affected areas and the state and local officials who are responding to the storm,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said. The president on Friday addressed the situation to start his speech to troops in Fort Bliss, Texas. He vowed the government will ""keep doing everything that it can"" to help those suffering due to the storm. ""As a country, we stand united with our fellow Americans in their time of need,"" Obama said. Jindal echoed that view, saying he was ""thrilled"" both major party's presidential nominees were making time to visit his state. ""There's no time for partisan politics in Louisiana at this point in time,"" Jindal said. Mary Landrieu, the Democratic senator from Louisiana, made a political point directed at Romney during a news conference in Plaquemines Parish. She said she hopes the Republican nominee will realize the importance of the Army Corps of Engineers and its projects that tackle hurricanes and storm damage. She called the agency's budget ""underfunded."" ""Two billion dollars is not nearly enough new investment in core infrastructure for our nation, so one of the things I hope (Romney) sees firsthand when he's here is that,"" she said. ""I realize he's all about cutting the federal budget, but this is one agency that absolutely cannot take any additional cuts,"" she said. Isaac made landfall on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which overwhelmed levees and contributed to nearly 1,800 deaths. After slamming into the United States as a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday, Isaac weakened considerably but still dumped ample rain as it headed north through Arkansas and toward Missouri. ""There are some individuals in the metropolitan area of New Orleans that have suffered damages in excess of what they suffered during Katrina,"" said Mayor Mitch Landrieu, where 20 inches of rain fell, according to the National Weather Service. With 25 mph sustained winds, the tropical depression moved Friday night into the Middle Mississippi River Valley, where it is expected to dump several more inches of rain, the National Weather Service said. By Saturday night, it should start affecting the Ohio River Valley. Already, Isaac caused at least 19 deaths in Haiti while churning north from the Caribbean and into the Gulf of Mexico and then another four in Louisiana and Mississippi. It has also left its share of destruction and headaches, many of which persisted on Friday. That includes hundreds of thousands without power around the Gulf Coast, including 430,000 Entergy Louisiana customers Friday evening. Such such storm-related problems led the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry to offer up to 50 gallons of fuel per day for purchase by dairy farmers who were without power. The same department noted more than 160,000 gallons of diesel and 138,000 gallons of unleaded fuel had been requested by hospitals, law enforcement agencies and other emergency operators. Floodwaters remained high, meanwhile, in numerous parishes where the lingering heavy rain combined with storm surges to inundate scores homes and businesses. In Plaquemines Parish, for instance, officials intentionally breached a levee to help drain floodwater in nearby communities. The bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water in the kitchen of a home in the parish, officials said late Thursday. An autopsy will determine the cause of the death for the couple, Nungesser said. In St. Tammany Parish, a Slidell resident was killed while driving through four feet of floodwater, state police said. Ascension Parish announced voluntary evacuations for parts of the region. Animals have also been impacted -- from the 94 cats and dogs in shelters in Alexandria and another 63 in Haughton, to state authorities waiving restrictions to allow beef cattle to be evacuated from Louisiana to Texas. The storm had a ""major impact"" in Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant said. The state was among those soaked by the storm, including 17 inches in Kiln. A falling tree killed a tow truck driver in the state as he was attempting to clear debris on a road, officials said. Water levels at 700-acre Lake Tangipahoa dropped Friday as authorities pumped water from it, meaning a damaged earthen dam may not have to be breached, Mississippi Emergency Management spokesman Brett Carr said. ""We don't know if it's going to be enough,"" said Carr of the water level drops. ""We are clearing land in preparation for the cut."" Residents living within a half-mile of the Tangipahoa River, which runs from the lake south into Louisiana, remain under an evacuation order. Officials in Louisiana say two bridges in Tangipahoa Parish have been closed because the river's water level has been too high. Amid such continued challenges and the massive clean-up, there were also signs Friday of life returning to normal. Days after closing off the waterway, the Coast Guard captain at the New Orleans port on Friday reopened the Mississippi River, from Baton Rouge to the mouth of the river, to limited vessel traffic. ""Although the Mississippi River was heavily impacted by the storm, the navigational channel is in good condition. The Coast Guard is working with the maritime industry to respond to a number of ship groundings and barge strandings along the riverbank caused by the river surge and high winds of the storm,"" the Coast Guard said. And Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport officials said Friday that flights had resumed and commercial power had been restored. Terrebonne Parish in Louisiana announced, meanwhile, that its curfew had been lifted, its government offices reopened and its public transit system was back in operation -- though a boil water advisory remains in effect. Jindal praised the selfless actions of people, like a caretaker who stayed behind to help nursing home patients despite losing homes during Isaac and Katrina. ""I'm in awe of the generosity and resilience of the people,"" he said. CNN's Brian Todd and Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: What's left of Isaac is headed toward the Ohio River Valley .

"(CNN) -- Recently, the chairman of the U.S. bishops' Committee on Religious Liberty argued that the Obama administration's requirement that most health insurance plans cover contraception goes against ""the mandate of Jesus Christ."" But Jesus said nothing about contraception coverage, of course, or most any other issues related to sexuality. So, what is the issue? The current mandate would require that Catholic institutions like universities and hospitals include coverage for contraception and sterilization, although it exempts Catholic parishes. Official Catholic teaching is against contraception and sterilization. But this issue goes beyond internal Catholic Church concerns and moves into the public arena. The U.S. Catholic bishops and other conservative Christian groups have argued that the Obama administration's requirement wars with religious liberty and the role of conscience. Last Sunday, at least 100 bishops had letters read at masses in their dioceses imploring Catholics to oppose this coverage. Newspapers have carried stories of Catholic bishops making apocalyptic predictions that Catholic universities and hospitals would have to close their doors if this coverage is allowed. But who is really making this argument besides the bishops and a minority of conservative Catholics and Christians, especially when studies show that 98% of sexually active Catholic women have used contraceptives? First, a brief history. Since the 1930s and the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Church, most Christian denominations have allowed for contraceptives, leaving the decision up to married couples. The Catholic Church rejected that position, standing relatively alone on the issue, and has allowed, since 1951, only the rhythm method for birth control (this is now called natural family planning). When the Catholic Church went through changes in the 1960s, during the Second Vatican Council, or Vatican II (1962-1965), the pope formed a committee outside of the council to evaluate the stand against contraceptives. The result: 75 out of 90 on the committee recommended that the church allow for contraceptives for married couples. Even so, in 1968, Pope Paul VI issued the encyclical (papal document) Humanae Vitae (Of Human Life), in which he rejected the conclusion of the committee and maintained the church's opposition to contraception for married couples. Immediately, Catholic theologians issued a statement disagreeing with the encyclical, arguing against its methods and conclusions, and maintaining that Catholics may act responsibly by following their well-informed consciences on the issue. Since that time, studies have shown that most Catholic couples use some form of contraception. Most Catholic theologians (professors of theology at colleges and universities) reject the church's teaching on the issue, and have argued that a teaching that the majority of the faithful have rejected is not valid. Those are historical facts. Fast-forward to now, when the bishops and other Christian groups are appealing to the role of ""conscience,"" a concept on which the bishops themselves and recent popes have put little emphasis, in contrast to the role of ""obedience."" If they are going to appeal to conscience, then they must also respect the consciences of responsible adults -- Catholic women and men, and non-Catholics who work at Catholic institutions. They must respect the role of parents to decide how many children they can have, and can afford to take care of. No one is forcing Catholics to take contraceptives. It is a question of access, and hence, of justice. They must also respect the role of Catholics to share their expertise in health care and in public policy, as Vatican II argued. Catholic theologians and other professors at academic universities have the responsibility to search for truth and to work for justice. The Catholic moral tradition has long argued that there is a difference between morality and public policy. There is another messy side to this. The Catholic Church argues that human life must be protected from the moment of conception. Therefore, contraception that works after conception to prevent implantation (around six to 10 days after conception), such as with the IUD, would be considered as a category of abortion. So, while the Obama legislation does not require abortion coverage, that ""abortion language"" has also been a part of the Catholic argument. This seems fair enough to those who would argue that a pre-implanted fertilized egg should be protected from the time of conception. But would the majority of Catholics oppose contraceptive coverage that works before conception? And shouldn't women be allowed to make that decision? Would most Catholics and Christians deny health care coverage for women because of this? So here is the question, as I see it, as a Catholic theologian and lifelong Catholic, educated almost entirely at Catholic institutions, and taught to work for human dignity, the common good and social justice: Should the U.S. bishops speak for all Catholics on a matter of national public policy, an issue that most Catholics disagree on within their own church? The bishops have refused to discuss this issue with their fellow Catholics for more than 40 years. And the bishops are all male. What about Catholic theologians, academics, social workers and health care professionals? What about Catholic women? What about the 98%? Public policy involves discussion, dialogue, debate, and sometimes even compromise. That does not mean compromising one's moral principles, but it may involve compromising how those principles are legislated as a matter of public policy in a pluralistic and democratic society.

"(CNN) -- Despite defense criticisms of what it called a ""shameful"" leading question about whether Drew Peterson tried to intimidate a neighbor, a judge ruled Thursday that the former Chicago-area police officer's murder trial can proceed. Five witnesses took the stand in Joliet on Thursday, but not before lawyers from both sides argued about whether a mistrial should be ordered, thus bringing the entire case back to square one. This debate followed testimony Wednesday by Thomas Pontarelli, a Bolingbrook, Illinois, neighbor of Peterson's ex-wife Kathleen Savio and one of those who found her dead in a dry, clean bathtub on March 1, 2004. Pontarelli testified Savio had asked him to put a lock on her bedroom door and also that Peterson had once challenged him about the front door locks at Savio's house being changed, which Pontarelli insisted he didn't do. The night of March 1, he said Peterson -- a police officer in Bolingbrook who was barred from seeing Savio by a protective order -- called the Pontarelli house to say a locksmith was coming to get in his ex-wife's house. After the door was unlocked, Pontarelli, some of his family members and Peterson came across Savio's body, with no rug or towel nearby, in an upstairs bathroom. Later, prosecutor Kathy Patton brought up the time Peterson questioned Pontarelli about whether he'd changed the locks of Savio's front door, asking him, ""Did there come a time when you felt intimidated by him?"" ""Yes,"" Pontarelli responded. ""We had a conversation. He accused me of changing the locks on the front door. I (said) I didn't, but I got his message ... I found a .38 bullet out on the driveway."" Catch up on the Peterson case in 3 minutes . After this statement, defense lawyer Steven Greenberg objected and subsequently Judge Edward Burmila asked the jurors and the witness to leave the courtroom. On Thursday, Greenberg argued for a mistrial, saying, ""(Prosecutors) are going to try and continue ... to put in evidence that people were fearful of Mr. Peterson ... So far, we have a jury that thinks everybody's afraid of Mr. Peterson. How is that fair to Mr. Peterson?"" Calling the state's question leading and unfair, the defense lawyer added that prosecutors were acting as if ""the rules of evidence don't apply to them,"" which he called ""shameful."" Prosecutor Chris Koch, in response, said it was ""absurd"" to suggest the state was ""trying to mislead this jury."" The judge ruled the question and response was inadmissible, later instructing jurors to ignore it and any reference to a bullet. But he also said the trial should continue and that the jury could consider the rest of Pontarelli's testimony. With this issue settled, the trial resumed with the testimony of Louis Oleskiewicz, the paramedic who saw Salvo ""down in the bathtub"" with no pulse. He spoke about her hair being matted down and skin feeling cold and ""waxy."" Oleskiewicz said he didn't see any towels to suggest Savio might have been taking a bath, questioning whether a blue towel shown in a picture from the scene was actually there that night. A locksmith, Robert Akin, took the stand next to discuss being called -- with a call straight to his cell phone, even though he was not on call for his shop that night -- and unlocking the front door of Savio's house, with Peterson standing next to him flashlight in hand. Three Bolingbrook firefighters later testified about their experience at the Savio house that night, noting the presence of several people, including Peterson. Two of them said Peterson, who was in uniform, asked them to be respectful of the scene because it was his ex-wife. Testimony will resume Friday and, after a three-day weekend, pick up on Tuesday. The entire trial is expected to last about four weeks. Peterson's letter to the media . Peterson, now 58, was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Kales, who later became Peterson's fourth wife. He has been called a suspect in her 2007 disappearance, though he's never been charged and she has never been found. Savio and Drew Peterson filed for divorce that October, and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Drew Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. A judge in March 2002 granted Savio a protection order from her ex-husband, prohibiting him from being near her, entering her home or taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits. Savio had claimed that months after that order was issued, Peterson held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home. On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home, spending the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed Savio. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. During opening statements Tuesday, one of Peterson's lawyers argued that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless.

"New York (CNN) -- It was producers who cooked up a money-making scam in the Broadway show ""The Producers,"" but officials allege it was producers who were the victims in a real-life Broadway scheme. Authorities arrested businessman and stockbroker Mark Hotton at his Long Island home Monday morning on charges of defrauding Broadway producers and a Connecticut-based real estate company in two separate ruses, the U.S. district attorney in Manhattan and the FBI said in a news release. From September 2011 to October 2012, Hotton created fake investors and businesses to fool producers of ""Rebecca: The Musical,"" the release said. Hotton promised the show a $4.5 million investment from four overseas investors in return for $60,000 paid to Hotton and entities that he owned, authorities allege. He also is charged with a separate $750,000 real-estate scheme. The ""Rebecca"" producers were introduced to Hotton through the investment community in February 2012, when they had fallen about $4 million short of their budget, producer Ben Sprecher told CNN Tuesday. The producers signed an agreement with Hotton's TM Consulting Inc. on February 7 that entitled Hotton to a $7,500 fee and a guarantee of 8% of any money he raised in excess of $250,000, the government said. Hotton claimed to have secured the $4.5 million from four investors, identified in the news release as Paul Abrams of Hawthorne, East Victoria; Roger Thomas of St. Peter Port, Guernsey; Julian Spencer of Crocker Hill, Chichester, Sussex; and Walter Timmons of London. All of them Hotton allegedly created and portrayed himself through e-mail. Sprecher said he had not doubted the legitimacy of the deal because of the phone conversations and e-mail correspondences that he had with supposed investors. Hotton had even introduced him to a woman he said was Paul Abrams' niece, he said. But when producers started pressing Hotton for the money, Hotton told them Paul Abrams had suddenly died of malaria, Sprecher said. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said that in an investigation begun in September 2012, officials uncovered that the investors' e-mail accounts and the websites for businesses associated with the investors were all controlled by Hotton. ""As part of one alleged scheme, Hotton concocted a cast of characters to invest in a major musical -- investors who turned out to be deep-pocketed phantoms,"" Bharara said in the news release. ""To carry out the alleged fraud, Hotton faked lives, faked companies and even staged a fake death, pretending that one imaginary investor had suddenly died from malaria."" Producers had already spent $6 million on Rebecca and were about to begin rehearsals when they found out the $4.5 million from Hotton was not there, Sprecher said. They are now searching to replace that capital and move forward with the show, which has been indefinitely postponed. Hotton is expected to be presented at federal court in Central Islip, New York, where he will face up to 20 years in prison on each charge, according to officials.","Businessman and stockbroker Mark Hotton is arrested at his Long Island home .

"(CNN) -- When Ernie Els won the U.S. Open in 1994, he was the first South African to claim a major golf title in 16 years. Perhaps more importantly, he was the first to win one since the end of apartheid and the start of the ""Rainbow Nation"" -- his victory at Pennsylvania's Oakmont Country Club came less than two month's after the country's historic elections in which Nelson Mandela was voted president. So when Els won his fourth major crown on Sunday after Australian Adam Scott capitulated on the closing holes of the British Open, the 42-year-old knew who to thank. ""A lot of the Olympic theme this year has got President Mandela in it, so he's been very much in my thoughts,"" Els said of the celebrated former anti-apartheid activist, who turned 94 last week. ""Believe it or not, I was lying watching cricket (South Africa against England) and I was just kind of day-dreaming and that thought came through me in a split second. Scott's collapse hands British Open crown to Els . ""If I win, I told myself, I'd better thank President Mandela because I grew up in the era of the apartheid, and then changing into the democratic era President Mandela was right there. ""Right after the change I was the first one to win a major, so there's a lot of significance there in my life. In a way we intertwined together in a crazy way and I just felt he's been so important for us being where we are today as a nation and as sports people."" Els has joined an elite group of golfers -- including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Lee Trevino -- who have won two Opens on either side of the Atlantic. His earlier successes led the way for compatriots Retief Goosen, who won the U.S. Open in 2001 and 2004, Trevor Immelman (2008 Masters winner) and two players he has helped develop through his golf foundation -- Louis Oosthuizen (2010 British Open) and Charl Schwartzel (2011 Masters). Giving it back: Els' off-course passions . Els' unexpected victory at Royal Lytham and St. Annes, coming 10 years since his 2002 British Open victory at Muirfield, has been hailed by his compatriots. ""Thank you for lifting SA flag high to de world of golf. You are an inspiration to all South African kids,"" Jabu Likhele wrote on Els' Facebook page. Hugo Myburgh posted: ""Truly an inspiration to every South African, that no matter what's happened over years of suffering and struggle can and has been overcome and a true smile reflects that!!!"" Others paid tribute to Els' work with raising awareness of autism, a condition which afflicts his son Ben. ""As a 4 times a year hacker of a golfer and a father of a 26 year old son with severe autism I want to say way to go Ernie winning the Open after all you and your family have been through what a triumph!"" wrote Brad Doyle from Phoenix, Arizona. Son's autism gives golf ace Ernie Els a grand ambition . Nine-year-old Ben Els was watching on television in London while his father conjured up an unlikely victory at the Lancashire links course in north-west England. ""I made a lot of putts with Ben in mind because I know Ben's watching,"" Els, who has raised millions towards building an autism research center, told reporters. ""He loves when I hit golf balls -- he's always there. He comes with me. He loves the flight of the ball and the sound. ""I know he was watching. He gets really excited and I wanted to keep him excited, so I made a lot of putts for him."" Els was supposed to have headed straight to Canada for a PGA Tour event, but has delayed that so he can celebrate with Ben, wife Liezl and daughter Samantha. ""Ben's coming through now nicely. He's a wonderful boy now and he's a bright boy, so we're going to have a lot of fun."" Els has now won major titles in three different decades, but not along ago it appeared that the former world No. 1's days as a contender were over. He failed to qualify for this year's Masters after throwing away a winning position during a PGA Tour event in March, but he rebounded with a ninth-place finish at last month's U.S. Open as he was again in the title mix on the final day. ""Not too many people win majors at my age, it means so much more, it feels so special,"" he told CNN. ""You're almost blase in a way when you're young. It was like okay, you knew you were going to win and here we go. When you get older and you've gone through the mill a bit like I have, this is so special."" Last year Els, known as the ""Big Easy"" for his languid playing style and relaxed manner, dropped out of the top-50 rankings for the first time since 1993. He has now moved back up to 15th, and paid tribute to his coach Claude Harmon -- the latest in a line of top instructors from that family, including his father Butch (who also worked with Els) and his namesake grandfather. ""He's helped me immensely with my game, with confidence and so forth. I'm very grateful to Claude, he's one of many in that circle around me,"" Els said. ""He's one of many I want to thank, but obviously Claude is right at the top of the list.""","Ernie Els dedicates British Open victory to former president Nelson Mandela .

"(CNN) -- Gary Johnson says there are three keys to his campaign being successful: he needs you to know who he is, he needs to be on the ballot in as many states as possible and he needs other libertarians to support him. And for the next two months, Johnson, the Libertarian party candidate for president and acknowledged underdog, will be zig-zagging across the country to make those admittedly unique goals a reality. That is the thrust of his argument: Once you get to know me, I swear you'll like me. Johnson has fashioned himself the ""clear alternative"" to Republican candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in November's presidential election. The most recent CNN/ORC International poll shows that 3% of likely voters and 4% of registered voters say they'd vote for Johnson. But the fact he is even included in a poll is enough to get Johnson excited. ""It is one thing if it gets reported that I am at 4% nationally,"" said Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, ""but I don't think I go down when people take a look at who I am and what I have done, I think it actually goes up."" And in some ways, he has proof to back that up. Johnson first ran for governor of New Mexico -- a state with a majority of Democratic voters -- in 1994 as a Republican. He won in the Republican primary, defeating three other Republicans, and then defeated an incumbent Democratic governor by 10 points. After four years in office, Johnson ran again and won in 1998. Johnson's popularity remained consistently high through his time as governor, leading one paper to remark that he was ""arguably the most popular governor of the decade."" CNN Poll: Could Gary Johnson be spoiler? But he has his work cut out for him. The most notable third party presidential contenders are from the 1800s -- John Tyler, Andrew Johnson -- and even they were largely independents because their original parties disowned them. The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant run at the White House was Ross Perot in 1992. He ultimately carried no states and earned 19,743,821 votes. In 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was labeled as a ""spoiler"" after getting nearly 100,000 votes in Florida. He was seen by some as siphoning votes away from Democratic candidate Al Gore, who ultimately lost to George W. Bush in the closest election in modern U.S. history. And Johnson, who first announced his candidacy as a Republican, only switched to Libertarian when his campaign failed to gain much traction during the primaries. He has huge burdens when it comes to fund-raising -- he had only $14,265 in cash on hand at the start of August -- and in organization, with a passionate but small collection of staff and volunteers in a handful of states. And then there's name recognition: Gary who? Still, Johnson believes he can defy the odds and make the unlikely climb. ""I just need to catch a wave by the middle of October and awareness for me is a plus,"" Johnson told CNN. ""I do think that I have a resume to back up everything that I am talking about."" Johnson says he is more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues. He says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, he supports legalizing marijuana usage and he says he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service. The third-party candidate is optimistic and is devoting large sums of his own money to make this campaign possible -- much of which came from Big J Enterprises, his mechanical contracting business in New Mexico. But what Johnson's here-is-what-we-have-to-do optimism fails to clearly show is the daunting challenge in front of him. Johnson's ballot access gospel . Johnson is proud that he is likely going to be on the ballot in 47 states, even if that status is being challenged in three states -- Oklahoma, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Before being asked, Johnson brings the ballot access issue up to differentiate himself from other third-party candidates, like the Green Party's Jill Stein. ""No other third party is going to come close to this 50 ballot access,"" Johnson says proudly. ""I am a clear alternative to the other two and I want to point out that we are going to be on the ballot in all 50 states."" Johnson sees the struggles to get on the ballots as a badge of honor. ""We should take it as a compliment,"" he said, that the party establishment doesn't want him on the ballot. Compliment or not -- even if you are on the ballot, people have to know who you are. Hi, my name is Gary Johnson . Fighting for ballot access and libertarian support are all for naught, however, unless Johnson is able to introduce himself to the American people, his campaign admits. At the heart of this introduction are the three prime-time presidential debates. ""The only way I am (going to be) president of the United States is if I am in the national debate between Obama and Romney,"" Johnson said. ""If that takes place, then anything is possible."" The last time a third-party candidate was included in the presidential debates was 1992, when Perot, an independent businessman, was running for president. And due to the fact that the three presidential debates have been announced without Johnson's inclusion, the candidate admits it isn't likely he will be included. ""It is absolutely an uphill battle,"" Johnson said, ""but that is the only scenario by which I could actually win."" But Johnson isn't putting all his stock in being included in the debates. He is taking his message on the road, hitting 16 college towns around the country in the next few weeks. In the statement announcing the trip, Johnson touches upon the importance of the youth vote -- and in particular, the way young voters were inspired by another libertarian, Rep. Ron Paul. A Libertarian courting Libertarians . It is unusual that the Libertarian candidate for president is being forced to court other libertarians, but that's exactly what Johnson has to do with the unflinchingly loyal base of libertarians who support former Republican hopeful Ron Paul. According to Johnson, the Paul supporters are ""absolutely pivotal"" to his success. Johnson acts surprised that he has to do this, too. ""Where does his support go?"" the former governor asks. ""To Mitt Romney? To Barack Obama? Or to me?"" Libertarians are a unique set of voters. While they agree on some things -- individual freedoms, the right to do what you want without government coercion and a generally liberal social policy -- they also share a fierce independent streak. That independence, which largely stems from the desire to make their own decisions, makes the libertarian movement less of a cohesive group and more of a set of factions exchanging ideas. When making his pitch to Paul supporters, Johnson lists a litany of positions on which he and the former candidate agree. ""I don't want to bomb Iran, I want to bring the troops home, I want to end the drug war,"" Johnson says quickly. ""I want to end the Patriot Act, I want to balance the federal budget tomorrow and I want to abolish the IRS."" But many Paul supporters don't see those issues as that black-and-white. Reaction to Johnson's candidacy has been tepid and varied. ""He is ok. He is definitely very close,"" said Mike Salvi, a Ron Paul grassroots organizer. ""Gary is very much in line with Dr. Paul on many issues,"" said Jordan Page, a performer who traveled with the Paul campaign. ""(It's) the first time we have had a viable third party candidate."" ""I am not sure if I will vote for Gary Johnson,"" said Danny Panzella, another Paul grassroots organizer. ""I don't see him as a principle Libertarian."" Johnson endorsed Paul in 2008, when the Texas congressman was running for president, and when Johnson dropped out of the race as a Republican in 2012, he urged his supporters to vote for Paul in the Republican primaries. So far though, Paul has yet to give Johnson much support in 2012. ""We don't have contact with the Ron Paul campaign,"" Johnson said bluntly. ""I am not asking for his endorsement and I don't expect his endorsement."" The tension between Paul and Johnson is evidence of a larger split among libertarians. Paul commanded such a loyal following, that with his political career dwindling, there is power vacuum in the movement right now. With Johnson as the party's candidate, he is trying to position himself as the group's heir apparent. ""I am the Libertarian nominee for president,"" Johnson said. ""I am now the spokesperson for the movement.""","Johnson switched to the Libertarian Party when his campaign stalled in the primaries .

"(CNN) -- If Barack Obama is re-elected on November 6, he will owe more to his first lady than any president ever to win a second term. On Tuesday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, Michelle Obama gave one of the finest speeches ever delivered at a national political convention. More important, it could have more impact on the immediate future of the country than her husband's celebrated 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Why? Her speech tied the Obamas' personal stories directly to the lives of millions of voters struggling not to be the first generation of Americans unable to offer hope of greater opportunities to their children than they had, thus drawing a contrast with Mitt Romney as an unnamed but unmistakable caricature of privilege without shading her talk with negativity or animosity. What candidates' wives are telling us . In fact the overall emotion, and there was far more real as opposed to rhetorical emotion than any speech at this level in memory, was a feeling rarely conveyed in our political language today -- love. The first lady was not afraid to use the word love openly and often, in relation to working people of all classes, armed services families, immigrants, parents and especially to her husband and her children. And she was not afraid to show an emotional connection to her words in a performance that was as remarkable for its passion and sincerity as for its many quotable lines. First family watches . Like humor, authentic feeling is risky business in historic addresses, but the rewards can be a level of connection and a sense of strength deeper than any amount of lectern-pounding can drive home. But while these qualities, like the many others now being cited by commentators of all beliefs and backgrounds, help explain why the first lady's speech already has a place in the history books, they do not explain why it may actually change what will be written in them. Should that occur, it will be because almost for the first time in four years, she single-handedly brought Democrats to tears and to their feet at the idea of Barack Obama as president of the United States. Insiders' views from the DNC . Because however much the Obama campaign seeks to deny it, the fact is that the priorities, conduct and accomplishments of the Obama administration have been a disappointment to many Democrats. Some have said that Obama's political high-water mark might have been election night of 2008. Now four years later, he finds himself having to reinspire millions of citizens who feel that for too long he sought too many accommodations with those who did so much damage and who have always sought to destroy him. Michelle Obama has redefined black women . Tuesday night, his wife with the singular American title of first lady may have opened a path for her husband back into the hearts of those who had such high hopes for his audacity. It will be up to him whether to choose change over comity when a leader cannot have both, and win the opportunity to give a second inaugural address that will be better than his first, as perhaps a second term may be more successful on more fronts than his first. For as Mrs. Obama reminded the nation Tuesday night, ""Being president doesn't change who you are. ... It reveals who you are."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gordon Stewart.","Gordon Stewart: If Barack Obama is re-elected, he will owe much to his first lady .

"(CNN) -- Seven people, mostly tourists, were killed Thursday when a small plane crashed in southern Peru near the famous Nazca Lines, the official Andina news agency reported, citing Nazca police. The morning accident happened during a flyover of the mysterious geoglyphs in the sand that are one of Peru's largest tourist attractions. Three Chilean tourists, three Peruvian tourists, including a child, and the pilot were killed, Andina reported. The plane belonged to Nazca Airlines, which had not made a statement as of Thursday afternoon. There are more than 1,500 geoglyphs extending over 190 square miles, according to the National Geographic Society. They were constructed by the Nazca culture about 2,000 years ago. Though they're virtually indecipherable from the ground, from the air they are clearly visible as a monkey, a killer whale, a hummingbird, a condor, a pelican among flowers, trees and geometric shapes. The Nazca Lines are believed to have had ritual astronomical functions, according to UNESCO, which designated them a World Heritage site in 1994.","Seven killed in crash .

"(CNN) -- On November 24, 1859, the first edition of a book that would shake the most deeply established beliefs about life was published in London. What would eventually be known as ""The Origin of Species"" was the opening shot in a debate that hasn't ended, even 150 years later. In a series of books starting in 1976 and in his 2002 TED Talk, biologist Richard Dawkins has explored the implications of Darwin's work. In ""The Selfish Gene,"" Dawkins wrote, ""Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" Watch the TED Talk by Richard Dawkins . Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion. In fact, he argues, science and religion undermine each other. ""I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith,"" Dawkins says in his TED Talk. There's no room for a God in the world as he sees it, and he believes atheists should be forceful in opposing religion. He acknowledges that it's an unpopular case to make, particularly in the United States. ""It's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub,"" he said. ""And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority."" Watch an interview with Dawkins . According to Dawkins, life was not created by an intelligent designer. In ""The Selfish Gene,"" he wrote that science has established that, ""We are survival machines -- robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."" Read why another writer believes evolution and faith can be compatible . Darwin himself was very slow to make his theory of evolution by natural selection public, taking 15 years from his early insights on the subject to the publication of the book -- and publishing it then only after naturalist Alfred Wallace had independently come up with the idea of evolution. Darwin struggled with the book, which he called ""my abominable volume"" and said that it ""has cost me so much labor that I almost hate it."" The book went through six editions with Darwin's input and sold many copies, but it was controversial from the start. Read the view of an advocate of ""intelligent design"" In an interview by e-mail last week, CNN asked Dawkins about Darwin and religion. CNN: How would you describe the book's importance compared to other classic books? Richard Dawkins: Dan Dennett described natural selection as the best idea anyone ever had, and that is an easily defensible talking-point. Wallace independently had the idea, and the main reason Darwin is remembered more than the admirable Wallace is that Darwin wrote the book that changed people's minds. Evolution by natural selection didn't trickle into public consciousness but was properly launched, fully fashioned, in a brilliant book. T.H. Huxley surely wasn't the only reader to close the book saying, ""How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that."" CNN: In your TED Talk, you described American biologists as being in a ""state of war"" when it comes to defending evolution against its critics. Do you think that's still the case, nearly eight years later? Dawkins: Yes. More so, if anything. CNN: You contrast the British 10 pound note, which displays a likeness of Darwin, to the ""In God We Trust"" on American currency. Why are attitudes in Britain so significantly different on this question? Dawkins: I think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in America, but that only pushes the question back a stage. Why is America so much more religious than most other western countries? CNN: What's your sense of Darwin's influence around the world? Dawkins: Evolution is almost universally accepted among those who understand it, almost universally rejected by those who don't. CNN: You maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science. In what practical ways do you see the influence of religion today affecting what science can accomplish? Dawkins: Since we are talking about practical ways, the obvious example is stem cell research. But there is a more pernicious and pervasive influence, which is an active shutting down of the critical faculties. Religion teaches us to be satisfied with non-explanations, and this is viciously corrosive of science and of the life of the mind generally. CNN: In your 1986 book, ""the Blind Watchmaker,"" you wrote that, ""For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, Darwinism seems more in need of advocacy than similarly established truths in other branches of science."" Do you have any further thoughts on why that's the case? Dawkins: I think it is mostly because of biblical literalism. Then there's the added fact that, as the great molecular biologist Jacques Monod said, 'The trouble with natural selection is that everybody THINKS he understands it.' CNN: What's the greatest remaining mystery about evolution? Dawkins: How the evolution of the brain gave rise to the emergent property we call subjective consciousness. CNN: What question would you ask Darwin if he were alive today? Dawkins: Why did you wait so long before publishing your brilliant idea? CNN: You make the argument in the TED Talk for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion. Do you see signs that such an attitude is taking hold? Dawkins: Yes, I am happy to say I do think so. I'd like to think that books such as those by Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens and me have initiated a turning of the tide.

"(CNN) -- These are tumultuous times for Tunisian tennis player Malek Jaziri. The 28-year-old might be the only player from an Arab country in the men's draw at the Olympics, but his first-round win over Yen-Hsun Lu 7-6, 4-6. 6-3 has once more showcased the Tunisian's remarkable powers of perseverance in the face of injury and political turmoil in his homeland. Professionally Jaziri has never looked back since the Tunisian revolution, which sparked the region's Arab Spring and toppled the regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.. At the start of the revolution Jaziri was ranked 342nd; by the end of 2011 he was up to 150th; and now, following this week's release of the latest rankings, the Tunisian has climbed to 67th after recording his first win at Wimbledon. ""I decided to come back from living in Barcelona to practise,"" Jaziri told CNN, as he recalled the events that led to Ben Ali's fall. ""The weather is always good and I was close to my family -- then one week after I got back, the revolution happened. It wasn't easy, but it made me feel better, and my ranking got better. ""At first it was very hard to practize and to travel to play. The airport was closed, there were helicopters and shooting. But now it's safe, everyone is feeling good. I'm an ambassador for Tunisia and it is my source de l'inspiration. We have history, the desert, the sea, it's like a paradise, really."" Docteur, Docteur . Jaziri's rise up the rankings is even more remarkable given he missed two years through injury at the age of 22 -- a time when most players are establishing themselves professionally. ""A few years ago when I was young, I was very promising, going very well, 200th in the rankings, being put forward for Grand Slams, and then I had an accident. I injured my knee and I couldn't play. ""I spent the first year here in Tunisia with my family, but my knee wasn't doing so well. I told my family that I would take one last chance going to Europe. I went there, saw a French doctor, and after nine months I was running again. It was a very, very tough time for me though."" But a spate of injuries -- he also hurt his ankle and wrist -- badly affected Jaziri's confidence. ""It's true, I didn't get given much of a chance with injuries -- it was not easy for me. With my knee, I was sat at home unable to do anything. I said I would quit and work with my father in the family business. But then I took my last chance in Paris...and thank God for that."" It is not just the intervention of a Parisian doctor that provides fond memories of the French capital for Jaziri, who was born in the Tunisian city of Bizerte. ""During the war Roland Garros crashed his plane in Bizerte, the town where I play,"" said Jaziri, referring to the renowned French pilot, who was a keen tennis player and whom the stadium that hosts the French Open was named after. ""They made a monument here for him. Eighty per cent of clubs in Tunisia have clay courts and everyone watches Roland Garros. So far I've played two Grand Slams, and in Roland Garros I won the first round, I'm very happy."" Carrying the hopes of a nation . As well as his recent Grand Slam achievements, Jaziri is making the most of his Olympic experience, particularly given he needed a wildcard to enter the tournament. ""I had just finished my first match at Wimbledon when they told me that I had made the main draw in the Olympics. To win my first match at Wimbledon and then to have the chance to play at the Olympics was fantastic, I was twice as happy."" ""I thank the ITF for giving me the wildcard to play at the Olympic Games, it's very important for me. I'm very proud to play for my country, for Tunisia, and I hope to do good things. Why Federer's friend is flying the Swiss flag at London . ""It's a very tough sensation to explain, when you hear the anthem of your country from on the podium. And I'm not just representing my country at the games but also all African and Arabic countries -- I can feel their support, it's like a dream for me."" Going solo . It's not just revolution and injury that Jaziri has had to overcome. Earlier in his career he was even having to book his own hotels and train tickets as well as having to apply to enter tournaments. ""At first I didn't have the chance to get a coach or staff. In the beginning it was tough, travelling alone, but then it becomes like a habit -- you're always alone so you learn to take responsibility. I had to do everything myself. It's a lot of small things, but it takes up a lot of time."" But his new-found success has brought sponsorship and that has enabled Jaziri to hire a coach and a fitness trainer, which perhaps explains his progression up the tennis ladder. ""I'm the new ambassador of tourism for Tunisia, the Minister of Tourism sponsors me,"" added Jaziri. ""I would welcome everyone to Tunisia, it can be a second home to anyone. We have freedom and safety now. It will be very nice to promote Tunisia all around the world. The Olympics is a dream for everyone, and I will be a part of it.""","Jaziri is the only Arab representative in the men's singles Olympic draw .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have opened an investigation into permits issued to Wal-Mart in light of allegations that the retail giant bribed officials in Mexico to speed up store construction. ""If any irregular activities attributable to federal public servants are detected, the federal government will take appropriate action,"" Mexico's Ministry of Public Administration said in a statement Wednesday. The ministry also said Mexico's federal government was requesting information from U.S. officials about the case for its investigation. Local authorities will be alerted if the investigation turns up possible corruption among local officials, the ministry said. The announcement comes several days after a New York Times report detailed what the newspaper said was widespread bribery used by Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary. The New York Times report cites a former executive, Sergio Cicero Zapata, who resigned from Wal-Mart de Mexico in 2004. Cicero told the newspaper he had helped organize payoffs to local officials -- including dispatching intermediaries to deliver envelopes full of cash. The aim of the bribes, he said, was to guarantee zoning approvals, reductions in environmental impact fees and support from neighborhood leaders, according to the newspaper. After resigning, Cicero alerted a senior Wal-Mart lawyer about the deals in 2005, prompting an internal investigation, The New York Times said. A paper trail found suspect payments in Mexico totaled more than $24 million, the newspaper said, citing an internal Wal-Mart review. CNN has not independently confirmed the details in the New York Times report. Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica, the company's subsidiary in Mexico, said in a statement that it is ""fully committed to complying with the laws of the countries where it operates, including any state or municipal regulations pertaining to the application for licenses and permits."" ""The allegations in the recent New York Times article, if true, do not accurately reflect Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica's culture,"" the statement continued. Earlier this week, the CEO of the Mexican Stock Exchange declined to comment on the New York Times report. ""I have nothing more to say, other than that it is a great company, that Wal-Mart is a company that has been very appreciated by Mexican investors. It is one of the companies that has grown most in the country,"" Luis Tellez said. Mexico was the first country in Wal-Mart's international division. Wal-Mart has 2,099 retail units in the country, including 213 supercenters, according to a company fact sheet. While some experts and officials have called for investigations of the retail giant's Mexican subsidiary in light of the New York Times report, others see a symptom of a larger problem: widespread government corruption. Mexico ranked 100 out of 183 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index last year. And only China and Russia ranked behind Mexico on the organization's Bribe Payers Index, which ranks the likelihood of companies to win business abroad by paying bribes. Jose Luis de la Cruz Gallegos, who directs an economic research center in central Mexico, told CNN Expansion that such rankings ""show clearly that businesses and people have to incur a great cost in order to get ahead."" ""It's not so much the kinds of bribes that The New York Times mentions, even though those are important. It is the general context of impunity and abuse of the law that has characterized the growth of Wal-Mart over the past decade in Mexico,"" John Ackerman, a professor at the Institute of Legal Research at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told CNN Expansion. The retail giant, which also came under fire in the United States after the New York Times report, has stressed that it has been conducting a global review for months over whether its workers violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits giving bribes to international officials. ""We will not tolerate noncompliance with FCPA anywhere or at any level of the company. We are confident we are conducting a comprehensive investigation, and if violations of our policies occurred, we will take appropriate action,"" Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement Tuesday. Tovar also noted that the alleged activities in the newspaper's report ""are more than six years old."" The company has taken steps to ""establish stronger FCPA compliance"" in Mexico, he said, including improving auditing procedures, policies and training. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Rey Rodriguez contributed to this report.","Mexican federal authorities are looking into permits given to the retail giant .

"(CNN) -- The University of Tennessee student at the center of a nationally publicized alcohol incident denied Tuesday that he ever used an alcohol enema. Alexander Broughton, 20, admitted to reporters that he made a ""bad choice"" drinking last month, one that could have killed him. ""However the scandalous accusations surrounding that event never happened and I completely deny them,"" he said at a news conference. Broughton, a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, was hospitalized September 21 with a blood alcohol level well over 0.40 -- five times the legal limit for driving -- according to Knoxville police. The case made national news when police said Broughton and some of his fraternity brothers had been using enemas containing alcohol. ""At this point my intent is to clear my name, my fraternity's name and to punish those individuals and institutions responsible for the lies that have been spread around the world,"" Broughton said. His attorney, Daniel F. McGehee, said they intended to sue ""whoever violated his HIPAA rights and his constitutional rights, and the list is as long as your arm."" Experts: Alcohol enemas 'extremely dangerous' The university said Tuesday it would not comment. McGehee said that his client passed out and was taken to the hospital after members of the fraternity drank wine as part of a ""Tour de Franzia."" He described that as a party where one person holds up one of several bags of wine while another drinks from it. A report from the University of Tennessee police department said after questioning fraternity members, officers believed fraternity members had used ""rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol."" Twelve members of the fraternity were cited for underage drinking, one for disorderly conduct and the fraternity chapter was suspended, a university spokeswoman said. McGehee said he went to the hospital the night Broughton was admitted and asked the student if he had been involved in using alcohol enemas. ""He looked at me like I'd lost my mind,"" McGehee said. Police said investigators found tubing and materials used to give alcohol enemas at the scene. An alcohol enema involves placing a small tube into the rectum and pouring alcohol into the colon. Because the alcohol is then absorbed directly into the bloodstream, the recipient gets drunk faster. Human stomachs and livers have an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase that breaks down ethanol to make it less toxic for our bodies, said Atlanta gastroenterologist Dr. Preston Stewart. The lower gastrointestinal tract doesn't have that enzyme, so alcohol molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the colon. Eventually the alcohol would still make its way to the liver, Stewart said, but the high alcohol content would overwhelm the organ. ""It's extremely dangerous."" CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: University says it has no comment on Tuesday's news conference .

"(CNN)  -- Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova will team up again to play at this year's Wimbledon championships. The popular pair won the 1999 and 2002 Australian Open doubles titles, but will be returning the SW19 to play in the legends doubles event for players who are retired from the professional circuit, the management company Octagon said Tuesday. Swiss star Hingis won five grand slam singles crowns and nine in doubles during a glittering career which ended under a cloud in 2007, when she was suspended for two years for testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon. The 29-year-old denied taking the drug, but did not appeal the ban, which ended last September, prompting speculation that she may attempt a return to the WTA circuit. Kournikova is a year younger, but has not played regularly on the main tour for seven years after being hit by a string of injuries. The Russian, who reached a career-high of number eight, made it to the semifinals of the singles at Wimbledon in 1997, but grand slam success eluded her. The pair were once labeled as the 'Spice Girls' of tennis, with the height of their fame coinciding with the peak of popularity of the British all-girl band, which included David Beckham's wife Victoria. As well as winning two grand slam titles together, the pair also reached No.1 in the WTA doubles rankings. ""I'm so excited to be returning to the UK to play doubles with Martina again,""  Kournikova told her official Web site. ""This tournament has always held a special place in my heart, and it will be a great honor to play on the courts of Wimbledon again. I'm looking forward to having a lot of fun.""","Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova to be re-united at Wimbledon this year .

"(CNN) -- ""By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world."" Mother Teresa, pictured in 1997, lived and worked in Kolkata from 1931 until her death. That's how Mother Teresa chose to describe herself in life. In death, however, her words will probably do little to settle a diplomatic squabble over her remains. The Albanian government wants to receive her remains before her 100th birthday next year. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said his nation plans to open a museum in Mother Teresa's honor and has planned commemorative events. But more important, Berisha said, Mother Teresa should rest next to her mother and sister, who are buried in a cemetery in the Albanian capital, Tirana. ""She missed them very much all her life,"" he said. ""My request is a very human one. ""She told me that she prayed every day for her family and her country. That's why I think both governments should talk about [this] and find a solution,"" Berisha said. Then there is Macedonia, the nation where Mother Teresa was born and raised. It, too, may stake a claim on the woman who is well on a path to sainthood. But India, the land where she made her life's work, has made it clear that Mother Teresa, buried in the heart of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), will not be leaving her final resting place. ""Mother Teresa was a citizen of India,"" said Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the country's external affairs ministry. Though she arrived as a foreigner, Mother Teresa came to be cherished in her adopted home. In billboards and booklets, the city of Kolkata proudly claims her as one of its most famous citizens. She was a devout Catholic who transcended religion, inspiring a nation of millions of poor people, mostly Hindus and Muslims. She is buried in the courtyard at the nondescript Missionaries of Charity compound in central Kolkata, a site visited by residents and tourists alike. People stream in from the bustling streets to the serenity of Mother House to pay their respects -- and find strength in her presence. They wander among her order of nuns in their simple blue-bordered white cotton saris. On the second floor is the small and sparse room that belonged to Mother Teresa. ""She has become part and parcel of our national life,"" said Father Babu Joseph, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. ""She built a strong bond with India,"" he said. ""People of all religious groups here rather consider her an inalienable part [of India] and therefore we would strongly want the remains to be in India."" Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to ethnic Albanian parents in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910. At 18, she left home and joined the Sisters of Loreto, arriving in India in 1931. Moved by staggering poverty and human suffering, she started the Missionaries of Charity, dedicating her life to helping those in need. She became a fixture on the streets of Kolkata, often picking up the sick and hungry, and giving them food, shelter and love. When she accepted her Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, she asked that the gala dinner be canceled and the money be sent instead to help Kolkata's destitute. Mother Teresa was 87 when she died in 1997, the news eclipsed by Princess Diana's death several days earlier. Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa in 2003 and she could be canonized by her centennial birthday next year -- a saint in the heavens whose resting place on Earth remains a devilish debate.","Mother Teresa lived, worked mostly in Kolkata but was ethnically Albanian .

"(CNN) -- War crimes prosecutors Thursday asked a court to order supermodel Naomi Campbell to give evidence in the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. They said Campbell received rough diamonds from Taylor, and claimed her testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Campbell has said she does not want to be involved in the case, prosecutors said, forcing them to ask the court to issue a subpoena ordering her to appear. ""Her anticipated evidence rebuts the accused's testimony that he never possessed rough diamonds,"" prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they learned last June that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond in South Africa in 1997. The actress Mia Farrow confirmed it, they said. ""Ms. Farrow was present at the reception where the accused met Ms. Campbell and was told the next morning by Ms. Campbell about the gift,"" they said in the court papers. Campbell's lawyer did not respond to repeated prosecution e-mails and phone calls earlier this year after The New York Times reported that Campbell was cooperating with the prosecution, court papers say. She was confronted on Oprah Winfrey's television show with the accusation that she had received a diamond from Taylor, and did not deny it, prosecutors said. ""I don't want to be involved in this man's case -- he has done some terrible things and I don't want to put my family in danger,"" they quoted her as saying. Campbell did not immediately respond to CNN request for comment about the case. Taylor, 62, has been on trial for nearly three years. He is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in Sierra Leone that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation. The war, which involved riches from the diamond trade, was fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior, and often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor denies the charges. ""I am not guilty of all of these charges, not even a minute part of these charges,"" he said in the first day of defense testimony last July. ""This whole case is a case of deceit, deception, lies."" The trial is being held at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, in The Hague, the Netherlands. The court was set up jointly by the west African country of Sierra Leone and the United Nations. The court did not immediately respond to a CNN e-mail about when it would rule on the prosecution request for a subpoena, or what power it would have to enforce it. The prosecution also asked to be allowed to reopen its case or to present the Campbell and Farrow testimony in its rebuttal. The case is now in the defense phase.","Prosecutors of Charles Taylor say supermodel got diamonds from former Liberian president .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's main opposition leader resigned as head of his party Monday after the circulation of a videotape allegedly showing him having an affair with a female party deputy who had once been his secretary. Deniz Baykal declared that ""there is a conspiracy against me"" and blamed the government for the video. The 71-year-old chairman of the Republican People's Party said the secretly shot tape could not have been made without the approval of the ruling party. ""It is impossible to organize such a plot within such a short period of time without the knowledge of the ruling party,"" he said in a televised address. ""One who gives credit to unlawful and unethical plots cannot defend law and ethics."" The party is to elect a new leader at its convention May 23 and 24. Baykal has said he wouldn't be a candidate, but that won't stop members from trying to elect him again. Numerous party members are gathering signatures from delegates to renominate him as a candidate for leadership, saying they do not believe the accusations. And Baykal said, ""My resignation doesn't mean I will give in to this conspiracy or will stop the fight."" Members of parliament wept openly during the speech by Baykal, a representative from Antalya. Afterward, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had ordered distribution of the tape halted. He added that he found Baykal's statements ""just as ugly and worthless as the tape"" and noted that Baykal had not denied its authenticity. The resignation of the secularist party leader comes as the government is preparing to take a package of proposed constitutional changes to a national referendum. The Republican People's Party opposes the changes. The chief prosecutor's office in Ankara has initiated a criminal investigation, according to Turkey's semi-official news agency Adnadolu Ajansi.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Rescuers have found the bodies of 28 workers buried in a coal mine, authorities said Thursday, dimming hopes for two more missing days after an explosion rocked the facility in northern Turkey. The miners were trapped Monday after a mysterious explosion rocked the sprawling state-owned coal mine near the Black Sea port of Zonguldak. Hundreds of rescue workers scrambled to cut through fallen rubble to reach the victims trapped in a shaft 540 meters underground. Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said crews were still searching for the two remaining victims. ""We believe they died from carbon monoxide poisoning when the accident happened, but we are not sure yet,"" Yildiz said in a live appearance on Turkish television. Relatives of the victims have been holding a vigil in a tent near the entrance to the coal mine. Turkish President Abdullah Gul issued a statement on his web site Wednesday calling for an investigation into the cause of the explosion. ""Our president instructed the State Inspection Council to start research and investigation into the accidents that happened in te mining sector during the recent period that caused casualties and injuries, and deeply affected the public,"" the statement said. The accident devastated a community that relied on nearly minimum-wage mining jobs to make ends meet. ""This is a mining town with a mining tradition,"" Taci Alkaya, the head of the mine worker's union in Zonguldak, told CNN by phone. ""Families always have more than one miner in a household. Often the jobs pass from father to son."" Alkaya said the mine in question worked 24 hours a day, with three to four alternating shifts. He added that the 28 miners likely earned between 800 Turkish lira ($550) and 1000 Turkish lira ($684) a month. Though the facility is state-owned, the miners killed were working for a private company contracted to fulfill a specific job in the mine. Turkish labor unions have denounced the practice of hiring private contractors, questioning their safety standards. ""The practice of contracting jobs to private companies in state-owned mines should be stopped immediately,"" said a statement from the secretary general of DISK, one of Turkey's largest federations of labor unions, in the wake of the Zonguldak disaster. This is the third major accident to shake Turkey's mining industry in 6 months. Nineteen miners died in a methane gas explosion in the western province of Bursa in December. In February, 13 miners died after a similar explosion hit a mine in Balikesir.","Energy Minister says crews are still searching for two remaining victims .

"(CNN) -- Though soccer is the most played sport around the world, with governing body FIFA recognizing football federations in more than 200 nations, the beloved ""beautiful game"" has always struggled to be a dominant force in the United States. Attempts have been made to boost its support, first with the North American Soccer League (NASL) which kicked off in 1968, and more recently with Major League Soccer (MLS). The approach to break the grip of traditional sports in the U.S. has been different with both franchises. The NASL, which collapsed in 1984, favored big names and an adaptation of the rules, while the MLS has tried to supplement home-grown talent with foreign stars such as David Beckham, capable of taking the game's reach to more fans. However, the NFL, NBA and MLB remain the big attention-grabbers with the U.S. public as American football, basketball and baseball dominate. Though breaking this grip has proved a difficult task in most MLS expansions across America, Seattle is one of the few towns where the tide for the affection of the city's sports fans seems to be turning. Seattle first put itself forward as an MLS franchise at the league's inception in 1994 and, after several attempts, in 2007 the city was awarded a team thanks to the combined efforts of high-profile backers. Film producer Joe Roth, comedian Drew Carey and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, among others, combined to convince the MLS to accept the city's bid and to create the Seattle Sounders Football Club. The bid was helped by Allen's ownership of the 60,000 capacity Qwest Field, home ground to the NFL's Seahawks -- an arena built with intention of hosting an MLS team. Seattle Times sports columnist Steve Kelley was amazed that it took so long to found a team in a community that has a large soccer fanbase. ""Seattle was a huge soccer market. It had a lot of success when the NASL was playing here in the 1970s and '80s. My question is: 'What took the MLS so long to get here?' I've always thought that this was a goldmine."" ""It's the most played sport [here],"" adds Greg Mockos, co-president of the Emerald City Supporters (ECS) -- the Sounders' largest fan organization. ""You can go around downtown Seattle at every park and every pitch, and there are hundreds of teams playing."" The 2009 season was the inaugural campaign for the Sounders, and while the front office will be delighted with its on-pitch performance -- the side reached the Western Conference semifinals and won the U.S. Open Cup -- it has been the enthusiastic response of the city's soccer fans that could be providing most pleasure. Qwest Field set a league record with an average attendance of 30,897. This rivals that of baseball's Seattle Mariners, who in 2008 averaged 28,761 at the 47,116-capacity SAFECO Field and since 2004 have been watched by just over 30,000. While factors such as number of games must be considered, the Sounders' final playoff attendance of 35,807 indicates growing interest. Yet it has been the nature of the city's response that suggests this support is more than just a fad. ""The atmosphere has been tremendous,"" explains Sounders coach Sigi Schmid. ""Every time we walked on the field the atmosphere was great. The fans were behind us and they've got their chants for individual players. In that sense it's very European, very international."" With their banners, flags and shirts, supporters have combined to create an atmosphere rare within professional American sports, and wholly typical of soccer. ""A major problem with the atmosphere at typical American sports is the number of stoppages, there are too many times when tension is lost,"" explains Robby Branom, part of the ECS. ""In addition there are no sections in any baseball or American football stadium where active fans can group together, making it impossible for any organized support."" The process of attracting people inside and out of Seattle's existing soccer fanbase has come at a time when the city is still reeling from the loss of its NBA franchise (the Sonics) to Oklahoma City (now named Thunder). Despite its embracement of the Sounders, the timing of the soccer season means it ends in November just as the NBA is getting underway. For some, the quality of the MLS is not enough to make up for the Sonics' disappearance. ""I've loved this year; it's been great to watch quality soccer,"" Kelley said. ""But the NBA has the best players in the world, and they're gone now from Seattle. The MLS has a good league, but these aren't obviously the best players in the world. For some people the gap has been filled, but not for me."" Despite this there is a confidence that MLS in Seattle is advancing well. ""The Sounders have done everything right to placate and involve the soccer fans,"" Kelley said. ""But I think there's still growth among sports fans. As the next couple of years progress, if the team gets better and I think because of management it will, then there's a whole bigger market out there."" Schmid is certainly optimistic over his club's future. ""We have to realize this was year one, so from a business standpoint we've got to continue to work as it its year one all over again and not pretend it's easy now. The main thing for us is we can't be complacent on the field or off it,"" he said. The Sounders will be absent from Sunday's MLS Cup final, held at Qwest Field, but Seattle's soccer fans will surely echo Schmid's sentiment. They will, however, be able to watch as English superstar Beckham's Los Angeles Galaxy side takes on underdog Real Salt Lake .","Seattle was finally awarded a Major League Soccer franchise in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- ""Borderlands 2"" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora. At a hands-on demo, a pre-alpha build of the new title showed off two classes of characters -- one new and one familiar. It also demonstrated how the development team at Gearbox Software learned and applied lessons from its first title and subsequent downloadable content releases. The ""Gunzerker"" class is all about the weapons -- the more, the merrier. This tank of a character can wield two weapons at once, bringing more firepower to fights and dishing out the pain. The best combinations featured one weapon that could bring rapid fire, but deliver light damage, while wielding another that brought serious hurt, but took its time to fire. Working together, the two different types of weapons created a consistent kill zone for creatures -- no matter how strong or numerous they were. The other class available for play was the ""Siren."" This class was featured in ""Borderlands"" and offered phasewalking (turning intangible) as its special talent. This time, Maya the Siren has the ability to trap foes in a force field hovering in midair, making them easy targets for damage. The art style remains the same as in the original, with its familiar hand-painted look and dark outlines. Gearbox producer Randy Varnell said the team wanted to improve what it had done to make the characters look great, then extend that look to the surrounding environment. ""It's warmer. It's almost water-colored with those really harsh, dark edges. Just like you would see in a comic book,"" Varnell said. ""A lot of it is drawn right on to the texture models themselves. We have a very distinct art style and art guide that all of our artists adhere to."" The action takes place five years after the conclusion of ""Borderlands"" and introduces a new villain to the mix, Handsome Jack. Varnell said bringing an antagonist to the plot gave the team more options to make the story personal for the players. ""Why is he mining? What is he mining in the planet? Why is that so much more important than finding a Vault (the final object in the first game)?"" he said. ""Having a villain puts a personal face on it. Are you racing him for the treasure? Are you trying to keep it from him?"" Varnell said giving the players a focus also helps flesh out the game's characters and what motivates them. The whole idea was to make the story richer and more fulfilling without changing too much of the gameplay that fans enjoyed. Senior producer Sean Reardon echoed those sentiments and said community involvement in the first title and its three downloadable updates was important in figuring out what gamers liked and what worked best. Invoking Einstein and Venn diagrams during the interview, Reardon acknowledged there were problems they hadn't foreseen until after the games were made, but they were things that could be corrected for ""Borderlands 2."" ""In 'Borderlands,' (designers thought) it was just a fact that as a four-player (co-op) game, the vehicle had two seats,"" he said. ""You don't see it as a problem. You think they can use two vehicles and everyone likes to drive. Turns out, it is an elephant (a problem), and you've got to fix that."" Little refinements, he hopes, will make the gameplay and the experience even more enjoyable for fans of the franchise as well as new players who are seeing Pandora for the first time. Reardon built his development team out of people who had worked on the series as well as new talent that he felt were the best at what they do. He said it was about having confidence in the people who were putting the game together, trusting them and believing they were smarter than he was about their areas of expertise. ""Get the right people, give them the right mission, get enough resources to do the job, make sure they're inspired and get out of the way,"" he said. More than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions. There are also named creatures who will offer additional challenges -- and loot for those who defeat them. Also, mechanical enemies are prominent in the game, in addition to all the natural wildlife you can battle on Pandora. The player characters from ""Borderlands"" will also show up in the new game as nonplayer characters, providing backstory and missions for the gamers to complete. Varnell said ""Borderlands 2"" is significantly larger, broader and deeper than its predecessor. Gamers will have to wait until September 18 to find out if this game is more enjoyable than the first.","The art style remains the same, with familiar hand-painted looks and dark outlines .

"(CNN) -- When the Nintendo 3DS was introduced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2010, one of the announced games that drew the most favorable reaction was ""Kid Icarus: Uprising."" A follow-up to the original ""Kid Icarus"" title that came out 25 years ago, this new version offers updated graphics, classic boss battles and humorous dialogue that, unfortunately, quickly becomes cheesy and trite. The story harkens back to the original as the forces of Light battle the forces of Darkness with the player acting as the champion for Light. The angel hero, Pit, must set out once again with the help of the goddess of Light, Palutena, to defeat Medusa and end the threat to the human race. Players control Pit with the device's circle pad and use its stylus to aim and turn him. Firing his weapon is done with the left shoulder button on the 3DS. Fortunately, the game comes packed with a nifty stand, because trying to hold and maneuver gameplay was quite the contortion. Even using the stylus after a while became painful in my wrist. The game does remind you from time to time to take a break, so perhaps the developers thought there might be a problem. Combat is broken down into three sections for each chapter: flight battle, ground battle and boss battle. In the air, Pit attempts to shoot enemies while continuously flying forward. He is able to dodge around the screen but his motion is always moving ahead. On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts. Hearts are the currency by which players can obtain new weapons and skills. The boss battles close each chapter, involving classic characters and a combination of nimble dodging and intense firepower. The bosses are returning enemies from the original title, but offer new challenges for fans of the franchise. The intensity of each chapter can change as well, ramping up the enemies and the loot. A device called the Fiend's Caldron allows players to spend hearts to adjust the difficulty. Want to make it easier? That'll cost you. If you want more, you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter, winning you more hearts. Pit has nine weapon types at his disposal and can equip one before each chapter. Ranging from rifles to clubs, each offers special advantages. One nice feature is that some weapons can be fused with other weapons to create even more powerful attacks. Plus, some of the names are really quite charming. If there is a downside to the game, it is the dialogue. It starts off being funny and cute, but I get the feeling the writers were trying too hard in the later stages of the game. There are plenty of silly pop-culture references that don't quite work in this mythological setting: ""Happy meal of pain""? Really? The talk also clashes with the action. Many times, the dialogue ran on so long that I completed the fight before the characters were done trash-talking each other. It ended up almost ruining the entire experience. Overall, ""Kid Icarus: Uprising"" does offer some solid combat, some great visuals and a good soundtrack. The gameplay is good, and the story does move along at a brisk pace. However, it's hobbled by an uncomfortable playing configuration that cries out for a second circle pad (Circle Pad Pro, anyone?) instead of the stylus pointer.. ""Kid Icarus: Uprising"" is available now and only for the Nintendo 3DS. It is rated E 10+ for everyone 10 years old and older due to comic mischief, fantasy violence, and mild suggestive themes.

"(Wired) -- When Toshiba announced its 13-inch Excite tablet Tuesday, the company made an argument that one size does not fit all when it comes to touchscreen devices. But who will actually use such a large slab of mobile computing? ""The Excite 13 is what we see as a home tablet,"" Jared Leavitt, a Toshiba spokesman, told Wired. ""The larger size makes it an ideal kitchen tablet. You can watch how-to videos while you're cooking, or look up recipes. And then later, you can bring it into the living room to watch videos with the kids, or to look at family photos with friends."" Thankfully, Toshiba is shipping the Excite 13, which runs on Google's Android 4.0 operating system, with a stand that will relieve owners from having to hold, or prop up, the large device themselves. And despite being bigger than pretty much every other competing tablet on the market, the Excite 13 is fairly thin and light for its size, Leavitt said, noting that it will weigh 2.2 pounds and measure 0.4 inches thick. Nonetheless, anyone who's watching the tablet market has to wonder why Toshiba is releasing a tablet behemoth in a world enamored with smaller devices. After all, the first tablet to gain any widespread consumer adoption other than Apple's iPad is the 7-inch Kindle Fire. And looking forward, the hottest rumors focus on an iPad mini and a 7-inch tablet that would be Google's next flagship mobile device. In short: Small is in, and big isn't even part of the conversation. Jared Spool, the CEO of User Interface Engineering, a usability research firm, agrees that Toshiba is thinking about tablet design in a way that its rivals aren't. But Spool doesn't agree that the world needs, or wants, a 13-inch tablet. ""This is the sort of typical maneuver of just adding another feature without improving the actual user experience,"" Spool told Wired. ""It's just bigger, and it's not clear to me that anyone is asking for bigger. You can only get the iPad in one size and nobody is saying, 'Gee, it just feels a little too small to me.'"" But while there seems to be no consumer demand for larger tablets, the use case of watching movies as a group, or flipping through photos with loved ones on the couch, on a 13-inch slate isn't too hard to imagine, says Jakob Nielsen, principal at the Nielsen Norman Group, a usability research firm. ""If a small group of people is trying to use the tablet together, sitting on the couch and consuming content, this size makes sense,"" Nielsen told Wired. ""But I do think [the Excite 13] might be a bit of overreach. I don't think that people only need one computer. Nowadays, most people have two computers, between a laptop and a smartphone. But where this Toshiba tablet fits in -- between those devices and the TV -- I'm not sure. It's not likely to be a big success."" Spool also predicts that the Excite 13 will be neither an iPad killer, nor a top-selling Android tablet. ""These types of enhancements are knee-jerk reactions from companies who are trying to 'out feature' other companies,"" he said. ""But what this comes down to is that it's not the specific technology in a tablet that makes it exciting. It's the user experience. And there's just a lot less to do on an Android tablet than an iPad. And what there is to do is much clumsier because the screen sizes and specs for Android tablets are all over the place. A 13-inch screen and a bunch of top specs do nothing to change that."" Among the other specs the Excite 13 touts are a quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor, 1GB of RAM, a 5-megapixel rear facing camera, and four rear-mounted speakers to blast audio from the tablet's aluminum back. The tablet also sports a 1,600Ã—900 screen resolution, a micro-USB port, a micro-HDMI port and a full-size SD card slot. The Excite 13 sits at the top of a revamped tablet line for Toshiba, in terms of both price and screen size with a price tag of $649.99 for the 32GB model, and $749.99 for the 64GB model, when it hits stores in early June. For those looking for a more traditionally sized tablet that still packs a quad-core punch, Toshiba will also ship in June a 7.7-inch version of the Excite (known as the Excite 7) at $499.99 for 16GB of storage and $579.99 for 32GB. A 10-inch Excite, dubbed the Excite 10, will ship in May for $449.99 with 16 GB of storage and $529.99 for the 32GB. The Excite range of tablets replaces Toshiba's old line of Thrive slates, which were offered in both a 7-inch and 10-inch model. In case you're wondering why is the Excite 7 more expensive than the Excite 10, Leavitt explained: ""Smaller is harder to do.""

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- You don't expect to hear an electric saw in church, but Kevin Cross uses the tool along with a frying pan, blender and toaster oven to help free people from debt. Kevin Cross holds the boards steady as a woman uses a reciprocating saw to cut up her credit cards. This money missionary helps people destroy those little plastic shovels, otherwise known as credit cards, that so many people have used to dig their way to financial ruin. ""It's such an easy message. It really is,"" says Cross, an ex-con who credits religion for his conversion from thief to money coach. ""That's why it doesn't take a rocket scientist, it doesn't take a CPA to do it. A first-year bookkeeper can figure out that you can't spend more than you make,"" he said. Earlier this month, Cross spoke to about 150 people at the Miami Vineyard Community Church where Kevin Fischer is the pastor. ""You've got to plan your spending; you've got to give back a part to God. You've got to save for the future, and you've got to learn to be content,"" said Fischer. Fischer says the pressure of money and debt is enormous on people, especially more recently. ""We should change the marriage vows from 'till death do us part' to 'debt do us part' because that's what's going on, and it's so true,"" he said. Cross is breathless. As he speaks to the crowd, he's a non-stop, doesn't-come-up-for-air, high-octane money missionary. He uses Christian principles, prayer, common sense, and a few good one-liners to get his message across. ""I had a 401k, it went to a 201k, went to 101k, now it's just K,"" he said as the crowd laughs. ""I'm thinking I got a thousand bucks left, and I can retire for about a week."" Cross presides over a day-long sermon on how people can make their lives better by taking control of their spending. He says he tries to demonstrate the long-term effects of irresponsible borrowing. Simple stuff, he says, will make people more content and give them the cushion necessary to give back. His new book is ""Building Your Financial Fortress in 52 Days."" ""I want to get people to have more margin, so instead of investing in stuff, and stuff that doesn't last, they can invest in people's lives,"" he said. The tools he uses to hammer home his message go beyond his overhead TV screens, charts and calculators. Cross invites his guests, who pay $25 a head to hear his message, to come up to the front of the room for what he calls the beginning of ""freedom."" On a table, sit a frying pan, a toaster oven, a blender and a wooden sawhorse and an electric saw. About six people cut up their credit cards and bake them in the toaster oven as if they were TV dinners. Others sliced and diced their Visa, MasterCard and Amex, before mixing the pieces with Spam in the blender. At one point, Cross called for some cooking oil as one lady stood over her credit card-saute with a spatula. Holding a plate full of the little pieces of credit card, Cross said, ""This looks like a melted credit card, but this really represents freedom in these people's lives, because it's the first step."" Cellie Mayol says she used to have 10 or 11 credit cards. She put on protective goggles, taped her cards to a two-by-four and shredded them with a reciprocating saw. ""It just felt like the right thing to do to get me started on the right path,"" she said. ""The Sawzall [reciprocating saw] was exhilarating. I love that feeling."" Kevin Cross wasn't always this way. About 20 years ago, as a teen, he embezzled about $300,000 from the sheriff's office in Broward County, Florida. Yes, the sheriff's office. Cross was a bookkeeper and skimmed money from an account filled by payments from court judgments. He invested the stolen funds and profited about $50,000 before he was caught. He was charged with fraud and theft, and spent minimal time in jail. He paid half the money back. But, he says, that was another life ago. Cross says it took him four years to crawl out of his own hole; He was $100,000 in debt. ""I could spend a thousand dollars a day,"" Cross told the crowd. ""Although, I'd have to spend about two days recovering from that -- you know what I mean,"" he said. ""I completely sabotaged my life, all in one year. I did more damage in one year than most people do in their whole life."" One night, as a 20 year old, he says, he was parking cars at Miami's Hyatt Regency hotel. He was wearing black ladies garden shoes, because he couldn't afford the black sneakers that were part of his uniform. A Jaguar pulled up, and inside was one of Miami's most recognizable newsmen, anchorman Dwight Lauderdale. He took the car, turned on the radio, and heard a Christian financial expert say, ""There is hope for the hopeless. All you have to do is give your heart and soul to the Lord."" ""And then, I thought, oh Lord, if you're there. I need you."" ""I wasn't going to find satisfaction in money. The only place I was going to find it was outside of that, and I found it, in turning my heart over to God."" He became a CPA and spends one full day each week doing free financial counseling for needy people. He says he no longer gets high on money. He only helps people understand that they can manage their money in a way that can help themselves, their families and others. Juan and Beth Diaz were at the seminar. They said they ran up their credit cards and that their home, south of Miami, went into foreclosure last year. ""America has been a very greedy, give-me-now country for so long, and I think it's a wake-up call for everybody that we can live differently,"" said Beth Diaz. Juan Diaz, her husband, says doing away with credit cards has helped them. The couple plans to be debt free in about 18 months. ""They're telling you: 'Use me, you need me' -- and they own you. We've gotten to the point where we just don't need credit cards,"" he explained. ""Everything we do, we plan, and if we don't have the money, we just don't buy it,"" he said.","Kevin Cross teaches churchgoers about the evil of credit cards .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal authorities have charged alleged drug cartel leader Edgar Valdez-Villarreal -- known as ""La Barbie"" -- and five other defendants with trafficking thousands of kilograms of cocaine from Mexico into the United States between 2004 and 2006, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court Friday. Valdez-Villarreal, who remains at large, is alleged to be a top member of the Arturo Beltran-Leyva cocaine cartel. Authorities have issued a $2 million reward for information leading to his capture. He is currently believed to be in Mexico, a Justice Department statement noted. ""This indictment shows that we are not content simply to arrest and prosecute those in our district who work on behalf of the Mexican cartels to bring cocaine into the United States,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said. ""We are committed to tracing the drugs back to the cartel leaders themselves, and we look forward to the opportunity to prosecute the sources of this cocaine in federal court."" The indictment charges Valdez-Villarreal, 36, Carlos Montemayor, 37, Juan Montemayor, 45, Ruben Hernandez, 38, and Roberto Lopez, 31, with conspiring to import and distribute cocaine, as well as attempted money laundering. The sixth defendant, Jesus Ramos, has already been arrested and arraigned in Atlanta, Georgia. Evidence unveiled during an early 2008 trial in Atlanta showed that Valdez-Villarreal played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, the statement indicated. Several tractor trailer trucks were used to ship the cocaine to Atlanta, as well as to transport millions of dollars in cash back to Mexico. Valdez-Villarreal, according to the U.S. State Department, was a member of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel until Arturo Beltran-Leyva broke off to form his own ring in 2008. Beltran-Leyva was killed in a shoot-out with Mexican officials in December 2009.","Feds charge Edgar Valdez-Villarreal -- a.k.a. ""La Barbie"" -- with distributing thousands of kilograms of cocaine .

"Editor's Note: The FBI had three openings on its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Monday night, FBI Assistant Director Kevin Perkins joined CNN's Rick Sanchez exclusively on ""Campbell Brown"" to announce who filled the first open spot. Tune in at 8 p.m. ET to ""Campbell Brown"" over the next two nights to find out who else will fill the slots. Officials say Joe Saenz is thought to be linked with Mexican drug cartels. (CNN) -- Joe Saenz rubbed his hands together and smiled as he walked up to a Los Angeles County, California, home. His demeanor gave no clues as to what would happen next. Once in the front yard of the home, police said, he drew a gun and shot the victim several times, then in the head, execution-style. The slaying, caught on tape in October 2008, was over drug money, police said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.  Watch why Saenz made the list » . At the time, Gonzales had no idea that videotape would break open a case that has frustrated local and federal authorities for a decade. Saenz had eluded authorities for so long, they thought he might be dead. Now, they knew Saenz, wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape, was still out there. Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught. A member of the Cuatro Flats gang, Saenz first stepped into police crosshairs in 1998. He was wanted for shooting and killing two rival gang members at a housing complex in the Hollenbeck area of Los Angeles. Then, he was a fresh-faced 22-year-old with a dark side. ""Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded,"" Chavarria said. ""Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."" They knew he was dangerous, and they had to find him. ""We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was,"" Chavarria said. Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder. Investigators said Saenz suspected the mother of his child, Sigreta Hernandez, would turn him in, so he kidnapped, raped and murdered her at his grandmother's house. ""He leaves a note indicating that his grandmother has nothing to do with the murder and that he left the scene. And from that point on he became a fugitive for the next 10 years,"" Gonzales said. FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola believes Saenz graduated from local gangs to international drug trafficking -- crossing the border with falsified documents. ""He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said. ""And I think the reason for the last crime was a direct relationship to the cartels."" He's eluded police for years, and has reportedly made statements that he plans to kill a police officer if they ever find him and arrest him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Web site. Now, authorities are hoping the video from October 2008 will help them get one step closer to the man who they say terrifies those who know him just as much as his victims. ""We heard rumors that not only citizens were afraid of him, but also his own gang members were afraid of him,"" Chavarria said. The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous. ""It looks like he really enjoys what he does, he enjoys killing people,"" he said.","Joe Saenz wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape .

"(CNN) -- Romanian striker Adrian Mutu has been ordered to pay English Premier League champions Chelsea a record $20.7 million after losing his final appeal in a five-year case relating to his positive cocaine test. The Swiss Federal Court upheld the decision of FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in ruling that the player must compensate his former club for breach of contract. Mutu, 31, who now plays for Fiorentina, was sacked by the London team in 2004 after testing positive for the drug. He was given a seven-month worldwide ban from football before resurrecting his career in Italy with Juventus and then Fiorentina. Chelsea's legal case was based on the fact that they paid £15 million to sign the player from Parma in 2003 and he had four years remaining on his contract when he was banned. A statement from the Swiss court said:""The Swiss Federal Tribunal has rejected the appeal filed by Adrian Mutu against a sentence by Cas. ""The Cas had sentenced the professional Romanian footballer to paying a sum of more than 17 million euros to his previous employer, Chelsea Football Club Limited."" Mutu is currently serving a nine-month drug ban after testing positive for an anti-obesity drug in January.

"(CNN) -- American Airlines will cancel more flights from its daily schedule through mid-November. ""American Airlines is extending its previously announced schedule reductions through the first half of November by approximately 1%,"" said American spokesman Matt Miller in a statement. ""Although we are beginning to see improvements in our operations, we are taking this proactive step to allow us to get our performance back to the levels our customers deserve and expect."" The new cuts of about 31 flights per day out of the airline's total network of 3,500 daily flights will not affect holiday travel, Miller said. Previously, the airline announced an up to 2% reduction in the number of seat sales through the end of October. The airline declared bankruptcy last year and has been mired in contract negotiations with unions. Airline executives convinced a bankruptcy judge to throw out the pilots' contract last month. In the past month, more than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed. Some travel agents and business travelers have told CNN they can't count on American flights to take off or -- when they do take off, to land on time. Some American customers are starting to book flights on other airlines. Airline management blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems as part of a slowdown. The pilots' union denied management's assertion, arguing that company mismanagement has led to increased maintenance problems. ""These mechanical items are all of American management's making,"" American Airlines Capt. Carl Jackson, a representative of the Allied Pilots Association, told CNN on Thursday as several dozen American pilots conducted an informational picket at Washington's Reagan National Airport. ""They have old planes,"" Jackson said. ""They have a shortage of mechanics, here in the near term it's going to be a severe shortage of mechanics, and we're just trying to do the best we can to get the public safely to where they need to be."" The airline also faced questions about its maintenance after seats on three American Airlines flights have come loose in flight, requiring the airline to fix floor mounts in 48 of its 757s to prevent seats from coming loose again. Although American management and pilots resumed negotiations last week, the three major American employee unions have already reached conditional agreement with US Airways, should a merger of the two airlines take place.

"(CNN) -- The European Commission is warning one of its members that stimulus spending, growing debt and a slower than expected recovery has become a volatile cocktail. No, it's not Greece. It's the UK. Whichever party wins Thursday's general election will steer the fortunes of the world's fifth largest economy, an influential global financial center and a deficit that the European Commission forecasts will rise to 12 percent of GDP in 2010 -- even higher than Greece. (Greece's 2009 deficit stands at 13.6 percent -- the commission estimates it will drop to 9.3 percent this year). The elections come as the financial world has been roiled by events in Europe, such as the growing debt crisis of Greece, Spain and Portugal and the massive economic disruption of the Icelandic volcano. Narrow pre-election polls point to a possible hung parliament for the first time in 36 years, which could further add uncertainty to already shaky global markets. The markets didn't react when UK elections were called a month ago, but that may soon change after the polls are closed: For the first time, London traders have been allowed a special election night session to trade bond and sterling futures -- and they're expecting heavy action as banks try to stake out positions, rather than wait for the usual 8 a.m. open on Friday. The UK ""is a financial mega-center, so for us as a financial institution we care very much (about the election),"" said Julia Coronado, senior economic analyst for BNP Paribas in New York."" In the global banking world we are very aware, more than ever, about what's going on in continental Europe, what's going on in the UK, what's going on in China, all of these things are much more interwoven now. ""There's clearly two very different views of the world represented in this election, and I think if we look at it from the economics point of view it certainly has implications for the growth potential of the U.K. (and) for the regulatory environment in the UK, so that could impact the financial industry very significantly,"" Coronado said. So far, the major parties haven't provided many specifics about how they plan to tackle the UK's growing deficit, which crediting ratings agencies have warned may eventually impact its AAA rating. (Greece's credit rating was downgraded to junk status last week, sparking a weeklong decline in global markets). Are the ratings agencies credit worthy? ""I'm concerned about (the deficit) in the medium to long term, but in the short term we need to keep this recovery going. What has been driving this is public sector stimulus and the difficulty is we have seen very little action in the private sector,"" said David Blanchflower, a former UK monetary policy adviser and economics professor at Dartmouth University. ""Firms aren't investing and they aren't hiring, and if we pull public sector stimulus away the danger is we drop off a cliff."" While the deficit is worrying, market watchers point out that London is no Athens. ""We don't have a bad track record. We shouldn't be compared to Greece,"" said David Buik, of BGC Partners. ""This is actually a buoyant economy, in the fullness of time. It's just the fact that the election really has gotten in the way of reality."" Some worry that a hung parliament and any resulting coalition government may be fractious and short-lived. The last coalition government in 1974 lasted only seven months before new elections were called. ""One benefit I think of actually having a hung parliament is that maybe it rules out the possibility that anybody would do anything stupid,"" Blanchflower said. ""At this moment the status quo is perhaps not a bad thing to be in.

"Former England captain John Terry has announced his retirement from international football with immediate effect. The Chelsea defender, who won 78-caps for his country, was scheduled to attend an FA hearing on Monday for allegedly racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand. Terry was cleared of the allegations by a London court in July. Terry, who lost the armband on two separate occasions for off-field incidents, says the FA has made his ""position with the national team untenable"". And the 31-year-old has now confirmed he will be unavailable to represent England in their quest to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In a statement, he said: ""I am today announcing my retirement from international football. I would like to thank the England managers who have selected me for my 78 caps. ""I have had great pleasure in sharing that honor with all the players that I've played with. I would like to thank them, the fans and my family for their support and encouragement during my international career. ""Representing and captaining my country is what I dreamed of as a boy and it has been a truly great honor. I have always given my all and it breaks my heart to make this decision. ""I want to wish Roy Hodgson and the team every success for the future. ""I am making this statement today in advance of the hearing of the FA disciplinary charge because I feel the FA, in pursuing charges against me where I have already been cleared in a court of law, have made my position with the national team untenable. ""I now look forward to playing for Chelsea FC, and challenging for domestic and European honors, and I want to thank the fans and the club for their continued support."" Terry made his England debut in 2003 against Serbia and Montenegro and was made permanent captain in 2008. But his tenure as captain came to an ignominious end in February 2010 after he was revealed as the sportsman behind a gagging injunction involving his private life. A court order had previously been in place, covering an alleged relationship between married Terry and French model Vanessa Perroncel -- a former partner of teammate Wayne Bridge. Terry was restored as captain by Fabio Capello on March 19 2011 before losing the armband once again following the alleged incident with Ferdinand during Chelsea's game at Queens Park Rangers last October. Terry's final game for England was earlier this month when he played in the 5-0 win over Moldova in Chisinau.","John Terry retires from international football .

"Washington (CNN) -- Is this week's anti-American chaos in the Arab world going to be President Barack Obama's Jimmy Carter moment or Republican challenger Mitt Romney's John McCain moment? The unrest so far in Libya, Egypt and Yemen -- embassies attacked, an American ambassador killed, spreading protests -- evokes memories of another U.S. crisis more than 30 years ago. In 1979, Iranians celebrating their revolution invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage to launch a crisis that helped doom Carter's re-election bid a year later. Romney and some conservative backers seek to draw parallels between the Carter and Obama presidencies, hoping to weaken what has been a major advantage for Obama on foreign policy and cement in voters' minds that he doesn't deserve a second term. Romney: 'A strong America is essential to shape events' The question is whether the strategy at a vital moment in the November election campaign, following the two party conventions and heading into the debates, will end up raising or sinking Romney's hopes. Unable to catch up in the polls, the former Massachusetts governor launched immediate and initially inaccurate criticism of Obama's foreign policy on Tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- after first reports of protesters breaching the U.S. Embassy in Egypt and of an attack that had killed an American at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya. ""It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,"" the Romney statement said in reference to a Cairo embassy statement that was released before protesters stormed the compound. When news emerged Wednesday that the Libya attack killed four people, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Romney found himself criticized by Democrats and some Republicans and conservatives for what they depicted as a crass and non-presidential move. ""Governor Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later,"" Obama told CBS in an interview on Wednesday. ""And as president, one of the things I've learned is you can't do that. It's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you've thought through the ramifications before you make them."" Obama: Romney overstepped on Libya, Egypt attacks . Daniel Larison, a contributing editor at The American Conservative, wrote on the group's website that Romney tried unsuccessfully to apply his campaign theme that Obama has been a weak leader to a situation that didn't fit. He called the mistake akin to McCain's unorthodox reaction to the unfolding financial crisis during the 2008 campaign, when the Arizona senator called for both candidates to suspend campaigning and insisted the fundamentals of the economy were sound in the face of collapse. A more reasoned response by Romney ""wouldn't have fit his ready-made scheme of Obama-as-Carter, but it would have spared him of most of the ridicule he's receiving now,"" Larison wrote, adding: ""Now instead of portraying Obama as Carter, he has presented himself as the bumbling McCain figure of 2012."" Mark Salter, a former chief of staff and campaign adviser to McCain, also took issue with Romney's move, writing on the website realclearpolitics.com that ""the rush by Republicans -- including Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin and scores of other conservative critics -- to condemn (Obama) for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing."" ""I understand the Romney campaign is under pressure from some Republicans to toughen its attacks on the president,"" wrote Salter, comparing it to similar pressure on McCain four years earlier. "" ... But this is hardly the issue or the moment to demonstrate a greater resolve to take the fight to the president."" After his vigorous attacks on Obama on Tuesday night and Wednesday, Romney dropped some of the harshest rhetoric from remarks at a campaign event on Thursday in Virginia while continuing to label the president as a weak leader. ""As we watch the world today, sometimes it seems we're at the mercy of events rather than shaping events,"" he said, later adding that ""the world needs American leadership, the Middle East needs American leadership, and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and will keep us admired throughout the world."" For his part, Obama emphasized U.S. muscle on Thursday in promising a Nevada campaign event that ""no act of terror will go unpunished."" The president added that he instructed his administration to ""do whatever is necessary to protect all Americans who are serving abroad."" Opinion: Romney foreign policy attack was disgraceful . The back-and-forth on the issue reflects the competing efforts by the Obama and Romney campaigns to frame the election in terms favorable to their candidate. Obama seeks to make it a question of competing visions for the future, while Romney pushes for a referendum on Obama's presidency at a time of high unemployment, sluggish economic recovery and mounting federal deficits and debt. Romney previously has sought to tie Obama to the troubled, one-term Carter presidency, focusing on the economy -- considered the most important issue of the campaign. However, Romney trails Obama in the latest polling, particularly on foreign affairs. A recent CNN/ORC International poll showed Obama favored over Romney on foreign policy by 54%-42%. With less than eight weeks to the election, Romney appeared to leap at the chance to challenge Obama on foreign policy when first reports of attacks on U.S. compounds in Egypt and Libya emerged. He continued to sharply criticize the administration on Wednesday, saying it sent ""mixed messages"" on American values and policy to the rest of the world. ""I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values,"" Romney said of the statement issued by the embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video that fomented protests outside the compound. ""When our grounds are being attacked and being breached ... the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation. And apology for America's values is never the right course."" Although Romney said the statement was released after the violence at the embassy, in fact it was released hours earlier. Arab Spring turmoil evokes political response . Democrats quickly fired back, with former presidential candidate John Kerry saying Romney's comments demonstrated ""an insensitivity and a lack of judgment about what is happening right now."" ""I don't think he knows what he's talking about, frankly,"" the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman from Massachusetts told CNN. However, some Republicans including Romney's running mate in November, conservative Rep. Paul Ryan, quickly came to Romney's defense. ""It's never too early to be in strong support of the American values to stand up for what we believe in and to condemn those people who are damaging our property,"" Ryan said in an interview with WLWT in Cincinnati. Conservative analyst Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a former State Department official in the Bush administration, accused Obama of a litany of missteps that she said weakened U.S. influence abroad. ""Apologizing for America, appeasing our enemies, abandoning our allies and slashing our military are the hallmarks of Mr. Obama's foreign policy,"" Cheney wrote in the Wall Street Journal, concluding that ""an America already weakened by four years of an Obama presidency will be unrecognizable after eight."" Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, agreed that Obama's foreign policy was ""weak"" and ""vacillating,"" but he also acknowledged that Romney must win the foreign policy debate that the candidate himself launched to the forefront of the campaign. To Larison, the Romney gambit appeared to be a desperate move by a campaign that ""knows it's losing."" ""When senior Republican foreign policy professionals start referring to this as his 'Lehman moment,' likening it to McCain's mid-September meltdown in response to the financial crisis, we can see that Romney's latest attempt to seize on an international event has done significant and possibly irreparable damage to his campaign,"" Larison wrote. ""Most Americans may not sympathize with Romney's more aggressive foreign policy, but they might have been willing to believe him to be competent and have good judgment. This blunder undermines his claims to both of these."" Ex-SEALs, online gaming maven among Benghazi dead .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The future of design could see the divide between able-bodied and disabled people vanish. A toilet for all: the ""Universal Toilet"" caters for able-bodied and people in wheelchairs. Don Norman , design Professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and the author of ''The Design of Future Things,'' is issuing a challenge to designers and engineers across the world: Create things that work for everyone. ""It is about time we designed things that can be used by ALL people -- which is the notion behind accessible design. Designing for people with disabilities almost always leads to products that work better for everyone."" Once the champion of human-centered design -- where wants and needs of individuals are the primary consideration in the design process, Norman now believes accessible activity-centered design is a better approach. This approach creates designs by looking at the job a person needs to achieve in using a particular technology. Norman told CNN that including disabled people in this thought process would create better technologies for all people, regardless of their level of ability. ""Make cans and bottles that a one-handed person can open and guess what, many people will find it makes their lives easier when they only have one free hand. ""Showers and baths can be made better and safer for all. Make things better for the hard of hearing or seeing and guess what, similar benefits for all,"" he said. And technology like this is already being developed. Korean designers Changduk Kim and Youngki Hong have come up with the ""Universal Toilet,"" an invention that could end the need for separate able-bodied and disabled toilets. Tell us your ideas for machines or objects that could be adapted to suit disabled and able-bodied people. Despite such innovation, Norman said there would still need to be a shift in the mindset of many major companies. ""The most important first step is to increase the awareness of designers and companies of the need to accommodate everyone. The disabled are not just some small, disenfranchised group: they represent all of us. So the first step is education, awareness, and empathy."" A change in the thought process of designers would also require support and active participation of people with the disabilities being designed for, he said. Norman also hoped for some more care to be taken with these designs. ""Finally, why are so many aids so ugly? Why can't we rally the design community to make beautiful, elegant canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and other items?"" Such an approach would aid the work of organizations like the Disabled Living Foundation, and Alison Wright's British company EasyLivingHome, which specializes in inclusive interior design to meet the functional and aspirational needs of older consumers. Norman felt some of the best designs in existence were simple and very old. He believed computers are actually restrictive when it comes to being creative. ""Pencils and small pieces of paper are two of the best objects designed. When you take our computer tools they don't allow us such flexibility. The good technologies are bringing that flexibility back."" He said producing good designs was about making the object understandable, and not trying to base the design on a certain way in which people should use the technology. ""What we should do is understand the job the person is trying to do. Don't try to predict what a human will do. You will get it wrong,"" he said. Some of Norman's favorite technologies of the contemporary era include the Nintendo Wii, navigation systems in cars, and Google Maps with the option of being able to select driving or walking. He is not a big fan of the iPod's design, and believes it has been successful primarily because of excellent marketing, the iTunes store, and other extras which can be bought to accompany the iPod. Norman was also supportive of users of technology could have input into how it functioned. He said 'mass customization' where designers offer the purchaser the opportunity to add a personal touch to goods was increasingly common. ""I think it's quite rewarding letting people design their own things."" So, what does he see occurring in the future? Norman said he was excited about 3D printing and the possibilities that could one day open up. ""I can imagine in the future if I was after something like a new dish-mat, I will be able to buy it online and by printing it it gets manufactured in my own home."" He envisaged being able to purchase the raw materials for such items and then input them into the machine.","Professor of design Don Norman wants designers to be more inclusive .

"(CNN) -- Two suspected rebel leaders accused of having committed war crimes in Sudan's Darfur region surrendered to the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, the court announced. Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus are charged with three counts of war crimes stemming from an attack on African Union peacekeepers in September 2007, the ICC said. They arrived voluntarily at the court at The Hague on Wednesday following summonses issued last August, the court said. Their first appearance before the chamber was scheduled for Thursday morning. Both men are now staying at a undisclosed location, where they will remain for the course of the proceedings, the ICC said. The men each led armed groups that carried out the attack on the African Union peacekeepers, the court said. Banda led splinter forces of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and Jerbo commanded troops from a breakaway faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army/Movement, it said. In the attack, about 1,000 men armed with anti-aircraft guns, artillery and rocket-propelled grenade launchers killed 12 African Union peacekeeping troops and severely wounded eight others in Haskanita, in northern Darfur, the court said. They also destroyed peacekeepers' communications installations, dormitories and vehicles and stole computers, cell phones, uniforms, ammunition and money, the court said. It was the deadliest single attack on the peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004. The voluntary surrender of the two accused was ""the culmination of months of efforts,"" ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said. ""The appearance of the two suspects means that all the persons we wish to prosecute in connection with the Haskanita attack have now appeared before the court,"" he said. The case against Jerbo and Banda is the fourth one dealing with Darfur that has been handled by the court. In one case, Ali Kushayb, a militia leader, and Ahmad Harun, former minister of state for the interior in Sudan, are still at large. Both face charges of murder, rape, forced displacement and other offenses during the Darfur crisis, which the United States characterizes as a genocide. The prosecutor offered them the option of voluntary surrender, Moreno-Ocampo said. ""They refused to cooperate, and the judges issued arrest warrants against them,"" he said. Sudan has refused to extradite them, and has been found in ""non-compliance"" with U.N. Security Council resolutions as a result, he said. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir -- who was just reelected last month -- is wanted by the court for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. He also remains at large. A third case involved Bahar Idriss Abu Garda, of Sudan's Zaghawa tribe. He appeared voluntarily before the court last year on charges of murder, directing attacks on peacekeepers, and pillaging in the 2007 attack on the peacekeepers, but the court declined to pursue those charges in February citing insufficient evidence. The attack on the AU peacekeepers came months before the 7,000-strong force was replaced by a United Nations peacekeeping force of 26,000 troops. The U.N. force, known as UNAMID, is a joint operation between the United Nations and the African Union and took over formally at the end of 2007. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. Sudan denies that the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.","NEW: Surrender means all attack suspects are in custody .

"(CNN) -- Cynde Strand, CNN's Beijing camerawoman during the crisis, had spent night after night in Tiananmen Square, amidst a heap of trash, leaning on her ladder, her head over her camera, just waiting for something to happen. Cynde Strand: ""I just knew this was the day it was going to end."" If she was really exhausted, she'd lay plastic over the trash and cat-nap on that. ""Every night I would stay there,"" she recalled. ""Every night there'd be rumors that the troops were coming, or they weren't coming. And then there were all those kids we had gotten to know,"" she said about the demonstrators. ""Some days I'd start around 5 and just stay the whole night,"" she said. ""The sun would come up and I would just ache. But I knew I wanted to be there when it happened."" She and Mike Chinoy, both based in Beijing and both keen watchers of the Chinese leadership, shared the feeling that the situation was going to end badly. The Chinese had been deeply embarrassed by the demonstrators during the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, they reasoned, and the students were still occupying Tiananmen Square, although their numbers had dwindled.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 » . In their minds, the Chinese leadership just would not stand for that. And Strand had a feeling that whatever was going to happen was going to happen at night, when energy levels were low. ""That Saturday (June 3), I just knew this was the day it was going to end,"" she said. ""That peaceful people-power picnic sit-in was gone. There was anger, rock-throwing behind the Great Hall of the People. The tension was much higher."" And then Strand and her team got word of troops coming towards the giant square. And then kids started running into one side of the square with bodies. ""I got everybody together and said, 'okay, this is it,'"" she recalled. ""'If you don't want to stay, you can go. You don't have to stay here with me, but you have to leave now.'"" She and soundman Kit Swartz stayed in the square for that entire historic night, determined to witness history. ""Bullets were whizzing overhead and then about 3 or 4 in the morning, they turned all the lights off,"" she said. ""Troops started pouring out of Mao's mausoleum, different troops came out from under Mao's portrait. Tanks moved in. By early morning, they had taken over the square and crushed that tent city."" Strand didn't get to film much that overnight of June 4. It was dark, she and Swartz took shelter behind public bathrooms for awhile, and the most dramatic images she had managed to film had gone with producer Donna Liu back to the CNN bureau. Strand had no idea what had happened to the tapes. And no one at CNN knew what had happened to her and Kit. Her walkie-talkie battery was long dead and nobody had cellphones then. From CNN's base at the Beijing Hotel, the square, she knew, ""looked like hell, with buses on fire, APCs [armed personnel carriers] on fire and the Goddess of Democracy statue backlit by the fires burning on the road."" Daytime broke. Chinese troops controlled the square. Strand and Swartz needed to get back to the CNN bureau. They flagged down a flat-bed rickshaw driver, who pedaled them and their gear to the Beijing Hotel. As they arrived, journalists leaned out of the hotel windows, begging to hear what had happened overnight. She walked into the CNN bureau. She and Chinoy looked at each other. She could see the palpable relief on his face. ""It was one of those moments,"" she recalled, ""just a deep connection between us. It said: 'We knew it was coming, and we survived it.'""

"(CNN) -- France's all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry has announced his retirement from international soccer. Henry confirmed his decision on the day he was presented as a New York Red Bulls player having signed a multi-year contract with MLS side after leaving Spanish champions Barcelona. The 32-year-old scored 51 goals for his country but only made two substitute appearances as France were knocked in the group stages at the World Cup. The squad returned in disgrace after refusing to train two days before a vital game but Henry says France's dismal showing had nothing to do with his decision. ""South Africa didn't play any part in it. My decision was taken right before the World Cup,"" he told reporters in New York. ""I could have announced my decision before the World Cup but I didn't want to put that kind of cloud on the team. I think it was time for me to stop after the World Cup.'' Asked what went wrong at the World Cup Henry replied: ""I actually would like to know myself. I don't know what it was. ""From a personal point of view, I am always going to respect the decision of the coach. It was [Raymond Domenech's] decision not to play me and I respect that. ""Lots of stuff was invented unfortunately. I just like to stick to the pitch, and the problem was we didn't play very well. That's the only thing we should be talking about right now. We didn't perform. It's as simple as that. ""We had a good atmosphere, but when you don't perform well it is difficult. For me, you can also have a lot of stuff happening when you win. We just didn't play well. I will stick to this. ""I think the team should move on now with Laurent Blanc in position as the coach, and hopefully they can qualify for the European Championships and do well in that competition.'' As for his move to New York, Henry said a switch to the United States was something he had been thinking about for ""four or five months."" ""I can assure you I have come here to try to win, that is the most important thing,'' Henry said. ""I am a competitive person and I'm sure the boss can put a team out there to do it. ""I've met some people who came to MLS before and played for this club. I played with a guy you know well, Youri Djorkaeff, and know Claudio Reyna too. ""For me there was not any other option than New York Red Bulls. I wanted to represent New York. I love this city.

"(CNN) -- Facebook users who haven't yet discovered the joys of FarmVille or plugged in to the sounds of Spotify will be getting an easier way to find apps that run on the site. On Thursday, the site unveiled Facebook App Center, a clearinghouse for social apps that sounds a lot like Apple's online store. And while most will likely remain free (with some making money through in-game purchases), Facebook will also now allow paid apps on the site. ""For the over 900 million people that use Facebook, the App Center will become the new, central place to find great apps like Draw Something, Pinterest, Spotify, Battle Pirates, Viddy, and Bubble Witch Saga,"" Facebook's Aaron Brady wrote on the site's page for developers. A life without Facebook: Are you off the site? Tell us why . The center will be available on the Web and on both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. It will roll out to users over the next few weeks, according to Brady's post. Facebook will use ""a variety of signals, such as user ratings and engagement"" to determine which apps are added to the App Center and which get most prominently displayed. ""Well-designed apps that people enjoy will be prominently displayed,"" Brady wrote. ""Apps that receive poor user ratings or don't meet the quality guidelines won't be listed."" Developers are being asked to create an app detail page, that will give potential users details about the app and be accessible to Web searches. Those pages are due by May 18, signaling that a full rollout might not happen until after then. And in a move that mirrors Apple and Android app stores, developers will now be given the option of charging a one-time fee for their apps. ""Many developers have been successful with in-app purchases, but to support more types of apps on Facebook.com, we will give developers the option to offer paid apps,"" Brady wrote. Facebook currently makes about 15% of its money through payments in games and other apps. Zynga, owners of FarmVille, Draw Something and other successful games, are responsible for the majority of those payments. Facebook takes a 30% cut of the payments. The center rolls out at an opportune time for Facebook, as it prepares for an initial public stock offering. Facebook has not yet found a way to make money on the increasing number of users who access the site through mobile devices. Becoming more visible to iPhone and Android users may be a move in that direction, easing investor concerns in the process. Most initial tech-world reactions Thursday were positive. ""So far, I see nothing not to thumbs-up here,"" wrote Matt Peckham for Time. ""A user-related ranking and inclusion system? A chance to investigate an app before installing it? A way for developers to compete on more level terms with Apple and Google with regard to app pricing? Everything in one central location? App agnosticism when it comes to platform and installation?

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Protesters led by a Sri Lankan cabinet minister laid siege to the United Nations compound in Colombo on Tuesday, demanding that the world body drop a probe into alleged human rights abuses in the final stages of the separatist war that ended last year. Staffers were prevented from leaving as a crowd of about 1,000 surrounded the compound and burned an effigy of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Their placards told the United Nations to stop interfering in Sri Lanka's affairs. Ban named a three-person advisory panel last month to look into possible human rights violations committed during the war between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. ""The secretary-general remains convinced that accountability is an essential foundation for durable peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,"" a statement from Ban's office said. ""Through the panel, the secretary-general expects to enable the United Nations to make a constructive contribution in this regard. Scuffles erupted Tuesday when U.N. staff tried to leave the compound. Police charged the crowd with batons, wounding at least six people. Wimal Weerawansa, a minister in President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government, said the protesters planned to return Wednesday. The United Nations objected to the demonstration led by Weerawansa. ""While respecting the right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, preventing access to U.N. offices hinders the vital work being carried out by the United Nations each day to help the people of Sri Lanka,"" U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters in New York. ""The government has provided assurances for the safety and security of our staff and for their full access to their offices,"" he added. ""We will be closely monitoring developments and trust these commitments will be honored."" Sri Lanka's decades-long war, through which the Tamil Tigers were seeking an independent homeland, ended with a ceasefire in May 2009. More than 65,000 people died in the strife. The United Nations has been concerned about accountability issues related to the military defeat of the rebels, including alleged war crimes by troops and rebels -- allegations that both parties deny.","U.N. staffers prevented from leaving offices .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy Seals' dramatic rescue of Poul Hagen Thisted and Jessica Buchanan early Wednesday ended the hostages' three-month ordeal in Somalia. But why was it left to the United States to conduct this operation in a country thousands of miles away? The short answer is that the United States has the military and intelligence capabilities to conduct the rescue of a U.S. citizen in pressing need of medical attention. The longer answer is that Somalia lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support. This is evidenced by the failed attempt of Somali forces to rescue a Danish family in March 2011, where, as has so often been the case, local authorities found themselves outgunned by the organized criminals. There are no Somali agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in Somalia, which has existed under a relatively impotent Transitional Federal Government since the central government collapsed in 1991. Most of Somalia is a patchwork of quasi-autonomous regions, across which neither governance nor law enforcement is coordinated. While most nations recognize the transitional government in Mogadishu as the legitimate government of Somalia, its reach is extremely limited. Local administrations are thus left to manage issues of organized crime with little resources or support. The result: Citizens exist in a precarious truce with a well-armed and organized criminal element. It is in this context of lawlessness that the United States opted to take direct action to release these two hostages. But such heroic and high-profile moves, by the United States or any other nation equipped for them, are not a long-term solution to Somalia's plague of organized crime, now spilling across borders. To break this cycle of crime, the international community must step up its commitment to investing in Somali stability and addressing the symptoms of the nation's governance vacuum. A recent report by the Center for American Progress estimated that $9 billion in humanitarian and development aid went into Somalia over the past 20 years. This is a stark contrast to the billions that piracy costs the world each year. A forthcoming One Earth Future report finds that $7 billion was spent on measures to address Somali piracy alone in 2011. If the international community does not shift toward building sustainable Somali law enforcement capabilities at sea and ashore, the only realistic options to resolve hostage situations will continue to be through military action or ransom payments. Among the ways money used to combat piracy is spent: . 1. International Navies support operations to patrol Somali waters and the Western Indian Ocean. 2. Nations fund suspect and prisoner transfer arrangements and ""outsourcing"" of prosecution within the region, as well as Europe, North America and Asia. (Even more will be spent to incarcerate convicted pirates.) 3. The maritime industry spends billions on armed guards, extra insurance, ""ship hardening"" and re-routing. 4. Shipping companies pay expensive ransoms, if other measures fail. Somali criminal elements have proven themselves to be amazingly resilient and adaptable. And we can expect that this rescue may lead to an even greater escalation of violence and corresponding threats to innocent human life, including the estimated 190 hostages held (one of whom is a recently captured American writer) and the thousands of seafarers who continue to transit this dangerous area. Indeed, the violence has been increasing as pirates confront private security teams and aggressive naval actions. They have changed their tactics to separate and conceal hostages and are re-investing ransom funds into criminal enterprises. Gangs are also becoming more sophisticated. Hostage takers now demonstrate a familiarity with international law that prohibits negotiation with international terrorist groups. Groups labeled as terrorists simply sell their hostages to middlemen who can legally negotiate. Yet there has been surprisingly little investment from the international maritime community in a sustainable solution, although for a brief time last fall it appeared there might be a ray of hope. When the radical Islamist group, Al-Shabaab withdrew from Mogadishu in early fall 2011, many saw this as an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to stabilize Somalia. In September, key regional leaders from Somalia adopted a ""Somali Roadmap"" to improve security, the constitution, reconciliation and good governance. But with a fractured political system and roiling conflict between the country's regions, implementation has been slow. Now the world's eyes are turning to a high-level conference to be convened by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in London on February 23 aimed at tackling the root causes of the problems in Somalia, including piracy. We can only hope that this conference will set the stage for a coordinated and forward-looking international effort that engages all the stakeholders in Somalia and looks past the symptoms.

"(CNN) -- Seven Baha'i prisoners face a death-penalty trial Saturday in Iran amid calls for their release from a U.S. panel on religious freedom. A U.S. panel on religious freedom has demanded the immediate release of the imprisoned Bahai's. Responding to a letter from Roxana Saberi, the Iranian-American journalist who spent four months in an Iranian jail earlier this year, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) demanded the seven prisoners be freed rather than stand trial on charges of espionage and religious violations. If convicted, they could face execution. ""In addition to the hundreds of Iranians who have been detained in the context of Iran's disputed presidential poll, many other 'security detainees' arrested long before the June election remain behind bars,"" Saberi said in her letter requesting U.S. government intervention in the Baha'i case. ""These Iranians and the authorities who have detained them need to know that the Iranian people's human rights are a matter of international concern,"" she said. Saberi, who was tried, convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison on espionage charges, spent time in a cell at Tehran's Evin prison with two of the Baha'i prisoners. Saberi was released in May. Leonard Leo, chairman of USCIRF, said the crackdown on protests after Iran's June 12 presidential elections ""have exposed the world to the cold realities about how the Iranian government regularly deals with dissent or views that are a perceived threat to the theocratic regime."" ""The charges against these imprisoned Baha'is are baseless and a pretext for the persecution and harassment of a disfavored religious minority,"" Leo said. ""They should be released immediately."" The seven Baha'is have been held for more than a year without formal charges or access to their attorneys, said Diane Ala'i, representative to the United Nations for the Baha'i International Community. She said the seven are being legally represented by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi and human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani. But according to the human rights group Amnesty International, Soltani was arrested in Iran on June 16 and his whereabouts are unknown. Ala'i said the lawyers have not had access to their clients though they have been able to read their files. USCIRF, which is an independent bipartisan federal commission, said the seven Baha'is are charged under the jurisdiction of Branch 28 of Iran's Revolutionary Court, the same judicial process that convicted Saberi in April. The Baha'i prisoners are accused of spying for Israel, spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic and religious offenses. ""This trial is all about them being Baha'i,"" Ala'i said. ""The accusations are completely false."" The Baha'i faith is a world religion that originated in 19th-century Persia but Iran does not recognize it. Baha'is are regarded as apostates and heretics in Iran, where they have long been persecuted. Ala'i said that since the Islamic revolution in 1979, more than 200 Baha'is have been executed in Iran. Iran denies that the Baha'i community is mistreated. Earlier this year, prosecutor general Qorban-Ali Dorri Najafabadi, told state-run Press TV that the Iranian government has afforded the Baha'is with ""all the facilities offered to other Iranian citizens."" But Najafabadi said there is irrefutable evidence that many Baha'is are in close contact with Iran's enemies and have strong links to Israel. The treatment of the Baha'is in Iran and the detention of the seven prisoners have attracted global attention. Human Rights Watch, the world rights monitoring group, last month called for the release of the imprisoned or a prompt trial, with ""fair and open proceedings."" Lawyer Cherie Blair, the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, wrote a newspaper column this week urging international pressure before the trial to ""ensure the seven men and women receive a fair trial and a chance of justice.""","Seven Baha'is in Iran to face trial Saturday, could face death penalty .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's foreign minister met with Hamas' leader-in-exile Khaled Meshaal during a visit to Syria Monday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al Hariri during his Damascus visit, spokesman Selim Yenel said. Turkish media reported he also held talks with former Iraqi prime minister Ayad Allawi and radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Yenel said he did not have details about the discussion between Davutoglu and Meshaal. Turkey, once Israel's only Muslim ally in the Middle East, was condemned by the Israeli government when it hosted Meshaal on an official visit in 2006.  Hamas had just swept parliamentary elections in the Palestinian territories. Davutoglu, then a key foreign policy adviser to the Turkish prime minister, was seen as the architect of the Hamas visit. Yigal Palmor, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said the meeting would not make change Hamas' actions. ""So one wonders what is the point of talking to an organization that refuses and rejects the idea of solving problems through dialog,"" he said. Israel and the United States both formally label Hamas a terrorist organization. Turkish-Israeli relations have sharply deteriorated over the last two years, since Israel mounted a military offensive on Hamas-ruled Gaza.  Relations hit rock bottom after Israeli commandos raided a Turkish aid flotilla steaming toward Gaza in May, leaving eight Turks and one Turkish-American citizen dead.","The Turkish foreign minister meets in Syria with Hamas leader Meshaal .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China has become the world's third-largest economy, surpassing Germany and closing rapidly on Japan, according to government and World Bank figures. Commuters drive along a road in downtown Beijing, China, on Thursday. The Chinese government revised its growth figures for 2007 from 11.9 percent to 13 percent this week, bringing its estimated gross domestic product to $3.4 trillion -- about 3 percent larger than Germany's $3.3 trillion for the same year, based on World Bank estimates. Beijing is expected to release its 2008 GDP figures next week. Although the world's top economies, the United States and Japan, are in recession, the most pessimistic estimates for China's growth in upcoming years runs about 5 percent. That could allow China's GDP to overtake Japan's, currently $4.3 trillion, within a few years. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, was about $13.8 trillion in 2007. The World Bank's estimate of China's economic growth is about 7.5 percent. But China has seen a sharp decline in exports in November and December as other major economies struggle, and the bank's analysts say rates below 6 percent could worsen the rest of the world's slump.  Watch how China was able to overtake Germany » . And Michael Santoro, author of the 2008 book ""China 2020,"" said China will have other problems to overcome if it is to maintain its rapid expansion. ""It's no longer sufficient for China to become a manufacturer of sneakers or toys and the like,"" Santoro said. ""Now they're looking to become players in the area of pharmaceuticals and foods and other high value-added products, where safety and quality are important characteristics for improving in the global economy."" China recently announced a $600 billion economic stimulus package, and its State Council on Wednesday laid out a new plan to boost its steel and auto industries -- including about $1.5 billion to develop alternative-fuel vehicles.

"(CNN) -- A series of explosions and shootings killed 44 people and injured more than 200 in Baghdad and elsewhere Thursday morning, Iraqi police said. Police believe the wave of attacks, most of them within a two-hour time frame, were a coordinated effort by militants. While most of the Baghdad attacks targeted majority Shiite neighborhoods, explosions also took place in the majority Sunni provinces of Salaheddin, Diyala, and Mosul. No militant group claimed responsibility for the attacks, but authorities believe they may be attempts to unnerve Iraqis and erode their confidence in the ability of Iraq's army and police, a police official said. The country has seen more coordinated attacks since American troops withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011, the official said. An Iraqi government spokesman declined comment on the incidents. But the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said it ""strongly condemns"" what it called terrorist attacks. ""These heinous acts targeted people going to work and shopping, children going to school and security forces working to protect the citizenry,"" the embassy said, adding the attacks were ""targeted at all the people of Iraq in a desperate effort to undermine Iraqi society and its institutions."" The United Nations' Assistance Mission in Iraq also condemned the violence ""in the strongest possible terms."" ""The continuing violent attacks on Iraqis are totally unacceptable and have to stop,"" said Martin Kobler, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general, in a statement. The attacks ""are meant to hinder the achievement of national unity and stability,"" he said. In Baghdad, incidents included gunmen opening fire at a police patrol checkpoint, a car bombing in a busy square and an attack at an outdoor market, according to police officials. Roadside and car bombings were also reported in towns including Hilla, Baiji, Kirkuk and Dujail, police said. In the town of Mosul, two suspected suicide attackers were shot dead by Iraqi security forces as they were attempting to carry out an attack, police officials said. The death toll in Iraq has fluctuated over the past four months as U.S. troops completed their withdrawal. In November 185 Iraqis were killed, the majority of them civilians, according to sources within Iraq's Ministry of Interior. In December, that number dropped to 155. Iraqi government figures for January showed 151 deaths in violence. However, sources with the Ministry of Interior disputed that, saying 293 people were killed. And the London-based Iraq Body Count group, which tracks civilian deaths, put January's deaths at more than 400. ""The situation is worsening,"" said Hamit Dardagan, co-founder and principal analyst of the organization. January's figure ""shows a constant level of violence that doesn't seem to let up."" While the 2011 death toll -- more than 4,000, according to Iraq Body Count -- was drastically lower than that recorded at the height of the violence, between 2005 and 2007, the group predicted in a January 2011 report that a low level of conflict in Iraq would continue to claim a number of civilian lives for years to come. Iraq's Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders have squared off in recent months after an arrest warrant was issued for Tariq al-Hashimi, the country's Sunni vice president. Al-Hashimi is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. The warrant was issued shortly after the vice president's Sunni-backed Iraqiya party said it would boycott Parliament, saying Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. Al-Hashimi last week denied the charges in a televised speech, saying the Iraqi judicial council is under the control and influence of the central government and that the charges are ""politically motivated."" Iraqi officials expressed concern Thursday that the violence could cast a shadow over Iraq's hosting the next Arab summit on March 29. The government said earlier this month that logistical and security arrangements had been agreed upon for the event. The U.S. Embassy said, ""We are confident the Iraqi people will remain firm in their desire to keep sectarian division at bay and not allow the terrorists to win or their corrupt vision to triumph over the democratic will of the people.""","NEW: The United Nations and U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemn the attacks .

"London (CNN) -- Niche markets -- such as reusable diapers -- are proving the buffer against recession for some Barcelona-based entrepreneurs. Monste Munoz is the founder of Tucuxi, a small business which specializes in ensuring growing families did not suffer from rising diaper bills. She told CNN's Richard Quest the company was able to save families significant sums of money. ""We have a key advantage for parents,"" she said. ""With the first baby where they have to invest in the cloth nappies they already save 900 euros [$1,665]."" Spain: Perils of being 'filthy stinking poor' She added: ""Another type of customer buys them because of ecological motivations."" The business is powered by three second-hand sewing machines in a tiny workroom, and Monste ensures that any earnings are reinvested back into the company. Barcelona is the capital of the north-eastern region of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the Spanish economy and has the highest gross domestic product of all the Spanish provinces. But Monste says the high labor costs and a lack of bank lending is preventing the expansion of her diaper-based venture, and makes local production uncompetitive. Spain's next crisis: Regional splits? At 25%, Spain has the highest rate of unemployment in Europe, according to Eurostat. And Monste says taxes rather than salaries are responsible for Spain's jobless problem. ""For every 100 euros I pay a person I have to pay 40 to 50 to the state and that is extremely expensive,"" she said. Santa & Cole -- another Barcelona-based firm -- have turned to foreign markets to boost sales. The company -- which specializes in lighting and furniture -- has seen exports more than double from 30% since 2006. Santa & Cole President Javier Nieto Santa says that many of small suppliers in the area have gone out of business due to the economic downturn and this is forcing companies to take more risks in order to survive. He said: ""We are not giving up. Spain has done a lot of things properly in the last 15 years. I strongly believe in our country... We all have to become international.""

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's main militant group said Friday it destroyed another oil pipeline owned and operated by a foreign company in the Niger Delta region. File image shows Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta fighters. It is the third reported attack this week by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, which demands a fairer distribution of the country's oil wealth. ""Heavily armed fighters"" blew up a ""major"" crude oil pipeline run by the Italian gas company, Agip, in Bayelsa state early Friday, MEND spokesman Jomo Gbomo said in an e-mail. There was no immediate word from Agip about the purported attack. Some companies in the region have shut down their operations in the Niger Delta in the wake of ongoing violence there. The fighters reached the pipeline after overpowering a Nigerian military gunboat, Gbomo said. ""All the soldiers numbering seven (7) were dispossessed of their weapons,"" he said. ""The gunboat was also stripped of its weapons before it was disabled by explosives. The soldiers pleaded for their lives to be spared and we did."" The militant group said it blew up Shell's major crude oil trunk line late Wednesday in Bayelsa state, as part of its campaign ""to cripple the entire oil and gas export of the Federal Republic of Nigeria."" MEND called on the company to ""vacate the Niger Delta region to avoid collateral damage to their investment and death to staff."" Shell confirmed an attack on its pipeline in Bayelsa on Wednesday, saying it shut down some production ""to avoid potential environmental impact,"" spokesman David Williams said. ""There's a joint investigation underway to determine the quantity of crude (oil) spilled,"" Williams told CNN from the company's headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands. MEND also claimed to have attacked a Chevron oil station in the Niger Delta region Monday and threatened further attacks in other states in the Niger Delta region, as well as on offshore oil facilities. At the time, a Chevron spokesman said it was investigating the reported attack on its Abiteye flow station. The U.S.-based company halted its onshore operations in the region last month. MEND on Monday also warned the international football association FIFA that it should ""rethink"" allowing Nigeria to host the upcoming under-17 World Cup series later this year. ""The safety of international players and visitors can not be guaranteed due to the current unrest,"" MEND said in an e-mail. Only two out of the nine stadiums in Nigeria are close to being ready for the tournament which is scheduled to take place between October 24 and November 15, according to FIFA. The association has given the country a grace period to start constructing the remaining venues, FIFA Vice President Jack Warner said. Last month, the militant group declared an ""all-out war"" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent. The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer.","Militants claim to have overpowered gunboat and bombed a major pipeline .

"Washington (CNN) -- Staff members at eight Head Start centers manipulated income information given to them by undercover applicants so that the applicants would get benefits they were not qualified for, according to a Government Accountability Office report being released Tuesday. In response to the report, Health and Human Services Director Kathleen Sebelius has notified the more than 1,600 operators of Head Start facilities nationwide of new steps being taken to crack down on fraud. The GAO report says undercover applicants made 15 visits to 13 centers in six states and the District of Columbia to register their fictitious children. At eight of those centers, Head Start employees disregarded ""part of the families' income to register over-income children into under-income slots"" or ""lied about applicants' employment status or misrepresented their earnings,"" the report says. The Head Start program provides child development services to around 1 million children of low-income families. Because of its popularity, many Head Start centers have waiting lists for spots for children. The GAO report raises concerns that many Head Start slots are taken up by children of families that are not low income, thereby leaving the targeted low income children on the waiting lists. At a Wisconsin center, the report says, a Head Start associate knowingly included the income from only one of the child's guardians so that the family would qualify for the Head Start program. And in Pennsylvania, a Head Start associate disregarded $23,000 in income for a family of three so that they would qualify. Then, when told that the mother also received some additional cash income from a part time job, the associate replied, ""That's your business,"" the report says. The GAO undercover operation also looked at centers in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and the District of Columbia. In her letter, sent Monday, Sebelius said that the department's inspector general's office is following up on the incidents reported by the GAO, and that those incidents and any other allegations of fraud could result in criminal prosecutions. Among other steps the Health and Human Services Department will take, she said, are increasing the number of unannounced visits to monitor centers, requiring operators to improve any inadequate controls to prevent errors and other lapses, and developing ""new regulations that promote program integrity."" ""Allowing ineligible children to enroll in the program is a blatant violation of head Start's rules and it steals opportunity from children who need it most,"" Sebelius wrote.","Watchdog agency says workers rigged information to allow undercover applicants to qualify .

"New York (CNN) -- Many times I've watched in dismay as crowds of Moammar Gadhafi supporters gathered to wave flags in front of Libya's former dictator -- in particular, two years ago, when the convicted murderer Abdul Al Megrahi returned to his home country under the guise of near-death, to be welcomed as a hero, banners waving, Gadhafi embracing the man who helped him kill my brother. We watched in jaw-dropped horror as these two conspirators embraced in front of what we believed to be a throng of paid political cheerleaders. We'd often heard that part of the way Gadhafi kept up the sparkly image of a happy, well-led people was to pay them to show up and look as though they were viewing a god. It's classic imperial propaganda: Make sure the little people show the love when the cameras are on. It's a method designed by Joseph Goebbels and painstakingly perfected by Gadhafi. Today, as I look at the images streaming from halfway around the world, my heart is deeply moved by what I see on the faces of a liberated people. In a country where the economic disparity has historically been far greater than any place since Ancient Rome, a true revolution has occurred. The impoverished, the downtrodden, the unlawfully imprisoned, the enslaved, are all pouring into the streets with their new, green flag of freedom, tears of relief and even disbelief etched on their faces. This is their day. My 23-year struggle for justice is a grain of sand compared to what the Libyan people have endured. Gadhafi's death an answer to little girl's prayer . I have had countless e-mails and phone calls today, asking me if I'm happy, and if I feel that my brother can finally rest in peace. At the risk of sounding like I'm never satisfied, I have to say that I am not entirely happy. Sure, some weird, throttled joy is bubbling up in me today, and I don't hold with any camp that would contend that ""Gadhafi deserved a fair trial."" But yet I fear that with his death goes a warehouse of secrets and lies that could have been revealed in order to salve the souls of Libyan families who lost loved ones during this regime. Men and women have literally disappeared from their houses and places of work and worship, only to be buried in mass graves. I know where my brother rests in peace, innocent of any crime other than being an American on the wrong plane at the very wrong time in history. Rather than wanting to see the kind of freak-show snuff film of Gadhafi that is worming its way through the internet as I write this, I would have far preferred to watch him from a front row seat in the Hague as he, in true Milosevic style, would have been made to answer for his countless hideous crimes. In the 23 years since I lost my brother I have fought (alongside my parents) for this day. Many times I have been accused of wanting revenge, of not tempering my desire to see Gadhafi and all his cohorts brought to heel. Today, as that dish is served to me ice-cold, I can tell you honestly it has never been about revenge. Today, as ever, it has been about justice, for those 270 innocent American and Scottish citizens who fell to earth like so many doused stars on a cold night in late December. Today, as ever, it has also been about justice for the 6.5 million Libyans, who no longer need to be paid to look happy when the world's cameras point their way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Flynn.","Brian Flynn: It has been 23 years since bombing of Pan Am 103 .

"(CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was a binge drinker who had a pornography habit or fetish in the 1980s, then changed radically when he stopped drinking alcohol, his former girlfriend told CNN on Monday. Lillian McEwen, who dated Thomas for several years before he was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1991, provided CNN's ""Larry King Live"" program with a harsh depiction of Thomas. She said when they first met, he might have been a ""raving alcoholic"" who used pornography to help fulfill sexual fantasies, but then gave up drinking and transformed into an angry, obsessive man who bullied his son. King said during the program that Thomas' office declined offers to comment on the topics of the interview. Thomas almost had his Supreme Court nomination derailed when another woman, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment when they worked together in the 1980s at the U.S. Department of Education and then the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Thomas angrily denied any improper behavior involving Hill, calling the allegations a form of lynching. McEwen, a former prosecutor and administrative law judge who has written her own memoir and is seeking a publisher, said she believed Hill's account of sexually suggestive statements by Thomas because of his use of pornography. ""I suppose I would call it a fetish or a hobby,"" she said of Thomas. ""It was something that was very important to him, something that he talked about."" She said the pornography bored her and she wouldn't watch pornographic videos with him, but she also said she enabled his fantasies tied to the pornography ""because we had a sexual relationship."" ""I didn't disapprove of it. I just didn't care,"" McEwen said. According to McEwen, Thomas underwent a major personality change when he gave up alcohol that eventually caused her to leave the relationship. ""Clarence became not the person I knew when I first met him,"" she said, adding that he ""drank to excess"" when they first met and might have been a ""raving alcoholic"" at that time. When he gave up alcohol, she said, he became ""angry, short-tempered, asexual"" and obsessive with ambition and what she called ""weird things,"" such as long runs in the dark before dawn. Asked if she believed back then he was qualified to reach his goal of being a Supreme Court justice, McEwen said it was a difficult question and cited ""instability,"" a ""lack of intellectual curiosity,"" and trouble with concentrating when reading for a long time as issues about Thomas that would make it difficult to do the job. Thomas""went backwards"" during the time she knew him and became a bully to his son, McEwen said, and she added that she once turned him down when Thomas asked if he and his son could move in with her. Eventually, McEwen said, ""it was time for me to go."" Thomas is one of the most conservative justices on the nine-member Supreme Court, and is known for rarely if ever asking questions during hearings. To McEwen, his conservative rulings amount to a kind of revenge fueled by anger against liberals who he believes turned against him. ""His enemies are people who are active in civil rights, professors who have criticized him and anybody who disagrees with the conservative friends that he has such as Rush Limbaugh,"" she said. McEwen had never spoken publicly about her relationship with Thomas until the recent revelation that Thomas' wife, conservative activist Virginia Thomas, left a voicemail for Anita Hill asking her to apologize for her 1991 testimony at the confirmation hearing. According to McEwen, she was ""tricked"" by a Washington Post reporter into commenting on the Virginia Thomas phone call to Hill and decided is was time to come forward with her story.

"Washington (CNN) -- He, or perhaps she, is described as ""hairless,"" ""pink,"" ""wiggly,"" ""the size of a stick of butter"" and ""very vocal."" In other words, beautiful! For a panda. The National Zoo's joyous announcement Monday of the birth of a still-nameless panda is giving Washington something to celebrate. Here, in the city that is just coming off a blazing hot summer and entering the quadrennial exercise in self-immolation we call a presidential election, the birth of a panda is giving the city something else to talk about. Panda birth in Washington: 'We are thrilled' The 4-ounce baby, the second offspring of Mei Xiang (pronounced may-SHONG), is believed to be the first birth in this city that wasn't used by politicians as a grim reminder of the future cost of college tuition, or by government actuaries to recalculate the pending bankruptcy of the Social Security trust fund. It is the perfect birth for our imperfect times. A zookeeper was the first to recognize the momentous occasion was at hand. Pandas are notoriously difficult to impregnate, because of a very short fertility period. And scientists often must wait until a baby is born before they can confirm efforts at artificial insemination are successful. The zookeeper, listening to a monitor, ""heard the vocalizations of the cub,"" Brandie Smith, a senior curator at the zoo told reporters Monday. ""And she immediately called (another of the zoo's panda keepers) to confirm... And they called me as well. And the three of us kind of sat in front of our computer screens in our individual houses about 11 o'clock last night going, 'Did you hear that?' 'Did you hear that?!' 'Did you hear that!?' ""And once we confirmed that, yes indeed, it really was a cub, once our kind of disbelief and our incredible job and elation, we overcame that, and we started calling everyone and bringing them in."" Another curator checked the videotape to see if it had recorded the moment of birth. ""We didn't see the cub come out, but we saw her reaction and it was that kind of (the) 'Aaaaah!' reaction that she had when she had (her first baby in 2005),"" Smith said. ""And fortunately she was a great mother this time and she turned around immediately, picked at that cub, cradled it and took care of it right away."" Zoo officials have pronounced Mei Xiang a fit, loving and caring mother. ""She's such a fantastic mother,"" said panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle. ""She did a wonderful job with (her other cub) and we're confident she'll do a great job again this time. It's great to see her with a cub tucked under her chin like she did so many years ago and it's great, for the zoo, it's great for all of us that have been around with her for so long."" For now, the baby is nameless. The zoo says it will follow the Chinese tradition of naming the panda 100 days after it is born. Zoo officials predict attendance will increase by a half-million people this year because of the panda. For Washington, and for a nation desperate for unity, it is the perfect election-year gift. Pandas are tri-racial (being both black and white and Asian in origin), non-denominational, and non-partisan, evoking neither the size of Republican elephants nor the temperament of Democratic donkeys. As an added bonus, scientists at the zoo still have not determined the sex of the baby, making discussion of gender equality pointless. It is, in short, the perfect baby for our times. There is, of course, that whole U.S.-China thing. But for now, that will have to wait. People here are just happy waiting for their chance to see a hairless, pink, butter-stick baby. And hope that uptick in stuffed panda bears bring us out of our national doldrums.","Mike Ahlers: The birth of a baby panda is more than just a unique addition to the National Zoo .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A four-year-old boy in a Hong Kong isolation ward has tested negative for a SARS-like virus that infected two people in the Middle East, the government said on Monday. The illness was instead confirmed to be an influenza infection, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said and not a case of novel coronavirus -- which belongs to the same family of viruses that caused the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The newly discovered virus killed a 60-year-old Saudi national in June and has left a 49-year-old man from Qatar who had traveled to Saudi Arabia in a critical condition in a London hospital. The boy arrived in Hong Kong from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with his father on October 3 and was admitted to the emergency room of Ruttonjee Hospital on Sunday with a fever, cough and vomiting. He was later put in isolation at a different hospital. New SARS-like illness poses medical mystery . Hong Kong, which was at the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, takes disease control very seriously and put health workers on alert after the World Health Organization first reported the virus's discovery on September 23. The outbreak of SARS, which killed 299 people in Hong Kong and 800 worldwide, also dealt a severe economic blow, emptying the normally bustling city's shopping malls, restaurants and schools. The WHO said that while from the same family, the new virus is distinct from SARS. It said it was investigating the possibility of transmission from animals but, unlike SARS, there is no evidence yet that the novel coronavirus has been transmitted from person to person. A Hong Kong University researcher, Yuen Kwok-yung said last month that the new virus is closely related to two bat viruses found a few years ago in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post. SARS was though to have jumped species from the civet, a member of the cat family.","Boy tests negative for SARS-like virus that has infected two in Middle East .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rains left thousands stranded in eastern Australia on Saturday as authorities warned of more flooding and urged several communities to flee to higher ground. About 16,500 people are isolated because of flooding in New South Wales, with evacuation orders in place for several communities, the New South Wales Emergency Services said. In the neighboring state of Queensland, authorities issued flood warnings for three towns, Surat, Roma and Mitchell, and warned residents living downstream of rivers to move to higher ground. Residents of the southwestern Queensland town of Charleville are hoping that its protective levees will hold back the rising waters. Emergency officials ordered evacuations early Saturday as they warned that the river was expected to top the levee banks within 12 hours. Food and medical supplies have been flown to isolated communities elsewhere in Queensland. In New South Wales, officials issued natural disaster declarations for several areas. Flood waters have started to recede around North Moree after five days of major flooding, the New South Wales Emergency Services said, but many of the town's streets remain closed. Aerial assessments show some 300 homes and businesses have been inundated -- making it the worst flooding in nearly 60 years, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. The State Emergency Service carried out 18 flood rescues from Friday to Saturday, Seven Network reported, including half a dozen people stuck on a shed roof near Moree with snakes swimming underneath them. The airline Qantas put on a special flight to Moree on Saturday with supplies of fresh food and milk, the network added. Major flooding has also affected communities along the Namoi River, leading to the rescue of at least one person trapped in a vehicle on a flooded bridge. The town of Wee Waa is cut off, with all roads made impassable by flood water and the local airport also out of action, the New South Wales Emergency Services said. Major flooding is expected to continue there until the middle of next week. Other communities affected by the Namoi River include Boggoabri, Narrabri Bugilbone and Goangra, with flood waters closing roads and inundating some rural properties.. Emergency officials urged people not to walk, ride or drive through flood waters, as this is the main cause of death and injury during floods.","Queensland and New South Wales are suffering major flooding .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- When Leo Manzano won second place in the 1,500-meters final at the Olympics, he celebrated his well-deserved victory by waving two flags, that of the United States and Mexico. He has every right to do so: After all, he has dual citizenship for both countries. Some observers disagree with Manzano's action. On CNN.com, Ruben Navarrette voiced his concerns that Manzano was showing disloyalty to the United States even while he's wearing the USA jersey. Opinion: U.S. Olympic athlete, Mexican flag? Judging by the volume of comments in response to Navarrette's opinion, one would think that Manzano had committed treason. One reader wrote, ""He is pathetic. ... Go back to Mexico. You're either American OR NOT!!"" OK, calm down. Let's not get too worked up here. Navarrette was right when he said that ""it's all about context."" Like him, I personally don't like Mexican-Americans or undocumented Mexicans waving Mexican flags protesting in the United States. But keep in mind, we live in America: a country where one can voice an opinion, however different it might be. We live in a land that has freedom of speech. But I believe Navarrette missed the larger point. Manzano is not Mexican-American but was born a Mexican and became an American. There is a reason one can have dual citizenship; it means that one can have an allegiance for two countries. There is no conflict of interest. If governments can approve of dual citizenship, why can't individuals embrace it? Navarrette asked: ""Where were the Italian-American athletes waving the Italian flag, or the Irish-Americans waving the Irish flag?"" Maybe we don't have that because Italian and Irish families emigrated to the United States much earlier and their ties may not be as strong to their motherland. Also, they are too far away from Europe. However, Mexico is so close to the United States that Manzano, or any other Mexican or Mexican-American, can just drive their car across the border. Those people with Italian or Irish lineage can't just drive home: There's too much water along the way, much more water than the Rio Grande. I found it interesting that Navarrette would say that most Mexican-Americans he knows ""would need a whole team of therapists to sort out their views on culture, national identity, ethnic pride and their relationship with Mother Mexico."" I don't see that, though I think some of my fellow Mexican-Americans need therapists for other reasons. Navarrette also thinks that Mexican-Americans are ""the orphans of the Southwest -- too Mexican for the Americans, too American for the Mexicans."" I have heard this before. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't need to see a therapist to accept being a second-generation Mexican-American and embrace the culture of my grandparents. I am bilingual, bicultural and have two addresses: Dallas, Texas, and Mexico City. I have affinity for both the United States and Mexico, and that's perfectly fine. In this increasingly global world we live in, don't we have an appreciation for people who do not forget where they came from? When I am in Mexico City, I certainly never forget that I am also an American. On the Fourth of July, for example, I once had a party that included American flags, hot dogs and hamburgers in order to educate my Mexican friends about American culture. No one made a big deal about it. When I posted Navarrette's commentary about Manzano on my Facebook page, the reactions were not in Navarrette's favor. My friends, mostly Mexican-Americans and Mexicans, looked at Manzano's victory lap in a positive light. They know that Manzano was representing the United States and never doubted his devotion to the country that took him and his family in during hours of need. It's just that, in a moment of pride, Manzano wanted the world to know that he didn't forget his heritage. As one friend aptly put it, ""Identity, like borders, is porous and negotiable."" I like this statement because even though I was born and raised in Dallas, I have no problem crossing borders, loving both Dallas and Mexico City. If I am ever recognized in Mexico for any of my accomplishments, I will not hesitate to wear my U.S. flag in honor of my country. Sure, the Olympics are a different story. The whole world is watching. While Olympic athletes should always rally behind their team, it does not mean they have to subsume their individuality. We should admire individuals for their hard work and respect their decisions in how they wish to be recognized. Manzano wanted to thank the United States and also acknowledge Mexico, the land of his forefathers. As I see the image of Manzano running with two flags and embracing his dual citizenship, I sense no insolence. He didn't take off his USA jersey; the Mexican flag is not prominently hanging over his head, it's only dangling as some sort of secondary thought. It is clear he loves his adopted country. Viva to Manzano for being proud of who he is: someone who is American, but also has a part of Mexico in him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jesús Chairez.","Jesús Chairez: Leo Manzano has a right to wave two flags in his victory lap at the Olympics .
Chairez: Manzano has dual citizenship for the U.S. and Mexico .
He says Manzano wanted the world to know that he didn't forget his heritage .

"(CNN) -- As Hurricane Frank gained strength far from land over the Pacific Ocean on Thursday morning, southern Mexico dealt with the aftermath of the system's assault on the mainland earlier in the week. Frank was packing sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest ""tropical weather discussion."" The hurricane was about 380 miles (610 kilometers) south of the southern tip of Baja California, the center's 11 a.m. Thursday advisory said. Hurricane center meteorologists predicted the system's strength -- currently Category 1 (74 to 95 mph) -- would change little Thursday, and then would gradually begin weakening on Friday. But Frank had already done plenty of damage -- and as a tropical storm (39 to 73 mph sustained winds), no less -- before growing into a hurricane. Four people died and at least 30,000 residents in southern Mexico were affected by heavy rain and winds from the former Tropical Storm Frank, the government-run Notimex news agency said Wednesday. The deaths and damage occurred in Oaxaca state, on Mexico's Pacific coast, Notimex said. A mudslide in the municipality of Totontepec Villa de Morelos killed two farm workers, the news agency said. A mudslide in another part of Oaxaca caused at least six vehicles to drive off Federal Highway 182, leading to another two deaths, Notimex said. Several rain-swollen rivers -- including the Valle Nacional and the Atoyac -- overflowed their banks, affecting at least 10,000 people and leading to the loss of 4 tons of corn and 50 head of cattle, it said. Hundreds of people have been evacuated and placed in temporary shelters, officials said. In the nearby state of Tabasco, also in southern Mexico but on the Gulf of Mexico coast, heavy rain affected 48 localities and nearly 7,700 people, Notimex said. Frank is the third hurricane in the Pacific Ocean this year, following Celia and Darby. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report .","NEW: Hurricane Frank is about 380 miles south of Baja California, with 80 mph winds .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- A fourth newborn baby has died after a fire in the intensive care unit of a maternity hospital in Romania, a hospital official said Tuesday. The baby died at the Grigore Alexandrescu Hospital, where another seven were being treated, said Dr. Radu Balanescu, the hospital's medical director. One of those babies was in poor condition Tuesday and the other six were stable, he said. Autopsy results on three babies whose deaths were announced earlier show that one died from smoke inhalation and the other two died from lack of oxygen, said Marcus Iacob, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. All the babies have been identified, Balanescu said, but officials still planned to run DNA tests to confirm their identities. The fire at Giulesti Maternity Hospital in the capital, Bucharest, began Monday after an electrical cable in the air conditioning system caught fire behind a wooden closet in the intensive care unit, according to prosecutors' preliminary conclusions. The cable had not been installed and isolated properly, they said. Pictures of the burned intensive care unit, published Tuesday in the Romanian newspaper Adevarul, showed a burned incubator, a blackened room, and equipment that had melted and was singed. Prosecutors said the fire burned slowly for about an hour before any medical staff entered the room. The intensive care room had been unstaffed at the time, they said. As a result, prosecutors called for the questioning of 15 medical staff, including the nurse who was supposed to be in the room at the time, Iacob said. Staff also failed to evacuate any babies in the five minutes between the time they placed the emergency call and firefighters got to the burning intensive care unit, fire department spokeswoman Anca Onofrei said. Everyone in the hospital was eventually evacuated, including five women in labor, another 26 pregnant women, and six who had just given birth, Raed Arafat, state secretary deputy in the Health Care Ministry, said Monday. The Romanian press was critical Tuesday of the staff's response, saying it showed the weakness of the Romanian health care system. Dr. Gheorghe Burnei, a renowned surgeon with the Children's Hospital Marie Curie in Bucharest, told Realitatea TV that due to the poor Romanian health care system, this kind of tragedy could happen again at any time.","A fourth baby dies from Monday's fire at a Bucharest hospital .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of Google alum Marissa Mayer's surprise hiring as CEO, variations of the same question are popping up again and again: . What can be done to turn once-mighty Yahoo around? In the salad days of the late '90s and early 2000s, Yahoo was the very face of the Internet for many people. Its search engine was the Web's most-used, letting the company demand top dollars for advertising. As a Web portal, it helped hundreds of million of people take their first tentative steps online. Opinion: What signal is Marissa Mayer giving to Yahoo employees? But along came a company called Google, whose algorithm-based search feature came to dominate the market quickly and whose e-mail service, while not supplanting Yahoo's, played a part in stripping away the company's fading sheen of Internet chic. Yahoo's stock price spiraled to $118.75 in early 2000. That number sat at $15.62 Wednesday morning, about three months after the company laid off 2,000 workers. The once-dominant photo site, Yahoo-owned Flickr, has been increasingly shoved aside in favor of mobile apps such as Instagram and blogging sites such as Tumblr. And even online advertising, which Yahoo once dominated, is slumping. Yahoo's ad revenue has been passed by both Google and Facebook, and its overall share of online ad sales in the United States has been cut in half since 2009. The company has churned through four CEOs in four years. And the last, Scott Thompson, left in May after he was discovered to have padded his resume with college credentials he didn't really earn. So what's to be done? Defining Yahoo . Analysts say the Sunnyvale, California, company needs to start by deciding what it is. Take a quick look at this list of products: Yahoo Mail. Yahoo Messenger. Yahoo Groups. Yahoo Voice. Yahoo Voices (yes, they have both). Yahoo Sports, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Shopping. That's just the tip of the digital iceberg, and doesn't even get into Yahoo-owned services such as Flickr and Rivals.com. Oh yes, and Yahoo still has a search engine, too (although its inner workings have been farmed out to Microsoft). ""Yahoo!'s fundamental problem is that it has too many disparate products with no clear unifying thread that ties them all together,"" analyst Shar VanBoskirk of Forrester Research wrote on the company's blog this week. VanBoskirk, who has followed Yahoo closely, said Mayer must be open to killing the company's lesser products as she seeks to move things in the right direction. Marissa Mayer: Six life lessons from Yahoo CEO . According to VanBoskirk, Yahoo's new chief needs to do three things: Define a clear vision for the Yahoo brand, get rid of products that have nothing to do with that vision and then ""market the new vision clearly so that business and consumer customers know what Yahoo! is and why to use it."" And while she lauds Mayer's experience and knowledge, VanBoskirk said she is not sure the 37-year-old is up to the task. ""Mayer's background is in product development ... not corporate strategy, not marketing, not brand definition ... the areas where Yahoo! has the most critical need,"" she wrote in the post, which a Forrester spokeswoman cited when reached for comment on this story. Attracting talent . Evercore analyst Ken Sena doesn't necessarily agree. He said innovation is the key for Yahoo, a company that, in the eyes of many, has remained stagnant while rivals better anticipated such digital trends as the growth of social media and mobile networking. Those competing companies, including Google, have repeatedly disrupted a Web landscape that's dramatically different than when Yahoo ruled. ""Her experience will be valuable there,"" Sena said. ""I think the argument can be made that Marissa probably already knows Yahoo very well. She's probably studied it for some time."" He too suggests streamlining, saying that some Yahoo services will need to be ""pared down and, ultimately, outsourced or shuttered."" The company needs to address the growth of the mobile Web, he said, or as VanBoskirk puts it, develop ""a plan for The Splinternet."" And to innovate truly, Sena said Mayer will need to bring in the sort of people who helped turned Google into a powerhouse. Popular tech blogger Robert Scoble agrees. He's bullish on Mayer as CEO, even though she ""does face huge problems at Yahoo,"" he wrote on his Google+ page. He said she's uniquely suited to do what any good leader must do: surround herself with other talented people. ""That company has been abused by its leaders for so long and has lost so much talent,"" he wrote. ""That said, one thing I watch is who would join a new leader. I've been at several events and have seen first hand the people that Marissa inspires. She'll probably bring in her own innovation team that will be world class pretty quickly. This will be an innovation shock to Yahoo that's definitely needed."" Opinion: Marissa Mayer can revive Yahoo, and the Web . Leading with products, not content . By selecting Mayer over interim CEO Ross Levinsohn, Yahoo could be tipping its hand as to what users can expect. Levinsohn's background is in content, such as Yahoo News and related offerings such as Yahoo Voices (formerly Associated Content, a publishing platform that's been criticized as a low-quality ""content farm."") Mayer, meanwhile, comes from a product-development background. In her 13 years at Google she helped create the look of a number of services, from Gmail to Google Maps. The Internet just wants Mayer to fix Flickr . Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, now head of influential venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said that could mean Yahoo is ready to focus on innovating and improving products such as Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger instead of pumping up Web content such as Yahoo News (which is hugely popular but is largely populated by material gleaned from outside news services). ""It's a huge statement on the part of the board that they want the company to be product-led,"" Andreesen told Business Insider, a CNN content partner. ""I say that because they had a great CEO (Levinsohn) if they wanted to be media-led. It's a huge double down on product."" Andreessen said he wouldn't have gone in that product-focused direction, but ""I didn't think they could get someone like Marissa."" Yahoo will need to figure out how to make users want those products though, according to Sena. Tools such as Yahoo Mail and the popular portal page don't translate well to mobile devices, which are, increasingly, how people access the Web. But analysts point to some positives on which Mayer can build. While it's sliding in the United States, Yahoo Mail is still the second-most popular e-mail service in the world (behind Microsoft's Hotmail) and a top portal for many. The company said 700 million people a month still visit Yahoo sites -- a lot of eyeballs to look at advertising, which both Sena and VanBoskirk see as a logical focus moving forward. ""Its reach and available inventory is massive,"" VanBoskirk wrote last year. ""And its ad marketplace is making real-time ad buying mainstream."" 11 interesting facts about Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's new CEO .","Analysts break down what Yahoo needs to do to turn its business around .

U2 -- Adam Clayton, Bono, The Edge and Larry Mullen Jr. -- hold signs for ""U2 Way"" Tuesday in New York. Bono, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen and The Edge appeared on the southwest corner of 53rd Street and Broadway -- along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- to unveil the street sign ""U2 Way."" West 53rd Street west of Broadway will keep the name for one week while the band is in town to appear each night on CBS' ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" The rock band released its 12th studio album, ""No Line on the Horizon,"" Tuesday and is gearing up for a worldwide tour to begin in July. Bloomberg told fans that the band represents peace and tolerance, and each member will now be considered an honorary New Yorker -- a status that is a bit more than honorary for Bono and The Edge, each of whom have second homes in the city. The rechristening of the street had special meaning for the band members. ""The Beatles had Penny Lane, Elvis had Lonely Street and now we have the street between 10th Avenue and funky, funky Broadway,"" said Bono. Drummer Larry Mullen cracked that he had been hoping for something better, along the lines of Larry Mullen Circle. Adam Clayton said he already has a street named after him. There is a street in Harlem called Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard. It's actually named after a former congressman.

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya said he was denied permission to land at Tegucigalpa's airport Sunday evening after a deadly clash between Zelaya's supporters and government troops. A plane carrying ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya flies over Tegucigalpa on Sunday. Zelaya told the Venezuela-based news network Telesur that his jet was denied permission to land in Tegucigalpa, where military vehicles were arrayed on the runway. The aircraft was en route to San Salvador, the capital of neighboring El Salvador, after what Zelaya called a ""fruitless"" attempt to land. At least one person was killed and eight wounded after security forces opened fire and used tear gas on protesters who ringed Tegucigalpa's airport, said Hugo Orellana, a Red Cross director in Honduras. Protest leaders put the death toll at three. After being denied permission to land in Honduras, Zelaya's plane made a stop to refuel in Nicaragua's capital, Managua. During the stop, he met with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega -- who is a leftist ally of both Zelaya and Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez -- and told Telesur that his supporters had been trying to remove obstacles from the runway in Tegucigalpa when troops opened fire. ""The people pulled back when fired upon,"" he said. In a statement read on national television, the interim government said police opened fire when protesters tried to force their way onto the airport grounds. ""The outcome of police intervention has not been verified,"" the statement said, adding, ""The government regrets the consequences of these violent demonstrations."" ""We call on national and international people who participate in these actions to abstain from encouraging disorder and disquiet of our population not to interfere with our country's development efforts,"" the statement said. The provisional government that took power after the Honduran military removed Zelaya from office June 28 has vowed to keep him from coming back from exile. Government officials said Zelaya would be arrested if he returned, but several thousand protesters who ringed the airport said they would protect the ousted president with a human cordon.  Watch military block runway » . The small jet was transporting Zelaya and United Nations General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto from Washington. The U.N. General Assembly condemned the coup last week. Zelaya called on the U.N., the Organization of American States and the United States to take action after his return was thwarted Sunday. ""What are at risk are social reforms started in Latin America,"" he told Telesur. ""What we see is a return of the right in Latin America -- a more reactionary right, more prone to killing, more fascist than in the past. They're regrouping. It's almost a conspiracy, a plot."" At a news conference earlier Sunday, provisional President Roberto Micheletti said that Zelaya's return could create unrest in a country that has seen demonstrators for both sides in the streets since the coup. ""I don't want a single drop of blood to be spilled in Honduras,"" Micheletti said. The leftist Zelaya was ousted in a military-led coup the same day he planned to follow through with a referendum that the courts and the congress had ruled illegal and that the military said it would not support. Lawmakers voted to strip Zelaya of his powers and named Micheletti as provisional president. The provisional government maintains that the military action against Zelaya was backed by a court order and that arrest warrants have been issued against him for violating the constitution. Before his jet reached Tegucigalpa's airspace, Zelaya told Telesur he remained commander-in-chief of the Honduran armed forces and demanded they ""to open up the airport and avoid any problems with the landing."" A delegation supporting Zelaya, including the head of the OAS and Presidents Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina, Rafael Correa of Ecuador and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay, was to fly on a separate plane heading to neighboring El Salvador. The OAS voted Saturday to suspend Honduras from the organization after the provisional government failed to respond to a 72-hour deadline to restore Zelaya as president. The United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid from Honduras, and the European Union and other nations have recalled their ambassadors from the country.  Watch report on suspension of Honduras » . In his remarks Sunday, Micheletti extended a diplomatic branch to Chavez and Ortega. The interim leader said his government was open to ""good faith"" talks with the OAS, but reiterated his government was legitimate and would not be moved. ""We are going to remain here until the country becomes calm,"" he said. In a conference call with journalists, senior U.S. administration officials -- who insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities -- said that if Honduras denied Zelaya entry, he would be expected back in Washington on Monday to continue conversations at the OAS. After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty. Military interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s. Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement. CNN's Karl Penhaul and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 1 killed in airport clash between troops, Zelaya supporters .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A series of civil lawsuits against defense contractors KBR and its former parent company Halliburton claims the companies endangered the health of U.S. troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan by unsafely burning massive amounts of garbage on U.S. bases. Burn pits produced thick black smoke and toxic fumes, according to plaintiff Richard Guilmette. Six lawsuits were filed Tuesday and three more are scheduled to be filed Wednesday in state courts on behalf of current and former military personnel, private contractors and families of men who allegedly died because of exposure to the fumes from the burning garbage. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also are seeking to file a class-action suit. The lawsuits are the first coordinated effort by plaintiffs to extract damages for the claimed health effects from the burn pits. The military has acknowledged the concerns but said its own test of the most notorious case, the Balad Air Force Base burn pit, found there is no prolonged health risk for those who were exposed for a year or less to the fumes. But the military's report on the fumes also acknowledged it cannot account for all the items burned in the Balad pit. At one point the open pit burned everything from plastics and food to medical waste, with jet fuel used as an accelerant at times. The lawsuits, filed Tuesday in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York and North Carolina, seek damages ""in an amount sufficient to strip defendants of all of the revenue and profits"" earned. KBR and Halliburton were paid millions of dollars to oversee the waste management for the military. One plaintiff, Richard Guilmette of Enterprise, Alabama, said he lived in a tent close to a burn pit while deployed by the Army to Kandahar, Afghanistan. Guilmette's suit describes winds blowing ""the thick black smoke and toxic fumes from the burn pit"" into the tent where he lived from March 2004 to March 2005. The suit claims Guilmette suffered a series of health problems, from severe chest pain and diarrhea, to asthma, sleep apnea and debilitating migraine headaches. A lawsuit filed for Michael Moore of Hinesville, Georgia, claims the plaintiff was exposed to ""toxic fumes"" while deployed to the Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2005 and 2006. Moore lived ""less than 50 yards"" from the burn pit, according to the suit. His suit claims he developed a chronic cough while there that woke him with coughing and choking. Ultimately he was evacuated and diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and breathing problems. According to the filing, Moore previously ""was in excellent health and physical shape, running six miles every day."" In all there are 70 plaintiffs who will file suits, according to lead attorney Elizabeth Burke. The lawsuits filed Tuesday and Wednesday represent 21 plaintiffs, with an addition 50 or so suits to still be filed, according to Burke. ""They sought profit in lieu of safety,"" Burke said of the KBR and Halliburton. KBR had not reviewed the complaints and would not comment to CNN on the specific allegations. ""The general assertion, however, that KBR knowingly harmed soldiers or contractors is unfounded,"" KBR said in a statement given to CNN. ""The safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains KBR's top priority."" A Halliburton spokeswoman told CNN the company had not been served with the suits and therefore could not comment on any of the allegations directly. However, spokeswoman Cathy Mann said if the allegations are in regard to KBR activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, then Halliburton believes it has been improperly named. ""We would expect Halliburton to be dismissed from the suits as Halliburton would have no responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the actions alleged. Further, it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR,"" Mann said in an e-mail to CNN.","6 lawsuits filed Tuesday; 3 more are scheduled to be filed Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Denver police opened a homicide case Wednesday after firefighters found five people dead inside a bar that was set ablaze. Police said they believe the bar was set on fire to mask the homicides inside. ""We'd like to say this was an isolated incident, but I can't say that with any certainty,"" Denver Police Chief Robert White said Wednesday afternoon as he asked members of the public to help investigators. Police said they had received tips, but had no suspects yet. ""We're asking if anyone has any information, no matter how trivial they think it is, please contact us,"" White told reporters. Reports of a fire at Fero's Bar and Grill came in around 1:50 a.m. Wednesday. Firefighters working to put out the blaze found four women and one man dead, police said. ""Each victim's body showed obvious signs of trauma indicating that a homicide investigation is warranted,"" police said in a written statement. Authorities did not identify the victims or release further details about their cause of death. Arson investigators were also looking into what caused the fire, police said. More from CNN Justice: .

"(CNN) -- Mark (John Hawkes) is a 36-year-old virgin and impatient to do something about it. But he's also a good Catholic, which complicates matters. And then there's his domestic situation: he spends most of the day horizontal, in the iron lung, a cylinder that looks a bit like a torpedo tube, that helps him breathe. Since he was struck with polio as a child, Mark can't survive outside this apparatus for more than four hours at a time and even then requires a gurney to get about. He tries not to let it cramp his style, but this is not a lifestyle conducive to courtship and seduction. We've seen films about severely disabled artists before (Daniel Day-Lewis picking up a paintbrush in ""My Left Foot,"" Daniel Auteuil writing his autobiography a blink at a time in ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"") but rarely about their sex lives. Based on poet and journalist Mark O'Brien's memoir ""The Surrogate,"" ""The Sessions"" has a different set of priorities. It's a given that Mark can write, but whether he can get it on with a woman, that's another question entirely, and a far more intriguing proposition. A romantic crush on his caregiver comes to nothing, she doesn't love him ""that way,"" but someone recommends professional help: a sex surrogate. Enter Cheryl (Helen Hunt), married, discreet, patient and practical enough to take a very nervous and over-excitable client through his paces over half a dozen assignations. It's a clichÃ© that actors playing disabled always win accolades, but these are also technically demanding roles, so why not? Hawkes, known for breakout roles in indie hits ""Me and You and Everyone We Know,"" ""Winter's Bone"" and ""Martha Marcy May Marlene,"" is terrific here: emaciated, bony, funny, his voice high-pitched and nasal, both confident in himself and oh so vulnerable. It's good to see Hunt back too in what feels like her best movie role in a decade; she's forthright, tender and ultimately left high and dry by an unusually abrupt third act. Kudos to Moon Bloodgood and Ming Lo as well, for their deft comic underplaying as another of Mark's nurses and the motel receptionist curious to know the nature of this weekly therapy. As are we, and this light but poignant crowd-pleaser of a movie doesn't disappoint on that score. Writer-director Ben Lewin, a veteran who has worked mostly (but intermittently) in TV, builds on the sexual candor pioneered largely by cable series and Judd Apatow-style comedies over the past decade or so. Typically, that involves full-frontal nudity for Helen Hunt, but not for Hawkes. This conventional chauvinism aside, and adopting confessionals with Mark's long-haired priest (William H. Macy) as a comic safety valve, the film is refreshingly frank about the nuts and bolts of physical intercourse, as well as the more complex emotional exchange that is taking place. What's the difference between a surrogate and a prostitute? Cheryl doesn't want the money upfront, and she doesn't want repeat business either (six sessions and that's it, she warns him). But what passes between them is too intimate, too personal to be strictly business, at least from where Mark is lying. Does Cheryl see it differently? Lewin suggests she too is touched by the experience; not by the sex itself, but rather the effect it has on Mark, and his ability to put it into words. Is that just movie romanticism? Maybe so, but ""The Sessions"" is a very different kind of love story, breaking taboos lightly, with sensitivity and humor.","Mark (John Hawkes) is a 36-year-old virgin and impatient to do something about it .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan Monday killed 14 people, including three NATO service members and four Afghan police, and wounded 57 others, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry said. The bomber targeted a joint patrol of ISAF forces and Afghan police, using an explosives-packed motorcycle, according to Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the ministry, which condemned the attack. NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack, saying three ISAF service members and their interpreter died in a bombing in eastern Afghanistan Monday. Their nationalities of the ISAF forces were not immediately available. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a suicide bomber had killed eight foreign forces and six Afghan security forces. The Taliban regularly reports higher casualty figures than either NATO or the Afghan government. CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.","The Taliban claims responsibility for the attack .

"(CNN) -- Kurt Haskell's eyes were locked on the seatback monitor in front of him when the words of a passing flight attendant caught his attention. ""She said something smells like smoke,"" recalled Haskell, a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253. ""I got out of my seat and took a few steps up the aisle, and that's when Row 19 burst into flames."" Two passengers quickly hauled the man sitting in the burning row into the first-class section. A flight attendant grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the flames in what became the latest example of citizens taking action when counterterrorism safeguards fall short. At the time, Haskell said he didn't know if he was witnessing a terrorist attack or a freak accident. In the hours ahead, he and the other passengers learned the details of the near-tragedy. The suspect, later identified as Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, allegedly tried to bring down the airliner with explosives concealed in his underwear. Despite warnings that he allegedly was consorting with Islamist extremists and that he was listed in a database of suspicious people, the 23-year-old Nigerian was allowed to board the plane. ""We dodged a bullet but just barely,"" President Obama said last week. A disaster was averted by ""brave individuals -- not because the system worked,"" he said. Brave individuals also were credited for saving the 197 people on American Airlines Flight 63 in December 2001. Passengers and crew saw Richard Reid trying to ignite a bomb in his shoe. The bomb malfunctioned, and those onboard subdued him and tied him to his seat. Three months before, on September 11, passengers overtook hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, foiling an apparent attempt to crash the plane into a Washington target. The plane instead crashed in a Pennsylvania field, killing everyone aboard. In situations such as these, everyday people play ""the most vital role"" in the nation's fight against terrorism, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. ""Citizens have a role and they have a responsibility, but it's the last and it's the thinnest line of defense,"" Hoffman said. On the front end, the counterterrorism system couldn't function without help from the public, Hoffman said, pointing to the United Kingdom's campaign against the Irish Republican Army and Israel's against the second Intifada. Signs on subways told people to be vigilant and to report any suspicious behavior or bags left behind. In both cases, ""citizen tips were absolutely essential,"" Hoffman said. While the threat of attacks on U.S. soil pales in comparison to the Britain of the late 20th century or modern-day Israel, the United States still needs its citizens to remain alert so as to thwart terrorist attempts to establish a local base. ""More than anything else, it's an attitude that we need to have that we can't leave everything to the government to fix,"" Hoffman said. Temple University psychologist Frank Farley said everyday heroism is empowering for the whole culture and helps combat the ""it's not my job"" mentality. ""What does it mean, everyday heroism? It means something you can do where you are, with what you've got,"" Farley said, echoing the words of Theodore Roosevelt. However, Farley, who has studied heroism for more than four decades, cautioned that overstating the threat or scaring people could counteract the public's willingness to act courageously. In his initial remarks after the attempted Christmas Day attack, Obama called on Americans to remain ""vigilant, but also be confident."" ""This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist,"" he said. Robert Heibel, a retired FBI agent who was the deputy chief of counterterrorism in the 1980s, said education can better equip the public as the nation combats terrorism. Homeland security officials need to tell people what to look for and what's suspicious. ""We live in a world where our antennas need to be up,"" said Heibel, who heads the Institute for Intelligence Studies at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. But he added that ""we don't want to turn America into a vigilante society."" The public needs to understand who the terrorists are and how to counter arguments made by Islamic extremists, he said. ""Terrorism is not going to go away, but I think how we view this opponent, how we view the radical Islamists, has got to change,"" Heibel said. ""We have to be able to sell ourselves better than we do. We are working against ourselves in many areas."" Hoffman added that as officials work to educate the public, they face a challenging pursuit as well. ""There is a very thin line between prudence and paranoia,"" he said. ""Striking that balance is enormously important. I think that's also where our leaders and where government has a very important role to make sure we always stay on the right side of that balance.""","Passengers, crew helped subdue suspect on botched Christmas Day terror attack .

"(EW.com) -- It's official: Neeson Season has stretched to October. Liam Neeson's ""Taken 2"" kicked its way back into the top slot for a second weekend with an estimated $22.5 million, and Ben Affleck's political thriller ""Argo"" and the Ethan Hawke horror flick ""Sinister"" were close second and third, respectively. The one-two-three punch helped boost the box office to a fabulous 47 percent gain over the same weekend in 2011, when ""Real Steel"" slugged its way to a second No. 1 finish. While ""Taken 2"" continues to outpace the 2009 original — after 10 days, it's notched $86.8 million, in comparison to Taken's $53.6 million total in the same time frame — it still dropped a hefty 54.6 percent from its astounding $49.5 million opening weekend. At that rate, it'll be tough (though not impossible) for the film to ultimately best ""Taken's"" $145 million domestic gross. With $20.1 million, ""Argo,"" about the C.I.A. mission to extract six Americans trapped in Iran during the 1979/1980 hostage crisis, did not quite beat Ben Affleck's 2010 Boston heist thriller ""The Town,"" which opened at No. 1 in 2010 with $23.8 million. But it's still a big win for the actor-director, who could ride the film's stellar reviews and superlative word-of-mouth — it earned a rare ""A+"" grade from CinemaScore — all the way to the Dolby Theater in February. A full 52 percent of the audience was over 50, with a 54/46 split between women and men. Also a good sign for Affleck's resurgent second career as a filmmaker: 20 percent of audiences reported seeing the film because he was the director. Put it all together, and ""Argo"" appears to have a lot of life left in it. EW Daily Poll: Best movie about movie-making? After leading the pack on Friday, the quasi-found footage horror film ""Sinister,"" produced by Jason Blum and Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (Insidious) and directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""), ultimately fell to third with $18.3 million. It's a respectable showing, besting studio Summit Entertainment's expectations and making back its $3 million budget six times over, thanks to a savvy marketing campaign that began with the film's surprise showing at the SXSW Film Festival in March. Still, the opening was lower than last winter's ""The Woman in Black"" ($20.9 million) or ""The Devil Inside"" ($33.7), and with a par-for-the-genre ""C+"" CinemaScore, the film better hope to vacuum up as much horror audience money as possible before Paranormal Activity 4 — also produced by Blum — blasts into theaters this coming weekend. So it's clear that audiences were in a mood for thrills and chills this weekend. Laughs, not so much. ""Here Comes the Boom"" whimpered into fifth place with $12 million, by far the worst opening weekend of star Kevin James' career. The folks who did shell out to see the film did at least enjoy themselves: It earned an ""A"" CinemaScore, with 46 percent of the audience under 25 years old. (""Hotel Transylvania,"" in which James provides the voice of Frankenstein, came in just ahead of Boom, banking $17.3 million en route to passing the $100 million milestone in its third weekend, with $102.2 million total.) The meta crime comedy ""Seven Psychopaths,"" meanwhile, landed in ninth place, with a mere $4.3 million in 1,480 theaters for an unfortunate $2,889 per location average. It must be a frustrating result for distributor, CBS Films, which marshaled an eccentric grass-roots marketing campaign to sell the film's offbeat sense of humor. At the very least, the company can be grateful it wasn't releasing ""Atlas Shrugged: Part II."" The second half of the adaptation of Ayn Rand's epic seminal tome collapsed in 11th place with $1.7 million on 1,012 screens. That is just slightly better than 2011′s ""Atlas Shrugged: Part I,"" which opened to $1.69 million — on 299 screens. Shrugged, indeed. Elsewhere, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" expanded to 726 theaters in its fourth weekend, pulling in $2.2 million for $6.2 million total. And the drama ""Middle of Nowhere"" — which won director Ava DuVernay the best director award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival — opened in six theaters to a healthy $13,000 per location average.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney's struggling presidential campaign is trying to change the subject this week with stark warnings of chaos in the Middle East. It's trying to scare voters into thinking that his tough talk will somehow make the situation better. Yet in a recent op-ed calling for a ""new course"" for the region, Romney refused, as usual, to outline any policy specifics, instead putting forth platitudes and falsehoods about President Barack Obama's record. Romney likes to criticize the president's handling of Israel and Iran and to recycle tired attacks on his record on Israel. But he repeatedly sidesteps the facts, ignoring Obama's unprecedented efforts to make our closest ally in the Middle East more secure. Under Obama's leadership, Israel has received record levels of security assistance, including aid for rocket defenses that have saved Israeli lives, and our defense and intelligence cooperation has never been better. The president has forged an international coalition to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Under the most crippling sanctions ever imposed, Tehran's economy is floundering and has never been more isolated. Obama has repeatedly vowed to use all instruments of national power to ensure Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, taking no option off the table. Opinion: Debate coach -- Obama, Romney are top performers . Beyond Romney's cowboy rhetoric, there are zero actual policy differences with Obama on Iran -- unless Romney thinks it's time to rush to war. Everything else he says he would do -- crippling sanctions, a credible military option -- the president is already doing. On terrorism, which Romney never discusses in depth, he has failed to outline any policies to go after al Qaeda and its affiliates. There is a reason for this: On the president's watch, Osama bin Laden is dead and more al Qaeda senior leaders have been taken off the battlefield than at any time since 9/11. Romney's op-ed also tried out new arguments against the president's handling of the Arab Spring. Yet Romney's position on the Arab Spring is particularly incoherent. He has tacked between supporting ""freedom"" and fanning fears of Islamism, without giving any sign that he understands the complexities of this volatile region. His criticism of the president is similarly erratic: sometimes accusing Obama of not doing enough to support emerging democracies, and, at other times, seemingly critiquing him for doing too much to support democracy in places such as Egypt. Perhaps out of fear of offending his party's warring neoconservatives, realists and isolationists, Romney simply refuses to offer any clear position on democracy in the Arab world. Romney's declarations on the Middle East have been heavy on bold declarations of ""leadership"" but light on explanation. Romney's claim that his brash rhetoric will restore order to the region is naive, if not dangerous. Indeed, the last time the United States enjoyed his brand of ""leadership,"" we found ourselves trapped in Iraq, besieged by record levels of anti-Americanism and confronting an ascendant al Qaeda. Bergen: Dangerous new world of drones . Similarly, during the intervention in Libya, Romney never articulated anything resembling a coherent policy. He simply refused to take a stand. More disturbing, Romney's immediate impulse when Americans were killed in Benghazi three weeks ago was to try to exploit the issue for political gain -- and he's been playing politics with the issue ever since. While Romney has consistently appeared unsteady and unready to handle unfolding events, Obama has effectively managed the tumult of the Arab Spring, demonstrating strategic patience and confident leadership. As millions flooded the streets of Arab capitals, Obama recognized that the United States should endorse their demands for democratic change and took the lead in helping to broker a peaceful transition in Egypt. When Moammar Qaddafi turned his guns on peaceful protesters, Obama led an international coalition that saved tens of thousands of civilians in Benghazi, supported the opposition as it overthrew a brutal regime and helped pave the way toward a new Libya. And in the face of President Bashar al-Assad's brutality in Syria, the administration is leading international efforts to isolate and sanction the regime, push back against Russian intransigence at the United Nations and work with European and regional partners to empower the opposition. Opinion: Debate coach: Obama, Romney are top performers . The fact that Romney's approach to the Middle East is all swagger and no substance should come as little surprise. After all, Romney backed the war in Iraq, the biggest foreign policy disaster in a generation, and his advisers -- the people who would populate the national security establishment in a Romney administration -- are a Who's Who of the war's architects. Not only did that war cost more than 4,400 American lives, leave more than 32,000 Americans wounded and cost taxpayers nearly $1 trillion -- it empowered Iran and Syria and undermined U.S. credibility in the region and around the globe. The notion that Romney and his team understand the contemporary Middle East or how best to advance American interests in this volatile region is impossible to reconcile with this record of catastrophically bad judgment. So, while Romney attempts to politicize overseas events to divert attention from his sagging numbers in the polls, Obama will simply continue to do what he's done consistently and effectively over the past four years: promote our values, protect our interests, defend our friends and bring to justice those who would do America harm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michèle A. Flournoy, Colin H. Kahl and Marc Lynch.","Writers: Romney lies about Obama on foreign policy but only offers vague platitudes .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William has helped save a teenage girl who was in danger of drowning off the coast of Wales in his role as Royal Air Force search and rescue pilot. The 16-year-old girl was caught in a rip current and rapidly losing strength when the alarm was raised Thursday, a statement from the RAF Search and Rescue Force said. William, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, had just landed a Sea King helicopter nearby, after going out on a routine exercise, when the alert was radioed through. Former PM: William and Kate reinvigorated monarchy . In less than a minute, he and the crew had reached the scene and a paramedic was winched down into the sea to assist the exhausted girl, who had just gone under water. The paramedic, Master Aircrew ""Harry"" Harrison, is quoted as saying: ""We never know what we'll face when we're called out. Sometimes it's just a twisted ankle or a broken bone, but this was one rescue where we truly did arrive in the nick of time and managed to save this young girl's life."" The girl and a younger friend, who was rescued by a surfer, had been body-boarding in Silver Bay, the statement said. Both were airlifted to the hospital in Bangor, north Wales, for treatment. The 16-year-old girl told the air crew she had thought she would drown, the statement said. Prince William, known to his RAF comrades as Flight Lt. Wales, has been stationed at a search-and-rescue base on the remote Welsh island of Anglesey since 2010, and lives there with Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. William's grandfather, Prince Philip, was admitted to a hospital in Scotland on Wednesday after the recurrence of a bladder infection and continues to receive treatment there.

"(CNN) -- The insurgents who attacked an Afghan military base where Prince Harry is deployed may have gotten onto the base by sneaking through a hole in a fence, a British military source said Monday. Officials discovered the hole after the attack, the source said, adding that the attackers -- daringly disguised in U.S. Army uniforms -- also tried to blow up parked NATO aircraft with hand-held improvised explosive devices. Prince Harry was about a mile and a half away from Camp Bastion when the attack happened, according to the source. The royal was immediately placed on lockdown, as were other troops who were not fighting the insurgents, the source said. U.S. Marines, British forces and a U.S. Army unit that just happened to be nearby spent nearly three hours battling the insurgents, the source said. NATO releases details of brazen raid on base in Afghanistan . ""This was a well-coordinated and complex attack that we're taking very seriously,"" a U.S. official said Monday. It's extremely rare for Afghan insurgents to use U.S. uniforms in their attacks. The last time CNN can identify was more than two years ago, when NATO repelled attacks on two bases in Khost province in August 2010. No coalition troops were killed in that attack, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said at the time. At least two U.S. Marines were killed in the brazen strike late Friday, and six jets were destroyed, the ISAF said. Well-trained, well-rehearsed fighters carried out the sustained assault in Helmand province, the ISAF said. About 15 insurgents organized into three teams penetrated the base's perimeter fence and did considerable damage, destroying six refueling stations and damaging six aircraft hangars. Slain Marine predicted his own death . The attackers toted automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. They destroyed six AV-8B Harrier jets and damaged two others before the attack ended, the coalition said. Fourteen of the fighters were killed, and one was wounded and captured, the ISAF said. Eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded. It is too soon to say whether the attackers had ""inside knowledge,"" ISAF spokesman James Graybeal said. The ISAF would not say how the attackers got the uniforms, but CNN staff who have spent time in Afghanistan say they are for sale in markets there. There has been at least one other case of Afghan insurgents wearing U.S. uniforms, in May 2010. And in Iraq five years ago, there was a dramatic and successful raid using the tactic. Attackers wearing what appeared to be American uniforms were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of five U.S. soldiers in Karbala, Iraq, in 2007. Prince Harry is an Apache helicopter pilot based at Camp Bastion, but the British Ministry of Defence categorically rejected reports in Sunday's British press that he was just a few hundred yards from the gunbattle. NATO admits killing civilians in Afghan strike . Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, ""was in no way in any danger"" during the latest attack, ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said earlier. On Saturday, the ISAF said the camp is secure and the strike would not ""impact"" air and ground operations. Camp Leatherneck, the U.S. side of the base, was not affected by the attack, said Maj. Adam N. Wojack, an ISAF spokesman. The joint base is in a remote desert region of Helmand, the southern province in the Taliban heartland. The Taliban said it carried out the strike, calling it a response to the anti-Islam film stoking anger among Muslims. Yet Crighton said there had no organized demonstrations outside its gates before the assault. Afghanistan has seen only relatively small and peaceful demonstrations against the film during a week in which there were protests across predominantly Muslim countries and other locations. 4 NATO troops killed in 'insider' attack in Afghanistan .","Attackers, disguised in U.S. Army uniforms, tried to blow up NATO aircraft, source said .

"(CNN) -- It was once that a cassock, a simple cross and a chalice was all you needed to equip the average church, but now the world of liturgical accessories is a big business. Poland's SacroExpo is one of the largest trade fairs of its type in the world, hosting displays of everything from bells to church alarm systems and evangelical multimedia. ""We've even had electronic Bibles and electronic rosaries, confessional boxes with air-conditioning and heating and special priest vestments equipped for war zones,"" explains Andrzej Mochoń, President of Targi Kielce, the organizer of SacroExpo. ""The electronic Bibles have been especially popular with the elderly,"" he says, referring to the pocket PC-like devices which speak the Old and New Testaments. The trade fair, now in its 13th year in the Polish city of Kielce, is officially called the International Exhibition of Church Construction, Church Fittings and Furnishings and Religious Art. It brings some 300 exhibitors from 15 countries and is now a fixture on the religious circuit. It attracts some 5,000 visitors -- most of these accredited clergy who are in the business of outfitting churches and priests with the accoutrements of the First Estate. Globally the industry is worth an estimated $4 billion and runs from big ticket items like expensive musical instruments such as church organs to simple wooden rosary beads, which can sell for as little as a few dollars. ""Probably one of the most expensive everyday item for a church would be a chalice for taking communion,"" says Mochoń. ""These can be works of art made of silver or gold and new ones are made in workshops in Germany, the Czech Republic or Italy."" Send in your best images of Poland . Some of the strangest items on the exhibitors' stands are church vestments designed for missions to war zones such as Afghanistan. These include camouflaged cassocks. ""It's also made of special material to withstand very extreme temperatures,"" says Mochoń. There are also highly colored vestments for African priests and plain black favored by Poland's local Catholic priests. Other items include electric candles, automatic church bells and even heated pews. The company that sells the pews, Polarheat, says that when the temperature in Poland drops to minus 10 degrees celsius it can be as cold as minus 15 in many churches. ""At that temperature, even the communion wine freezes,"" says a company spokesman. ""It can be pretty uncomfortable."" Renewable energy is also becoming increasingly popular to heat church properties, according to Mochoń, not least ancient cathedrals which, because of their cold stone, high Gothic arches and vast planes of stained glass windows, are some of the most notoriously cold places in many European cities. Other exhibitors point to new directions for the Catholic Church. A wine company that sells communion wine for Holy Mass reports that priests are favoring whites over reds because the colorless liquid does not make stains on white robes. The showpiece at last year's event was the reconstructed 18 meter-long ""popemobile"" of Pope John Paul II. As well as devotional articles, such as crucifixes and sacral art, the trade fair is also an acknowledgement that churches, especially historic cathedrals, can be expensive to run and need skilled craftsmen to maintain. Among the services displaying at the expo are internal architects, landscape gardeners, experts in cemetery maintenance and craftsmen that specialize in the manufacture of bells. Other services include agents for religious tourism and pilgrimages. Pilgrimages to sites of special devotion have been a big business since the Middle Ages, but the ability of people to travel easily and cheaply has seen Catholic pilgrimages grow into a multi-billion dollar industry. Lourdes in France, believed to be the site of several miracles, regularly attracts more than 5 million pilgrims a year, only slightly below the number one Catholic destination, Rome.","SacroExpo in Poland each June is one of world's largest church trade shows .

"London (CNN) -- Amid a din of whistles and klaxons, and bearing banners emblazoned with ""No cuts"" and ""Austerity is failing,"" thousands of protesters marched past London's landmarks Saturday in a show of popular anger over government cutbacks. ""I don't like the government's policy, I don't think it works and I think the most vulnerable people suffer -- that's why I'm here,"" said one woman on the march. The planned cuts to services and payments that help the sick and disabled are ""shameful,"" she said. Culminating in a mass rally in Hyde Park, the protest, staged by unions representing public sector workers and others, reflects a rising tide of discontent among many over the austerity measures brought in or proposed by the coalition government. Marches were also held in the Scottish city of Glasgow and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Addressing the crowds, opposition leader Ed Miliband, of the Labour Party, criticized the government's policies as unfairly putting the burden of austerity on ordinary workers and cutting ""too far, too fast."" ""None of these people think that Britain owes them a living, none of these people are asking for the earth -- they just have a simple request: They want a Britain that works for them. They believe we do better as one nation,"" he said. Miliband was booed, however, when he said that he could not promise ""easy times,"" or rule out any cuts to services. If in power, a Labour government too would have to take steps to balance the books, he said -- although he insisted it would target the country's millionaires with tax rises, rather than taking money from the poorest members of society, as he accuses the government of doing. A banner carried by one protester put the responsibility for the country's woes squarely on the shoulders of the prime minister, proclaiming ""Cameron has butchered Britain."" But speaking at his Conservative Party's national conference earlier this month, David Cameron defended the government's austerity program, saying ""painful decisions"" had to be made to bring down the deficit. He acknowledged, though, that the path ahead was not easy. ""Here's the truth,"" Cameron said. ""The damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped."" But public sector worker Lee Billingham, 42, said life was getting too tough for many, as costs continue to rise. ""I think the deficit is an excuse to cut our wages and cut public services,"" he told CNN. ""My pay has been frozen for three years now and it's really hard to make ends meet."" The Trades Union Congress, a federation that includes most British unions, said ahead of the event, dubbed ""A Future That Works,"" that it expected tens of thousands of union members to turn out in London. The Metropolitan Police declined to provide an estimate of the number taking part in the march and rally. While the demonstration itself was peaceful, groups of masked youths were seen shouting at police and running through the streets in central London on Saturday afternoon. A police spokesman said officers had responded to some incidents but that no damage to property had been reported. TUC secretary general Brendan Barber told protesters in Hyde Park: ""We have a stark and united message for the government. Austerity isn't working. It is hitting our jobs, our services, our living standards."" ""It is hammering the poorest and the most vulnerable. And austerity is failing even on its own terms, for this is a government of broken promises. ""Ministers told us that if we only accept the pain, recovery would come. Instead we have been mired in a double dip recession."" The TUC wants the government to abandon its program of cuts to public services and austerity measures in favor of investment in infrastructure, new industries and training. Without a focus on growth and job creation, especially for young people, the nation faces a ""lost decade"" of decline, it warns. Chancellor George Osborne said last month though that the economy was ""healing,"" and that the government's strategy was delivering results ""despite strong headwinds."" ""But the scale of the challenge is so great that there are no quick fixes or easy routes to recovery,"" he told business leaders in Scotland. ""The debts built up in our economy over the last decade will take time to unwind."" Both Osborne and Cameron have pointed to the eurozone crisis as a factor in the current economic situation, saying it has cast a shadow over the British economy. Britain is one of a number of European nations, Spain and Italy among them, laboring under a large burden of public debt in the wake of the global economic downturn. Violent clashes between police and protesters have broken out at anti-austerity protests in Greece and Spain in recent months. The UK unemployment rate fell slightly to 7.9% for the period from June to August this year, the Office for National Statistics said this week. However, many young people are without work. CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Laura Smith-Spark and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Police respond to trouble by small groups of masked protesters .

"Editor's note: Actor Rainn Wilson plays paper salesman Dwight Schrute in the television comedy ""The Office."" Rainn Wilson says fellow members of his Baha'i faith are being persecuted in Iran. (CNN) -- Why is Rainn Wilson, ""Dwight"" on ""The Office,"" writing a news commentary for CNN? Good question. It's a bit strange for me, to say the least; a comic character actor best known for playing weirdos with bad haircuts getting all serious to talk about the persecution of the fellow members of his religious faith. Dear readers of CNN, I assure you that what I'm writing about is no joking matter or some hoax perpetrated by a paper-sellin', bear-fearin', Battlestar-Galactica obsessed beet farmer. I am a member of the Baha'i faith. What is that, you ask? Well, long story short, it's an independent world religion that began in the mid-1800s in Iran. Baha'is believe that there is only one God and therefore only one religion. All of the world's divine teachers (Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Moses, Abraham, Krishna, etc.) bring essentially the same message -- one of unity, love and knowledge of God or the divine. This constantly updated faith of God, Baha'is believe, has been refreshed for this day and age by our founder, Baha'u'llah. There. Nutshell version. Now, as I mentioned, this all happened in Iran, and needless to say the Muslim authorities did not like the Baha'is very much, accusing them of heresy and apostasy. Tens of thousands were killed in the early years of the faith, and the persecutions have continued off and on for the past 150 years. Why write about all this now? Well, I'm glad you asked. You see there's a 'trial' going on very soon for seven Baha'i national leaders in Iran. They've been accused of all manner of things including being ""spies for Israel,"" ""insulting religious sanctities"" and ""propaganda against the Islamic Republic."" They've been held for a year in Evin Prison in Tehran without any access to their lawyer (the Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi) and with zero evidence of any of these charges. When a similar thing happened in 1980, the national leadership of the Iranian Baha'i community disappeared. And this was repeated again in 1981. In fact, since 1979, more than 200 Baha'is have been killed, holy places and cemeteries desecrated, homes burned, civil rights taken away and secret lists compiled of Baha'is (and even Muslims who associate with them) by government agencies. It's bad right now for all the peace-loving Baha'is in Iran who want only to practice their religion and follow their beliefs. It's especially bad for these seven. Here's a link to their bios. They're teachers, and engineers, and optometrists and social workers just like us. This thought has become kind of a cliché', but we take our rights for granted here in America. Imagine if a group of people were rounded up and imprisoned and then disappeared not for anything they'd done, but because they wanted to worship differently than the majority. There is a resolution on the situation of the Baha'is in Iran being sent to Congress. Please ask your representatives to support it. And ask them to speak out about this terrible situation. Thanks for reading. Now back to bears, paper and beets! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rainn Wilson.","Rainn Wilson: I'm a member of the Baha'i faith, founded in the 1800s in Iran .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan has banned the theatrical release of a comedy about Osama bin Laden due to hit cinema screens in South Asia on Friday. Movie distributors say they are appealing the ban, issued by Pakistan's Film Censor Board. The film, ""Tere bin Laden"" (""Your bin Laden), stars Pakistani pop singer Ali Zafar as an ambitious young journalist trying to land the scoop of a lifetime as a way to win a visa to live in the United States. Made in the India's Bollywood ""movie factory,"" it's a departure from the melodramas and musicals that dominate Indian cinematic fare. It's also unusual in that it has a Pakistani in the starring role. The trailer for ""Tere bin Laden"" suggests a movie of fast-paced slapstick comedy, and shows Zafar trying to coax an anxious and utterly inept bin Laden look-alike to impersonate the al Qaeda leader. ""You have a million-dollar face,"" he pleads. But the whole scheme spirals out of control when a video they make is taken seriously by the U.S. government. The movie is the directorial debut of Abhishek Sharma, who calls it a ""mad comedy."" Pakistani officials expressed concern that the characterization of bin Laden could incite terrorism in a country that already has more than its share of political violence. Masood Elahi, vice chairman of the Film Censor Board, is quoted by local media as saying: ""There was no justification to release the film in Pakistan under the present circumstances."" Film distributor Khalid Pervez told CNN that the distributors' appeal will be heard Friday. Zafar told the Pakistani news network Geo TV that he was disappointed by the ban. ""I wanted that people should go to the cinema and enjoy this movie,"" he said. Many cinemas in Pakistan have been driven out of business by a thriving black market in pirated DVDs, so the impact of the ban may not be great. Pakistanis who really want to see ""Tere bin Laden"" will be able to pick it up within days.","""Tere bin Laden"" (""Your bin Laden"") is scheduled to open in South Asia on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Jon and Kate Gosselin aren't the only ones conferencing with lawyers. TLC, the network that introduced the bickering couple and their eight kids to the nation, has not only put the kibosh on ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" but also filed a breach of contract lawsuit Friday against Jon Gosselin. Kate Gosselin's life as a single mom was supposed to be the focus of TLC's new series ""Kate Plus 8."" It's doubtful anyone is surprised that TLC is cutting ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" from its programming. After 10 years of marriage, the couple announced their separation and divorce filing on a special one-hour episode of their reality show in June. A show insider told CNN on Thursday there's enough ""Jon & Kate"" footage to last until mid- to late November, but the program will be off the air after then. TLC would like to be able to replace ""Jon & Kate"" with the renamed series ""Kate Plus 8,"" but the network will have to get past Jon Gosselin first. The network announced in September that ""given the recent changes in the family dynamics, it only makes sense for us to refresh and recalibrate the program to keep pace with the family,"" said TLC President Eileen O'Neill. In other words: less Jon and more Kate. TLC's ""deeper focus on Kate's role in the family and her journey as a single mother"" apparently didn't go over well with Jon. Days after learning about the network's new show, the father of eight barred TLC from continuing production on his Wernersville, Pennsylvania, property, citing concern for his children and effectively pulling the plug on his wife's solo spotlight. ""Kate Plus 8"" was expected to debut November 2, but according to a complaint TLC filed Friday in Montgomery County, Maryland, Circuit Court, ""Kate Plus 8"" is ""suspended indefinitely."" In its lawsuit, TLC alleges Jon Gosselin has violated his contract with paid and unpaid TV appearances he recently has made. The network claims it has lost more than $30,000 as a result of Gosselin's alleged disregard of his contractual obligations. In a statement provided to CNN, Mark Heller, Jon Gosselin's attorney, said that neither he nor his client have been served any documents; Heller said he read the complaint on the Internet. ""Apparently, TLC has elected to initially litigate this case in the court of public opinion .... because neither Jon nor I have been served with legal pleadings or informed by TLC of the instant litigation,"" Heller wrote in the statement, calling TLC's claims ""weak, feeble and baseless."" ""Discovery and TLC has treated Jon Gosselin like a dog by attempting to keep him on a leash and muzzle him and deny the father of eight the opportunity to earn a livelihood to support his family,"" Heller wrote in the statement. TLC's complaint said both Gosselins agreed to a contract before the fourth season of ""Jon & Kate"" in April 2008 in which their per-episode compensation ""substantially increased."" In addition, Jon Gosselin agreed to provide ""his and his family's services in taping and promoting the program in and around the family home and to provide those services exclusively"" to TLC, behave in an ""appropriate"" manner and not ""promote or endorse any products or services,"" according to the complaint. Jon has also ""entered a lucrative agreement with 'Entertainment Tonight' and its companion show, 'The Insider' to discuss his family and the problems he was having with Mrs. Gosselin,"" according to TLC's complaint. TLC also alleges that Jon has ""sold photographic rights to numerous media outlets"" and ""has accepted payments to endorse products and services,"" such as a pool party hosting gig in August at the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. In his statement, attorney Heller said the contract will be ""unenforceable"" because the Gosselins entered into the agreement without legal representation. ""In any event,"" the statement added, ""when TLC and Discovery ended the program 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' they also effectively terminated the purported contract."" Heller said that Jon will ""vigorously defend against the baseless action."" It's unclear when either of the Gosselins will return to television after ""Jon & Kate"" becomes part of reality TV history. Jon, however, appears optimistic. The 32-year-old told ""Entertainment Tonight"" this week that ""he's not worried about future employment"" and plans to continue his television career.","TLC lawsuit says new ""Kate Plus 8"" show is ""suspended indefinitely""

"(CNN) -- As many as 400 children have died of lead poisoning-related illnesses in Nigeria since March, two international aid groups say, and as many as 30,000 people could be affected by lead contamination. The deaths occurred predominantly in children under the age of 5 in the state of Zamfara, according to Lauren Cooney, the emergency manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres. The group is also known by its English name, Doctors without Borders. Cooney told CNN Tuesday that the death toll may be even higher, but said the numbers shouldn't mask the crisis. ""Rather than focus on specific death toll numbers, because those often are very difficult to obtain, the international community should focus on the harsh reality in Nigeria: It is very clear that a serious and significant number of children have died due to lead poisoning,"" she said. A study conducted by the World Health Organization and the Health Ministry of Zamfara State ""identified 180 villages where children may have been poisoned by lead, which means that up to 30,000 people could be affected,"" said a statement Friday from the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The report on child deaths comes a few months after the Nigerian government announced in early June the deaths of more than 160 Nigerians, including scores of children, of lead poisoning due to illegal gold mining. ""The lead poisoning is a consequence of villagers practicing small-scale gold extraction from lead-containing ore. The processing of the ore involves crushing and drying, often inside the homes of villagers, resulting in the contamination of soil,"" Doctors without Borders explained in a statement. Since June, Nigerian health officials have cooperated with the World Health Organization to clean up the affected areas. Since the process began, two out the seven villages known to be affected have been decontaminated, Cooney said. ""We already started in June treating patients. We are focusing on treatment of children under 5 but the most important thing is the remediation, or clean-up, so the exposure can stop,"" she added. Remediation is a lengthy process that requires removing all the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil. The process was stopped in the month of August due to the beginning of the rainy season but it started up again a few weeks ago. Efforts to clean up contaminated areas are being hampered by the reluctance of villagers to report potential lead exposure, for fear the Nigerian government will prohibit the informal gold mining, OCHA said. Doctors without Borders says it's still treating hundreds of lead-poisoning cases in Zamfara, but the group warned that the treatment is only effective if patients do not return to contaminated sites.","Doctors Without Borders says the death toll may be even higher .

"(CNN) -- While foreign policy became an unexpected pivotal point in last week's town-hall style presidential debate, Monday's final showdown will focus entirely on international affairs. And with the U.S. government knee-deep in an investigation of its handling of the Benghazi consulate attacks and as reports emerge of planned negotiations with Iranian leaders, the topic could provide a pivot point in the tight race for the White House. ""I think it's going to be an important debate,"" senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod said Sunday, though he sought to lower expectations. ""I don't think any one event is decisive, even though being strong at home and building our economy is the No. 1 issue."" Photos: When every vote counted, closest U.S. elections . President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney meet for their third of three debates in Boca Raton, Florida, the biggest swing state prize with 29 electoral votes. It marks the closing note of the debate season, one that landed Romney a much-needed boost after his widely applauded performance -- and Obama's derided one -- in the first debate. The second matchup was considered more of a draw, with Obama edging Romney in several polls of debate-watchers. Political observers say incumbents usually have an advantage on foreign policy because of their experience making decisions for the country and access to some of the most privileged intelligence. A Pew Research Poll that came before the second debate showed Obama ahead of Romney 47% to 43% when voters were asked which candidate they thought would handle foreign policy decisions better. That's within the margin of error and is a much tighter poll than one taken by Pew in September, which showed Obama leading Romney 53% to 38%. The Obama campaign has attempted to paint Romney as unprepared to handle issues on the world stage. Calling Romney ""reckless,"" Axelrod on Sunday hinted at one line of attack the president could take during Monday's debate. ""We all remember his 'Dukes of Hazzard' tour of international destinations over the summer, where he not only roiled countries that are not as friendly to us but also our best ally, Britain."" During a trip to the United Kingdom, Israel and Poland, Romney generated international criticism in July for his comments in London questioning the UK's preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Campaign explorer: Ads, money and travel . That perceived gaffe was followed by what some said were inappropriate comments about Palestinians, questioning why Palestinian-controlled areas had a lower GDP per capita than Israel. Romney also faced criticism over his initial response to the Benghazi consulate attack, in which killed four Americans were killed, and the breaching of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo last month. He put out a statement the night of the unrest, then held a news conference to chastise Obama on foreign policy the next morning. Democrats and some Republicans argued the reaction was made in haste. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, cited the incident as an example of Romney being unprepared to be a world leader. ""Gov. Romney just seems to be bluster, blunder, cowboy-alone foreign policy,"" Richardson said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I'm troubled at this time when we had the Benghazi crisis, he's trying to make political gain."" But questions have lingered over why the U.S. was unprepared for the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the mixed signals that the White House sent over its cause. In last week's debate in Hempstead, New York, Obama took responsibility for the security of State Department personnel, saying ultimately the buck stops at his desk. ""That's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do,"" he said . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich pointed to Obama's words and criticized the lack of robust security at the consulate, adding the whole episode represents a larger narrative of the president's foreign policy track. Intelligence on Benghazi shifted . ""If we can't figure out what went on in a relatively open city in a country we had helped liberate, why do we think we know what's going on with Iran's nuclear program?"" the former Republican presidential candidate and speaker of the House said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Defending Romney, Gingrich said he had ample foreign policy experience from his time as Massachusetts governor, as well as his role in running the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City and living overseas as a missionary. Weighing in on the expectations for Monday's debate, CNN contributor and New Yorker political reporter Ryan Lizza told CNN's Athena Jones that while foreign policy is important, it's not ""what's going to drive the vote."" ""So if you're Mitt Romney, every second you're talking about foreign policy is wasted. Which might mean that Romney tries to break out of that, tries to bring home some of the foreign policy issues to domestic economic issues. For instance, when you're talking about China, that's in some ways a domestic issue,"" he said. Lizza said Romney has a choice to make. He could try to attack Obama over the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, a strategy he took during last week's debate but ended up making headlines over mixing up a detail in the timeline. ""Or does he just put that aside, put those attacks aside and try to move on to some other issues where he has more of an advantage?"" Lizza said. New election lingo: from 'Obamaloney' to 'Romnesia' As for the president's challenge, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Obama will need to be ""defining the Middle East strategy going forward."" ""He's had some successes, he's had some things that are still pretty murky,"" Alterman said. Romney, on the other hand, has a broader challenge of laying out specific policies without upsetting the Republican base. ""The Republican Party hasn't really figured out what a Republican foreign policy looks like after the Bush administration,"" Alterman said. ""I think Romney has been uneager to really delve into that, but I think the challenge he will have on issue after issue is you have to get more specific."" Also developing on the international front, The New York Times reported Saturday cited an anonymous senior administration official saying the U.S. and Iran have agreed to take part in unprecedented, one-on-one talks over the country's nuclear program. The White House denied the report was true. Asked about Iran on Sunday, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio used an argument often made by Romney, saying the president failed to back the 2009 protest movement in Iran that the country's regime stifled with a violent crackdown. ""That set a tone where now Iran thinks they can go harder and faster than they could go. And today, they're closer than they've ever been to a nuclear capability,"" Rubio said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""That's very unfortunate."" Opinion: 'Iranians are trying to take advantage of our election cycle' But former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, also appearing on ""This Week,"" said that while he didn't know whether the reports of talks with Iran were true, the ""tables have been turned"" by Obama's approach. ""Three and a half years ago, the world was criticizing us on Iran. Today, the world is criticizing Iran on its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons. That's a direct change,"" he said.

"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- Barbara Harvey climbs into the back of her small Honda sport utility vehicle and snuggles with her two golden retrievers, her head nestled on a pillow propped against the driver's seat. Californian Barbara Harvey says she is forced to sleep in her car with her dogs after losing her job earlier this year. A former loan processor, the 67-year-old mother of three grown children said she never thought she'd spend her golden years sleeping in her car in a parking lot. ""This is my bed, my dogs,"" she said. ""This is my life in this car right now."" Harvey was forced into homelessness this year after being laid off. She said that three-quarters of her income went to paying rent in Santa Barbara, where the median house in the scenic oceanfront city costs more than $1 million. She lost her condo two months ago and had little savings as backup. ""It went to hell in a handbasket,"" she said. ""I didn't think this would happen to me. It's just something that I don't think that people think is going to happen to them, is what it amounts to. It happens very quickly, too."" Harvey now works part time for $8 an hour, and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet. But she still cannot afford an apartment, and so every night she pulls into a gated parking lot to sleep in her car, along with other women who find themselves in a similar predicament.  Watch women who live in their cars » . There are 12 parking lots across Santa Barbara that have been set up to accommodate the growing middle-class homelessness. These lots are believed to be part of the first program of its kind in the United States, according to organizers. The lots open at 7 p.m. and close at 7 a.m. and are run by New Beginnings Counseling Center, a homeless outreach organization. It is illegal for people in California to sleep in their cars on streets. New Beginnings worked with the city to allow the parking lots as a safe place for the homeless to sleep in their vehicles without being harassed by people on the streets or ticketed by police. Harvey stays at the city's only parking lot for women. ""This is very safe, and that's why I feel very comfortable,"" she said. Nancy Kapp, the New Beginnings parking lot coordinator, said the group began seeing a need for the lots in recent months as California's foreclosure crisis hit the city hard. She said a growing number of senior citizens, women and lower- and middle-class families live on the streets.  See how foreclosure filings are up 75 percent » . ""You look around today, and there are so many,"" said Kapp, who was homeless with her young daughter two decades ago. ""I see women sleeping on benches. It's heartbreaking."" She added, ""The way the economy is going, it's just amazing the people that are becoming homeless. It's hit the middle class."" She and others with New Beginnings walk the streets looking for people and families sleeping in their cars. The workers inform them about the parking lot program. New Beginnings screens people to make sure they won't cause trouble. No alcohol or drugs are allowed in the parking lots. ""What we are trying to do is we pull bad apples out, and we put good apples in the parking lots and really help people out,"" said Shaw Tolley, another coordinator with New Beginnings. Most of the time, the lots are transition points. New Beginnings works with each person to try to find a more permanent housing solution. ""It saddens me when they live in their vehicles,"" Tolley said. ""It is not the most ideal situation for senior citizens and families, but it is reality."" He added, ""We need to engage this problem. This is reality."" John Quigley, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said the California housing crisis has left many middle-class families temporarily homeless or forced them to go to food banks to feed their families. ""Part of the reason why it's so painful in Santa Barbara is, there's so little in the way of alternative housing,"" Quigley said. ""If there were alternative low and moderate housing and rental accommodations that were reasonably close by, you can imagine it wouldn't have this desperate look to it as people living in their cars."" At the only lot for women in Santa Barbara, it's a tough existence. There are no showers or running water. On the night CNN visited, a half-dozen women were in the parking lot before nightfall. Linn Labou, 54, lives in her car with four cats. She used to be in the National Guard and is on a waiting list for government housing, but the wait is a year long. ""I went looking for family, but I couldn't get them to help me,"" she said. As for Harvey, she begins each day by walking her two dogs before going to her part-time job. She leaves the dogs in her car with its windows cracked while she works. It's another chapter in her life that she's certain she'll get through. Her 19-year-old daughter moved in with friends to avoid being homeless. Her other children live overseas, and she didn't want to tell them about her living status. Even if her children offered to help, she said, she wouldn't accept it. ""They know me well enough to know that I will get through this."" ""My daughter especially is very unhappy. Sometimes she'll cry, and she'll call and say, 'Mom, I just can't stand it that you are living in a car,' "" Harvey said. ""I'll say, 'You know what? This is OK for right now, because I'm safe, I'm healthy, the dogs are doing OK, and I have a job, and things will get better.'

"(CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Sunday that Tony Blair and George W. Bush should be ""made to answer"" at the International Criminal Court for their actions around the Iraq war. Writing in an op-ed published by The Observer newspaper, the Nobel laureate accused the former leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States of fabricating a motive to invade Iraq, namely that it possessed weapons of mass destruction, and said that they had acted like ""playground bullies."" ""The immorality of the United States and Great Britain's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, premised on the lie that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, has destabilised and polarised the world to a greater extent than any other conflict in history,"" wrote Tutu. ""In a consistent world, those responsible for this suffering and loss of life should be treading the same path as some of their African and Asian peers who have been made to answer for their actions in the Hague."" Read Desmond Tutu's full op-ed piece . Tutu detailed some of the costs of the war. More than 110,000 Iraqis have died in the conflict, while millions have been displaced, he said. Close to 4,500 U.S. soldiers have been killed and more than 32,000 wounded, Tutu added. ""But even greater costs have been exacted beyond the killing fields, in the hardened hearts and minds of members of the human family across the world,"" he wrote. ""If it is acceptable for leaders to take drastic action on the basis of a lie, without an acknowledgement or an apology when they are found out, what should we teach our children?"" Last week, Tutu pulled out of a conference in Johannesburg to protest Blair's attendance. Read more about Tutu's withdrawal from conference . The former prime minister responded to the editorial in a statement on his website. ""I have a great respect for Archbishop Tutu's fight against apartheid -- where we were on the same side of the argument -- but to repeat the old canard that we lied about the intelligence is completely wrong as every single independent analysis of the evidence has shown,"" said Blair. He said Iraq has a stronger economy now and a lower child mortality rate, but added: ""Surely in a healthy democracy people can agree to disagree."" Groups have called for a citizen's arrest of Blair since he left office, with one website going as far as offering a reward to people who attempt to detain him. In 2010, protesters called for Blair to face war crimes charges as he gave evidence to the Iraq inquiry in London. Blair has said concern over Iraq's ambitions to develop weapons of mass destruction had been the main factor behind Britain's decision to back the war. No significant caches of chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq since the invasion.

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romanian President Traian Basescu will officially return to office after the country's top court ruled Tuesday that a referendum to remove him was invalid. The nation-wide impeachment effort last month had appeared to be heading for failure because turnout was below 50%. Prime Minister Victor Ponta made a last-ditch effort Monday to get the Constitutional Court to approve the referendum by submitting new voter lists, but the court said Tuesday the vote was not valid. Officials said after the referendum on July 29 that just over 46% of registered voters had cast ballots. Those who did cast ballots voted nearly 9 to 1 to impeach the president, the Central Election Bureau said. Ponta said Basescu ""should strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office."" Basescu had urged his supporters to boycott the polls, saying, ""The best help today is to stay home."" After the polls closed, he said voters had rejected a ""coup"" by Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. Basescu had been suspended since parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers. The legislature is dominated by Ponta's center-left USL party. Basescu said the austerity measures were needed to meet the terms of a $24 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for the cash-strapped country, but the move soured many Romanians on his leadership. Romanian president suspended . Opponents also accuse Basescu of cronyism. He took office eight years ago and has already survived one effort to remove him, in 2007. Ponta is dealing with his own controversy: He has been accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. He has dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. Romania's economy is starting to recover after two years of severe recession, but the International Monetary Fund recently said that ""a prolonged political crisis could hamper effective economic policy making, increase risk premiums and financing costs, further depreciate the exchange rate, and depress investment."" The power struggle is expected to continue in the following months, as Romania is holding parliamentary elections this fall.

"(CNN) -- When Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate, the media frenzy surrounding the announcement included claims that the choice was bad for women and that it would not attract women voters. Ryan's pro-life voting record was especially highlighted, and once again, the ""war on women"" came to the forefront and diverted attention from the ultimate women's issue in this election -- our dire economic future. It is misguided to think that women vote as a bloc. We are a diverse group, and it is nearly impossible for any candidate to appeal to all sides of the political spectrum. The reality is that women's top concerns are the same as men's, and like men, women are more likely to vote along party lines. U.S. Rep. Ryan's addition to the Republican ticket ensures that the debate about the economy will be vigorous. For women, and all Americans, nothing can be more important. Akin remark puts abortion at center of campaign debate . Women I know and talk to around the country are struggling with a new normal -- unemployment or underemployment, declining wages, having to work harder and longer to make ends meet, increasing food prices, rising gas prices and most of all the fear that their kids will have it even tougher than they do. They are making difficult decisions every day when it comes to their family budget. It is not a rosy picture. Why would Ryan appeal to women? A peek at his early life is illuminating. Ryan, who grew up the son of a lawyer, lost his father at 16 and was then raised by a single mother. He helped to care for a grandmother afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who lived with the family, worked after school at McDonald's to earn extra money and used some of his father's Social Security death benefits to help pay his way through school. I appreciate Ryan's personal experiences. Having lost my own mother to cancer at 3, I grew up with my father working two jobs and lived with my grandparents, who took care of us. I also used Social Security death benefits to help put myself through school and became the first in my family of immigrants to go to college. The Ryan family, like many families in America today, was not immune to experiencing a period of uncertainty. Ryan says this formative period in his life shaped his attitude about self-reliance -- it never occurred to him that his life would not get better. At an event in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday he reminded the audience that aspirations are at the heart of the American Dream. Over the past week, we have learned a lot more about Ryan's own path and his career in Washington as a budget wonk, rising to become the youngest chairman of the House Budget Committee. There are many voices in Washington, but few have the depth and knowledge about the $16 trillion national debt and its crippling effect on the country and the aspirations of future generations. I find it reassuring that Romney made the choice to select Paul Ryan. Ryan has distinguished himself by having the courage to offer big ideas and he is forcing a serious discussion about how to reform entitlements. He deserves credit for talking tough and leveling with the American people about what's involved in changing the course of our current predicament. Opinion: Rape can make you pregnant. Period. We all know President Barack Obama walked into a very dire economic situation when he came to office, but over the past few years, his policy of growing the government has not put the nation back to work. The poverty rate of women, for example, has climbed to its highest level in nearly two decades and doubts about providing for their families have not been alleviated. American women have to ask themselves if they want a federal government that respects their hard-earned dollars as much as it respects their right to choose. When they do, I am confident they will not be distracted by media hype and attack ads painting Ryan as hostile to women's concerns; rather, they will find his efforts to stop the buck from being passed to another generation very appealing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anita McBride.","Some think the choice of Paul Ryan as vice presidential nominee would turn off women .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is retraining some workers after allegations of racial profiling by officers assigned to look for people behaving suspiciously, a spokesman said. The classes come after agents at Boston's Logan International Airport said fellow employees in the agency's behavior detection program were targeting minorities for questioning based on their race or ethnicity. Some Boston officers have complained to the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ACLU attorney Sarah Wunsch, who has spoken with 10 officers accusing their colleagues of racial profiling, told CNN that officers were targeting racial and ethnic groups -- including Mexicans, African-Americans and Brazilians -- for secondary screening. The claims, first reported in The New York Times earlier this month, prompted the TSA to open an internal investigation. Now behavior detection officers nationwide will take an ""online learning center refresher course to reinforce that racial/ethnic profiling will not be tolerated,"" TSA spokesman David Castelveter said. TSA says it focuses on security, not good looks . A class called Combating Racial/Ethnic/Religious Profiling is being provided to behavior detection officers and managers at Boston and Detroit airports, where similar intensive programs are in place. Classroom training includes a four-hour session where problems created by profiling will be discussed. Trainees will participate in scenarios designed to emphasize programs method, including relying on behaviors only, using an environmental baseline, using techniques supported by science, and using a partner to monitor for and verify that no racial/or ethnic/religious profiling is going on. ""TSA's behavior detection program is a critical part of our approach to securing travel, but profiling passengers on any basis is simply not tolerated,"" Castelveter said. ""Profiling is not only discriminatory, it is also an ineffective way to identify someone's intent on doing harm. Officers are trained and audited to look for observable behaviors and behaviors alone."" Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi has called for the TSA to suspend the behavioral screening program and requested a congressional hearing. Thompson is the ranking Democrat on the House committee on homeland security. Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, a top Democrat on the House oversight and investigation subcommittee for homeland security, has also called for a probe. ""These allegations have more weight because they come from people who are knowledgeable about the requirements and training and see something going wrong in the screening process,"" Keating said.

"(CNN) -- At least two tornadoes struck Wednesday near Flagstaff, Arizona, injuring seven people, derailing a train and damaging more than 100 homes, authorities said. One tornado caused ""about a mile of destruction,"" said Sheriff Bill Pribil of Coconino County. It damaged at least 30 mobile homes, blew the windows out of about 100 homes and caused a train derailment, he said. At least seven people were injured, the National Weather Service's Flagstaff office said. None of the injuries in Coconino County were believed to be serious, Pribil said. Both tornadoes touched down in the town of Bellemont, the National Weather Service reported. See video footage of the damage in Bellemont . Lena Kent, spokeswoman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, said 28 train cars were derailed and that the track itself suffered minor damages. ""It was stopped (in Bellemont) because of the tornado warning, but unfortunately, the tornado came through and actually hit the train, derailing 28 cars,"" she said. No one was injured in the derailment, she said. The company hoped to get the rail lines reopened by midnight. Radar continued to show several thunderstorms in central and north-central Arizona capable of producing tornadoes with little or no advance notice, CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris said.

"London, England (CNN) -- A British aid worker held hostage in eastern Afghanistan since late last month was killed by her captors during a rescue attempt on Friday night, officials said. The woman was identified as Linda Norgrove, who worked for DAI -- an agency that provides various services to developing nations. Norgrove, who was age 36, spent much of her career managing projects for farmers and rural workers. James Boomgard, DAI president and chief executive officer, called the news ""devastating"" and said his operation is ""saddened beyond words by the death of a wonderful woman whose sole purpose in Afghanistan was to do good."". ""Linda loved Afghanistan and cared deeply for its people, and she was deeply committed to her development mission. She was an inspiration to many of us here at DAI and she will be deeply missed."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement that Norgrove ""was doing valuable work for the Afghan people."" ""Decisions on operations to free hostages are always difficult. But where a British life is in such danger, and where we and our allies can act, I believe it is right to try. I pay tribute to the courage and skill of all those involved in this effort,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a written statement that his forces received information about where she was held and ""decided that, given the danger she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on that information,"" ""Responsibility for this tragic outcome rests squarely with the hostage takers. From the moment they took her, her life was under grave threat. Given who held her, and the danger she was in, we judged that Linda's best chance lay in attempting to rescue her."" Norgrove was being held by two Taliban commanders, Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan, who were both killed in the raid, an Afghan intelligence official said. An Afghan official said last month that the British woman, two Afghan drivers and a security guard had been kidnapped after an exchange of gunfire September 26 in the Chawkay district of eastern Kunar province. Abdul Marjan Adel, a local provincial official, had said that the four were being held in a ""very remote area,"" and that Afghan and international forces were looking for them. He said they were healthy and located in the Dewcar valley. Provincial officials had created a council of district elders, religious scholars and provincial council members to negotiate with the abductors, he said. The three Afghans kidnapped with Norgrove had been released days ago, according to another Afghan intelligence official and a local provincial government official. Hague expressed his gratitude to NATO allies and Afghan forces ""for doing all they could to secure the safe release of the woman."" ""Hostage taking is never justified and the UK does not make concessions to hostage-takers. But whenever British nationals are kidnapped, we and our allies will do everything in our power to free them,"" he said. DAI said Norgrove worked in projects around the world, including Afghanistan, Laos, Mexico, Uganda, and Peru, and was involved in projects for the United Nations. She joined DAI in January and has been a senior manager on a program to create jobs, improve local economies and help local leaders ""reduce reliance on the opium economy,"" the group said in a statement. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the ISAF commander passed along his condolences. ""Afghan and coalition security forces did everything in their power to rescue Linda,"" Petraeus said. ""Linda was a courageous person with a passion to improve the lives of Afghan people, and sadly she lost her life in their service. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time."" Last year, British troops freed New York Times journalist Stephen Farrell from Taliban captivity in a raid but his interpreter, Sultan Munadi, died in the rescue effort. A British commando was also killed, as were a woman and child. Security forces in Afghanistan this week captured a Taliban leader who was ""directly involved"" in the kidnapping, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said.

"(EW) -- The third season premiere of a basic cable zombie drama just delivered a bigger rating in the adult demo than any entertainment series this fall — including all broadcast shows. Sunday night's third season premiere of ""The Walking Dead"" delivered a huge 10.9 million viewers for its first telecast. But what's really impressive is the show's adults 18-49 demo rating of a 5.8. That's stunning. The closest broadcast entertainment programs has gotten this fall to that number is ABC's ""Modern Family"" season premiere that pulled a 5.5 (all these are apples-to-apples next-day ratings, not including DVR). Football has delivered bigger numbers, but that's sports and we're talking entertainment programming. And AMC accomplished this rating with an extra disadvantage — not having a major distributor, Dish Network, on board due to its carriage contract dispute (imagine how many more viewers the episode might have had with Dish on board). You know, aside from AMC's other major disadvantage being a pay cable network that's only available to a fraction of U.S. households compared to the Big Four broadcasters. 'SNL': Christina Applegate hits right notes . ""The Walking Dead"" was already the the most successful basic cable drama of all time in the adult demo. Last night was up more than 50 percent from season two. And if you include ""The Walking Dead's"" encore telecast in the mix — which is a common habit for cable networks when touting their ratings — the total viewer number rises to 15.2 million. Sure, it's two airings, but still ... that's edging into NCIS territory. This hasn't been a great fall for broadcast so far. Three of the four major networks are down compared to last fall, with NBC — aided by ""The Voice"" — rising somewhat. For a cable show to come along and prove that getting a huge rating in the valuable adult demo for a third-year show is still very possible must give pause. Broadcasters, after all, turned down ""The Walking Dead."" As the show's writer Robert Kirkman told EW.com: ""There definitely was resistance to dive into the genre. [Network executives] were like, 'I don't know if we want dead people eating people on our network.' That makes sense."" 'Walking Dead' revived! Ken Tucker's take . Interestingly, the biggest new drama of the fall is NBC's ""Revolution,"" which as I've pointed out, plays a bit like ""The Walking Dead"" without zombies (or people eating people). Last night's premiere will probably be remembered as the hour that set a record for zombie killing. How many was that? Seventy? Eighty? After last season's fan complaint of too much farm chatting and not enough zombie killing, the third season premiere's orgy of kill-shots surely satisfied fan blood lust (though left me wanting an Xbox controller in my hands).

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney seemed to channel his inner CEO on Thursday when he sketched out a chart on entitlements on a whiteboard. There he stood, hair slicked down, white shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, listing differences between his and President Barack Obama's Medicare plans. If the scene seemed better suited to a corporate boardroom than the campaign trail, it is because the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is far more comfortable throwing out ideas than with having them challenged, experts say. ""It speaks to some of the issues he's been having,"" said Trevor Parry-Giles, a political communication professor at the University of Maryland. ""There are a number of ways in which businesses operate that are not analogous to the campaign context."" The challenge for Romney is making the case to voters that his business acumen is exactly the skill set needed to pull the country out of its economic slump. ""That's what he needs to sell the public so the public can be comfortable with a President Romney,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. So far, it is an effort that has met with mixed results. In a CNN/ORC International poll of likely voters released last week, 45% of those polled said that the economy would get better if Romney were elected -- two percentage points below Obama's number. Considering Romney's success as a business leader and the poor state of the economy, Romney should have higher poll numbers, CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said recently. Then there was Romney's impromptu news conference on Thursday on Medicare which steered off course from the economy, arguably a topic that should be Romney's strong suit. The candidate found himself once again discussing his taxes in an attempt to put to rest previous questions by reporters on whether he would re-examine his returns. ""I did go back and look at my taxes and over the past ten years. I never paid less than 13%. I think the most recent year is 13.6 or something like that. I paid taxes every single year,"" Romney said in a response aimed at quelling criticism from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that the former Massachusetts governor did not pay taxes for a decade. At times on the trail, Romney has appeared frustrated with constant questions about his taxes and calls for him to release more returns. That type of umbrage could speak to Romney's discomfort in such a public sphere, Parry-Giles said. Romney is a Harvard law and Business School graduate and led Boston's Bain Capital, a private equity firm. He served one term as governor, the only public office he has held. As someone who has spent most of his life in the private sector, constant questions about tax returns could feel like an invasion of privacy. Questions about his taxes ""do seem small-minded to someone with his worldview,"" Parry-Giles said. ""His personal communication style comes out of that (business) background. To be relentlessly asked about those questions is probably bothersome."" Tom Smith, an assistant finance professor at Emory University put it more bluntly. ""That is somebody who is used standing in front of a boardroom and not being challenged. 'I don't have to provide you evidence, that's beneath me',"" he said of Romney's attitude on releasing more tax returns. However, there are areas where Romney's business background has helped him steer clear of potential political pitfalls. His search for a running mate was handled with corporate-like precision. Conversations about who topped the list were treated as trade secrets. Documents about the search were kept in a safe and the selection process was only discussed among key people who sat in a room at campaign headquarters. Romney was also reportedly very methodical in his process. He solicited the advice of trusted advisers, carefully weighed his decision and then unveiled his choice in a showy roll out worthy of a brand launch. Romney's chief executive background was evident in his choice of Wisconsin Republican and conservative budget hawk Rep. Paul Ryan as a running mate, Smith said . Smith said Romney likely reasoned ""'People are already basing their opinions on me based on what I have or have not said, but if I choose a good number two then I look more like a good boss',"" Smith said. ""A good CEO would choose managers around them that would challenge them in order to make the whole company better."" Ryan and Romney's budget plans diverge in the level of detail â€” Ryan's has more in the way of specifics â€” and offering a time line of when the federal budget would balance. Romney acknowledged the differences and suggested room to use his running mate's ideas to help make his own plans stronger. ""I'm sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we're on the same page as I said before,"" Romney said on the trail on Monday. ""We'll look at the differences. Well, the items we agree on I think outweigh any differences there may be. We haven't gone through piece by piece. ... I can't imagine any two people even in the same party who have exactly the same positions on all issues."" Romney's CEO background will also help him in other ways. Some people erroneously think that the government can be run like a corporation and will give Romney greater benefit of the doubt on his ability to right the economy because he was a CEO, Smith said. He'll also benefit from a cultural tradition of not questioning the boss. ""Because he is a CEO there is a large share of people who are willing to just give him a pass,"" Smith said. But government doesn't function like a board of directors meeting, Smith said. As president, Romney would have to contend with Congress and all of the checks and balances that come with governing. ""You can't exactly have an executive president,"" Smith said. ""What a CEO might bring to the Oval Office gets eliminated immediately because you can't have that kind of power."" During the upcoming nominating convention and debates Romney will have to prove to the broader electorate that he has the ability to not only run a successful business but also successfully run the country, political experts say. Romney's ready for the challenge, said Keith Appell, a Republican strategist and senior vice president at CRC Public Relations. ""A CEO delegates a lot,"" Appell said, noting that Romney has been out in front during the campaign and taking the tough questions. As president, Appell said he could see him running the government like a CEO and delegating offices and responsibilities .","Mitt Romney's experience as a CEO both helps and hurts his campaign .
Political experts say Romney seems unused to tough tax questions .
Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as a veep was a solid CEO-worthy move .
