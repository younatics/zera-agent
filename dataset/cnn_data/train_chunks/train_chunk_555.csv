It might look small and insignificant but the dung beetle has its sights set firmly on the stars. The beetle is the first insect proven to use the light of the Milky Way to help steer its course. Also known as the scarab, the tiny creatures feed on animal droppings, which they fashion into a ball and roll away to a safe spot where it is less likely to be stolen. Expert navigator: New research has found that scarabs - also known as dung beetles - find their way through their desert habitat by using the stars of the Milky Way as a reference . Although their eyes are too weak to . distinguish individual constellations, scientists found they used the . glow of the Milky Way to navigate in a straight line, ensuring they do . not circle back to the dung-heap and potential competitors. 'Even on clear, moonless nights, many dung beetles still manage to orientate along straight paths,' said Dr Marie Dacke from Lund University in Sweden. 'This led us to suspect that the beetles exploit the starry sky for orientation - a feat that had, to our knowledge, never before been demonstrated in an insect.' Field experiments on a South African game reserve showed that the beetles were able to roll their dung balls along straight paths under starlit skies, but not in overcast conditions. A species of South African dung beetle used in the experiment, wearing a cardboard mask to block its view of the sky . The lighter band of the Milky Way's edge: While unable to pick out constellations, the scarabs could detect the light arcing over their heads . For the tests, the beetles were fitted with tiny cardboard caps to alter their field of vision. They were placed in a circular arena surrounded by a metre-high black cloth, making it impossible for them to see landmarks. With no moon, it took much less time for the beetles to roll a dung ball from the centre of the arena to the edge when they were able to see the sky. When they could not look up, the time taken increased from 40 seconds to 124 as they wandered aimlessly around. The experiment was repeated in a Johannesburg planetarium, with similar results. The beetles performed equally well under a full sky of stars, and when only the glow of the Milky Way was visible. Most . stars would be too dim for the beetles’ tiny compound eyes to see, said . the researchers. While unable to pick out constellations, the scarabs . could detect the light of the Milky Way arcing over their heads. 'This . finding represents the first convincing demonstration for the use of . the starry sky for orientation in insects and provides the first . documented use of the Milky Way for orientation in the animal kingdom,' the researchers wrote in the journal Current Biology. Previously only birds, seals and humans were known to navigate by the stars. Dung beetles also use the sun and moon as compass cues, said the scientists. They . added: 'Although this is the first description of an insect using the . Milky Way for their orientation, this ability might turn out to be . widespread in the animal kingdom.'","The scarab uses the light of the Milky Way to keep a straight course .
They do so to avoid rolling their balls of dung in a circle - which might bring them into contact with rivals who want to steal it ."

But for Hugo Tornqvist, it can trigger a sequence of events that could kill him. The two-year-old was born with  a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily, at the slightest bump. Called Junctional Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa, it is so serious that doctors wanted he wouldn't live to be more than eight months old. Hugo Tornqvist, with father Magnus, was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily, at the slightest bump . When he was born, doctors predicted that Hugo (here with mother Hanna) now, two, wouldn't live past eight months . But Hugo, who lives just outside Karlskrona in Sweden with his mother Hanna and her . partner Magnus, has defied the odds and is still fighting on. The only exterior sign of Hugo's condition is his extremely sensitive skin, with the slightest bump causing it to peel off. His entire body, both inside and out, is covered in sores and blisters. The condition also has other unforeseen and serious implications, including respiratory problems that can cause Hugo's airways to close suddenly and without warning. Last summer he had to be hospitalised . due to severe breathing problems and on another occasion his eyes were . totally swollen shut for three weeks. Hugo's condition makes his skin so sensitive, that the slightest bump can cause it to peel off . The condition also has other unforeseen and serious implications, including respiratory problems that can cause Hugo's airways to close suddenly and without warning . But his body has battled back . each time and, while at one point 70 per cent of his body was covered in . blisters, today this is closer to 15 per cent. Hugo has also developed at a normal pace despite his poor immune system and the fact he has to be fed through a tube in his belly button due to scarring of the pharynx. The family live in a specially adapted house where everything, including the floor of Hugo's bedroom, is carefully padded to avoid damage to his skin. Meanwhile, he is not allowed to . interact with children his own age and Hanna's other two children can . only stay every other weekend to limit his exposure to childhood . illnesses. His mother said: 'We feel pleasure every morning Hugo opens his eyes but we only ever plan two days ahead. 'He never complains, but is a rewarding little guy.' Hugo's disease is so rare that doctors have few answers to the family's questions. The family live in a specially adapted house where everything, including the floor of Hugo's bedroom, is carefully padded to avoid damage to his skin . While at one point 70 per cent of his body was covered in blisters, today this is closer to 15 per cent . His parents have also faced difficulties with their insurance company regarding the cost of Hugo's medical care. His mother said: 'Now we have the full support but in the beginning it was terrible. I hope we have taken the fight for future families.' Doctors are unable to say what Hugo's life expectancy is, as most people with the same condition rarely live past infancy. His mother said: 'The only thing we can hope is that his breathing will be better, that the airways grow the older he gets.' And despite the hardships he faces, she says Hugo has taught her a lesson. She said: 'You can get one or the other in life, but it does not mean that you give up. She adds: 'It's not bandages and gloves Hugo is wearing. It's sweatband and boxing gloves, because we're gonna beat the s*** out of this disease.' Herlitz JEB causes widespread blistering of both the skin and the mucus membranes. Areas of the body affected by blistering and chronic ulcers include the eyes, inside the mouth and throat and the toes and neck. Because the blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract,  it can make it difficult to eat and digest food. As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition and slow growth. Because of these complications, the outlook for children with Hugo's condition is very poor. Around 40 per cent of children with the condition die during their first year of life and almost all by the age of five. Sepsis and respiratory failure (due to blistering and narrowing of the airways) are the most common causes of death. Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia).","Hugo Tornqvist, 2, has rare genetic disorder that makes his skin very fragile .

Torment: Michael Barrymore says his TV personality is dead after years of being harangued by the press and he now wishes to be known as Michael Parker . Disgraced television entertainer Michael Barrymore has ‘killed’ his stage persona – after suffering a decade of torment since a man was found dead in his swimming pool. The recovering alcoholic has revealed he now wishes to be known as Michael Parker and admits he came close to taking his own life. Barrymore, whose TV programmes Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People were watched weekly by millions in the Eighties and Nineties, claims he was ‘framed for murder’ by the media over the incident. Barrymore said: ‘The press killed Michael Barrymore. My real name is Michael Parker – Michael Barrymore is dead. Although I have been a couple of times to the jumping-off point, I didn’t kill myself. If I had, it would have completed the story. ‘I don’t have to be Michael Barrymore – he’s dead. I don’t have to do what I’ve been doing since I was eight, which is making people laugh to deflect things. It’s the first time I’ve ever got to know me and I was 60 in May.’ He blamed ‘a conspiracy’ for destroying his TV career and spoke of his regrets over the way he treated his wife Cheryl following his decision to come out as homosexual. Barrymore said: ‘It smacks me that there was a definite conspiracy to destroy  ITV’s main brand at the time: “We want to get rid of anything that works for them.” ‘I never shy away from the fact that I’m an alcoholic and that I have had my problems, but I’ve never murdered anybody. I’ve never got up in the morning and thought I’ll harm someone. I’ve just had an extraordinary sequence of events that have been on public display that I’ve had no control over.’ His fall from grace began in 1995 when he announced ‘I’m gay’ from the stage of an East End pub. Three years later, he and wife Cheryl, who was also his long- serving manager, divorced. Framed: Barrymore claims he was ¿framed for murder¿ by the media after a man was found dead in his pool 2001 . Downfall: The TV star was hugely popular with British audiences during the eighties and nineties until a string of incidents blackened his name . In an interview with The Independent, Barrymore said: ‘Nobody’s written a book on how to handle fame, or the downside of it. We loved each other. I loved her, and she loved me too much.’ After the break-up, he descended into a public spiral of drink and drug abuse. The day after his divorce was confirmed, he was accused of a serious sexual assault in a Soho nightclub. But the police found the claims were unfounded and a national newspaper later paid him substantial damages. Then, in March 2001, Barrymore became the subject of a murder investigation after the body of 31-year-old Stuart Lubbock was found in the swimming pool in the grounds of his £2 million mansion in Essex. Ecstasy and cocaine were found in Lubbock’s blood – but more scandalous were internal injuries suggesting he was the victim of a sexual assault before his death. An inquest returned an open verdict in 2003 and police never charged Barrymore or anyone else with murder. Barrymore said: ‘It was just a party that went disastrously wrong, with a tragic ending. I’ve basically been framed for a murder – one that didn’t take place. ‘I’m just pleased that I’ve survived and that I have got a peaceful enough place to be able to deal  with everything.’","Former TV star says he has 'killed' stage persona after decade of torment .

A man has been jailed for helping a murderer to try and flee the country after he killed two teenage girls in horrific knife attacks. Steven Harratt, 57, gave Ahmad Otak money, clothing, food and a sat-nav so he could drive to  Dover where he could get a ferry to France after he murdered 17-year-old Kimberley Frank and 18-year-old Samantha Sykes. Ahmad Otak has been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years in prison after he stabbed his 19-year-old girlfriend Elisa Frank’s younger sister Kimberley to death in a flat March last year. Jailed: Steven Harratt, pictured left, has been sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for assisting murderer Ahmad Otak, pictured right, by providing him with money, food and a sat-nav to help him flee the country after he stabbed two teenage girls to death . The murderer then forced his girlfriend to lure 18-year-old Samantha Sykes to the flat in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where he stabbed her. A court heard Otak then asked for Harratt's help, saying he 'had a problem' but didn't tell him about the murders. It was then that Harratt provided Otak with money, food and the sat-nav to make the trip to Dover. The court was told that Harratt saw Otak was brandishing a knife and had bound Elisa's feet together before driving off with her in his car. Steven Harratt, 57, denied assisting the offender but was found guilty by a jury at Leeds Crown Court last month and was today jailed for two years and nine months. Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told him: 'I sentence you on the basis, as the jury must have found, that you believed [Otak] had committed at least one serious offence of violence. 'I’m satisfied from the evidence I have heard that you knew it was particularly serious because you know at one stage that Elisa Frank had her legs bound and that Mr Otak had on his knee a knife.' 'Sadistic': Afghan asylum-seeker Ahmad Otak will serve a minimum of 34 years for the murders of Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes . Teenage victims: Samantha Sykes (left), 18, and Kimberley Frank (right), 17, were stabbed repeatedly by Afghan national Ahmad Otak at Kimberley's Wakefield flat . The judge described: 'In March last year Ahmad Otak murdered the sister of his then girlfriend. He did that in his then girlfriend’s presence. He then forced Elisa Frank to lure her friend and again in her presence murdered the friend. 'The evidence clearly shows that after, he had determined to flee the country in an effort to avoid arrest. 'He took Elisa Frank against her will, binding her and carrying with him a knife, and they drove to your house. 'The prosecution do not allege and I do not sentence you on the basis that you know that Ahmad Otak had committed two murders. 'Had you know of the murders the sentence would have been significantly longer. 'I sentenced you on the basis, as the . jury must have found, that you believed he had committed at least a . serious offence of violence. 'You provided him with food, with money, clothing and you went out and bought him a satellite navigation device. 'Horrific': Otak, left, stabbed Kimberley Frank . (right with her sister Elisa Frank) to death at her home in Wakefield . while her sister watched helplessly . Scene: The bodies of murdered teenagers Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes were found at Miss Frank's flat in Wakefield . 'You gave him some advice, I’m satisfied, as to the method by which he might flee the country on a ferry. 'Once he had left your house there was some contact between you.' During the course of the four-day trial, the jury heard distressing evidence from Elisa, who told how she watched Otak spit on her sister Kimberley’s body before making her lure friend Samantha to the flat - and brutally knifing her as well. After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Atkinson, who led the enquiry to convict Otak and Harratt, said: 'We welcome the sentence of Steven Harratt today. 'Clearly the court have concluded that he assisted Ahmad Otak following the murder of Kimberley Frank and Sammy Sykes and in in doing so aided him in both escaping from West Yorkshire and evading the police. 'Fortunately however we were able to apprehend Otak before he managed to flee the country to make him answer for truly brutal and horrific crimes. 'I know the pain and suffering the families of Kimberley and Sammy have endured has been immense but I hope the conviction of Harratt today will at least bring them some closure now that the legal process has concluded.'","Steven Harratt, 57, jailed for assisting Ahmad Otak after he killed two teens .

Thousands of NHS patients could . be secretly monitored by the Government for symptoms of the human form of mad . cow disease amid concerns that there could be another wave of infections. Experts advising the Department . of Health believe patients who have received more than 80 blood transfusions . are most at risk of developing the fatal brain disease because it can be passed . on through infected blood. They say monitoring these . patients could give vital clues about the way the disease develops and is . transmitted from person to person and could help work out whether there are . likely to be further deaths. Thousands of NHS patients could be secretly monitored by the Government for symptoms of the human form of mad cow disease amid concerns that there could be another wave of infections . It could also inform officials whether the risk . from blood donations needs to be treated more seriously. But they are considering . conducting their surveillance secretly because they fear that informing . patients they are at risk and are being monitored will cause unnecessary alarm. The proposals have been . discussed by a powerful panel of leading scientists and doctors, which advises . the Government on the disease, known as variant CJD. The panel's report, published . online, suggests conducting 'covert health surveillance' of around 30,000 . patients known to have received a high number of blood transfusions. Experts would expect to see at . least 150 cases of vCJD in this group of patients, based on scientific evidence . that between one in 4,000 and one in 20,000 of the population may be infected. Experts believe patients who have received more than 80 blood transfusions are most at risk of developing the fatal brain disease as it can be passed on through infected blood . But this has so far not been . seen and may either mean the risk is lower than previously thought, or that it . is taking longer for cases to develop. The 'highly transfused' group . includes people suffering life-threatening illnesses including acute leukaemia, . aplastic anaemia and the blood disorder thalassemia - as well as those with . multiple injuries due to road accidents, or heavy blood loss from aneurysms. The report acknowledges that . following patients without their consent is 'ethically problematic'. But the panel, a subcommittee . of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, has asked the Health . Protection Agency to set out the various options for monitoring these patients . based on seeking their consent or not. Chris James, chief executive of . the Haemophilia Society, said: 'We are shocked to learn there was ever any . suggestion of non-consensual monitoring. 'Given the history of contaminated . blood in the 1970s and 1980s, the maintenance of medical ethics is especially . important to the haemophilia community. 'Any proposed framework must be . reviewed by an ethics committee and open to challenge from individuals and . organisations such as ourselves through a formal consultation process.' Latest official figures show . seven NHS patients have died from vCJD after having blood transfusions. Four are known to have been . given blood from people who were infected with fatal vCJD, and the other three . had previously had transfusions although it is not known whether the blood was . contaminated. Since the first vCJD cases . emerged in the mid-1990s, 175 people in Britain have died from the brain . wasting disease, which is linked to eating beef infected with BSE. Experts predicted that hundreds . more could die after receiving blood infected with the disease. But they now . admit they are baffled as to why these cases have failed to emerge. One theory is that some people . have a genetic advantage and may only carry the disease without developing . symptoms. However, they can still infect others if they give blood. In one case, a patient is known . to have been exposed to vCJD in a blood transfusion and is still alive 24 years . later. A memorial plaque to victims of Human BSE on the Riverside Walk near Westminster Bridge, London . At the moment, patients are . only informed that they are at increased risk of developing vCJD if they have . been exposed to blood from more than 80 donors and if they are about to have . brain, spinal or complex eye surgery. But this threshold may now be . raised to only inform patients if they are exposed to 300 or more blood donors . because the lack of vCJD cases so far may indicate that the risk of catching . vCJD in blood may be lower than previously suspected. Judy Kenny, of the CJD Support . Network, whose husband Deryck died aged 69 in 2003 after being given contaminated . blood, said: 'If the authorities are going to do any monitoring, patients should . be aware of it. 'There is no grey area - if they are thinking about unconsented . monitoring, then it is wrong.' CJD occurs when nerve-tissue proteins called prions (illustration above) turn 'bad' and gradually destroy the brain . Professor Chris Bunce, science . director of charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, said: 'The extent of the . risk [of vCJD] to patients who receive regular blood transfusions as part of . their treatment is as yet uncertain. 'One way to ascertain the risk would . be to monitor the distribution of the pathogen among people in this group.

A grandmother who fraudulently tried to claim £740,000 after tripping in the street now faces charges for contempt of court. Jamaican-born Barbara Fari, 59, sued Haringey Council in . North London after the incident in May 2008. She claimed the injury . to her right knee was so severe she could only move around her home in Haringey, North London, by 'sliding on my buttocks'. Mother-of-13 Barbara Fari tried to sue Haringey Council in North London, pictured, after she trip on an uneven paving stone outside her house and injured her knee . But video evidence contradicted her case and her claim was struck out at a county court last year after a judge found the mother-of-13 had grossly exaggerated her injury. Now a High Court judge has agreed that Homes for Haringey, which runs Haringey Council housing stock and maintains the pavement outside her home, can prosecute Mrs Fari for contempt of court. Her husband, Piper Fari, who gave evidence to back her false claim, will also be prosecuted. They both face a jail sentence if convicted. A statement released by Homes for Haringey's legal team revealed one of their lawyers had won permission from Mr Justice Holroyde to pursue contempt proceedings against the couple. It said Ms Fari's case was the first of its kind since a landmark ruling in June last year made it possible to take action over alleged fraudulent exaggeration in personal injury cases. The statement added: 'The application will proceed to a final hearing later in the year.' It is understood that prosecutions of this kind are intended to counter the 'compensation culture' to deter people from exaggerating their claim. Court case: The Central London county court threw out Ms Fari's claim - deciding she had grossly exaggerated her injury . Mr Justice Holroyde said that the case was prompted by surveillance videos which showed Ms Fari 'using stairs without assistance' and 'carrying her shopping bags without difficulty'. This was an 'extraordinary divergence from the picture painted' by Ms Fari and her husband, he said. They had claimed that she needed care for 10 to 16 hours a day, was only able to climb stairs by 'shuffling on her buttocks', and was no longer able to care for her children and grandchildren. The judge said that, although Ms Fari and her husband claimed previous publicity of her case had caused her 'embarrassment', there was a 'strong public interest in pursuing false claims' and that a contempt prosecution was justified. Last October, Judge Christopher Mitchell at Central London county court struck out her compensation claim altogether after deciding Ms Fari, who has 14 grandchildren, had grossly exaggerated her case. Haringey Council had admitted liability, but the issue went to trial after Ms Fari rejected their initial offer of a £7,500 settlement. The judge reached his decision in October after video evidence found that Ms Fari had a pre-existing deformity in her right knee and that she had exaggerated the extent of her injuries received in the fall. Judge Mitchell said the injury would have resulted in two to three months of discomfort and was worth no more than £1,500. Jennifer Harris, from Homes for Haringey, welcomed the decision. She said: 'Ms Fari grossly exaggerated the extent of her injuries.'","Barbara Fari made the claim after tripping on an uneven paving stone in 2008 .

The intervention by the multi-millionaire  – who owns British newspapers the Daily Express and Daily Star – came as St James’s Palace reacted with fury to the news, saying: ‘There can be no motivation for this action other than greed.’ A source close to Mr Desmond said last night: ‘When he found out what had been printed he was absolutely astonished. Immediate steps were taken to establish  who had made the decision, which all the company absolutely disagrees with. ‘Northern & Shell will now seek to have no further involvement with the joint venture that produces the newspaper.’ Insiders confirmed that the Irish Daily Star would face an uncertain future  without Mr Desmond’s backing, although Independent News & Media is expected to continue to support the title.

Jailed: Tracy Barker, 32, was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison at Cannock Magistrates Court for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal . A mother who suffocated her family's dog with a plastic bag because she could not afford to feed it has been jailed. Tracy Barker, 32, received an 18-week prison sentence after horrified RSPCA inspectors found the emaciated body of German Shepherd Milo stuffed into a wheelie bin outside her home. A court heard that unemployed Barker refused to spend any of her benefits on food for the dog - and instead locked him outside and ignored his pleas to be fed. She starved the dog for weeks before finally wrapping a carrier bag around his head and holding his jaw shut until he stopped breathing. Cannock Magistrates Court heard RSPCA inspectors were called to Barker's home in Blythe Bridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, following complaints from neighbours about dog mess in June last year. When they asked where her dog was, she broke down, confessed what she had done and led the team to Milo's body. The German Shepherd was found stuffed inside a black bin liner with the carrier bag Barker had used to kill him still tied around his head. Kevin Worthington, prosecuting, told the court on Wednesday that Barker had placed a carrier bag around Milo's head and held its mouth shut until he died last June. He said: 'The dog used to live in the house but the defendant claimed she did not have the money to feed him and it got to the point where she moved the animal outside, where it became more ill. 'The dog would have suffered physical feelings of hunger, lethargy along with being psychologically disturbed. 'It was used to being fed daily and it was placed outside, hungry and whimpering. It would have suffered serious trauma - this is a serious offence.' Barker pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Her solicitor told the court that Barker had not been able to stretch her benefits to feed her family and the dog. Lucy Taylor-Grime, defending, said: 'She is disgusted by her actions and regrets what has happened. 'She was trying to run a family home on benefits and cope with an animal - which is no excuse. 'Money was tight and she did not know where to turn to also deal with her depression. 'She got herself in such a mess and it went too far and she didn't put her hand up and say ""help me"".' Inspector Natalie Perehovsky, from the RSPCA's North Staffordshire branch described the case as 'one of the most disgusting' she had ever seen. She said: 'Seeing an animal with the bag still tied around its head was upsetting. Her actions were disturbing in the way she had the determination to suffocate. 'I am pleased with the sentence and the ban. It sends out a message that killing an animal is taking a life.' Barker was also banned from keeping animals for 30 years with no chance to appeal. An application from the RSPCA for £1,908 in vet's costs was rejected because Barker was jailed.

An artistic director who had acid thrown in his face outside his Moscow home may have staged the attack himself, his colleagues have alleged. Artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet Sergei Filin, 42, nearly lost his sight after suffering third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack two weeks ago. But dancers and staff at the Bolshoi Theatre have claimed Filin may have staged the attack himself. Acid attack victim: Artistic director . of the Bolshoi Ballet Sergei Filin, 42, is pictured left being . interviewed from a Moscow hospital where he was treated after a masked man threw acid in his face outside his home . Anastasia Meskova, a Bolshoi ballerina, told the Financial Times: 'It is an absurdity - such an insane idea. 'But I understand where it is coming from, because, truly, you throw up your hands; you just can't explain it. 'You think ""maybe this? But of course not! Maybe that? Of course not!""' The latest allegations come amid talk of infighting, backstabbing, soaring egos and constant rows between the key players at the theatre. Prestigious career: Sergei Filin in 2011 with the then president Dmitry Medvedev and his wife Svetlana attending a gala opening of the Bolshoi in Moscow . Treatment: The artistic director of the Bolshoi ballet Sergei Filin was interviewed at the hospital in Moscow where he was being treated after the attack . Bolshoi spokeswoman Yekaterina Novikova said Filin had received threats before the attack. 'We never imagined that a war for roles - not for real estate or for oil - could reach this level of crime,' she said. The . Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last . February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded . building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow. As a symbol of Russian . culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and . foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and . directors throughout its history. Since . the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, . whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in . public. After the . tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in . 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before . Filin's appointment. In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, . dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she . was too heavy for male dancers to lift. And in 2011, a senior ballet . manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011. The theatre in the heart of Moscow is . an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals . and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers . and directors during its tumultuous history dating back more than 200 . years. Filin, a former leading dancer at the . Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure job at the heart of Russian . culture for nearly two years, was attacked outside his Moscow apartment . building as he returned from the theatre. Filin, . a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was . named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar . position at another Moscow theatre. There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti. Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry. Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered. 'He said, ""I have a feeling that I am on the front lines"",' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack. 'The culprit should be sought among those for whom it was beneficial to compromise the theatre leadership', Iksanov told reporters. 'This two-week campaign has ended tragically and despicably,' he said. Iksanov said Filin had told him he believed he had been followed home, and that the attacker had called him by name before throwing acid on his face. 'There are very serious burns on his face, in his ears, his forehead, his mouth, and of course there are serious concerns about his eyesight,' he said. Filin's mother, Natalya, said he had been threatened but that she did not know who could have been behind the attack, state-run RIA news agency reported. 'What's important to me now is the health of my son, that he not lose his eyesight,' she said.","Artistic director of Bolshoi Ballet Sergei Filin was attacked outside his home .

A drug addict was today jailed for life for stabbing a pensioner to death in a late night knife attack on his own doorstep. William Jones, 32, had been going door-to-door with a knife looking for his ex-girlfriend and her new partner. Vulnerable charity shop volunteer Peter Lewis, 68, opened the door to his flat in Cardiff's Claude Road in the early hours of April last year and was confronted by an angry Jones. Jailed: Drug addict William Jones, 32, pictured left, was going door-to-door looking for his ex-girlfriend in the middle of the night when he knocked on the front door of Peter Lewis, pictured right, and stabbed him to death . Crime scene: Disabled Mr Lewis used his panic alarm button in his home in Roath, Cardiff, to alert the emergency services but died shortly after arriving at hospital . The partially sighted pensioner, who had learning difficulties, was stabbed once to the chest in the unprovoked fatal attack. Jones, from Adamstown, Cardiff, south Wales, was jailed for life today and told he will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison before being considered for parole. Judge Mr Justice John Griffiths Williams said: 'The contrast between your life and that of Peter Lewis could not be greater. 'At the age of 32 you were a drug addict, a man who had little or no regard for his fellow man. 'No remorse': William Jones, pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court, was told he is a selfish and unfeeling man who has shown no remorse for his crime . 'Peter Lewis was a calm and gentle man who, despite his disabilities, led a full life helping others where he could. 'There was no malice in him but those who knew him understood him. There were many who held him affectionately in their regard. 'His murder was a cruel end to an affectionate life.' The court heard that after murdering the pensioner, Jones went out to a Cardiff nightclub to enjoy himself. The judge told Jones: 'You are a selfish and unfeeling man who has shown no remorse whatsoever.' Jones was found guilty of murder last Friday by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court, where he was sentenced today. In his defence he had insisted the pensioner opened the door wielding a kitchen knife and he had inadvertently stabbed him trying to grab it away. He then made off on foot with the kitchen knife, disposing of it along the way. But the jury last week took less than three hours to reject Jones's version of events. The unprovoked killing was described as an 'appalling attack' by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). 'Peter Lewis was a vulnerable man who posed no threat to anyone, least of all William Jones,' senior crown prosecutor Paul Hewitt said. 'His murder was an appalling attack, carried out by a killer who has taken no responsibility for his actions, instead seeking to suggest that he himself was the one being attacked. Flowers left near the scene where Mr Lewis was killed on his own doorstep in Roath, Cardiff, in April last year . 'Thankfully, this trial has exposed his deceit.' Mr Lewis had made a desperate plea for help as he lay dying at his home in Roath, Cardiff, Mr Hewitt added, saying the 68-year-old was 'bleeding terribly'. The jury heard a recording which was made through an emergency panic alarm the pensioner wore around his neck. Despite quickly arriving on the scene, police found Mr Lewis lying pale and in shock with a single puncture wound in his chest. He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, but despite all efforts to save him he died 15 minutes after arriving.

A blizzard warning has been issued for New York City as the Northeast braces for a potentially dangerous winter storm that is already sparking a travel nightmare across the country. Anywhere from 10-14 inches of snow is expected to fall on the Big Apple on Friday night into Saturday morning. Thirty mph winds are also part of the forecast. The warning is in effect from 6am Friday to 1pm Saturday. Air travelers have been warned to expect headaches at the airport when the storm hits. Scroll down for video . Dangerous weather: The Northeast is bracing for what is expected to be a powerful Nor'Easter on Friday that is packing heavy wind, rain and as much as three feet of snow in some areas . Getting ready: Sanitation worker Jimmy White works on fitting trucks with chains at a New York City Department of Sanitation facility in Manhattan . Fearing the worst: Justo Garcia, left, and Jesse Rathier, right, of Luciano's Restaurant, stock up on bags of ice melt at a Massachusetts Lowe's store . In fact, more than 1,400 flights tomorrow have already been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the city is ready, and if bad weather has to happen, it's better to have it on a weekend. During a press conference this afternoon, . Bloomberg said: 'We hope forecasts are exaggerating the amount of snow, . but you never can tell.' Metropolitan Transit Authority chief Tom Prendergast told reporters: 'This is a very serious storm, and we should treat it that way.' He said that the MTA would keep a large number of trains in the system's underground tunnels to protect them from the storm. The Northeast is bracing for what is expected to be a 'dangerous' Nor'Easter tomorrow that is packing a punch of heavy rain, wind and as much as two feet of snow in some areas. Ready: Salt is loaded into a pickup truck at the Eastern Salt Company in Chelsea, Massachusetts . Forecast: Snowfall totals of more than two feet are expected when the storm hits tomorrow . Path: By Friday evening at 7pm the storm is projected to be just off the eastern coast of New Jersey as depicted by NOAA here . Recollection: The looming storm may be packing the same snowfall totals as the historic Blizzard of '78, which dumped nearly 30 inches of the white stuff in places like Pawtucket, Rhode Island . System: Experts say it's too early to tell if the storm will make a significant impact on the Northeast, but others are fearing the worst . The heaviest snowfall is expected in . New England - a region that has seen mostly bare ground this winter, the . National Weather Service said. The . storm would hit just after the 35th anniversary of the historic . blizzard of 1978, which paralyzed the area with more than as much as 40 . inches of snow in some areas and hurricane force winds from February . 5-7. The approaching Nor'easter could be just as troublesome. Meteorologist William Babcock says it's looking like it's going to be a very powerful storm. Marked by massive snow totals and hurricane-force winds, the Blizzard of 1978 is one of the Northeast’s most epic storms. The weather system dumped as much as 27 inches of snow in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. There was little or no visibility for drivers. About 100 deaths are attributed to the storm - with more than a dozen of them along Massachusetts' Route 128, where drivers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning after getting trapped in their cars. Because the storm came during a full moon, there was a double threat of a storm surge and record snowfall, which caused about $520million in damage. Also reported was the rare phenomenon of 'thundersnow' - a thunderstorm that drops snow instead of rain. In addition, a lack of forewarning was blamed after residents said they were unprepared. Now, about 35 years to the day of the historic blizzard, a powerful Nor’easter is expected to dump a similar amount of snow on the region. If everything falls the way it has the potential to, it could be among the top 10 snowstorms in New England's history. Suffolk County on New York's Long Island is under a blizzard watch, as are parts of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 'This has the potential for being a . dangerous storm, especially for Massachusetts into northeast Connecticut . and up into Maine,' said Louis Uccellini, director of the weather . agency's National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Uccellini, who has written two . textbooks on Northeastern snowstorms, said Wednesday it was too early to . tell if the storm would be one for the record books. But he said it will be a rare and major storm, the type that means 'you can't let your guard down.' Other weather experts are fearing the worst. AccuWeather meteorologist Mark Paquette told the Boston Globe: 'I certainly expect this to be a blockbuster storm of historical proportion. I think you could see 30 inches.' Dubbed Nemo by The Weather Channel, the storm will roll in on Friday morning, with the heaviest amounts dumped on the region that night and into Saturday as the storm moves past New England and upstate New York, the National Weather Service said. A blizzard watch for parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island said travel may become nearly impossible because of high winds and blowing snow. Boston public schools will be closed tomorrow in anticipation of the storm, Mayor Thomas Menino announced. A coastal flooding watch also is in effect for some shore communities in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Long Island. But not everyone is cowering in fear - some are anticipating the snow.

Reunited: Margaret Charles, 79, feared she would never see her Cairn Terrier Maisie again . A pet dog found alive after going missing for eight days in freezing -15C conditions during Britain's cold snap has been reunited with her delighted owner. Cairn Terrier Maisie disappeared after her owner Margaret Charles fell over during a walk in Dunwich Heath National Park in east Suffolk, sparking a large-scale search. Incredibly, the three-year-old dog managed to survive for eight days without food and water by creating an igloo for herself. She was eventually found trapped by a tree by a volunteer with a tracker dog. Maisie has now been reunited with her delighted owner Mrs Charles, 79, who said she thought she would never see her pet dog alive again. Mother-of-two Mrs Charles, of Middleton, near Aldeburgh, Suffolk, said: 'It's just incredible that I've got Maisie back. 'I'm so happy to get her back alive and in one piece. 'I didn't think I'd see Maisie alive again as she was out in this terrible cold. 'I was at the end of my tether and I couldn't function normally, I was so worried for her. 'Maisie is my whole life, I love her to bits. I couldn't imagine never seeing her again.' Maisie had run off after Margaret slipped on black ice while walking her on Dunwich Heath on January 16. Mrs Charles spent the next week trying to find Maisie with the help of friends and family but with no success. Jenny Brown, a volunteer with Dog Lost which helps trace missing dogs, then offered to help the search by bringing her highly-skilled tracker dog Tigger up from Kent the next day. Trapped: Three-year-old Maisie disappeared on Dunwich Heath in east Suffolk where her lead became trapped on a tree . Clever escape: Maisie, pictured with her owner Margaret Charles, manged to dig a hole in the snow which she crawled into to keep warm . Incredibly, Ms Brown and her dog Tigger found Maisie, who had become trapped after her lead somehow snagged on a tree, within just a few hours. She was incredibly hungry and dehydrated but otherwise unharmed. Mrs Charles said: 'Maisie was found not far from where I fell but her retractable lead had got caught on a tree meaning she couldn't walk any further. 'I was trembling and crying and didn't know what to do with myself but managed to get into my car and drive to where Maisie was. 'She had covered herself with snow to insulate herself, which was very clever. These dogs come from the Cairngorms in Scotland and I think that being very tough must be in their DNA. Found just in time: Maisie was finally found by Dog Lost volunteer Jenny Brown and her tracker dog Tigger . Back together again: Margaret Charles took Maisie to the vet who gave her a clean bill of health after her ordeal . 'The main thing was that she was okay and I got her back safe and sound.' Mrs Charles took Maisie straight to the vets where she was given a clean bill of health despite her eight-day ordeal. 'She's obviously lost some weight and we can see her ribs', Mrs Charles added. 'But I've given her a few treats to welcome her back and we~ll take things nice and steady as we get her back to normal.' Dog Lost volunteer Jenny Brown said: 'A lot of searches had already been carried out in a difficult area and in difficult conditions with the snow and cold temperatures.

The problem of horsemeat contamination may have spread from beef burgers to budget pies, pasties and ready meals. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is under pressure to begin testing a much wider range of beef products following revelations that contamination goes far wider than originally believed. It emerged over the weekend that pies and pasties supplied to UK prisons as halal beef actually contained pork, which is contrary to Muslim religious laws. There are now fears that pasties and pies could have been contaminated with horse meat (file picture) If pork is appearing in certified halal pies, MPs are concerned that horse and other species have also been used in many more budget beef products. The manufacturer of the pies, distributed by wholesaler 3663, was named yesterday as McColgan Quality Foods Ltd, which is based in Northern Ireland. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have been called to emergency talks with the FSA today to understand the extent of the food fraud. The FSA has been put in charge of handling Britain’s investigation into the contamination of beef products with horsemeat and pork. However, critics have serious doubts about the organisation’s handling of the crisis amid concerns it is too close to the food industry. In one glaring omission, FSA chiefs have failed to test the products that have been removed from sale by the likes of Burger King, Waitrose, Asda, the Co-op, Sainsbury’s and others. It is only testing products that went . into production after the contamination emerged two weeks ago, which is . after any suspect ingredients had been taken out. The . FSA said the decision to limit testing was made on the basis that the . presence of other types of meat is not a food safety issue. FSA chiefs have failed to test the products that have been removed from sale by the likes of Burger King, Waitrose, Asda, the Co-op, Sainsbury's and others . However, this approach means the watchdog is failing in its duty to enforce labelling laws, which state that it is a criminal offence to mislead the public by describing a product as beef when it also contains horse or pork. The FSA’s handling of the scandal was been surrounded by secrecy, which included refusing to identify the firm responsible for the tainted halal pies. Subsequently, the food wholesale company, 3663, which distributed the pies to some prisons, named the manufacturer as McColgan Quality Foods. It said the products have been withdrawn. McColgan said it viewed the contamination with ‘deep regret’ and insisted that pork is not included in the recipes of any of its halal products. Barry Gardiner MP, a member of the Commons food and farming select committee, which oversees the FSA, said widespread testing of pies, pasties and other beef products is needed urgently. ‘How are we to know whether or not there is horsemeat in pies and other products unless there is some testing?’ he said . Supermarket shelves were cleared of meat products in the wake of the horse meat scandal . ‘The FSA must be much more proactive in this area. We are in a recession and it is precisely the time that people do take these sorts of short cuts.’ Mr Gardiner said the limited testing ordered by the FSA so far, which has left out the products removed from sale, was ‘perverse’. He said: ‘If they have taken a clear decision that products are being taken off sale by the supplier and therefore we are not going to test them, that would be absolutely wrong.’ Erik(correct) Millstone, Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex, said the government and the FSA have been involved in buck-passing over responsibility for dealing with the scandal. He said the FSA’s narrow testing means it may have missed the chance to identify the true scale of the problem. The FSA described the presence of pork in halal pies as ‘unacceptable’. However, it said no decision has been made to extend testing beyond burgers and other products containing raw mince beef. ‘We have called an urgent meeting of major retailers and suppliers on Monday to ensure that everyone is fully aware of their responsibilities,’ it said.","FSA has been put in charge of handling Britain’s investigation into the contamination of beef products .

Archaeologists have uncovered treasure buried by the desperate citizens of a town under siege by the Roman army some 2,000 years ago. Hundreds of bronze coins, and various items of gold, silver and bronze jewellery were found beneath an ancient fortress in the Crimean settlement of Artezia, in modern day Ukraine. Researchers believe the loot was hurriedly buried by wealthy people sheltering from the attacking Roman legions who were backing one side in a civil war. Buried for 2,000 years: Archaeologists have uncovered hoards of buried treasure hidden beneath a Black Sea fortress by residents who were facing the might of Rome's legions during a destructive civil war . 'The fortress had been besieged. Wealthy people from the settlement and the neighborhood had tried to hide there from the Romans,' said Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University. 'They had buried their hoards inside the citadel.' As the Romans highly trained and well equipped soldiers attacked people huddled in the citadel for protection, however Professor Vinokoruv told LiveScience they knew they would not survive. At the time of the siege and fall of the fortress in 45AD, Artezian was a part of the Bosporous Kingdom where a rivalry was playing out between two brothers for political control. The elder, Mithridates VIII, wanted to win independence from the Roman Empire, while his younger brother Cotys wanted to keep the kingdom as a client state. Roman soldiers soon arrived to support Cotys' claims to the throne. They established his regime in the Bosporan capital and torched settlements controlled by his brother, including Artezian. Hellenistic culture: These two rings are engraved with the images of Greek gods. The people of the region borrowed many aspects of their culture from Greek colonists who had established outposts in the are hundreds of years before . A silver brooch depicts Aphrodite, goddess of love: Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals . Professor Vinokurov's team have been recruiting volunteers to study the town since 1989. It covered an area of at least 3.2 acrea, including a necropolis where many finds have been made. Archaeologists' work in the area has revealed that the people of Artezian followed a culture that was distinctly Hellenistic. Professor Vinokurov said that although the ethnicity of Artezian's residents was mixed, 'their culture was pure Greek. They spoke Greek language, had Greek school; the architecture and fortification were Greek as well. 'They were Hellenes by culture but not that pure by blood.' Write caption here . Ancient decorated spindles were also found on site: The Romans arrived in support of Cotys I, a usurper to the throne of the Kingdom of Bosporous, who asked for their help with deposing his older brother . Centuries earlier, at the height of classical Greek culture, sailors had navigated the Black Sea and created colonies to the east, intermarrying with the locals. Their customs and crafts seem to have endured through the intervening years despite being practised nearly 600 miles from Greece itself. This influence can be seen in the treasures the people of Artezia concealed as they waited for the final assault from their Roman enemies. Among the finds is a silver brooch engraved with an image of Aphrodite, Greek goddess of love, as well as gold rings set with gems on which are engraved images of Nemesis and Tyche, both also Greek deities. Dig: Nikolaï Vinokurov, a professor at Moscow State Pedagogical University, has been leading expeditions to the Artezian site for archaeologists and volunteers since 1987 . Peeling back the past: The fortress at Artezian was torched by the Romans in 45AD, then later rebuilt - but it's treasure remained undiscovered until now . Excavations of other portions of the site, which was razed to the ground by the attacking army, have revealed further evidence that the people of Artezia had a Greek culture. 'In the burnt level of the early citadel, many fragmentary small terra cotta figures were found depicting Demeter, Cora, Cybele, Aphrodite with a dolphin, Psyche and Eros, a maiden with gifts, Hermes, Attis, foot soldiers and warriors on horseback, semi-naked youths,' the researchers wrote in their paper, published this month in the journal Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia. The town was later rebuilt by Cotys I, who successfully managed to dispatch his brother with Roman help, but the treasures of its earlier inhabitants have remained untouched until now.","Hundreds of bronze coins and various items of gold, silver and bronze jewellery uncovered at site of Artezian in modern-day Ukraine .

A team of amateur astronomers from around the world has discovered evidence for 42 alien planets, including a Jupiter-size world that could potentially be habitable, it was revealed today. The team, organised online via the planethunters website, analysed data from Nasa's Kepler Space telescope. An artist's impression of of the view from a moon orbiting the planet PH2b. Scientists says Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, . Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, scientists believe. Astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life-friendly 'habitable zones' of stars. All are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune. While such planets would not themselves be suitable for Earth-like life, they could be circled by moons on which there are forests, oceans and living creatures, researchers now believe. Pandora, the fictional moon in Avatar, is just such a world. So far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9% certainty. The rest still fall into the category of 'candidate' planets while further evidence is collected. The confirmed planet, known as PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away. Astronomer Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, a member of the international team behind the discovery, said: 'There's an obsession with finding Earth-like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as PH2 b is far stranger. 'Jupiter has several large water-rich moons. Imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the Earth is. 'If such a planet had Earth-size moons, we'd see not Europa and Callisto but worlds with rivers, lakes and all sorts of habitats: a surprising scenario that might just be common. James Cameron's Avatar was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought. 'It may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around Jupiter and Neptune-size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system.' Members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers. The Planet Hunters project invites 'citizen scientists' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell-tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars. Follow-up work with the Keck telescope in Hawaii provided the proof that PH2 b is almost certainly a genuine planet. More than 40 volunteers are credited in a paper on the research published online by the Astrophysical Journal. One, retired police office Roy Jackson, 71, from Birtley near Gateshead, said: 'It is difficult to put into words, the pleasure, wonderment and perhaps even pride that I have in some small way been able to assist in the discovery of a planet.' Another, electronics engineer Mark Hadley from Faversham, said: 'Now when people ask me what I achieved last year I can say I have helped discover a possible new planet around a distant star. How cool is that?' Planet Hunters lead scientist Professor Debra Fisher, from Yale University in the US, said: 'We are seeing the emergence of a new era in the Planet Hunters project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars. 'Now, the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds.' Avatar featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like Pandora could be the best place to look for alien life . Before the latest finds, 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones. Also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but ""just right"" to permit liquid surface water. Dr Ji Wang, another Planet Hunters scientist from Yale University, said: 'We can speculate that PH2 b might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life. 'I can't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments. 'That could happen any day now.'","Online team analysed data from Nasa's Kepler telescope .

Review: Manslaughter charges against firework display organiser Geoffrey Counsell, who was accused after seven people died in a pile-up on the M5, have been dropped . Manslaughter charges against a firework display organiser accused after seven people died in a horrific pile-up on the M5 have been dropped. Geoffrey Counsell, 50, from Somerset, was operating a firework display close to the motorway at Taunton Rugby Club at the time of the crash in November 2011. The pile-up, which involved 34 vehicles, was described as one of the worst British motorway crashes in memory. Witnesses afterwards spoke of thick smoke causing visibility problems for motorists. Anthony and Pamela Adams, Maggie and Michael Barton, Malcolm Beacham, Terry Brice and Kye Thomas all died. Counsell was charged with seven counts of manslaughter on October 19 last year. But when he appeared at Bristol Crown Court today he was told the manslaughter charges were being dropped and he would instead face a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act of failing to ensure the safety of others. Peter Blair, prosecuting, said they had reviewed the decision following meetings with a range of experts in different disciplines. 'The outcome of the review that took place and developments, including the additional charge of failing to ensure the safety of others under the Health and Safety Act, was the decision that the prosecution will not be pursuing the manslaughter charges,' he said. 'It is the prosecution’s intention that Mr Counsell will be proceeded against under the Health and Safety Act.' Adrian Derbyshire, defending, told the court his client should 'never have been charged with manslaughter'. But he added the prosecution told him it was the right decision at the time and new evidence had come forward that prompted the decision to review the case. Judge Neil Ford QC said the case would now be marked as a closed file.Counsell left court without comment. Relatives of the seven people who died in the pile-up said their torment goes on after the manslaughter charges were dropped. Leaving court today, Tonia White, 49, . whose parents Mr and Mrs Adams were killed on their way back from . visiting the family in Taunton, said the torment for the families goes . on. She said: 'It’s been a very traumatic experience. 'However . we’re confident in the justice system and although the CPS have . discontinued the charges of manslaughter, we are led to believe there . will be health and safety issues to address.' Horrific: The pile-up, which involved 34 vehicles, was described as one of the worst British motorway crashes in memory . Mrs White was supported by her 24-year-old daughter, Terri, as she fought back tears.She said she could not describe how she feels about the manslaughter charges being dropped. 'I . think we are all still very traumatised and hurt and we’re grieving, . and I don’t think that that’s an answer we can give you.' Asked if the torment is still going on she said: 'Yes, very much so, very much so.' Jean Brice, from Bedminster, . Bristol - whose eldest son died in the crash - left court with her . husband, 83-year-old Terry Brice. The 79-year-old said: 'It’s a very sensitive case, but what can we say. 'It won’t stop the cruelty and misery that we two 80-year-olds have to go through for the rest of our days.' The collision involved 34 vehicles and witnesses spoke of thick smoke causing visibility problems for motorists. Problems: Witnesses afterwards spoke of thick smoke causing visibility problems for motorists . Friends and family of the deceased filled the public gallery in the court room to hear the charges dropped. Senior investigation officer for the M5 collision, Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The collision on the M5 in November 2011 was one of the worst in living memory. 'Fifty one people were injured and seven people tragically lost their lives. 'We launched a comprehensive investigation immediately after to establish the full circumstances which led to the collision. 'Our investigation was meticulous and complex. We took hundreds of witness statements, examined 34 vehicles and consulted several experts, including meteorologists, pyrotechnic and forensic specialists. 'Based on this evidence the Crown Prosecution Service took a decision to charge. However, following further consideration in recent weeks they have decided to drop the manslaughter charges.' He added that while Health and Safety proceedings are continuing they are not able to comment any further.

"By . Michael Zennie and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:45 EST, 13 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 16 January 2013 . Suing: Author Patricia Cornwell, 56, is seeking damages up to $100million from her former financial manager . A renowned crime novelist has found an uncomfortable new subject for her latest drama - herself. Patricia Cornwell is suing her former financial management firm in a Boston court, claiming the stewards of her money fleeced her out of millions of dollars and lost millions more by making risky investments without her consent. She is seeking damages that could total more than $100million. But the trial has cast a harsh spotlight on the 56-year-old, who is intensely private. Evan Snapper, a former principal at New York wealth management firm Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP, agrees Cornwell's money is gone - but only because she spent it all on a lavish lifestyle. His attorneys have described expenses including $40,000 a month for an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City, $200,000 in taxes alone for her customized, personal helicopter, $5million for private jets to ferry her across the country and $11million for private estates in Concord, Massachusetts. Cornwell lives with her longtime partner, Harvard University neuroscientist Staci Gruber. 'Where did the money go? Ms Cornwell and Dr Gruber spent the money,' James Campbell, the attorney for the financial company, said. 'You have to consider the large lifestyles involved, the . spending habits, impulsive buying.' Cornwell's crime novels, most of which follow Virginia forensic examiner Kay Scarpetta, have made Cornwell a nationally-recognized name. Her books - which lean heavily on the use of forensic science - are credited as a major influence for the TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.' Her novels, including 'Postmortem,' 'Cruel and Unusual' and 'Book of the Dead' have sold more than 100million copies worldwide. This is not the first time Cornwell has begrudgingly found herself in the spotlight. In the early 1990s, Cornwell had an affair with Margo Bennett, a married . FBI agent, which came out years later after Bennett's estranged husband . was arrested and convicted for the attempted murder of his wife and the . abduction of her pastor. Cornwell has also publicly revealed that she struggles with bipolar disorder. Her lawyer argues that she hired Snapper and his firm to insulate herself from her money and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company. Big spender: Cornwell has her own, personalized helicopter that she flies around the East Coast . Personal pilot: Cornwell says she stays so busy that she can't be bothered to fly commercial so she flies herself in her helicopter - or takes a private plane . Married: Cornwell married Harvard Medical School neuroscientist Staci Gruber in 2005. They live together in an $11million estate in Concord, Massachusetts . 'This case is, at its core, about trust,' her lawyer, Joan Lukey, told . the jury. 'There is no amount of money that is enough to properly . compensate her for what Anchin, Block and Anchin did.' Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net . worth of her and her company, despite having earning above $10million in earnings per . year during the previous four years, was a little under $13million, the . equivalent of only one year's net income. She also claims in the lawsuit that Anchin had borrowed several . million dollars, including mortgages for property and a loan for the . purchase of a helicopter, and had lost millions by moving her from a . conservative investment strategy to high-risk without her permission. She said she also found checks written for expenses she never . authorized, including a $5,000 check for a bat mitzvah gift to Snapper's . daughter from Cornwell, she alleges. According to the Boston Globe, she claims money for 46 rare books she purchased was also mishandled. And, she says, Snapper steered investments into a development backed by one of his associates - Bobby DeNiro, the son of actor Robert DeNiro. Wildly popular: Most of Cornwell's novels center around Virginia medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. The novels, which have sold 100million copies worldwide, are credited with introducing the forensic science crime genre . Lavish: Cornwell's financial manager claims the author lost most of her money because she spent it living lavishly - including $40,000 a month for a room in Trump Tower . Cornwell says problems caused by Anchin and Snapper were so . distracting that they caused her to miss a book deadline for the first . time in her career and cost her $15 million in non-recoverable advances . and commissions. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit in 2009, Snapper pleaded guilty to . violating campaign finance laws by buying $50,000 in tickets to an Elton . John concert benefiting Hillary Rodham Clinton, using Cornwell's money. He paid a fine. Cornwell, a Virginia native, is politically connected herself - though she has preferred to support Republican candidates in the past. She reportedly summered with President George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, and has close family ties to evangelist Billy Graham - even acting as a spokesperson for the family. Lawyers for Anchin and Snapper deny Cornwell's claims. During opening . statements at the trial, attorney Campbell described Cornwell as . 'a demanding client' who 'tends to push off responsibility and assign . blame when things go off track.' 'I do what I do when and how I do it,' she allegedly wrote in an email to Snapper read by Campbell to the jury. Cornwell said one of Anchin's primary functions in 2006 was to ensure that locations were arranged where she could write without distraction while her home was undergoing reconstruction. She said Snapper leased a series of expensive apartments, including one at Trump Tower in New York, that she had to leave long before leases expired because of construction, privacy or other issues. In the lawsuit, Cornwell openly acknowledges her struggles with bipolar disorder, an illness she said has contributed to her belief that she needs other people to manage her business affairs and investments. She said Anchin was aware of her illness.","Patricia Cornwell, 56, is suing Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP and money manager Evan Snapper, claiming she lost untold millions .

A Missouri family who adopted five orphaned siblings from Peru has opened up about their life-changing decision on The View, as a local university donated $500,000 worth of scholarships to help pay for the children's education. Scott and Lauren Sterling with their daughters Logan, 19, and Laney, 3, described how God told them to welcome the siblings into their home and said taking the leap of faith was 'so worth it.' However, Scott explained on Wednesday's show that he took some time to come around to the idea, as he was initially terrified by the financial burden bringing another five children into his home would create. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The View: Scott and Lauren Sterling appeared on The View with the five children they adopted from Peru and their two biological children on Wednesday . 'At first, (we) thought some rich family should adopt these kids and we are clearly not that,' he said. 'I am very practical and logical so I had to process through all of that and the enormous responsibility of that.' He said he was praying at church on Easter Sunday, when it became clear they had to be the ones to give these kids a better life. 'At that moment I felt like God turned the intercom button on and said you know ""I didn't ask you about the kids, I asked if you were willing,""' he said. 'It was that moment I couldn't choose comfort over.. these kids just wanted parents. And instead of choosing comfort I chose to do that.'

Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, nine, touched down in December, after an adoption process that lasted a year-and-a-half. The children said on The View that they were enjoying school, and becoming accustomed to life in the states, where they recently saw snow for the first time. Scott said the language barrier had been interesting, but the kids' English was very good and improving rapidly. 'It's been funny and very interesting at times,' he said. 'Like they called the other day and he said 'I have hungry' or they will say 'I am boring' instead of 'I am bored' so it has been interesting, it's been fun. Settling in: Scott said the language barrier had been interesting, but the kids' English was very good and improving rapidly . School: The children said they were enjoying school in their new town of Blue Springs, Missouri . 'The kids really know a lot more . English. I don't know Spanish and they can understand me, it's just when . they're nervous they don't like to make a mistake by talking back in . English.' The family are . moving to a bigger home in a few weeks to better accommodate their new . family, which more than doubled in size after the siblings sent them an . email imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy' more than two years ago. Scott said despite the cost, he doesn't regret the family's decision for a second. 'I can just say when God asks you to do something it's so worth it,' he said on The View. 'There's nothing that compares to it. The first time we saw the kids at the orphanage they came running from off in the distance, about 50 yards and jumped up in our arms. Even after two months that we've had them now, it feels like they've always been ours.' No regrets: Scott, pictured center with two of his daughters, said despite the cost, he doesn't regret the family's decision for a second .

Sterling's saw their small family expand more than double after they . adopted the five orphaned siblings from Peru who had sent them an email . imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy.' Their new children are now settling into school and home life in Blue Springs, where they saw snow for the first time after arriving down in December. Before the life-changing move, they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis. The children refused to be split up, making adoption seem unlikely. New additions: Scott and Lauren Sterling (back) already had two children, Logan, 19, (right) and Laney, 3, when they took in the orphans: Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, 9 . Finally home: The Sterling brood is pictured in the airport after touching down in Missouri in December . But in January 2011, they met an . American visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email . to send back to his friends in the United States. When Lauren and Scott Sterling received the message, they didn't think too much of it. 'I remember Scott and I looking at that . e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were,' Lauren, 30, wrote on her blog. 'I even . thought, ""Someone rich should adopt them"". And then life went on.' Shortly after, Lauren took a trip to an orphanage in Guatemala and was . devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own . daughter had the security of a home. Then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email. 'Somebody's got to do it, and why can't it be us?' Lauren said to her husband. 'We may eat a lot of spaghetti. I . will never buy another $100 pair of jeans again, and who cares? If those . are my reasons, it's just practicality,' she told Fox4ck. And so they embarked on the year-long . battle to bring the children from Peru to Missouri, hitting numerous . roadblocks along the way, including missing identification records for . the children. But over chats on Skype and visits to Peru, the Sterlings soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own. 'We got told ""no"" a lot of times, and by . then we were already crazy about these kids, so it was a rough part of . the story,' Mrs Sterling told Fox News. 'And you had to keep trusting that . we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for.' Old life: The children are pictured chatting with their parents-to-be on Skype from their orphanage . Sticking together: The children had been in the orphanage for seven years after their parents died of TB . With the help of members of their . church, the Sterlings raised the $85,000 needed for the adoptions to . bring the children to their new home before Christmas. One particularly excited member of . the welcoming committee at the airport was 19-year-old Logan, who had not . seen her father, stepmother or little sister since they left for Peru . five weeks prior. She said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters. 'I haven't met them, know the personalities, know who they are,' she said. 'I'm excited about that.' The Sterlings returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community, with a stocked kitchen, Christmas presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children. New life: The children are now attending U.S. schools and their English is improving all the time . Sisterly love: Nine-year-old Sibila holds her new little sister, three-year-old Laney . 'People painted beds, people framed . pictures - people made the girls' room look like they had lived . here for years. It was awesome to come home to that,' Lauren said. They also returned to a garden full of snow, which the youngsters had never seen before. Life has picked up pace in the Sterling household. Scott, 43, runs a lawn care business, while Lauren has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time. The children's English is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages, making for some busy mornings in the home. 'The sound of life is different,' Lauren said. 'It's a . lot more loud and crazy, and half of it's in Spanish, half of it's in . English, and half of it's in Spanglish. But it's really good. There's a . strange peace amidst the chaos.' Brood: The community rallied around the Sterlings to help them raise enough money for the children . Moving on: The couple returned home (pictured) to new bedrooms, a stocked kitchen . and Christmas present under the tree, organised by members of their . church. They are now moving to a larger home . But life is working out well, and most of that is thanks to the children, Lauren . said. Pictures over Facebook . show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours. 'These kids are fabulous. They have great attitudes,' she said. 'Nobody fought me on going back to school the second day. Everybody was up and ready, showers going on their own. So their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier.' She added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home, the children's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet. For more on the Sterling's story, visit their blog.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:02 EST, 6 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:30 EST, 7 February 2013 . Nick Clegg today piled pressure on disgraced former colleague Chris Huhne to repay the £17,000 payout he received after quitting the Cabinet to fight criminal charges. The Deputy Prime Minister said Huhne had to 'pay amends' after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice over speeding points a decade ago. Mr Clegg will today call the by-election in Huhne’s Eastleigh seat on February 28 – far earlier than expected – amid Lib Dem jitters that it could fall to their coalition partners. Disgraced: The by-election for one-time Energy Secretary Chris Huhne's (seen leaving his home in London today) former Eastleigh seat will take place at the end of this month . Mr Clegg fired the starting gun on his campaign today . with a savage attack on the Conservatives over their failure to agree to . a mansion tax on expensive homes, while claiming sole credit for . cutting the income tax bill for more than 60,000 basic rate taxpayers in . Eastleigh. He used the major speech of the by-election contest to accuse the Tories of demanding a tax cut for millionaires while he battled to cut tax bills for low and middle earners. But during his weekly radio phone-in he was repeatedly challenged over Huhne's dramatic fall from grace, and the £17,000 he received after leaving the Cabinet a year ago when he was charged by police. When pressed, Mr Clegg eventually said the public would expect Huhne to give the money back to the taxpayer. 'I totally understand why people think that now he has pleaded guilty and when he is sentenced that he should pay amends for what’s happened,' he said on LBC 97.3. 'But at the end of the day Chris has got to make that decision I don’t yet know what sentence the judge is going to hand down to him.' Rivalry: Huhne and Nick Clegg clashed during the 2007 leadership to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell . In his speech, Mr Clegg revived the prospect of a mansion tax to target wealthy home owners. He said his 'preferred option' was a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £2million, applied just to the value over and above £2m. Alternatively he proposed new council tax bands at the 'top end' levied on properties worth over £2million. Mr Clegg said: 'Both of these options are based on a very simple principle: That we should ask a small number of very wealthy individuals to make a reasonable contribution, in order to provide desperately needed help for millions of ordinary people. 'Nothing could do more to demonstrate a commitment to greater fairness in our tax system. It’s an open secret that our Conservative partners do not share our views on this. 'However, we will continue to make this argument, in this Coalition and beyond.  Our approach is simple: taxes on mansions; tax cuts for millions. An approach to tax that puts payslips before palaces, if you like.' The by-election contest is likely to be one of the most hotly-contested in recent years, with two governing parties going head-to-head. Both Mr Clegg and David Cameron know that victory for their party would help settle complaints about their leadership, and defeat will raise serious doubts about their hopes at the 2015 general election. Lib Dems insisted their decision, as the sitting party in the constituency, to opt for a short contest reflected the high state of preparedness of the local party, even though they have yet to choose a candidate. 'We are going to throw the kitchen sink at it. I'm pretty sure that the Conservatives will as well,' one source said. Speculation: It is thought Maria Hutchings may stand for the Conservatives in Chris Huhne's former seat . 'It is going to be a tight contest, and generally in tight contests in two-way marginals you get some pretty robust exchanges.' However, the Conservatives have . indicated that they intend to relentlessly highlight Huhne's record, who . quit the Commons on Monday after pleading . guilty to perverting the course of justice after years of denials. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps . told the Mail: ‘The residents of Eastleigh have for a long time been . sold a lie by their Lib Dem MP. That’s why they’ll welcome the . opportunity to express the way they feel about it very soon. ‘Conservatives will present the . opportunity to start afresh with a hard-working local MP who gets on . with looking after her constituents.’ It is understood that the Tories will formally select local mother Maria Hutchings, their candidate in . 2010, to fight the seat again. She famously confronted Tony Blair over cuts . to special schools in the 2005 election campaign. Her chances of success have been boosted by UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage’s decision not to stand. Labour sources are hoping for a strong showing, but are thought to privately accept they have little chances of winning. But Lib Dem chief whip Alistair . Carmichael will today move the writ to trigger a by-election in . Eastleigh in just over three weeks – before the party has even selected a . candidate. Former Lib Dem frontbencher Dr Evan . Harris, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign for a press law, last night . ruled himself out, as has Lib Dem council leader Keith House. A Tory victory in Eastleigh, which . would require a 3.5 per cent swing, would be a shattering blow for Mr . Clegg. No prime minister since Margaret Thatcher at the height of her . Falklands popularity has managed to gain a seat in a by-election.","Tories and Lib Dems will battle it out for seat vacated by disgraced MP .

Now Ms Hudson’s family has confirmed she died at the weekend. Despite surviving the blaze, Ms Hudson was first in a coma and, when she regained consciousness, severe brain damage left her unable to walk or eat. Her mother, Sharon Hudson, told ITV Calendar News: 'Even though where she’s been for the last two years, we could go and we could talk to her, and we could touch her, and we could hug her. 'Now we can’t. Now she’s gone. We’re all going to miss her terribly.' Mrs Hudson added: 'I hope she’s with AJ, Maddie and William, I hope they’re altogether. That’s a good thought.' An inquest into the children’s deaths heard how a discarded cigarette ignited clothing that had been left under a bay window. It is thought Ms Hudson had fallen asleep on the floor of the living room. The inquest heard that she was woken by the smoke alarm and went upstairs to help the children. She gathered them in a bedroom and firefighters found the family huddled together. Recording a verdict of accidental death in March 2011, coroner Geoffrey Saul said: 'The loss of these three very young children can only be described as tragic. It is a word often used but it is a word which can only be used in these circumstances.' Ms Hudson’s funeral is expected to take place next week.

Uncertainty about Britain’s place in Europe will have a ‘chilling effect’ on jobs and growth, Nick Clegg warned today. With David Cameron due to give a landmark speech on the European Union on Friday, which is set to trigger a five-year countdown to a referendum, Mr Clegg cautioned against ‘jeopardising’ the UK’s prime role in Brussels. The Deputy PM warned it was not ‘wise’ to place in peril employment in Britain by embarking on an ‘an arcane debate that will go on for years and years and years’. Scroll down for video . Deputy PM Nick Clegg, who last night unveiled a plaque to the Liberal Party, warned against an 'arcane debate that will go on for years and years and years' Downing Street later defended the Prime Minister's right to speak out on the issue. Mr Cameron is under intense pressure from within his own party to use the threat of potential exit from the EU to drive a hard bargain with Brussels to repatriate powers back to London. He has rushed his long-awaited speech forward to this Friday to appease the Germans who were unhappy at plans to hold it next Tuesday, the 50th anniversary of the Elysee Treaty, . which saw France and Germany finally bury the hatchet after decades of . conflict and hostility. Yesterday the Prime Minister gave the strongest hint yet that he will promise a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU after the next election – after trying to renegotiate a ‘fresh settlement’. But today Mr Clegg insisted the coalition had already legislated to offer a referendum if the EU tried to transfer more powers to Brussels, but more uncertainty was dangerous. Mr Clegg warned against holding 'a referendum out of thin blue air' ‘We've given that clarity, we've provided that certainty that there will be a referendum triggered in the future in those circumstances. the priority remains jobs and growth not an arcane debate that will go on for years and years and years,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. 'All I'm saying is we should be very careful at a time when the British economy is still haltingly recovering from the worst economic shock in a generation to create a very high degree and prolonged period of uncertainty. 'In my view, uncertainty is the enemy of growth and jobs because our priority in this government and our priority in the national duty has got to be to foster growth and jobs. 'If you are an investor investing in jobs in the United Kingdom, to create jobs here... I think it is unnecessary to create a high degree of uncertainty that might actually chase away investment and might diminish the number of jobs in this country.' Mr Clegg said he would focus on Britain’s leadership role in the EU and the need to protect jobs. ‘I think that we should be proud of the leadership that we have exercised in the European Union. ‘The single market wouldn't have have happened without the Brits. ‘I don't think we should do anything to jeopardise our leadership and we certainty shouldn't do anything that would have a chilling effect on jobs in this country.’ Mr Clegg's remarks will be seen as a direct challenge to Mr Cameron, who yesterday accused critics who warn against re-opening the Europe debate of wanting to 'stick your head in the sand'. The Lib Dem leader also challenged Mr Cameron's idea of renegotiating Britain's membership of the EU, adding: 'I don’t agree with the premise that we can, on our own if you like, unilaterally simply rewrite the terms of our membership for this European club, which is a club which is in need of reform.' David Cameron accused people who warn against engaging in the Europe debate of 'burying their heads in the sand' By shifting his speech from January 22 Mr Cameron hopes to avoid offending German and French sensibilities as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Elysee Treaty. But, in a sign of the diplomatic difficulties involved, the new date, January 18, also coincides with a number of other ominous anniversaries: . However Number 10 insisted it was right for Mr Cameron to take a lead in the Europe debate. 'The central point here is that the debate around the future of the European Union is already under way,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 'The Prime Minister's view is that it is absolutely in the national interest to take the lead in this debate that is already under way.' Mr Cameron is due to meet Conservative Cabinet members tomorrow to brief them on the details of his speech. He spoke by telephone with Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt last night to discuss his approach to the issue. The PM yesterday attacked the 'bossiness' of Brussels and insisted he was ‘not happy’ with every aspect of the . UK’s relationship with the rest of Europe. He added: 'Those that say ""this is . very dangerous, you’re putting at risk the relationship with Europe, . you’re putting at risk our position with regard to business"", I don’t . agree with that. 'The fact . is this debate is happening anyway. So we have a choice as politicians: . do you get out there, lead that debate, make the changes that would be . right for Britain – and I would argue right for Europe – and then give . people a choice about that? 'Or do you kind of stick your head in the sand and just hope the debate is going to go away?' Dubbed 'The Big Speech', Mr Cameron's address on Britain's relationship with Europe has been promised for months. The waiting began when he used a newspaper article in June 2012 to say: 'For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together.' In December he defended the delays, claiming the development of his vision for the EU was like tantric sex and would be worth the wait. Speaking to journalists in Westminster, Mr Cameron said: 'Thank you for reminding me that my Europe speech is as yet unmade. 'This is a tantric approach to policy-making. It will be even better when it does eventually come... That wasn't in the script . The sense of chaos in Number 10 continued yesterday, when the decision to give the speech on Friday was rushed out. Labour denounced the handling of the issue as a 'shambles'. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ""When it comes to David Cameron's speech on Europe, he can't seem to decide on a date, let alone a policy. It's not so much a Number 10 strategy as a Number 10 shambles. 'It seems that David Cameron has now been forced to bring forward his speech for the same reason that it was originally delayed - the opposition he faces from within his own party, as well as from Britain's allies and British business has simply overwhelmed him. 'As the chaos continues, this is a Prime Minister who looks unable to control the agenda or his party on Europe.' A spokesman for Mr Cameron said Dutch . PM Mark Rutte will not attend the speech, despite earlier reports that . he had been signed up as an ally in the battle with Brussels. The speech will be delivered to European diplomats, business leaders and 'other interested parties'. Mr Cameron is determined to set out Tory policy for Europe, despite the criticism of his Mr Clegg . Mr Cameron will meet Mr Rutte for talks during his visit to Holland. He briefed the Dutch PM and German chancellor Angela Merkel over the weekend on what he was planning to say, and is expected to speak to more EU leaders over the coming days. Mr Cameron's official spokesman declined to say whether the PM thought Mr Rutte would back his stance, saying: 'It is for the Dutch government to set out their views.' The spokesman said it was 'entirely appropriate' to make the speech in the Netherlands, as it had a similar ""global-trading, outward-looking history"" to the UK. European Commission vice-president Joaquin Almunia has warned that it would be a ""disaster"" for the UK if it withdrew from the EU. He told the BBC's Hardtalk programme that renegotiating the UK's terms of membership would be 'extremely difficult', adding: 'If you want to be in a club and you want to be an important member of the club - as I think the UK should be - you cannot be influential and relevant saying, 'I don't want this, I don't want that'.'","Lib Dem leader says 'arcane debate' will last for years and years and puts growth in peril .

Off the hook: A lawyer overseeing the federal investigation into Lance Armstrong says there are no plans to charge him over the doping scandal . The company that awarded Lance Armstrong $12million in bonuses for three of his seven Tour de France victories will now fight him in court to get it back. The shamed cyclist said earlier this week that he would not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses from Texas-based SCA Promotions during three of his seven Tour de France victories. Those victories came in 2002, 2003 and 2004 - all races in which Armstrong admitted that he cheated to win. It will be the latest legal battle for Armstrong since he admitted last month that doped repeatedly during his storied career. In a blockbuster interview with Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong said he had used performance-enhancing substances before all seven of his . But despite the confession, the Armstrong camp insists that the bonus funds are his, and they're non-refundable. Armstrong's lawyer Tim Herman told USA Today that his client has no intention of repaying Texas-based SCA Promotions, which paid and insured the $12million . he was awarded in bonuses during three of his seven Tour de France wins. Mr Herman told USA Today: 'My only point is no athlete ever, to my understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation. Not [New Orleans Saints coach] Sean Payton or anybody else. Payton was banned from the NFL for the entire 2012-2013 football season for his role in pushing a 'crush-for-cash' bounty program on the team. Herman added: 'They were suspended, but nobody said you've got to give your paycheck back.' Should Lance Armstrong be charged for perjury after admitting to Oprah that he had doped? Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Armstrong is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators. The ex-Tour de France champion is potentially facing charges of obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation relating to the systematic cover-up of his drug-taking when he was competing. The revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, Andre Birotte, who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of Armstrong, 41, only to suddenly drop it this time last year. Sources told ABC News that . agents had recommended an indictment for the drug-cheat on charges of . drug distribution, fraud and conspiracy and were stunned when the case . was suddenly dropped. A little help: Armstrong celebrates after winning the 15th stage of the Tour de France in 2003 - one of the years that he admitted to cheating . Last night, a high level source told the network: 'Birotte does not speak for the federal government as a whole.' According to the same source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 'Agents are actively investigating Armstrong for obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation.' An email to an attorney for Armstrong was not immediately returned to ABC News. The statement made earlier today by André Birotte, the U.S. attorney based in Los Angeles, follows Armstrong's confession in a blockbuster interview last month. 'We made a decision on that case a . little over a year ago. Obviously, we've been well aware of the . statements that have been made by Mr Armstrong in other media reports. Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . 'That does not change my view at this time,' Birotte said at a news conference in Washington to announce an unrelated lawsuit against Standard & Poor's. The government will continue to look at the case, Birotte added, but Armstrong's admission 'hasn't changed our view as I stand here today.' In February 2012, Birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by Armstrong. Birotte's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission. On Tuesday, Armstrong tied with former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o in atop a Forbes poll ranking America's most disliked athletes. Speculation about charges began anew . after Armstrong reversed his past doping denials in an interview with . Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey. Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . He told Winfrey he used performance-enhancing drugs and doping in cycling tournaments. Legal experts said Armstrong exposed himself to possible charges of perjury or obstruction of justice. Separately, Armstrong faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, accusing Armstrong of fraud. The U.S. Justice Department has not . said whether it intends to join the suit, and Birotte did not address . the suit at the news conference. Armstrong has been banned from cycling for life and stripped of race wins, including seven Tour de France victories. Herman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Opponent: Armstrong has a continuing feud with USADA CEO Travis Tygart, who spearheaded a probe into doping on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams . Armstrong's lawyers said last month that he will talk more about drug use in the sport, just likely not to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that led the effort to strip him of his Tour de France titles. The question is: When? In a testy exchange of letters and statements revealing the gulf between the two sides, USADA urged Armstrong to testify under oath to help 'clean up cycling.' Armstrong's attorneys responded that the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more good - namely to cycling's governing body and World Anti-Doping Agency officials. USADA's response to that: 'The time for excuses is over.' The letters underscore the continuing . feud between Armstrong and USADA CEO Travis Tygart, the man who . spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on . Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport. In the Oprah interview, Armstrong said he owed a long list of . apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he . can compete again. His most realistic avenue toward that . might be telling USADA everything he knows in a series of interviews . the agency wants started no later than today. That seems unlikely.

Major serial: House Of Cards, the new drama starring Kevin Spacey, is a $100million TV series commissioned exclusively for streaming service Netflix . What is going on in the world of home entertainment? Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey recreates a Machiavellian anti-hero from one of British TV’s best-loved dramas, and virtually no one is watching. If you live in London, you might have seen posters featuring a presidential Spacey posing on the stone throne of the Lincoln Memorial, fingers gripping the armrests. But that’s probably all you’ve seen of it. Even if you’re one of the estimated one million UK subscribers with access to watch House Of Cards via an American internet service, you probably won’t be glued to the same episodes as anyone else you know. The entire series, all 13 parts of it, was dumped online last Friday, like a bootlegged box-set of DVDs falling off the back of a lorry. For House Of Cards is a television spectacular that isn’t on TV. Instead, the $100million series is being ‘streamed’ on the web via Netflix — a £5.99 monthly subscription service that lets users watch broadcast content via the internet, on a computer, a tablet or a phone. You could view it on a high-definition telly hooked up to an online games console. What you can’t do is switch on the TV and watch it on any conventional channel, no matter how many your satellite package offers. It isn’t there. This is the first time a major serial has been commissioned exclusively for a streaming web service and, at $100m represents a bold gamble by Netflix. The expense and sheer quality of the show emphasise that it is intended as a competitor to the biggest U.S. series — a web-only equivalent of Homeland or Mad Men. Spacey plays a conniving Washington kingmaker who decides to put the White House crown on his own head after the new president breaks a promise to appoint him Secretary of State. His wife, played as an ice queen by Robin Wright, is ruthless, heartless and quietly insane — a modern-day Lady Macbeth. It achieves a chilling atmosphere of camp, rare in U.S. dramas. Spacey plays Congressman Frank Underwood as a chain-smoking aesthete, an habitue of art galleries and the opera, who reacts with physical revulsion to the thought of exercise when his wife buys him a rowing machine. But he is also cold-bloodedly diabolical, able to destroy an old friend’s career as dispassionately as he chokes an injured dog to death. The original House Of Cards aired as a four-part series on BBC1 in 1990, starring Ian Richardson as a Tory chief whip whose scheming mind goes into hyperdrive after the resignation of the Prime Minister. It was the BBC’s good fortune that the screening coincided with the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher. Screenwriter Andrew Davies had adapted the novel by Michael Dobbs — who had worked as the Conservative Party’s chief of staff under Thatcher — and it soon became compulsive Sunday night viewing throughout Britain. At Number 10, the new prime minister John Major (once a whip himself) and his staff apparently dropped whatever they were doing to watch it. And they weren’t the only ones. Across Britain, more than 15m a week were gripped. Richardson’s urbane, devious catchphrase — ‘You might think that; I couldn’t possibly comment’ — was on every tongue (and is occasionally used by Spacey in the new version). Star: Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood in the programme House Of Cards, which is exclusive to Netflix . Risk: The $100million for House Of Cards represents a big gamble for Netflix . It was sensational TV, a talking point in offices and pubs everywhere. That almost half the adult viewers in Britain were united in watching this modern take on a Shakespearean revenge tragedy created a communal feeling. Mass entertainment that brought the nation to a halt was not a new concept. At its height in the Fifties, the radio sitcom Hancock’s Half Hour was so popular that pubs emptied when it aired — everyone wanted to be at home, listening and laughing with the family. The streets were abandoned when Tony Hancock was on. It is this collective experience that has been sacrificed to technology. The convenience of being able to watch what we want, on any format, in any place from a bedroom to a bus, has come at a colossal cost — we watch alone. Family: The collective experience of sharing television has been sacrificed by technology . What once bound families and created communities is now a lonely, divisive ritual we cannot share. TV can’t bring us together any more; it splits us up. We have screens in every room — and instead of family debates and compromises, teaching children negotiation and fair play, everybody is free to be as moodily selfish as they like. A pocket-size touchscreen device and a set of headphones might mean children can watch a favourite show in the palm of a hand, while screening out conversations around them, but it also prevents anyone watching with them. 'What once bound families and created . communities is now a lonely, divisive ritual we cannot share. TV can’t . bring us together any more; it splits us up' Netflix is currently a sideshow — largely filled with half-forgotten TV shows and old movies for users to rummage through. It’s like the world’s biggest second-hand DVD market stall. It has an estimated 27.5m subscribers in the U.S., but barely a tenth of that in the rest of the world, and runs at a loss. Even when it makes new material available, such as the zombie drama Walking Dead (previously shown on cable channel AMC), viewing figures are underwhelming: 200,000 fans opted to watch the whole series in the first 24 hours — a huge number with nothing better to do, but a tiny blip in the overall TV market. Small wonder Netflix executives say they won’t be publishing audience figures for House Of Cards. They are no doubt underwhelming. The release of all 13 episodes at once, enabling fans to watch them back-to-back, gorging themselves in square-eyed binges, has other implications for TV traditions. Gone are the flashback summaries that open each episode in many conventional series — viewers don’t need them if watching a continuous stream. Netflix executives don’t like the term ‘bingeing’ to describe this phenomenon — it sounds unhealthy. Alone: Gadgets allow people to watch TV when they want, but nobody can watch it with them . They prefer ‘marathoning’. But they accept that viewers tend to gobble up shows so fast that plot summaries are superfluous. ‘We assume you know what’s happening, whereas TV has to assume a big chunk of the audience is always tuning in [for the first time],’ said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer. That ignores traditional viewers, the vast majority. Much as we’d like to sit in our pyjamas and bask in television rays like lizards soaking up sunshine, we have other obligations. If producers dispense with potted explanations and expect us to use Google to find out what happened last week, TV will become a chore. Imagine coping with complex dramas such as The Killing without a flurry of intercut moments from previous weeks to refresh the memory and set the scene. It gets worse. Beau Willimon, the producer of House Of Cards, predicts dramas will soon be made in a single flow, as long as blockbuster novels, ten or 20 hours of programming without a break: he’d like to ‘dispense with episodes altogether,’ he said, ‘you decide where to pause.’ At that point, the concept of tension, of cliffhangers, of everything that makes drama compelling, is lost. The rhythm and discipline imposed on scriptwriters and directors will evaporate. House Of Cards is scheduled in 50-minute episodes, a conventional format but there’s no reason — they might as well run for 20 minutes or three hours. Technology hasn’t just fragmented the market — it has shattered it into smithereens. Perhaps that’s a good thing. We’ve been in thrall to the telly for a lifetime; maybe we should all switch off and do something more constructive instead. But as a confirmed gogglebox addict, all I can say is: ‘You might think that; I couldn’t possibly comment.’","New Kevin Spacey TV drama is being 'streamed' on web via Netflix .

A BBC radio presenter refused to give up her mobile phone after she was attacked by a would-be mugger, it has been reported. Nikki Bedi is the third female BBC radio presenter to have fallen victim to phone muggers in the past six months. But the presenter managed to fend off the attacker after she was approached at a bus stop in west London while making her way to work. The television and radio presenter, who works for Radio 2 and Radio 4, said she managed to force the mugger to flee after she refused to let go of her phone and started shouting. She said: 'I had my phone out and was looking down at the screen when quite a big, tall man with a hoodie obscuring much of his face tried to rip the phone from my hands.' She said she had been waiting in the bus shelter with another passenger, but that was not even enough to put off the attack, the London Evening Standard has reported. She went on to say: 'But as I resisted the thief's yanking and vocalised, he fled into the night. 'It all happened in the blink of an eye and my fellow traveller was ready to give chase.'

Twitter's new mobile video-sharing app Vine has had its age rating increased after it was flooded with porn. It has been raised from 12+ on Apple's store to 17+, which is the highest rating. The software was launched last month and within days hundreds of hardcore porn videos were uploaded, leading to complaints from angry users. Twitter was forced to apologise just weeks after the launch when a six-second pornographic clip was promoted as an 'editor's pick'. The new rating is used for videos with 'frequent/ intense sexual content or nudity'. Vine users are asked to confirm they are over 17 by clicking on a window, but that is the only age verification system in place. Videos are not vetted before being uploaded but it has been announced that users will be able to block or report items they find offensive. Vine - dubbed the Instagram for video - is designed to encourage members to share clips recorded on their smartphones. It extends Twitter’s 140-character ethos to video, with clips limited to just six seconds. When the hardcore porn video appeared in January, children's charities said it was an example of how easily children can stumble on pornographic images. Twitter was forced to apologise last month after a hardcore clip was chosen as an 'editor's pick' Twitter blamed human error and had the video removed. A spokesman said at the time: ‘A human error resulted in a video with adult content becoming one of the videos in Editor’s Picks, and upon realising this mistake we removed the video immediately.

'Pathological liar': A coroner said he believed Terry Webb started the fire deliberately so he could rescue his partner's daughters and emerge a hero . A coroner has agreed with a police theory that a 'pathological liar' deliberately started a fire that killed his partner's two year old daughter so he could rescue her and be hailed a hero. Isobel Dobson was eating her dinner in an adapted Ford Transit minibus with her half-sister Sarah, one, when a blaze broke out in an adjacent barn, spreading to the van and engulfing it in huge flames. Terry Webb, 39, the partner of Isobel's mother Stacey Catch, 24, managed to pull Sarah from the burning van but couldn't reach little Isobel - known as Izzy - who perished in the blaze West Yorkshire in September 2011. Mr Webb denied he was responsible for Izzy's death at an inquest at Wakefield Coroners Court today. But the hearing was told police suspected the 39-year-old - who had previously lied about being an army veteran and invented a story about having a sister who had been brutally murdered - had started the fire himself so that he could rescue the little girls and be feted as a hero and 'the saviour of the day'. Coroner David Hinchliff, who described Mr Webb as a 'very sad man' who 'wanted to be liked', said: 'I personally have no reason to think that the police's theory is in any way far fetched or unjustified. 'I think the theory is correct.' Asked by Mr Hinchliff whether he denied the theory offered by police that he had deliberately started the inferno, Webb replied: 'It wasn't me.' The coroner recorded a narrative verdict, and said: 'The police inquiries were such that they had a reason to be concerned about the activities and possible motive of Stacey's then partner Terry Webb. Tragic: Isobel Dobson, two, died when the fire spread from a barn to the minibus in which she was eating dinner with her half sister Sarah . Fatal: All experts who reviewed the fire agreed it was started by a naked flame applied to hay in the barn in West Yorkshire, the inquest heard . 'It has been apparent that throughout his life that gentleman has perpetrated the most horrendous stories and lies about his previous life - that his own sister was brutally murdered. He invented a total false and spurious military record saying he had served in terrible spots around the world and had suffered psychological damage because of it. 'It was entirely ficticious. He hadn't suffered in any way. 'It was absolute nonsense,' the coroner said. 'It caused the police, not unreasonably in my opinion, a concern that possibly because of this man's flawed personality that he would want to invent stories which would turn him from what was really a very sad man into somebody else. He wanted to be liked. He wanted to be respected and he wanted to be a hero. 'The police theory and I put it no stronger than that, that he might well, in his rather odd psyche, decide to cause a fire to occur, not because he wanted to cause harm to these little girls, but he wanted to rescue them. [Then] he would be regarded as a hero, and the saviour of the day.' Mr Hinchliff said he believed the theory put forward by police to be correct. Aftermath: Mr Webb pulled one year old Sarah from the flames engulfing the mini-bus, but was unable to reach Izzy, who died in the blaze at the farm near Pontefract . Mr Webb, wearing a blue, red and white England rugby top with jeans, spoke quietly as he admitted making up a previous career in the army and lying about his non-existent sister being brutally murdered. Mr Hinchliff, who called him a 'pathological liar', said: 'You have told the most serious of lies. I don't just mean silly tall tales. 'You have made the most horrendous claims about losing your sister and about the military service. 'Can you think what made you say that?' he asked. To which Webb replied simply: 'No.' Questioned about making up his military career, Webb admitted that he had been in the Cadets when he was younger but failed a medical test when he signed up. 'Mr Webb was a very sad ordinary man who... wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense' Coroner David Hinchliff . The coroner pointed out that he not only lied about this to Ms Catch and her family, but also to ambulance staff and police who attended the scene after the horrific fire. When pressed for a reason why, Webb said: 'To get people to think I was a nice guy.' 'You clearly want to be known as this heroic person, you think that will make people respect you,' Mr Hinchliff said.Mr Hinchliff asked him: ""Can you... understand why the police have considered that you were in the vicinity at the time of the fire, you would have had the means of starting the fire as there were firelighters and 2 Stroke [a flammable liquid] in the back of your van.'Mr Webb said: 'I can understand that.' Mr Hinchliff said: 'The only other person in the vicinity was [witness and passerby] Wendy Russell, she would have no reason. Do you refute the suggestion that you started the fire so that you could rescue the two girls and be seen as a hero?' Webb replied: 'Yes.' When Mr Hinchliff asked him to offer an alternative explanation for what happened, Mr Webb said: 'I don't know.' Coroner Hinchliff also heard from Det Supt Singh, the Chief Investigating Officer in the case, who confirmed that the police had a theory that Webb had started the fire to feed his hero complex.He also said how, through witness statements and a reconstruction, the police estimated there was a time space of approximately four minutes where the fire could have been started. Discussing the lies that Webb told about his previous career, Mr Singh called it 'complete fabrication', and Mr Hinchliff agreed it was 'absolute nonsense'. Coroner Hinchliff said: 'I have to be very frank but it occurs to me that Mr Webb was a very sad ordinary man who had risen no higher than a bus driver on the Isle of Wight and wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense, which he carried through to the very end when he was sitting in an ambulance with all this tragedy around him.' 'Horrific fire': Isobel's mother Stacey Catch, left, said the outcome of the inquest 'hasn't given me any answers', and said she just 'wants to know the truth' about the fire at the farm near Pontefract (right) 'That's true,' Mr Singh agreed, adding that there was 'ample evidence' of Mr Webb's 'dishonesty'. But Mr Singh said although Mr Webb had been arrested police had been advised by the CPS in March that they should not proceed as there wasn't a reasonable prospect of a conviction on the evidence. The court also heard from Dr Robert Lewis, who investigated the fire, and found that evidence from witnesses about black smoke which turned to flames could have indicated that a flammable liquid was used as well as a naked flame. 'I just want to know the truth' Isobel Dobson's mother Stacey Catch . But all experts who reviewed the fire agreed that the fire was started by a naked flame applied to the hay. The coroner recorded that the cause of Isobel's death was the effects of smoke and fire. Speaking after the inquest, the little girl's mother said and she and her family believed the police theory and called for justice. 'It hasn't given me any answers,' she said, 'We don't know any more than we did. I just want to know the truth. 'I would like it to go before a jury so that they can decide if he is guilty of murder. Hopefully he will slip up or say something to incriminate himself. 'Me and the whole family believe the police's theory, that he started the fire so he could rescue the girls and look like a hero.' Senior Investigating Officer Det Supt Singh said after the hearing: 'We note the findings of the coroner today. It is a matter of record that a then 37-year-old man from the local area was arrested in connection with the enquiry. A file was presented to the CPS and it was decided that no further action should be taken. 'This remains an ongoing investigation and we continue to appeal for information from the local community. I continue to urge anyone who has information regarding this case to contact the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team on 101 or CrimeStoppers, which they can do anonymously, on 0800 555 111.'","Isobel Dobson, two, died when minibus she was in was engulfed by flames .

Flies Undone: Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, 47, was caught out while travelling on the London Underground last month . In one of his more unguarded moments, former foreign secretary David Miliband has been spotted taking a nap on the Tube. Labour's Mr Miliband, 47, was caught out while travelling on the London Underground’s Piccadilly line at 3pm last month between Leicester Square and South Kensington. Electrician Francis Janjua, 28, got on the train and sat opposite the MP for South Shields, who was reading a book - but minutes later he began snoozing with his trouser fly gaping open. Mr Janjua, of west London, said: ‘Pretty much as soon as the train set off, he closed his book and put his head on his hand and dozed off. 'He was properly asleep, I reckon. I was laughing to myself about it anyway, until I noticed his fly was down - then it was just hilarious.’ Mr Miliband dozed in a priority seat designated for disabled people and those less able to stand, although the Tube was not busy at the time when he was travelling - at 3pm on a day last month. He dozed until the train stopped at South Kensington, where he disembarked - without noticing his zipper was still undone. Mr Janjua, who was travelling home . from work, said: ‘I couldn't believe his fly was down. It kind of takes . the credibility away from him a little bit. But he's still got more . credibility than his brother.’ Meanwhile Boris Johnson urged senior ministers to follow Mr Miliband’s example and use the Tube. The London Mayor was a caller on . Deputy PM Nick Clegg’s weekly radio phone-in today, and demanded top MPs . got out of their chauffeur-driven cars to experience life on public . transport. Mr Johnson said: ‘I just want to ask you . when are you going to get all those Government ministers out of their . posh limos and onto public transport like everybody else? Praise: London Mayor Boris Johnson urged senior ministers to follow Mr Miliband's example and use the Tube . ‘How can we possibly expect Government to vote for increases in infrastructure spending which we need in this city and upgrading the Tube, which we all need, when they sit in their chauffeur-driven limousines - paid for by the taxpayer - rather than getting down on public transport with the rest of us? Nick, get them out of their limos! Boris, over and out.’ Mr Clegg, hosting his show on LBC 97.3, insisted the coalition had slashed spending on cars by around 70 per cent but backed the need for investment in infrastructure. This week Welsh Secretary David Jones was branded ‘lazy’ and ‘shameful’ after he used a chauffeur-driven Jaguar to travel 100 metres from his office to Downing Street and then back again. Mr Miliband was beaten to the post of Labour leader by his brother Ed, 43, in September 2010 and has since taken a far less public role in the party, as a backbench MP and business consultant. He has made almost £1million on top of his MP's salary since losing the leadership election. A spokesman for David Miliband told MailOnline today: 'David would like to thank everyone at TfL (Transport for London) for making his journey a pleasant and relaxing one.'","Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband spotted on train last month .

A morbidly obese man has been awarded £240,000 in damages from his GP because the doctor failed to refer him to a weight loss clinic or arrange a gastric band surgery. Luis Almario is suffering from terminal liver cancer, weighs more than 300lbs for his 5ft 6in frame, and blames his doctor for his condition. The 68-year-old Australian was already suffering from liver disease when he began seeing Dr Emmanuel Varipatis in 1997, an illness which progressed into cirrhosis, liver failure and eventually liver cancer. Fatal obesity: Luis Almario has won £240,000 in compensation from his GP as the Australian court ruled the doctor was to blame for Mr Almario's terminal cancer . Colombian-born Mr Almario saw Dr Varipatis for 14 years during which time, a court found, the doctor failed to ensure that the illness did not regress. Although the court reduced Mr Almario's damages from £374,648 to £239,774 due to mitigating factors, including his diet, Justice Joseph Campbell said had it not been for the ‘negligence’ of Dr Varipatis the outcome would have been different. Mr Almario has been given 40 weeks to live as a result of the advanced liver cancer brought on by his obesity, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, . ‘I am satisfied that but for the negligence of the defendant, the liver disease would not have progressed to cirrhosis. 'One could have expected a great improvement in his health generally, had bariatric surgery been successful, and a healthful weight been achieved by Mr Almario following surgery,’ said Justice Joseph Campbell in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Blame: Mr Almario says his life could have been saved had his GP ensured he lost weight, preventing his cancer . Justice Joseph Campbell found Dr Varipatis negligent on three counts but the Sydney GP has appealed the decision. He insists that when he began treating obese Mr Almario in 1997, gastric band surgery was not considered an effective treatment for liver disease linked to morbid obesity. The case has been deemed a legal landmark by medical experts, who have raised concerns about the effect it will have on doctor’s responsibility for their patients’ weight. ‘This will force doctors to refer patients off for every test under the sun or fear being dragged into the courtroom,’ Dr Adrian Sheen, from Doctor's Action, told Fairfax Media. ‘The cost to the health service will be astronomical.’","Luis Almario, 68, has terminal liver cancer as a result of his obesity .

A married couple accused of spying on Germany for 25 years for their Russian paymasters went on trial today in a case that could lead directly to Vladimir Putin's door. Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag began their snooping career in the same city, Dresden, where Putin was posted for the KGB. The duo are accused of first feeding information about West Germany to the former Soviet Union, then the reunited land to the Russian Republic. In the dock: Andreas Anschlag (left) and his wife Heidrun (right), whose identities have been obscured at the request of the court, arrive for the start of their trial where they are accused of spying on Germany for Russia . The espionage agents for Moscow operated under the radar of the intelligence services sending back their reports to their handlers via a radio code. 'The accused had the task of gathering information about the political and military strategy of the EU and NATO as well as security-relevant political aspects of relations between Germany, the EU and NATO to Russia,' said Germany's prosecutor's office. An alleged spy in the Dutch Foreign Ministry supplied them with secret European Union and NATO documents from 2008 to 2011. Their trial began today in Stuttgart. The court heard how Heidrun Anschlag's arrest in the autumn of 2011 was like a scene from a cold war movie - she was tapping out a message back to Russia from her home in Balingen when an armed task force broke in and arrested her mid-transmission. On trial: Andreas Anschlag (centre) and his wife are accused of first feeding information about West Germany to the former Soviet Union, then the reunited land to the Russian Republic . 'Caught red-handed': Heidrun Anschlag, pictured talking to her lawyer in court, was arrested by police in her home in Balingen, Germany, while allegedly typing out a coded message to her masters . Intelligence agencies said the message was intended for the SWR, the agency which replaced the KGB. It . was also revealed the pair, both now aged 52, had contact to agent OOX - . sexy spy Anna Chapman who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke . up in America two years ago. Investigators . said it was due to information gleaned from the interrogations in . America that led to the arrests of the spy duo in Germany. Andreas . and Heidrun were described as 'throwbacks' from the Soviet era who . stayed on in reunited Germany to serve new masters after the same old . secrets - industrial, technological and military. 'Clues': The trial heard the pair, both now aged 52, had contact to agent OOX - 'sexpot spy' Anna Chapman (pictured above) who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke up in America two years ago . Link? The pair began their snooping career in the same city, Dresden, where Russian President Vladimir Putin was posted for the KGB . While his wife was seized at home, Andreas was arrested while on an alleged business trip in the university city of Marburg. Two Austrian passports, both said to be forgeries made by the counterfeiters of the SWR, were seized when they were taken into custody. GS9-G commandos - the elite of the German police trained by former officers of Britain's SAS regiment - made the arrests. The bogus passports stated that Andreas was born in Argentina and Heidrun in Peru. Checks with authorities in both nations proved them to be fakes. 'The accused are suspected of having worked in Germany over a long period of time for a foreign intelligence agency,' the federal prosecutor said in a statement.","Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag began career in same city where Vladmir Putin was working for KGB .

Sticking to the task: Amanda Warrington, 50, celebrates with her 24,000 piece jigsaw puzzle that she finally completed after 17 months . Piecing it together: Department of Work and Pensions employee Amanda Warrington worked on the 24,000-piece puzzle in the evenings . The monster puzzle features a range of animal, sea life and planet scenes and when boxed weighs almost two stone. Ms Warrington, from Bristol, said her friends were shocked at the level of patience she showed in completing the jigsaw. The 50-year-old, who works for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: 'I love a challenge. 'I must have done at least 50 puzzles before but my favourites are doing the difficult ones like the mosaics, globes or the baked beans puzzle. 'I work full time so I was doing between 30 minutes and an hour each day but I have to admit sometimes I was staying up until 3am because I was getting addicted.

Victim: Frances Baird was found dead at home a week after giving evidence against the teacher who abused her as a teenager . The historic failure of our criminal justice system to properly try sexual abuse cases has claimed its first victim through the shocking death of Frances Andrade. A solitary tragedy? It’s the worst I know of but I’m sure that a lot of victims suffer deep distress when giving evidence. Her death throws into sharp relief the way the courts deal with vulnerable victims of sexual abuse. The criminal justice system has to understand not only that sexual abuse can leave a deep wound, but that it will reopen when probed, and to probe is the job the courts embark upon in every such trial. So victims need expert support. I find it extraordinary that support for Frances seems to have been profoundly lacking. The police advised her for two years not to have counselling for the trauma until after the trial. Why? Their theory may be that, unless the pain of having being abused comes out, the jury will be unimpressed by her evidence. So she must be kept in pain. Frances appears not even to have been kept informed of when the trial was taking place until shortly before it opened and must have felt unsupported by the system she was putting herself at stake to assist. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Michael Brewer, 68, left, and his . ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, right, were both found guilty of sexually . assaulting a former student of his, Frances Andrade, 30 years ago . Who can tell what she went through in . her own mind as she gave evidence of the most personal nature against . an evil man? She faced allegations of lying and being a fantasist. That . cannot have been easy. We . thought we had left behind those dark days when rape victims would be . routinely humiliated in court, but maybe we haven’t left them far enough . behind. Routine: Kate Blackwell represented Michael Brewer and cross-examined Frances Andrade during the trial at Manchester Crown Court . Defence barristers routinely ask for counselling notes to be disclosed to them so that they can go through them to find any vulnerabilities – the CPS can ask the judge ahead of the trial to refuse but they rarely apply to do so and judges on the whole don’t stop them being handed over. This is the other reason why police might try to deter counselling. I was not in court when Frances was cross-examined but her plea ‘This feels like rape all over again’ shows how agonising she found it. Clearly Brewer and his ex-wife were basing the case on the fact that she was a fantasist and Kay Brewer’s barrister had to ask the questions, but it is self-evident how offensive this must have been to Frances and her family. I do think that we have improved the legal system since Baroness Stern’s landmark review of rape cases. But we have a long way to go. We need to treat all victims as gently as we treat patients and be  truthful to them ahead of a trial about what it will entail. Otherwise we risk deterring them from coming forward. We need to discover who gave Frances the shameful advice not  to have counselling, and why the police and Crown Prosecution Service did not ensure she understood what was going to happen when she was cross-examined. We must urgently look at how we try rape cases. It is the least that we can do for Frances now.","Mother of four was groomed from the age of 14 by her music teacher .

'It's obviously come as a huge shock to us all and we're still trying to come to terms with it all. I'd please ask that my family's privacy is respected during this very difficult time.' Mrs Jackson’s parents, Joyce, 65 and Duncan, 66, from Twynholm in Dumfries and Galloway, were on holiday in Australia when the incident occurred and were understood to be flying back to the UK. Police said they had attended Mrs Jackson’s home in Crossmichael, Castle Douglas, in the early hours of yesterday morning but confirmed that, although, enquiries continued, there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances. A report is now being prepared for the Procurator Fiscal. The 42-year-old racing star’s elder bother, Duncan, yesterday declined to comment at the family home, which sits next to the motoring museum Lynsay helped to found. The former Formula 1 driver appeared on BBC One's Saturday Kitchen Live yesterday, and is understood to have been told about his sister's death before the programme began. His agent James Williamson confirmed to MailOnline today: 'He found out just before he went on air.' Residents in Twynholm were stunned to learn of the devastating news.

The Monte Carlo-based racer and his only sister were known to be particularly close and always liked to keep in touch. In 2001, he honoured her with ‘her . dream birthday present’ when he dedicated his first victory of the . season in Sao Paulo to her. Just . days earlier the then 24 year-old had moaned about not receiving a . birthday present from her brother but was reduced to tears when she . later saw him on television saying his win in Brazil was in her honour. Speaking . at the time, she said: ‘I phoned David last Tuesday to wish him a happy . 30th birthday and he said he had not managed to get me a present. ‘I was a bit miffed so when he won in Brazil and announced it was dedicated to me it was the best birthday present ever.’ She . added: ‘We watched the race on a German channel and they have breaks . which seem to last half an hour so we kept having to phone home to . Twynholm. When David finished the final lap we were ecstatic.’ Close: Mrs Jackson and the Monte Carlo-based racer and his only sister were known to be particularly close, and she previously ran the family's motoring museum . After his win, the Scottish driver said: ‘It was my sister’s birthday and she asked me for a win, so I dedicate this race to her. This is my 10th win and the best feeling I have had after a victory.’ Previously, the driver talked of his sister’s own impressive driving skills. He said: ‘There’s no reason at all why women should not race with men. There’s no physical or reaction reason. It just hasn’t happened because more boys get in to it and through that process, it ends up being more men.’ Coulthard was the only one of the familiy’s three children to take up racing driving, even though their father installed 100cc racing carts for each of his three offspring. Nine years ago, the driver, his sister and brother were united at the funeral of their grandmother, Margaret Coulthard, 88, who died in a care home in 2004. At the time, an onlooker said: ‘It is obvious they are a close family and there’s no way David wouldn’t have come here today. The man is a true gent.

The woman was going at such speed that the train continued for nearly 100 feet off-rail before it smashed into the apartment block where three families were asleep. Scroll down for video . Going off the rails: The stolen train carried on after the tracks finished - and crashed into the apartment block . The train-thief was trapped inside the driver's cabin for two hours before emergency services were able to cut her from the wreckage. She was conscious but suffered serious injuries and had to be airlifted to Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. The train was empty and stationary at the time of the theft and none of the five adults reportedly in . the house at the time of the accident were hurt. Train operators Arriva said the woman, who was employed by an external cleaning company, 'really put her foot down'. ‘The train drove straight through the . barrier, so it must have been going a lot faster than these trains . normally do,’ spokesman for Stockholm's Lokaltrafik Fredrik . Cavalli-Björkman said, adding that at normal speed, the train would have . been blocked by the buffer stop. Unconventional alarm: Five people were asleep inside the building when the train smashed into a kitchen at around 2.30am, none were injured . Trapped: The 20-year-old cleaner was stuck inside the wreckage for two hours and had to be taken to hospital where she is in a stable condition . Full frontal: The train was empty of passengers and stationary when it was stolen at 2am Tuesday morning . Viking public transport: Despite snow and the derailed train, service on the line returned to normal this morning . He added: ‘The trains should not be out and . about this late. We are investigating what had happened, who has got the . key and access to these trains.’ 'It's like something out of a movie,' said police spokesman Robert Heurgren. 'We received notification of a . missing train early on Tuesday morning and the next thing it is found . smashed into a home.' Police commander Ulf Lindgren said: 'The fact that we’re not dealing with a . more serious accident is absolutely unbelievable, both for those who . were inside the building and on the train. 'It’s incredible lucky that the situation . isn't worse.' It is not clear how the woman got hold of the . keys to start the train’s engine, but a rail technician at the scene this morning told newspaper Expressen that one of his colleagues ‘lost the keys to this train, is in a . bad state and is blaming himself’. Non-stop: The house is located near the end of the line, but the train was going at such speed that it continued 100ft beyond the barrier and into a kitchen in the apartment building . End of the line: When the tracks finished, the train continued . Stuck in: Emergency services discuss how to begin the removal of the train, firmly embedded inside the building . The first person at the scene was artist . Richard Herrey, known as a third of 1984 Eurovision Song Contest winners . Herrey’s, who lives nearby. 'I am shaking a little bit', he told . Swedish newspaper Expressen. ‘It is a bit scary that a train can jump . that far out and into a residential house.' It was reported this morning that the woman is in a stable condition and at 9am Stockholm Police arrested her for destruction endangering the public. Police and emergency workers are currently working on stabilising the apartment block to prevent the building's collapse before they can remove the wreckage.","20-year-old cleaner stole train and crashed it into apartment in Stockholm .

Accused: Raja Pervaiz Ashraf is accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects as well as of buying property in London with money earned through corruption in various scams . Pakistan was plunged deeper into political turmoil today as the country's Supreme Court ordered the arrest of its Prime Minister on charges of corruption involving private power stations. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf is accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects and of buying property in London with money earned through various shady deals. He is alleged to have committed the crimes during his reign as minister for water and power before he became the country's premier. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The prime minister's adviser, Fawad Chaudhry, condemned the court's order, calling it unconstitutional. The announcement comes as thousands of supporters of a fiery Pakistani cleric who has been calling for election reforms descended onto capital Islamabad, as security officials girded for mass rallies by a movement that has virtually overnight become a powerful but still mysterious force on the political scene. The dramatic entry into Pakistani politics of Tahir-ul-Qadri, a preacher who until recently lived abroad in Canada and had only a modest local following, has galvanized supporters looking for reforms but worried detractors who fear he'll derail upcoming elections. Also on Monday, thousands of Shiites finally ended a three-day long protest in the southwestern city of Quetta in which they demanded better security following an attack that killed 86 people. They had blocked a main road with dozens of the victims' coffins, and finally agreed to bury their relatives after Pakistan's leaders dismissed the government of surrounding Baluchistan province. Groundswell: The announcement comes as thousands of supporters of fiery Pakistani cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri who has been calling for election reforms descended onto capital Islamabad . Supporters: Qadri has galvanised Pakistani supporters who believe the current government has succeeded in bringing little but electricity blackouts, unemployment, terror attacks and corruption to the country . The protest was launched in the wake . of a twin bombing at a billiards hall Thursday that targeted members of . the minority Shiite sect. The demonstrators demanded the provincial . government be dismissed and the army take over responsibility for the . city. Prime Minister Ashraf said in a . televised address shortly after midnight on Sunday that the governor, . who is appointed by the central government, would take over in . Baluchistan, replacing the chief minister elected by the provincial . assembly. Also, paramilitary forces will . receive police powers and launch an operation against militants behind . the billiards hall attack. The national government is also worried about security in Islamabad in advance of Qadri's protest. Thousands of police have been deployed in the city, and officers in riot gear are manning the main roads and streets. Authorities used shipping containers to block off the part of Islamabad where most government offices and embassies are located. Protests: Also on Monday, thousands of Shiites finally ended a three-day long protest in the southwestern city of Quetta in which they demanded better security following an attack that killed 86 people . Sacked: The protesters had blocked a main road with dozens of the victims' coffins, and finally agreed to bury their relatives after Pakistan's leaders dismissed the government of surrounding Baluchistan province . About 15,000 of Qadri's supporters . left Sunday in hundreds of vehicles from the eastern city of Lahore, . where the headquarters of his Minhaj-ul-Quran organization are located. They are expected to arrive in Islamabad later Monday, as more . supporters join the rally along the way. Television . footage showed the marchers crowded into buses and vehicles with . Pakistani flags flying as they made their way toward the capital. Even before Qadri arrived in the . capital, thousands rallied on the main avenue running through Islamabad . that leads to the government headquarters. Members of the march set up a . make-shift stage on top of one of the shipping containers that were . supposed to block their way. Male protesters gathered on one side of the avenue while women and children were on the other, divided by a grass median. Devastation: The double suicide blast tore through a crowded market place on January 10 . Carnage: A bomb disposal squad member checks the site of the blast in Quetta . Many of the protesters waved Pakistani flags or photos of Qadri, while songs on religious themes or in praise of Qadri blared through a loudspeaker. The crowd appeared to be a mix of longtime Qadri followers and new supporters who had been inspired by his anti-government message. 'He feels pain for the people while the government feels no pain for the people,' said Faizan Baig from the northern city of Abbottabad. The 23-year-old said he had come to Islamabad the night before and slept in a shrine on the outskirts of the city. Qadri's rhetoric has invigorated many Pakistanis like Baig who are angry at the current administration whose five years in office ends this spring. They say the current government has succeeded in bringing little but electricity blackouts, unemployment, terror attacks and corruption. Qadri returned to Pakistan in December after living for years in Canada, where he's also a citizen. He heads a religious network in Lahore and gained some international prominence by writing a 2010 fatwa, or religious opinion, condemning terrorism.","Raja Pervaiz Ashraf is accused of receiving kickbacks to secure projects .

The remarkable image of Russell Murphy, 26, kissing Alexis Creque, 28, as the couple were led into Manhattan Criminal Court by police officers last August was an online hit. Murphy was back in the New York court yesterday and admitted two misdemeanours - possession of a graffiti instrument and criminal mischief - and was sentenced to eight days of community service. Modern day Bonnie and Clyde: This photograph of Russell Murphy and Alexis Creque was an online hit . He had been arrested with Creque while spraying 'CASH4' on Williamsburg Bridge, and was charged with the offence. Murphy was later changed in connection with tags on Manhattan Bridge and a building in Eldridge Street. His plea entered this week covered all three cases, although he still face charges in connection with graffiti in Brooklyn and Queens. But if Murphy stays out of trouble for the next year, the offences will be reduced to a violation and wiped from his record. Sentenced: Murphy was given eight hours community service by Manhattan Criminal Court . The Daily News recorded his lawyer, Stacey Richmad, as saying: 'Ultimately my client should be left with no criminal record and be able to continue on with his life. She added that it is 'unfortunate; that Murphy will be 'forever shackled' because of the photograph. The photographer, Mo Gelder, from Brooklyn, wanted to enter the picture into Canon's prestigious competition, Project Imagina10, but has been refused permission by the couple. His image drew comparisons with Bonnie Parker and Clyde Chestnut Barrow, notorious outlaws from the United States' Great Depression era of the 1930s.

The young lovers Bonnie and Clyde went on a crime-spree over the course of two years and were romanticised by some sections of the public - with many viewing them as Robin Hood-like figures. Street photographer Mr Gelder had been outside the court last August to take a picture of the accused Manhattan Madam, Anna Gristina. He was standing next to dozens of other snappers but happened to be looking in the right direction. Charges against Creque are pending.

Injured: Alleged bomb-maker Martin Middleton has lost fingers in an incident at home on Sunday . A bungling bomb maker blew off part of his hand when a home-made explosive went off at his house. Martin Middleton is in hospital being treated for his injuries while under police arrest. It is thought the 26-year-old, who is in a ‘stable’ condition, has lost several fingers following the incident on Sunday. Mr Middleton had apparently been making a pipebomb, although police, who are waiting to interview to him, are unsure why. Up to 40 homes had to be evacuated following the explosion in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Neighbours were today shocked to hear about the explosion, which could have had lethal consequences. Mr Middleton is soon to become a father after his girlfriend Kay Emerson fell pregnant. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I couldn’t believe when I heard, it’s like something out of a movie. 'His girlfriend is pregnant, I thought he was getting his life back on track.' Another, who also wanted to remain anonymous, added: 'I see him now an again, he looks like a nice enough lad, he always says hello. 'Shocking to hear that.' Police searched two other properties in the Tonge Moor area of Bolton as part of the investigation but no explosive items were found. Officers went to a house a few doors away, which is thought to be where Mr Middleton’s mother lives. He had recently moved to the same street with his girlfriend. Address: This is the home where Martin Middleton blew off part of his hand after allegedly making a pipebomb . Mr Middleton’s injury is described as a ‘serious hand injury’ but it is not life threatening, although it is believed he has lost some of his fingers. Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Jackson, said: 'I appreciate that given the nature of this incident and the impact it had, that there will be some concern among residents, but I want to reiterate that this was an isolated incident and there was not and is not any threat to the wider community. 'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances leading up to this incident and if anyone has any information that can assist I would urge them to get in touch.' Mudasir Dean, ward councillor for Bradshaw, said: 'I am sure the police will get to the bottom of this. 'We must find out why this bomb was built.

Patricia Goodband has been missing since mid-December and detectives said they have discovered a body at her home . Detectives searching for the body of a missing businesswoman discovered human remains near her home today. Patricia Goodband, 76, was the director of a building supplies company that she ran from her home in Woodham, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. She was reported missing on January 9 but had not been seen since the middle of December. Police said the body, which has not yet been formally identified, was found in Woodham. Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The body was found on land at Akeman House in Woodham this afternoon. 'Scenes of crime officers and a forensic archaeologist are continuing to work at the location. 'The recovery of the body will understandably take some time and we will not be able to carry out a formal identification until this process has been completed.

This baby red deer appears to be in the middle of an identity crisis, as he has convinced himself he is a lamb and has joined a flock of sheep. Shepherd Andrew Capell was shocked when he was counting his animals and noticed the male fawn had joined his 100 livestock on Dunwich Heath in Suffolk. Mr Capell, who looks after the sheep which help maintain the National Trust land by grazing on it, said the lost deer became separated from its herd and attached itself to the flock. Scroll down for video . Good friends: This baby red deer has lost his own herd so has joined a flock of sheep instead, and appears to be settling in well . One of the gang: The fawn (centre) has been widely welcomed by the rest of the flock, although his shepherd says he is towards the bottom of the pecking order . He has been living, eating and sleeping with his 100 new friends for about two weeks now and shows no sign of leaving. The sheep do not seem to mind their new guest and have adopted him into the flock, giving him a warm welcome. 'I was counting the sheep when I spotted this little deer amongst the flock,' said Mr Capell. 'I think what's happened is that the main herd of deer have come through the field, jumped over the fence and then jumped out again and he's not gone with them. 'He seems to have adopted the flock and stayed with them and the flock have taken to him really well. 'There's a bit of a pecking order in the flock so he's finding his place within it. He sees to be the bottom of the ladder. 'He does seem to miss the sheep if he's too far away from them and does go looking for them.' Cunfused: Shepherd Andrew Capell says that the deer seems convinced he is a lamb after a fortnight with them . Bonding: The deer has spent two weeks eating, drinking and sleeping with the 100 sheep is fully integrated . Sad: When the sheep move on to new pastures later this year, sadly the deer will be left behind . The National Trust had only recently moved the 100 sheep north from Orford Ness National Nature Reserve, where the fields become flooded with shallow water in the winter and so are too wet for the sheep to graze. The deer now spends his day grazing with the sheep and does not seem to have noticed his lack of woolly coat or inability to bleat. He even sleeps in the field with the flock at night. 'I've never known of this happening before,' added Mr Capell. 'The big deer spend a lot of time in the field when the sheep are away in the summer and two winters ago we had a yearling in the field for two days but that did not hang around with the sheep.' Surprise! 'I was counting the sheep when I spotted this little deer amongst the flock,' said shepherd Mr Capell . But sadly the young animal will not be able to stay a 'sheep deer' forever. At the end of the winter the sheep will be taken back to their summer home, but the deer will have to stay behind on Dunwich Heath. A spokesman for the National Trust added: 'It is hoped the young deer will rejoin his herd if they roam past the flock over the coming weeks.'","The confused deer has joined a flock on National Trust land in Suffolk .

It has been four years since readers were last sucked into the mysterious world of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. But he will reappear in May when Dan Brown releases his new novel, based on the hidden clues in medieval poet Dante’s Inferno. His first book since The Lost Symbol in 2009 is named after Dante’s poem and will be set in Italy. Thriller: Dan Brown (pictured) signing copies of bestseller The Da Vinci Code. His latest novel, Inferno, will be released in May . Its title was revealed on Mr Brown’s website in puzzle form. Every time a Twitter user tweeted ‘#DanBrownTODAY’ a tiny piece of the puzzle appeared, until a mosaic was created spelling out ‘Inferno’. Like The Da Vinci Code, which was based on theories about the secret history of the Mona Lisa, Inferno will examine the deeper meanings of Dante’s poem and its influence on modern life. It is thought the author could inflame religious controversy – as he did with The Da Vinci Code when he suggested Jesus and Mary Magdelene had had children – by expanding on Dante’s criticism of church leaders. ‘Although I studied Dante’s Inferno as a student, it wasn’t until recently, while researching in Florence, that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante’s work on the modern world,’ Mr Brown said. Mystery: The Da Vinci Code was transformed into a hit film starring Tom Hanks (left) and Audrey Tautou (right) Inferno (Italian for Hell) is the first part of Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem The Divine Comedy. It is an allegory telling of the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine circles of suffering located within the Earth. The Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul towards God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin. ‘With this new novel, I am excited to . take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm…a landscape of . codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways.’ The author’s editor Jason Kaufman . said: ‘When we turn the first page of a new Dan Brown novel, we step . into a world that seamlessly infuses fascinating history, art, symbols . and puzzles. In Inferno, we have the added . excitement of following Robert Langdon back to the heart of Europe, . where he becomes entwined in a mystery that has global ramifications.’ Four million copies of Inferno will initially be published in the UK, the US and Canada on May 14. The book will be the fourth in the . series featuring protagonist Robert Langdon, which started with Angels . and Demons in 2000, followed by The Da Vinci Code in 2003 and The Lost . Symbol in 2009. Mr Brown has sold more than 200million copies of his novels, including 80million copies of The Da Vinci Code. Dan Brown has been credited with keeping the publishing industry afloat as well as renewing interest in Leonardo da Vinci (pictured) The son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was born in 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire, and raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate of Amherst College, a private liberal arts college in Massachusetts, and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing. His novels, including The Da Vinci Code which has become one of the best selling novels of all time, is the subject of heated debate among readers and scholars. In 2005, he was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with 'keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.'","Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon set to make a reappearance .

A large cuddly toy left on a grass bank triggered an alert that a large black cat may be on the loose. Eagle-eyed Marc Peacock-Smith contacted his local paper after spotting what appears to be the outline of a black panther-like creature lying on a grass verge outside Thorpe Wood police station in Longthorpe, Cambridgeshire. Mr Peacock-Smith, who had just been dropping off his son at nursery, said he had to stop when he saw the 'animal' and take a picture. Cat or cuddly toy? Marc Peacock-Smith took this picture of a 'panther-like creature' lying outside Thorpe Wood Police Station in Longthorpe, Cambridgeshire . He said it thought it was bizarre because it was right outside the police station. He told the Peterborough Telegraph: 'I was driving along to drop my son off at nursery when I saw what looked like the biggest black cat or panther sat on a verge right outside the police station. 'I stopped my car for a few seconds so I could take a picture on my mobile phone. I didn't get out of my car and I must have been about 10 metres or so away from it. It just sat there. I'm sure other people saw it too. 'My reaction was intrigue more than anything, I just thought it was really odd. I wasn't convinced it was real because it didn't seem to be moving.' The real thing: But the cuddly toy turned out to be no where near as dangerous as an actual panther . A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said officers had received a call on Monday afternoon from someone reporting a Puma walking along a grass verge in Thorpe Road, Longthorpe. However, the spokesman added that a very large stuffed toy cat had been seen in the same area earlier the same day. Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, said: 'This looks to me like a large cuddly toy.' The sighting rekindled speculation about the mythical 'Beast of Bretton' - a large black cat reputedly sighted in Peterborough and most recently spotted on a footpath in Mallard Road, Bretton, by Royal Mail worker Clive Williams in August 2011. Mr Bamping added: 'There are hundreds, if not thousands of big cat sightings reported in Britain every year - some people are mistaken. Some are clearly not big cats but a large majority either are or go unexplained.' He said sightings are widespread and occur in every county, fuelled partly by the fact such 'big cats' are able to cover 25km to 35km in one night in search of shelter, food or a mate. In August last year, there was a reported sighting of a big cat in Gloucester after a local took a blurry picture of a furry black figure sprinting through woodland in Nailsworth. Months earlier, nearby resident Coryn Memory released footage showing a 6ft-long beast stalking through fields close by. She claims to have first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in Thrupp, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in July 2009 and says she has seen it five times since. A previous 'Panther' sighting: This picture taken in February 2012 shows a furry black figure sprinting through woodland near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire . Carcasses of deer, sheep and wallabies have been found strewn across the county several times last year, with some suggesting it lends credence to the theory a big cat is on the loose. Another famous case was that of the 'Essex Lion ' after holidaymakers at caravan park nesr Clacton in Essex claimed to have spotted a lion in nearby fields. The culprit was believed to be a three-year-old moggie called Teddy Bear, owned by Ginny Murphy, who said he does look quite lion-like. A Maine Coon, which is the largest domestic cat breed and can weigh up to 25lb, Teddy Bear lives near the caravan park and likes wandering around in the field where witnesses claimed they'd seen the lion.

In what was described as a victory against art 'snobbery', 80 pieces of his work - including eight rarely unseen landscapes - will be displayed at the Tate Britain in June. Lowry is loved for his ‘matchstick men’ depictions of everyday life in North of England in the first half of 20th-century Britain. But a major retrospective of his work has not been shown in the capital since his death in 1976. Lowry's The Football Match is a typical example of the artist's depictions of everyday life in the north of England . His art has previously been dismissed as . the work of a ‘Sunday painter’ by high-brow critics, with some saying . he could ‘barely paint’. The Tate holds 23 Lowry pieces - 16 paper drawings are readily available to visitors but only one painting, Industrial Landscape (1955), has been on display in London in the past 20 years. The gallery has previously been criticised by actor Sir Ian McKellen and Oasis star Noel Gallagher for being biased against the Lancaster-born artist. Sir Ian told a 2011 documentary it was ‘a shame, verging on the iniquitous, that foreign visitors to London shouldn’t have access to the painter English people like more than most others’. In the same film, artist Dame Paula Rego described reaction to him as ‘a great snobbery’. Yesterday Art historians TJ Clark and Anne Wagner, who worked on the exhibition, said it was time to ‘reassess’ Lowry’s place in British art. Mr Clark said: ‘It is absolutely extraordinary to me that the image of him as an amateur, as truly someone who could barely paint, just won’t die. ‘Coded into that is a deep conviction of the metropolitan elite that someone who spends their life painting that subject matter can’t be taken seriously.’ Tate Britain Director Penelope Curtis said the exhibition would be ‘serious, authentic and not cynical’ and Lowry needed to be ‘reconciled to art history’. Sir Ian would be invited to the opening, she added.

A father-of-three has lost a whopping 18 stone after fearing he would not be around long enough to watch his sons grow up. Wayne Robinson, 37, ballooned to a whopping 31 stone, and had a BMI of 59 - almost three times what it should be. And after he started skipping doctors appointments - fearing he was too fat to be examined - he realised that he was living on borrowed time. The father-of-three, who used to weigh 31 stone (left), lost a massive 18 stone after fearing he would not get to see his sons grow up . Mr Robinson realised he was on borrowed time after he started skipping medical appointments for fear he was too fat to be examined, which prompted the dramatic change . After ditching takeaways and signing up to a diet plan, Mr Robinson soon started to shed the pounds - and just nine months later, weighs a healthy 13st 4lb. Mr Robinson, from Currock, Carlisle, said: 'I was a ticking time bomb, but still that wasn't enough to make me lose weight. 'What really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a dad. 'I vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a BMI of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy BMI around 25 - and mine was much, much higher. 'That made me realise that I was living on borrowed time. 'My life had come to the point where I was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations. Mr Robinson, pictured with his sons William aged 14, Harry aged 11 and Finley aged 4, ditched the takeaways and signed up to a diet plan to make the incredible weight loss in just nine months . 'I never went to my sons' parents' evenings, as I was worried about them being bullied about my size. 'And I would always avoid going on planes - as I was terrified I'd have to ask for a seatbelt extension.' But now, Mr Robinson's wife Sam, 37, and sons William, 14, Harry, 11, and Finley, four, couldn't be prouder of their newly-slim husband and dad. The pounds had slowly crept on over the years while Wayne was working at a desk job for travel agent Thomas Cook. He said: 'I signed up to the LighterLife Weight Loss Management system, and I lost about half a stone a week. 'It has completely transformed my life. 'The change has been unbelievable and not just physically. Inside I am a completely different person. 'I'd had no major health scare to speak of, although at the size I was I generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors. 'But I was in denial for many years, because with a BMI of 59 it wasn't a case of if I fell ill, it was when. 'I'd lost my mum in my mid 20s to bowel cancer and I just didn't want that for my boys. I wanted to be around to see them grow up. 'Because of my mum's early death, when I reached 35, I was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure the cancer could be caught early if I was unlucky enough to have it as well. 'I'd received the letter from the hospital but I was so worried that the hospital wouldn't be able to do it because of the size of me that I didn't go. 'Even though I knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it wasn't detected earlier, the embarrassment and fear kept me away. I never want to feel like that again. 'I'm the miraculous shrinking man - my weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations.'","Father-of-three Wayne Robinson feared he might not see his sons grow up .

From the world's mightiest and most elusive creatures, to spectacular landscapes in the farthest flung corners of the globe, National Geographic has been capturing the wonder and diversity of our planet and its inhabitants for more than a century. The publication is now celebrating its landmark 125th anniversary with a showcase of some of the most iconic and recognizable images to have graced its pages over the years. The stunning series of photographs span decades and continents, from a trio of men on camels in the shadow of Egypt's pyramids in 1938, to the arresting beauty of a young Afghan refugee captured on camera in Pakistan in 1985. King of the jungle: A mighty lion finds a place for a nap amid the branches of a tree in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, where the creatures are often spotted sleeping high above the ground in fig trees . Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world. It has funded more than 10,000 scientific research, conservation and exploration projects around the globe. The magazine is celebrating its 125th anniversary . Having started out as a scholarly journal in the 19th Century, the magazine has evolved into a publication that shines a spotlight on distant corners of the globe for millions of readers, with its combination of breathtaking photography and on-the-ground reporting. Steve McCurry's photograph of young Afghan refugee Sharbat Gula is perhaps the image most associated with National Geographic. Sharbat, whose piercing green eyes captured the attention of the globe when her solemn face appeared on the cover of the magazine in 1985, was around 12-years-old and living in Pakistan when the picture was taken during Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. For years she was known simply as 'the Afghan Girl', until the photograph's striking subject was formally identified in 2002. A look back through the National Geographic photo archives offers a glimpse into landmark moments in the history of countries around the world. One 1963 image features two members of the first U.S. team to reach the summit of Mount Everest trudging through the dazzling white snow as they make their ascent. The American expedition was sponsored in part by the National Geographic Society, and pioneered a new route to the summit of one of the world's most daunting peaks. But it is not always humans that feature in the journal's most spectacular photographs. In many of National Geographic's stunning pictures, it is animals, not people, that take centre stage. Photographer Paul Nicklen managed to capture a rare 'spirit bear' enjoying a feast of salmon in the rainforest in British Columbia in 2010. Also known as the Kermode bear, the elusive creature is a variant of the North American Black Bear that is born with white fur. Another picture reveals an enormous lion, lit up in the African dusk, stares down the lens of the camera as it prepares to bed down for a sleep amid the branches of a fig tree in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park. One heart-warming photograph, which captures a fleeting moment of contact between Jane Goodall and a baby chimpanzee, reveals the bond that can exist between animals and humans. Photographer Hugo Van Lawick snapped the photograph as the chimp, which was named Flint, reached out to Jane at Gombe Stream National Park in western Tanzania. Now 78, British primatologist Jane famously spent 45 years studying the interactions of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania.

Former British Army officer Robert Jolleys arrives at Swindon Crown Court, where he is accused of expenses fraud . A senior officer fraudulently claimed nearly £220,000 from the Army to send his children to a top public school, it was alleged in court yesterday. Former Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jolleys is said to have pretended he was still with his wife Judith after the couple had split up in order to claim the ‘eye-watering’ amount of cash. The change in circumstances meant he would no longer have been entitled to claim from the Army’s education fund. His three sons Rupert, now 22, Charles, 20 and William, 15, were being sent to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. One of the most prestigious Catholic boarding schools in Britain, it charges fees of £28,000 a year. Despite no longer qualifying for the benefit when he ceased to be main financial provider after the break-up in 2002, Jolleys claimed the benefit for seven further years, a jury was told. It was only a chance phone call by his wife to the Army that uncovered the fact Jolleys was no longer married. He is also alleged to have ‘bullied’ his former partner to help him maintain the pretence. Swindon Crown Court was told how Jolleys – a ‘highly intelligent and clever man’– would not have been able to fund his sons through the school without the swindled money. The jury heard how Jolleys carried out the fraud while working for the Directorate of Education Training Services for the Army in Swindon. Prosecutor Nicolas Gerasimidis said Jolleys did not inform the MoD of the change of circumstances to claim cash from the Army’s Continuous Educational Allowance, which pays 90 per cent of fees in certain circumstances. It was in 2009 the deception was uncovered by accident. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘Judith phoned his base to find out where he was and she told officers she was no longer married to Jolleys. ‘This was a surprise to his superiors.’ The court heard that following the separation Jolleys, continued to live in quarters specifically for serving members of the Forces who were married. The jury heard how Jolleys tried to ‘bully’ his wife into supporting the claim. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘He bullied her and provided her with a document which told her what to say.’ Records also showed Jolleys attempted to file a retrospective application in an attempt to change his status to reveal he was separated. But this was rejected by Army personnel. Jolleys, of Whalley, Lancashire, denies 11 counts of deception and fraud between 2002 and 2009. The alleged bogus claims totalling £218,094.11 were made at bases where Jolleys was serving in Upavon, Oxfordshire, and Harrogate, Yorkshire. The trial continues.

During the hearing Coral sat less than 10ft away from the defendant, and was seen wiping tears from her eyes with a tissue.

The pictures included the first picture of the family all together. Coral said: 'April I love you so . much, I cant stop crying today when I look at your lovely pictures that . have been taken by me and the families.

Millions of pounds is being wasted on government reviews and consultations, MPs said yesterday. The . Coalition has opened 984 inquiries – more than one for each day it has . been in power – into issues as diverse as ice-cream van chimes and the . electronic monitoring of pigs. Other . reviews include whether street sweepers should require qualifications . and whether mothers should be able to use vouchers to buy frozen . vegetables. MPs have said millions of pounds is being wasted after an investigation found the Coalition opened 984 inquiries since coming into power . Richard . Bacon, a Tory member of the Commons public accounts committee, . yesterday called on the National Audit Office to investigate, perhaps . not seeing the irony of his request. ‘The . huge scale of these reviews raises questions, and I wouldn’t discourage . the NAO from looking at this area,’ he said. ‘On this scale they must . have serious financial implications, with hundreds of civil servants . being diverted to work on them. ‘These . reviews could lead to delay and sclerosis inside departments, because . civil servants will be hanging around waiting, rather than taking . action. ‘I would be very interested in knowing from the NAO how much this all costs and how effective and economic it is.’ Critics . say the figures show David Cameron has broken a pledge to slash the . number of pointless reviews. Late last year the Prime Minister vowed to . ‘cut through the dither’, adding: ‘If there is no need for a . consultation, don’t have one.’ Yet . a year after saying in 2011: ‘It is hard to believe we need government . regulations on issues such as ice-cream van jingles’, his government set . up a consultation on the very same issue. The Coalition has opened more than one inquiry for each day it has been in power, while George Osborne's Treasury alone has set up 84 reviews . An inquiry was opened into how long ice-cream van chimes should ring for and where they should be able to ring, but there has been no response from the Government in six months . An investigation by The Times found that many of the 984 reviews have not yet been acted upon. The . survey of the 15 largest Whitehall departments showed that almost a . third of the consultations set up since 2010 had still not received an . official response. Bernard . Jenkin, Tory chairman of the public administration committee, called on . parliamentary select committees to ask individual departments for . explanations. ‘It is . staggering that the Government should spend so much time and money and . produce so few outcomes,’ he said. ‘This gives the term “kicked into the . long grass” a new reality. The government has also looked into whether pig farmers should inform councils about the movements of their animals by letter or e-mail . ‘The Prime Minister complains rightly . about dithering and inaction but Whitehall seems to be institutionally . predisposed to dithering and inaction by review and consultation. This . could be costing tens of millions of pounds.’ The . 17,000-word review into ice cream van chimes, sent to 23 organisations, . asked the public how long chimes should ring for, where they should . ring and until what time. One question asked whether chimes should be played after 8pm because children’s bedtimes are getting later. Twelve . months on, ministers have still not come to a decision on the . less-than-pressing issue. A consultation by the Department for Transport . was prompted by a one-man campaign to save a railway committee that . decides which artefacts should be saved for the nation. Labour . peer Lord Faulkner of Worcester made a plea in the House of Lords that . the eight-man Railway Heritage Committee, which costs £100,000 a year, . be saved from the bonfire of the quangos. A consultation was launched and all 32 respondents supported the plan to move the committee’s role to the Science Museum. Another consultation into Cornish wine received no responses at all. Andrew . Haldenby, director of the Reform think-tank, said: ‘David Cameron . promised a post-bureaucratic age but his record in government is very . different.’ George . Osborne’s Treasury has set up 84 reviews, Vince Cable’s Department for . Business 61, the Department for Work and Pensions has set up 73 and the .

A family of five had a lucky escape after arriving home to find their bathroom ablaze after sunlight reflected from a shaving mirror set their towels alight. Pregnant mother-of-three Kate Liew arrived home to find her house in Bristol filled with smoke and her bathroom towels ablaze. Mrs Liew, 35, called the fire service who were initially baffled as to how the fire could have started. Hazard: Pregnant Kate and her husband Alli Liew, pictured left, found their Bristol house filled with smoke after a magnifying shaving mirror, pictured right, left near a window caused a towel to catch fire . But after checks on the electrics proved fine, investigators believe the fire had been started by sun reflecting onto a towel from a nearby high-magnification shaving mirror. The full time mother, who is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, said: 'I got home on Friday afternoon and there was a strong smell and I could see smoke. 'As I went upstairs the smoke got thicker but luckily the fire was over by the time I got home, as there was nowhere for it to spread. 'The towel had been completely destroyed by the fire - it was just a heap of ashes. It was very lucky that it had not caught onto something else. 'The fire service arrived and were baffled as to what happened. Initially it was thought it must have been something to do with the electrics. 'The light fitting for the pull cord was burnt and smoke damaged so we thought that must be right. But the fire service checked and there was nothing wrong with the electrics. 'A fire officer then told me it could be the sun coming through the window, reflecting off the shaving mirror and then onto a flammable towel. 'I cleaned the bathroom that morning and moved the mirror so the magnifying side was facing the window.' Lucky escape: The couple - pictured with their three children, Alfie aged five, Olly aged eight and Freddie aged three - called the fire brigade before the blaze managed to spread further . Mrs Liew, who lives with husband Allister, 34, and children Ollie, eight, Alfie, five and Freddie, three, added: 'It's important that people are aware of the dangers these mirrors can pose. 'I have three young children to look after and we are lucky that the towel did not set fire to anything else. 'The fire service, who were absolutely brilliant, certainly thinks we had a very lucky escape. 'These magnifying mirrors are common now in many bathrooms and can be bought very cheaply. 'I feel that the public need to be warned of this fire hazard risk, and perhaps manufacturers should put a warning on their mirrors. 'They put warning signs on cups of coffee to say they are hot so why not explain the fire risk on bathroom mirrors?' Avon Fire and Rescue are now advising householders to think about the positioning of magnifying mirrors, in relation to windows, and to consider any possible fire hazards which could be caused by the sun being reflected by these mirrors. A spokesman for Avon Fire and Rescue service said: 'At 2.42pm on Friday we were called to a private house in Chelsea Park, Easton, where there had been a small fire involving a towel on an electric hand-rail. 'It is believed that the fire happened sometime between 9am and 2pm that day in a converted en-suite bathroom situated in the loft of the building. 'It is believed that the fire may have been accidentally started as a result of the sun being reflected onto the hanging towel by a high-magnification shaving mirror nearby. 'Crews provided fire safety advice to the occupiers of the property. Householders are being advised to think about the positioning of magnifying mirrors, in relation to windows, and to consider any possible fire hazards which could be caused by the sun being reflected by these mirrors.'","Pregnant Kate Liew arrived home to find her house filled with smoke .

All pupils should study for GCSE-style qualifications in good manners, kindness and self-control says Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College . All pupils should study for GCSE-style qualifications in good manners, kindness and self-control, says a leading headmaster. Schools should devote as much attention to developing children’s ‘character’ as preparing them for exams, according to Dr Anthony Seldon. In a speech next week, Dr Seldon, the master of fee-paying Wellington College in Berkshire, will call for pupils to be taught the importance of traditional manners, punctuality, kindness, tidiness, self-control, responsibility, determination, resilience and appreciation. He will say that so-called ‘character education’ is vital for the smooth running of schools and also helps prepare pupils for university and jobs. But the Government is failing to do enough to emphasise the importance of it, he claims. Delivering a lecture at Birmingham University, Dr Seldon, who has championed so-called ‘happiness lessons’ at Wellington, will say: ‘Schools are rightly emphasising exam results and academic attainment. ‘They need also to emphasise the development of good character, which is essential for the smooth running of schools, for future employability, for higher education and for good citizenship.’ A new GCSE-style compulsory qualification should be introduced, called the GCCE - General Certificate of Character Education. ‘All schools must offer this qualification, and all students must take this qualification, which will be as prized by future employers, and even by Higher Education, as highly as GCSE,’ he will say. Top state and independent schools which paid attention to character development were seeing ‘dramatic’ gains, according to Dr Seldon. ‘It used to be the case that the public schools emphasised the development of character. Schools should devote as much attention to developing children's 'character' as preparing them for exams, according to Dr Seldon . ‘Now the best state schools are leading the way. ‘They are teaching their students character - good manners, self-control, self-reliance, responsibility, punctuality, determination, resilience, appreciation, kindness and tidiness. The impact is dramatic.’ He will add: ‘The government wants to build on a big society. But they are not doing enough to build capacity amongst young people when they are at school. The emphasis has tilted too far to exam preparation and too far away from developing the child.’ He called on Education Secretary Michael Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw to give character education a ‘higher priority’. ‘They have seen it as an alternative to, and even a threat to, academic attainment,’ he said. ‘If all schools offered the GCCE (General Certificate of Character Education), and all children took it, we would have much better schools in Britain, and they would go on to build a much better society.’","Dr Anthony Seldon, of Wellington College, says pupils should study for GCSE-style exams in the qualities .

Government forecasters have suggested the number paying the 40p tax rate, on incomes between £34,000 and £150,000, in Wales was expected to increase to 108,000 for the last tax year and 117,000 this year, The Telegraph has reported.

Bank of England chief Sir Mervyn King said bankers had to realise they 'can¿t just exist on their own' Goldman Sachs has abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate. The u-turn came hours after Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King branded the idea 'depressing' and accused bankers of mis-judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash. The investment bank had considered waiting to . award equity bonuses deferred from previous years, due to pay out this . month, until after April 6. It would mean tax on the payouts would have been paid at the 45p . rate instead of the 50p rate for high earners. But people familiar with the bank's deliberations said the Comp Committee of the board met today and ruled out the idea. In a devastating attack on attitudes in the City, Sir Mervyn accused the super-rich of thinking it was 'exciting' to use a loophole which could cost the taxpayer millions. 'I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think it's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent,' he told the Treasury Select Committee. Sir Mervyn, who will stand down as Bank of England Governor in June, said City firms had to consider the reputational damage the move would cause. 'I think it would be rather clumsy and rather lacking in care and attention to how other people might react and , in the long run, financial institutions, like all large institutions do depend on good will from the rest of society, they can’t just exist on their own.' British taxpayers could lose out on . millions of pounds if super-rich bankers press ahead with the idea of delaying their bonuses until after the 50p tax rate . is scrapped. Chancellor . George Osborne came under pressure to take action to close the loophole . which could lead to a massive shortfall in Treasury coffers. The revelation will . add to the sense of public fury after it emerged bankers at the firm are . expected to reward themselves £8.3 billion in bonuses tomorrow. Staggering: Bankers at Goldman Sachs are expected to share £8.3billion in bonuses . Shadow . treasury minister Chris Leslie said: 'Goldman Sachs has made the right decision, but the fact remains that from April thousands of bankers and millionaires will get a huge tax cut from David Cameron and George Osborne.' The . American investment bank, which employs 5,500 staff in the UK, will be . the first to unveil its telephone number-sized rewards – an average of . £250,000 a person – as part of the latest round of bonus updates. The . increase, up from £230,000 last year, comes as British families are . still struggling to make ends meet five years after banks brought the . economy to the brink of meltdown. About half of the top 20 banks in the City had considered delaying UK payouts, the Financial Times reported. In . 2010 bankers brought forward their bonuses by a few weeks ahead of the . introduction of the 50p rate for people earning more than £150,000, . costing the taxpayer £16billion. Chancellor George Osborne will be urged to act to stop bankers avoiding tax by delaying their big bonuses until after April 6 . By delaying a bonus until after April 6, a banker with a salary of £150,000 awarded a £100,000 bonus would save £5,000 in tax. Lib . Dem MP John Hemming said any bank caught dodging tax in this way should . be banned from being awarded lucrative government contracts. Calls for restraint by politicians, who have used taxpayers cash to bailout many of the banks, have fallen on deaf ears. At . taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group, which is expected to make a loss . this year, its boss is likely to be entitled to a multimillion-pound . bonus. Some of the reward . for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio is linked to the share price, . which has doubled, and customer satisfaction, which means he could be in . line for a £4.4 million fortune. But . most of the anger will be directed at Goldman Sachs whose vice chairman . said back in 2009 ‘inequality is a way of achieving greater opportunity . and prosperity for all’. The . comments by Lord Griffiths echoed those of fictional banker Gordon . Gekko in the film Wall Street - whose mantra ‘greed is good’ came to sum . up the excesses of the 1980s. Griffiths . was of the view that taxpayers should ‘tolerate the inequality’ and . insisted banks should not be ashamed of rewarding staff. True . to this ethos Goldman is likely to have boosted its salary and bonus . pot to £8.3 billion from £7.6 billion the previous year due to increased . profits. The last three months have been strong with share trading and bonds performing well. Global profit could top £3.79 billion up from £2.73 billion. The . lavish windfalls come as new research shows pay rewards are failing to . incentivise Britain’s big bosses to improve the long term success of . their businesses. 'Prosperity for all': The American bank (London offices pictured) employs 5,500 staff in the UK and will be the first to unveil its massive rewards . Executive pay packages across . Britain’s biggest firms are ‘overwhelmingly’ linked to short-term . financial measures such as earnings and share price movement, according . to research from the High Pay Centre lobby group. However . it shows chief executive pay has trebled to £4.8million, on average, in . ten years without any accompanying long-term increase in share values. At . Lloyds, the bank has experienced a short term stock rise, but given the . political tensions over banking bonuses, the Lloyds directors may . decide not to pay the full amount to the Portuguese banker, who last . year waived his bonus following a prolonged period of sick leave. Lloyds shares were the second best performing of Europe’s banks last year and closed last week at 54p, up from 25.5p in May. But . the bank is still expected to make a full year loss of about £1.4 . billion, as it continues to suffer from bad debts from corporate loans . and a big bill over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The . 40 per cent state-owned lender was pushed to a £144 million loss in the . three months to 30 September, as it took an additional £1 billion . charge for dealing with the scandal, taking its total to £5.3 billion. Lloyds froze basic pay for 500 senior staff for the third year in a row on Friday.","Bank governor accused bankers of thinking they 'exist on their own'

Threat: Air pollution to trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in expectant mothers, a study has found . Exposure to air pollution could trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, researchers have warned. Women with asthma are particularly . vulnerable to the condition - marked by high blood pressure and fluid . retention - according to a new study. It blamed one in every 20 cases of pre-eclampsia on higher levels of ozone pollution in the air during the first three months of pregnancy, as well . as an increase in premature births. The rate would mean pollution was a factor in up to 2,000 cases of pre-eclampsia in the UK each year. As many as one in 20 first-time mothers develop pre-eclampsia, while . around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood . pressure. It is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year. The only treatment is to deliver the baby early with an emergency Caesarean. The new study adds to evidence of a link between air pollution and . premature birth, with international research earlier this week showing . higher pollution levels raised the risk of low birth weight. The study looked at almost 121,000 births in Greater Stockholm, Sweden, between 1998 and 2006. It compared the records with national data on the prevalence of asthma . among the children’s mothers; and levels of the air pollutants ozone and . vehicle exhaust (nitrogen oxide) in the Stockholm area. In all, 4.4 per cent of the pregnancies resulted in a premature birth . and the prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 2.7 per cent, say findings . published in the online journal BMJ Open. There was no association between exposure to levels of vehicle exhaust . and complications of pregnancy, nor were any links found for any air . pollutants and babies that were underweight at birth. But there did seem to be a link between exposure to ozone levels during . the first three months of pregnancy and the risk of premature birth . before 37 weeks and pre-eclampsia. Each rose by four per cent for every 10 microgram per cubic metre . increase in ambient ozone during this period, says the analysis. Mothers with asthma were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born . prematurely and 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than mums . without this condition. Vulnerable: Pregnant women with asthma were 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than those without the condition . The effect of pollution on inflammation processes in the body may be a potential mechanism, say the Swedish researchers. Asthma is an inflammatory condition and ozone may therefore have . worsened respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation, so accounting . for the larger increase in the risk of premature birth among the mums . with asthma, suggest the researchers. After taking account of various factors, they calculated that one in . every 20 (five per cent) cases of pre-eclampsia were linked to ozone . levels during early pregnancy. Lead researcher David Olsson, of the department of public health and . clinical medicine at Umea University, said the findings should lead to . improved monitoring of women with asthma during pregnancy. He said ‘It’s difficult to put into practice measures that will . effectively reduce the risk, but it shows the importance of ensuring . women’s asthma symptoms are under control during early pregnancy. They . need to use their medication to help counteract the possible health . effects of pollution. ‘The study increases the evidence suggesting we should strive to keep . reducing pollution levels to improve human health’ he added.","Pre-eclampsia can threaten the life of both mother and baby .

A mother who is accused of beating her two-year-old son to death attended parenting classes where she 'pretended to be a caring mother', a court heard today. Rebecca Shuttleworth, 24, and her boyfriend Luke Southerton, 31, are accused of torturing Keanu Williams over a period of several months and battering him to death over 48 hours. Keanu, nicknamed 'Kiwi, was found with 37 devastating injuries when he was found dead by a paramedic on the sofa of Southerton's flat in Ward End, Birmingham, in January last year. Trial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court today, where they stand accused of murdering her son Keanu, 2 . Death: Two-year-old Keanu Williams's body showed 37 external marks of injury allegedly inflicted in 48 hours . Birmingham Crown Court heard today that the youngsters was found with 'waxen' skin and 'fixed and dilated' eyes after the couple dialled 999 on January 9. He was rushed to the Heartlands Hospital but had died from internal injuries. The court heard that Shuttleworth had attended a number of parenting courses after giving birth to Keanu in Torquay, Devon where she was living at the time before moving to Birmingham. Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC accused her of using her knowledge of the care system to 'manipulate social workers, doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother.' Mr Hotten told the court: 'Rebecca Shuttleworth ill-treated, neglected . and assaulted her son Keanu and we say that this is not simply a case of . being immature or naive or indeed a substandard mother. 'She had attended a number of . parenting courses and after the birth of Keanu in 2008 she was given . extensive support by health and social services workers in Torquay. 'In 2009 she attended a 12-week . course designed to support her well being and confidence in parenting . and we say it was her family and friends who saw the reality of her . treatment of Keanu.' Shuttleworth's friends and family . told police that Keanu was often neglected, often unwashed and would be . left in a soiled nappy for extended periods. Mr Hotten added 'Her attitude was one . of someone who resented Keanu and thought he was in the way and an . obstruction to her living her life as she wanted. Accused: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton arrive at Birmingham Crown Court . today, who prosecutors say tried to hide the child's injuries to avoid being caught by the authorities . 'He was often unwashed and dressed in . grubby clothes and many people spoke of the fact that he would go for . long periods with his nappy unchanged, his soiled nappy hanging off him. Tragic: Baby Keanu was found lifeless on a Birmingham sofa by paramedics early in 2011 . 'She would swear and shout at Keanu, she was seen by a number of people to handle him very roughly and to hit him, grabbing him by the arms, slapping him to the arms, the legs and the bottom, sometimes hard enough to mark him. 'We say that this behaviour was meted out to Keanu within months of his birth.' The court heard that Shuttleworth told concerned nursery staff that Keanu had fallen over to explain his injuries. Mr Hotten said that Shuttleworth and her sister Angela had a 'disruptive' childhood, with Shuttleworth having spent time in care as a youngster. He said: 'Their mother was an alcoholic, she struggled to care for her daughters and they spent lengthy periods of time in care and both sisters had considerable experience of the care system and of social workers. 'A key issue in this case is whether, as we suggest, her experiences equipped Rebecca to manage and manipulate social workers, teachers, doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother, for the picture painted by her friends and family is different.' Shuttleworth had taken a 'fit and healthy' Keanu to Southerton's flat on January 7, 2011, before both of them beat him over the next two days. A post mortem revealed Keanu died of internal bleeding and tests showed he may have suffered months of abuse prior to his death. Mr Hotten said: 'How was it that this two-year-old boy came to die on a sofa in a flat in Ward End, Birmingham? 'The answer, sadly, is that he was beaten to death. 'His fatal injuries, we say, were not an isolated event but the culmination of months of ill-treatment and assaults."" The pair did not report Keanu's injuries out of fear they would be arrested and only called an ambulance after he was dead. He added: 'He was not breathing, there was no pulse, the pupils of his eyes were fixed and dilated, his skin was white and waxen. 'No medical help was sought for this child until he was dead. 'Both Rebecca and Luke must have known that Keanu was assaulted and was profoundly unwell. 'Their only hope was that he might recover untreated. 'Both were in it together, it was understood between them that Keanu had been beaten and punished and each had been criminally responsible for the injuries that caused his death. 'Any competent carer would have realised that he was profoundly unwell and would have called an ambulance.' Investigation: Police and forensic officers outside the home where Keanu was allegedly battered to death by those who should have cared for him . On the way to the hospital, paramedics had questioned Shuttleworth about the hours leading up to Keanu's death. She told them that he had been refusing to eat and had vomited earlier that day. As well as a murder charge, both defendants also face one charge each of causing or allowing the death of a child and one charge each of child cruelty. Both deny all counts. In December 2010 Shuttleworth called NHS Direct after Keanu bruised his forehead and burned the bottom of his feet when he was staying at Southerton's flat. Tragic: Flowers were left outside the Birmingham home of Keanu Williams following his death two years ago . In a transcript of the call read to the jury, she tells the operator: 'He [Keanu] just seems so accident prone, everything's going wrong for him. 'This morning I got him up and his bed, I know it's silly but it's by the radiator and he burned his foot on the radiator when he got up this morning.' Following advice from the operator, Shuttleworth took Keanu to hospital, which prompted a child protection examination, including a police inspection of Southerton's flat. Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth texted Southerton to alert him to the police visit and tell him what she told officers. He said: 'Rebecca texted Luke to warn him that the police were going to come to his flat and that they wanted to look at the radiator and the position of the bed. 'We say that the obvious implication is that she is texting this to Mr Southerton to make sure that their stories fit together. 'It is our contention this shows that Rebecca and Luke were acting together to cover up a series of injuries to Keanu that we say were plainly not accidental.' Shuttleworth, who wept throughout the court hearing, faces a further cruelty charge relating to another child who cannot be named be legal reasons. Addressing the jury of four men and eight women, Judge Mr Justice Spencer told them not to let their verdicts become 'affected by emotion.' He said: 'I’m sure you understand the absolute crucial importance of you as jurors not being affected by emotion at all in this case. 'What’s called for by a jury in a case of this kind is a cool and dispassionate assessment of the evidence and that is what will lead you to true verdicts.' Shuttleworth and Southerton are both on bail. The trial is expected to last up to three months.

Tracey McDermott, The regulator's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: 'Harbinder Panesar has left a trail of destruction behind him. 'He was misappropriating funds from his businesses, acting recklessly towards consumers, and taking two firms into liquidation. 'So egregious were his actions that even though he has only recently been discharged from bankruptcy, we will not reduce the fine because of financial hardship.

It is excruciatingly bad television lambasted by critics as ‘horrendous’ and ‘idiotic’. But the ratings suggest ITV1’s Splash! has become a guilty pleasure for the nation. The second episode of the much-ridiculed show which sees celebrities dive for glory under the mentorship of Olympic medallist Tom Daley pulled in a remarkable 5.15 million viewers – making it the most watched programme on Saturday night. But the popularity of the inane programme will be a blow to Clare Balding’s high-brow BBC1 rival Britain’s Brightest which is struggling to compete. The second episode of the quiz show, which tests the intelligence of ordinary Britons by assessing them over a range of disciplines, dropped 800,000 viewers to 4million on Saturday. Audiences have admitted that Splash is becoming a 'guilty pleasure' despite the widespread criticism. Kate Gibson said: ‘I secretly love Splash so much.’ Sally Biddulph admitted: ‘Splash is becoming a guilty pleasure - strangely gripping format, really like it.’ Others have said that Miss Balding’s new BBC show is little better than Splash despite having a more highbrow title, and have questioned why it has escaped criticism. Mo Akle said: ‘Splash! might be bad but Britain’s Brightest is phenomenally dire.’ Dan Smith added: ‘This Britain’s Brightest programme seems to be competing with Splash for the title of worst TV show. EVER.’ Splash sees an array of low-rent celebrities learn to dive with the help and advice of 18-year-old Tom and diving coach Andy Banks . Each week celebrities including former model Caprice, skier Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards, and comedian Omid Djalli, compete by performing a dive in front of a panel of experts and pool-side audience. It is hosted by Gabby Logan and Vernon Kay, while the panel of judges include comedienne Jo Brand and retired Olympic diver Leon Taylor. Scroll down for video . Celebs taking part in Splash! include Joey Essex, Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards, Diarmuid Gavin, Charlotte Jackson and Caprice Bourret . Britain’s Brightest sees 24 ordinary people to have their intelligence tested in a variety of ways including memory, speed and emotional intelligence. Daley has come under fire for his involvement in the show – British Swimming chief executive David Sparkes expressed concerns about the impact of the teenager’s commercial commitments on his ability to train and compete. Mr Sparkes said: ‘Tom is an incredibly talented young man, but he’s yet to achieve his full potential and it’s only going to get harder to achieve that Olympic gold medal as he gets older. ‘You can rest assured the next Chinese diving superstar will not have such distractions from training. ‘He should look at the example of skaters Torvill and Dean who waited until the end of their competitive careers before doing such programmes.’","Critics are smacking their foreheads, but viewers love diving show Splash!

You're picking your way carefully along an icy pavement when  suddenly – thwack! – a snowball thrown by an unseen hand hits you on the back of the head. As you stop to dry off, you look round for the pesky little brat who threw it, but there’s no one to be seen. Irritating, of course, but hardly a matter for the police ... unless, that is, you live in County Durham. Spoil sports: These children had fun in the snow but youngsters in Country Durham could be arrested if they are caught throwing snowballs (file pic) The force there provoked derision yesterday after threatening to arrest children found throwing snowballs at cars or bystanders. It announced that its officers would crack down on anyone caught lobbing them at those who don’t wish to partake in a snowball fight. Posting a message on Facebook, police from the Neighbourhood Police Team in the town of Crook said: ‘Crook Beat Team are aware that it has been snowing and that people are going to have fun in it, however if anyone is caught throwing snowballs at vehicles or on to the road, they could be arrested. 'Likewise, if anyone throws snowballs at persons’ homes or at people who do not want to be involved in the snow games, they could be arrested and it will be classed as anti-social behaviour.’ An arrest for anti-social behaviour is normally dealt with by a fixed penalty order. But the police warning received widespread ridicule online, with residents saying that throwing snowballs was a centuries-old tradition that could not be stopped by a Facebook message. One, Eddie Philips of Wolsingham, said: ‘What an absolute joke. I can’t believe the times we live in that police would see fit to make such a ridiculous pronouncement online. How preposterous. ‘I can understand them doing it if people had put stones in the snowballs, but that’s not what they mean, is it?’ No joke: Crook Neighbourhood Police Team publised on its Facebook page that children would be arrested if they were caught throwing snowballs . Paul Emmerton, of Middlesbrough, accused officers of ‘sucking the fun from everything’. And Chris Clynes said: ‘We’ve had one thrown through our slightly ajar backdoor and it knocked the fabric softener off the top of the tumble dryer. Good shot but annoying. I would have done the same when I was younger.’ Durham Police said they did not want to spoil fun or ban snowballs completely, but were simply issuing advice. A spokesman said: ‘It might seem like innocent fun but it could have serious consequences. The problem in Crook is no worse than anywhere else, but the team thought they would head the problem off at the pass.’ No arrests have yet been made. The move came after plummeting night-time temperatures and snowfall across large parts led to treacherous conditions on the roads and underfoot. And while much of the country escaped any serious snowfall yesterday, it remained bitterly cold. In parts of Yorkshire, residents were bracing themselves for temperatures of -8C (18F) tonight. In Norfolk more than 40 schools were forced to close for the day and Norwich airport also had to shut for a time. The AA estimated it has seen a 30 per cent rise in the number of breakdowns since the cold snap started, while the RAC has put extra patrols on the roads. The Highways Agency has a 500-strong fleet of salt spreaders and snowploughs on standby. The Met Office issued an amber weather warning, predicting severe weather for all of England. The icy conditions are likely to last into the weekend and beyond, with a risk of snow and ice next week.","The message was posted by Crook Neighbourhood Police Team in County Durham on its Facebook page .

Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has infected dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination. The Health Ministry said the outbreak was first detected on January 6 and was being contained. 'Fifty-one cases have been confirmed to date,' the statement read, without mentioning fatalities. Outbreak: Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination . Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. But recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people. 'Due to the measures adopted transmission is in the phase of extinction,' it said. But in off-the-record discussions with a ministry official and doctor directly involved in fighting the outbreak, a different picture emerged with hundreds of suspected cases. They said the first cases were traced to a baseball game at the Latin American Stadium in the Cerro municipality of the Cuban capital, where fans come from all parts of the city to watch their team, the Industriales, play. 'We know what happened. Either the pork sandwiches or Tan Rico soda pop was contaminated at a game earlier this month,' the official said. 'Even some of the baseball players became sick,' she added. The Health Ministry statement said the outbreak had begun in Cerro and 'later spread to other municipalities in the capital.' Tens of thousands of British tourists Cuba every year and in particular visiting Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness. Concern: Tens of thousands of British tourists travel to Cuba every year and in particular visit Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness . Several European diplomats have told AP they are considering issuing travel advisories to citizens planning visits to Cuba, and have been concerned that the government is not sharing information with them in a timely manner. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Tourism is the top sector in Cuba's flagging Communist economy, with 2.8 million visitors a year, making £1.5billion. In 2010, 174,343 tourists from Britain visited the country. A major cholera outbreak is sure to make some visitors think twice about a trip, despite Cuba's sterling reputation in responding to epidemics and natural disasters. Community clinics and family doctors are on high alert and giving out instructions to prevent the disease, transportation hubs have passengers sterilizing their shoes before leaving town and eateries are being systematically inspected and sometimes closed, residents say. The official said Havana had been preparing to fight the disease since Cuba's first cholera outbreak in decades last year in eastern Granma province. Killer disease: Recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people . There have been scattered cases since then, but all were traced to the Granma area and quickly contained, she said. 'This time is different. There are many cases, but we are well prepared in terms of supplies and the protocol,' she said, adding, 'let's just hope we can stop this before it becomes much worse.' The lack of official information until Tuesday has led to rumors that dozens have died in the Cuban capital, though the official and doctor said there had been only one fatality. The family of one man, 46-year-old Ubaldo Pino Rodriguez, told The Associated Press last week that he died of cholera in Cerro on Jan. 2, about two weeks after going to the hospital with severe vomiting. Rodriguez's sister, Yanise Pino, said her brother had a drinking problem and lived in squalid and unhygienic conditions in a tiny makeshift wooden dwelling. 'When he began to feel bad he thought it was from drinking and nothing else,' she said, adding that he left the hospital of his own accord last month. She said that following his death authorities sealed off Ubaldo's room and told her to burn all his belongings. Three Havana hospitals have been designated to handle cholera cases - one for adults, another for children and a third for pregnant women. Another doctor working at the designated adult hospital, the Center for Tropical Medicine, said they were swamped at the weekend with suspected cases. Cholera is generally not fatal, but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration, especially among the elderly. The illness runs its course within a week, making it relatively easy to track, but at the same time is highly contagious, spreading from hand to mouth, through contaminated food and the water supply. 'So far there is no indication its in the water supply, but we are dumping more chlorine in the system,' the Health Ministry official said. Until 2012, there had been no cholera outbreaks reported in Cuba since well before the 1959 revolution and the creation of a national health system by the Communist government. Hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade in Haiti which has battled a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people since that country's 2010 earthquake. Cuba lies closer to Haiti than any other Caribbean country, with the exception of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the crisis stricken country and has reported more than 20,000 cholera cases and 350 deaths since the Haiti epidemic began.","Health Ministry: Outbreak was first detected on January 6 .

The family have kept Shaylyn out of school since the incident. The Searcys met with Child Protective Services investigators on Wednesday and are working with the director of the special needs program to move their daughter back to her previous school. ‘The teacher that did this and whoever else was involved shouldn't be working in a school, let alone a special needs program,’ said Mr Searcy.","Shaylyn Searcy had her feet bound at Westlake Elementary in Indianapolis, Indiana on Monday .

Sentenced: Carer Angela Perkins was jailed for two years after admitting stealing £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia sufferer . A carer who stole £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia patient has been jailed for two years. Angela Perkins siphoned money from the vulnerable patient's life savings between 2005 and 2010. Perkins, from Norwich, in Norfolk, helped patients to do their shopping and had access to the woman's PIN and bank accounts. She had originally been charged with stealing £55,000 from the woman in July last year, but it was later discovered that she had stolen almost double that amount. The 47-year-old was handed a two year prison sentence at Norwich Crown Court after admitting the theft at a previous hearing. The victim is in 24-hour residential care. Det Con Huw Caine, of Norfolk Police, said after the sentencing: 'The actions of Perkins left the victim confused, upset and extremely traumatised with worry due to the fact her savings had dwindled away and she didn't have any money left in her account. 'Perkins exploited the fact the victim was vulnerable and removed money from the victim's account for her own use, abusing her position of trust. 'When Perkins was challenged in interview about accounting for cash withdrawals from the victim's account that corresponded with deposits into her own account she was unable to give any satisfactory answers.' He added: 'The case highlights that offences of this nature and the targeting of some of our most vulnerable people in society will not be tolerated. 'I hope that the results of this case highlight to other potential offenders how robustly Norfolk Constabulary will investigate and deal with such incidents.' Norfolk Police said it was now trying to confiscate money from Perkins under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Should a confiscation order be served and Perkins fail to pay up, she could face an additional sentence.

Changes: Barclays boss Antony Jenkins is to scrap the company's tax avoidance unit in a bid to move away from the bank's scandal-hit past . Barclays is to shut down a controversial unit used to slash tax bills in a bid to ‘shred’ the legacy left by former boss Bob Diamond. Critics last night welcomed the move but baulked at the idea that the lender has had a ‘Road to Damascus moment’ over its ethics. Barclays, which is fighting to salvage its reputation after a string of scandals, will unveil the plans after its financial results tomorrow, when it counts the cost of its wrongdoing. It is expected to slash up to 2,000 ‘casino bankers’ at its investment arm Barclays Capital as part of a shake-up. But in its most eye-catching bid to convince the public that it is improving its culture, it will also announce the closure of its structured capital markets business. This secretive division helps companies avoid tax through a network of offshore tax havens and was previously run by its highest-paid banker Roger Jenkins. But it has also been used by Barclays to cut its own tax bill in the UK, heaping pressure on ordinary households to bridge the £32billion annual shortfall in HM Revenue & Customs’ coffers. Last year it was ordered by the Treasury to repay half a billion pounds after being caught out using two ‘aggressive’ loopholes to avoid paying tax. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins will describe the activities of its tax-avoidance arm as ‘legal’ but ‘incompatible with our purpose’, pledging ‘a new approach for a new era of banking’. In the closest the bank has come to admitting widespread tax avoidance, he will admit that in some cases the unit ‘relied on sophisticated and complex structures, where transactions were carried out with the primary objective of accessing the tax benefits’. He will say: ‘We get it. The old ways weren’t the right way to behave nor did they deliver the right results – for banks themselves or for wider society. Job cuts: The move will see some 2,000 investment banking jobs axed by the firm . ‘There must be a new approach for a new era of banking. Banks that fail to change will become failing banks. My message is Barclays is changing.’ The move comes amid fresh accusations that Barclays helped clients avoid tax on an ‘industrial’ scale. In a Panorama investigation aired on BBC One tonight, a former insider will claim that the small team of 100 staff at the structured capital markets unit would share huge rewards from the profits of tax avoidance deals. Scandal: The closure is part of Mr Jenkins' drive to 'shred' the legacy left by former boss Bob Diamond who resigned following the bank's £290 million Libor rigging settlement last year . ‘Some tax restructuring is common in a lot of banks, and there’s nothing wrong with it. The issue is they turned it into an industry within the bank.’ The tax avoidance arm was run by Roger Jenkins, a former boyfriend of supermodel Elle Macpherson, who made as much as £40million a year before leaving the bank in 2009. Mr Jenkins, 57, is also one of several current and former Barclays executives being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and the City watchdog over fees paid to Middle East investors during the financial crisis. Campaigners welcomed Barclays’ decision to close its tax avoidance arm but said it needed to be accompanied with a reform of the system to make it harder for companies to dodge tax. Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Companies shutting down controversial units might ease public anger but it doesn’t solve the problem of our broken  tax system. Until it is reformed the public will remain deeply unhappy when they see companies able to exploit relief and loopholes simply not open to the rest of us.’ Chief executive Mr Jenkins admitted to the banking commission of MPs and peers last week that the overhaul of his bank amounted to ‘shredding’ the legacy left by his predecessor Mr Diamond. He admitted that an ‘aggressive’ and ‘self-serving’ culture had developed under the American. Barclays last night said it paid its fair share of tax in the UK, having paid £300million of corporation tax on profits of £1billion in 2011.","Antony Jenkins is to announce the moves on Tuesday .

After a Saturday night shooting at New Orleans' famed Bourbon Street, which terrified Mardi Gras revelers who fled in all directions, the New Orleans Police Department may have a lead. The department released a photo of a man they are referring to as a 'person of interest.' He is not a suspect, but the police believe he could play a crucial part in determining the quadruple shooting, which sent four gun shot victim to the hospital. The New Orleans Police Department have stated this man is not a suspect, but a 'person of interest' and released these stills of him from this evening . In a video taken by a witness and released by police on Sunday, four shots rang out, followed by screams as some in the crowd staggered into one another and a nearby wall. An argument involving one of the victims led to the shooting, police said. Two men can be seen on tape leaving the argument and returning with a third, then approaching the victim and shooting. Scroll down for video . Terror on the streets: A bystander's video shows one of the suspects, left, that police are seeking in a shooting that wounded four people on New Orleans' famed Bourbon Street late on Saturday . Tighter control: From a security tower above the Mardi Gras crowds, NOPD officers watch the 400 and 500 blocks of Bourbon Street after four people were shot on Saturday . A man whom police identified in a statement as one of the perpetrators moves deeper into the crowd and extends his arm as the gunfire erupts. No arrests were immediately reported and police said they were seeking three men who fled, including the one who extended his arm. The wounded were two males and two females, New Orleans Police spokesman Frank B. Robertson said. One male victim was being guarded on Sunday with shots to the abdomen, thigh and pelvis. He is currently listed as stable by doctors as he recovers from surgery. The second male was shot in the buttocks, one female was shot on the chin and right foot, and the second female was shot in the toe. The three have all been released from the hospital. Police had said late on Saturday that the most severely wounded man was undergoing surgery while the others were stable. None was identified by age or name. Damage done: Contractor Terrance Harbor replaces a broken window he said appeared to be struck by a bullet, in the 400 block of Bourbon Street in the French Quarter . The shooting came on the last weekend of partying before Mardi Gras, the Fat Tuesday celebration that is the signature tourist event of the year in New Orleans. And for thousands, the partying continued despite the shooting. New Orleans has been plagued for years by violent crime, including gun violence that has soared since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. In 2011, sixteen people were shot and at least two killed in Halloween shootings in New Orleans. One of those killed - a 25-year-old local resident - was shot near the famous Chris Owens nightclub, about a block away from Saturday's incident. Police placed the Saturday shooting in the 400 block of Bourbon Street. Patrick Clay, 21, a Louisiana State University student, told The Times-Picayune that he was standing on the corner of Bourbon Street on Saturday night when suddenly he saw a crowd running and people screaming that there had been a shooting. 'Everyone immediately started running and the cops immediately started running toward where people were running from,' Clay said. On the lookout: Louisiana State Police patrol the streets of the French Quarter on Sunday . Chaos: Two men and two women were injured when gunfire broke out on Saturday night amid thousands of revelers . 'I was with a group of about seven people and at that point, we all just kind of grasped hands and made our way through the crowd as soon as possible.' Some bartenders and revelers said the block of Bourbon Street where the shooting occurred was closed for a time while detectives investigated, but partying resumed hours later across that stretch. Julia Rosenthal, a 19-year-old from Westchester, NY, had mixed feelings about hanging out in the French Quarter after the shooting. ' It's not an OK thing that happened, and it's definitely scary. But I'm not going to let it affect my night,' she said. Peter Manabani, an employee at the Rat's Hole bar, said police had shut down a whole Bourbon Street block for an hour to investigate but allowed people to return to the area later. Hours later on Sunday, there was little evidence that a shooting had occurred. Overnight revelers were in full party mode, packing the block amid a heavy police presence. Laura Gonzalez, 21, of Baytown, Texas, said it was her first Mardi Gras and she spent some time in the Fat Catz bar nearby as police investigated. She said the bar locked its doors quickly after the shots rang out and wouldn't let anyone in or out while police went to the scene. Asked if it was frightening, she responded: 'Not really. We were just locked in a bar and we weren't going to let this one incident wreck our party.' Parades rolled all day on Saturday but none on Bourbon Street because the streets are too narrow. One of the biggest Mardi Gras parades, the Krewe of Endymion, rolled down a major thoroughfare and just skirted Bourbon Street a few hours before the shooting. Typically, once the parades end, partygoers head to the French Quarter.","New Orleans Police Department releases a photo of 'person of interest' but insists he's not a suspect .

House prices are increasing at their fastest rate since early 2010, fuelled by the Government’s £80billion attempt to kick-start the economy, the Halifax said yesterday. The Funding For Lending Scheme has been failing to get money to its key target – cash-strapped small businesses – but it is managing to cut interest rates on mortgages and make them more easily available. For homeowners, a rise in prices is a cause for celebration, but it is another blow for first-time buyers trying to get on to the property ladder. Rise: House prices are increasing at their fastest rate since early 2010, fuelled by the Government's Funding For Lending Scheme . Between November and January, the banking giant said the cost of the average home jumped by 1.9 per cent, the biggest quarterly rise since the beginning of 2010. Prices are up by 1.3 per cent on a year ago – the first annual rise for 27 months. The average home costs £162,932, which is about £2,000 more than when the Funding For Lending Scheme was introduced in August.  The increase is thought to have been driven by the pressure for homes in London and the Home Counties. Another recent report, from the Land Registry, pinpointed huge regional variations in England and Wales. In London, the average home costs £371,223, a rise of 8.4 per cent on last year. In the North East, the cheapest region, it is £99,974, up only 0.3 per cent last year. The funding scheme allows banks to borrow an unlimited amount from the Government for as little as 0.25 per cent as long as they maintain, or increase, their lending in the form of mortgages and loans to businesses. But recent figures from the Bank of England show that lending to companies has continued to fall. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: ‘The Funding For Lending Scheme has helped lenders to lower interest rates and improve availability. This is likely to have been a factor contributing to the pick-up in both home sales and prices.’ Figures from the Bank of England show that the number of mortgages handed out has jumped by nearly 20 per cent since the scheme came into force. In that time, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate for those with a 40 per cent deposit fell from 4.33 per cent to 3.85 per cent. The number of homes being sold has also hit its highest level since the credit crunch struck in 2007. Some 932,000 homes were sold last year, the largest number since 2007 when 1.6million changed hands. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘Credit conditions look to be easing as the impact of the Funding For Lending Scheme hits home. ‘If this trend continues, we should see an increasing number of buyers able to enter the market and drive house price growth from the bottom up.’ Matthew Pointon, property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, warned: ‘The housing market is being supported by Government interventions. But with most measures still pointing to significant house price over-valuation, they are rowing against the tide.’","Funding For Lending Scheme managing to cut interest rates on mortgages .

Nathanial McIntosh persuaded a court to have his curfew lifted so he can go on holiday to Thailand . A violent thug has successfully applied to have a curfew lifted by magistrates so he can go on holiday to Thailand. Nathanial McIntosh, of Falmouth, in Cornwall, is serving a 12-week suspended sentence after abusing three people. The non-league footballer, who plays for Wendron United, was convicted on January 22 and was also given an eight-week curfew to stay at home between the hours of 7pm and 6am. But the 23-year-old went back to court to plead with officials to have the curfew lifted because he had booked a month-long holiday in Thailand. Magistrates in Truro, Cornwall, have agreed the curfew can be relaxed until McIntosh gets back from his trip. The decision to relax Nathanial McIntosh's curfew has been branded 'ludicrous' by one victim of an unrelated crime. But Peter Chapman, chairman of the Magistrates' Association's sentencing committee, explained: 'If the curfew clashes with work, a pre-booked holiday, a relative's wedding or a job interview, magistrates can adjust the curfew as they see fit.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman added: 'Only courts can vary the requirements imposed under suspended sentence - this is solely a matter for them.' McIntosh pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent against three people and was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year. Last month he was also fined and banned from the road for drink-driving after he was found three times over the limit.

A pair of criminals who plotted to break in and steal valuable Chinese artefacts worth £1.8m from a museum have denied smashing a wall in the premises and grabbing the precious items. Durham University's Oriental Museum was the scene of a highly-professional, high-stakes raid last Easter, Durham Crown Court heard. Thieves escaped with an 18th Century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine which dated from the Qing Dynasty in a night-time break-in last April. Lee Wildman (left) and Adrian Stanton both deny taking part in the raid, but admitted conspiracy to burgle . Lee Wildman, 35, and Adrian Stanton, 32, both from Walsall, admitted conspiracy to burgle at a previous hearing on the basis that they were recruited to help unnamed figures who carried out the break-in. That basis of plea was rejected and Judge Christopher Prince is hearing a trial of issue to determine what role they played. The two will be sentenced on Friday, along with four others. Wildman, tall and with a clean shaven head, told the judge he and Stanton were recruited from the West Midlands to help figures in the North East after chatting to associates at a garage in Walsall. He said they travelled to Durham, without knowing what they were to be asked to do, as they needed 'to earn some money'. There, they met some people in a silver Mercedes at a car park, who asked them both to go into a building - the museum - and grab Chinese artefacts, the older the better, Wildman said. 'They said: ""Get any Chinese pieces for us you can"",' he told the court. Thieves tunneled into Durham's Oriental Museum before making straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine . Tunneling in: Chinese treasures worth nearly £2 million were stolen from the Centre in the raid . But security staff made him check in his rucksack so they had no opportunity to break into the cabinets and grab the items. CCTV . images played in court showed the men testing the locks on the cabinets . in preparation for the raid later, the prosecution claimed. When . the men left empty-handed, the gang in the car outside were angry, . Wildman said, and grew aggressive. So he offered to provide them with . stolen cars, for a fee of £1,000 each, he claimed. That . explained a series of journeys police have traced using number plate . recognition cameras between Walsall and Durham over the following days. Wildman insisted he did not take part in the raid at the museum which took place in the evening of April 5 last year. Peter Makepeace, prosecuting, said Wildman was telling 'a pack of lies'. Wildman declined to name any of the people at the garage in Walsall or in the North East, saying his life would be in danger. Thieves escaped with an 18th Century jade bowl during the night time raid in April . A Dehua porcelain figurine was stolen from the Oriental Museum in Durham City after thieves smashed their way through a wall . He claimed West Midlands Police had warned his family last year that they and he were at risk . Mr Makepeace told Wildman: 'You are a man who has considerable experience of burgling.' He replied from the dock: 'A long time ago. I have never been involved in stuff like this before.' Both stolen items were recovered later. They were from the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty in China, which ruled from 1644 to 1911. The large green jade bowl, dating from 1769, is from the collection of Sir Charles Hardinge, a British collector of jades and hardstones. A Chinese poem is written inside. The Dehua porcelain sculpture, which has a cream white glaze and depicts seven fairies in a boat, is 30cm in both height and length. The hearing continues.

A New Zealand school girl repeatedly mistaken for missing Madeleine McCann has given police a DNA sample so Scotland Yard can confirm that she is not the youngster. She has been consistently pointed out as the youngster, who went missing in May 2007 while on holiday with her parents and twin siblings. The New Zealand girl bears a striking resemblance to Madeleine, and is believed to have a mark on her right eye similar to the distinctive one on the British girl's iris. Confusion: A girl in New Zealand has been repeatedly mistaken for Madeleine McCann, pictured, and is now undergoing a DNA test to confirm she is not the missing child . Police launched a five-day investigation in January when a Queenstown retailer became suspicious of a man and the young girl. The sample was requested following a reported sighting of Madeleine on New Year’s Eve. The DNA sample is a conclusive way of proving her identity, according to Detective Senior Sergeant Kallum Croudis of Dunedin police, News.com.au reported. A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said, 'This is not a line of inquiry, but just to corroborate what police in New Zealand are saying we have requested DNA,' the Daily Mirror reported. Relentless: Kate and Gerry McCann have never given up their quest to track down their missing daughter . Digital image: This pictured released by police last year shows how Madeleine might look five years on . Madeleine was nearly four when she vanished from her family's Portuguese holiday apartment in Praia da Luz as her parents, Gerry and Kate, ate dinner at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. The case led to a worldwide search amidst fears the girl had been snatched, but despite a number of leads coming to light no trace of Madeleine has every been conclusively found. Since the disappearance, officials have from time to time issued digitally altered images showing what she might look like over the passage of time. Portuguese police stopped formally investigating the case in July 2008, but Madeleine's family have never given up their quest to track down their missing daughter. Holiday: Madeleine disappeared while she was with her family in Praia da Luz, pictured, in the Algarve region . Mrs McCann has ploughed £1million from sales of her book back into the search. The bestseller, entitled simply Madeleine, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday. Madeleine's Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old vanished from her family’s holiday. But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000. Official papers filed with Companies House show all the money raised from the 384-page book went to the fund.

An unemployed man dumped 10kgs of dog poo in his local job centre after they refused to hand over his dole money because he was 10 minutes late to sign on. Simon Bonnell, 21, from Berry Hill in Stoke-on-Trent, made the protest in anger at the way staff at the Job Centre Plus treated him after he was late for an appointment to sign on. He has since been banned from the building in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, for three months, meaning he will lose out on £600 in Jobseekers' Allowance. A court heard Bonnell arrived late for the appointment on December 6 last year and was told he would need to speak to an adviser over the telephone. He then went back home where he filled a bin liner with dog mess collected from a nearby park before returning to the centre and dumping the contents in the foyer. Bonnell had so much faeces in the bag that he had to stop half way back to the centre for a rest because of the weight, the court was told. Staff soon identified him from CCTV footage and following his arrest pleaded guilty to criminal damage. As well as not being able to claim jobseekers' allowance for three months, JPs fined Bonnell £200 and ordered him to pay £63.60 to cover the cost of industrially cleaning the carpet. Simon Oldham, defending, told the court: 'It was an extremely silly incident and the defendant accepts it was a stupid thing to do and is extremely sorry.

The defendant has everything in front of them, yet the victim goes into the courtroom blind.

Finger pointing: Dr Helen Moss, who was the hospital's director of nursing from 2006 to 2009, was cleared of any wrongdoing at a private disciplinary hearing this month . Almost 70 medical staff who faced disciplinary action after 1,200 patients died needlessly at Stafford Hospital have already been cleared in secret hearings, including the most senior nurse at the height of the scandal. Helen Moss was director of nursing from 2006 to 2009 when care reached 'appalling' standards, yet has been told she has 'no case to answer' and is now working as a management consultant. In the last few years 29 nurses and 38 doctors from Stafford Hospital - 67 in total - were cleared at private hearings that considered complaints that will never be made public. The allegations, made by police, the public and other medical staff, were all thrown out at an early stage, so regulators refuse to publish the details. A report by Robert Francis QC published yesterday highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients' in Stafford, as the Prime Minister revealed that nobody has been struck off or disciplined for their part in the biggest NHS scandal in history. The sick and vulnerable were left for hours sitting in their own urine and excrement, . drink was left out of reach forcing them to glug water from vases and hygiene was so poor that relatives had . to clean toilets themselves. Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died in . harrowing circumstances at Stafford Hospital, says she has been . inundated with complaints from others from all over Britain about about . NHS standards. Speaking about the lack of disciplinary action following the scandal she told the BBC: ‘I’d like to say I was surprised, but I’m not. This is how the NHS is. It is one big roundabout where they get on, fail, and then get on somewhere else. ‘Those in charge then (at Stafford) have already gone, resigned and gone to other jobs with huge pay packets. ‘The chief executive was so unwell he couldn’t give evidence to the (Francis) Inquiry, but he has made a mockery of it because he is now working for another organisation in the area. ‘We need radical action. We need leaders in the NHS. Something has gone terribly wrong and unless we make a stand now we will lose the NHS. Just rewarding people for failure cannot continue.’ Targets: This wall in Stafford is adorned with names campaigners blame for poor standards, including current head of the NHS David Nicholson and head of nursing Helen Moss . Victims: Face after face of those who died at Stafford are pasted on the wall along with details and tributes . Upsetting: The pictures not only show the dead but also the painful injuries they received when they were supposed to be cared for . In total, 29 nurses who worked at Stafford Hospital during its darkest days have been cleared of wrongdoing in private 'Investigating Committee' hearings held by regulator the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Under pressure: NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson is refusing to resign despite calls for his head . This is the first stage of the process which decides whether there is a case to answer. Two individuals have been cleared in public, with ten more still facing charges at future hearings. Meanwhile 42 doctors were referred to the . General Medical Council during the scandal, but only four face a public . hearing. Figures given to MailOnline show 22 doctors were given 'advice’ but no punishment, and 21 were told they had no . case to answer. Healthcare assistant Bonka Kostova faces a hearing next week after she was accused of dragging a 73-year-old patient around by the collar of his pyjamas. Ms Kostova joined Stafford Hospital at the end of its scandal and allegedly abused Patient A on a night shift and told him 'you are no longer a human being but an animal'. Nurse Reni Biju will also face the NMC hearing, accused of telling fellow nurses in 2008 a patient with heart problems was well. But the critically ill woman was not breathing and died shortly afterwards. Despite this incident she was allowed to carry on working there for two more years, until she was accused of ill-treating a patient by ignoring her repeated requests to be taken to the toilet. Nurses who worked in the hospital . complained of bullying from the top down, with senior staff 'ruling with . fear' and treating patients 'like an inconvenience'. Scandal: Julie Bailey (C), of 'Cure the NHS', whose mother Bella, 86, died while a patient at Stafford General Hospital, speaks to the media outside the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre yesterday . At risk: Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford Hospital (pictured) and Cannock Chase Hospital are 'dotted around' the NHS . Helene Donnelly told the Francis Inquiry that she tried to raise the alarm, said: 'It went right to the top that people didn’t want to know. And I think that’s why things got so extreme at Stafford.' After being cleared at a hearing on January 23 this year, after a . Nursing and Midwifery Council panel considered two complaints, Helen Moss . now works for Ernst & Young as a consultant. Her company won a contract to look at the financial viability of Mid . Staffs NHS Foundation Trust, but Ernst and Young confirmed she would . not be working on it. They also told MailOnline she was not available for comment. Ms Moss was director of nursing at the time, and took over from Jan Harry, 60, who has been suspended pending a NMC hearing in March. Tragic: 86-year-old Bella Bailey died while she was a patient at Stafford General Hospital and her daughter Julie has been bent on improving standards ever since . Campaigner Julie Bailey is furious that not one member of staff has been disciplined or struck off following the scandal. The families of those who suffered in Staffordshire have called for NHS . chief Sir David Nicholson, who oversaw standards at Stafford during the scandal, and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) chief . executive Peter Carter to resign. 'From all over the country I get emails asking for help, help for the complaints procedure, people that are actually suffering on the wards today, asking for help, from the particular hospitals that have been identified last night, but also other hospitals', Miss Bailey said. 'I can take these complaints down to particular wards within hospitals, they are so frequent, but there's just nobody to help these people, and this is the huge problem that's going on throughout the whole of the country. 'We know the NHS does some wonderful things but we also know it's doing some awful things to people, and they're our most vulnerable.' In a growing crisis for the NHS it . has also two other UK hospitals are now facing legal action from 18 . people whose loved-ones had their human rights breached with . sub-standard care, it was also revealed today. The BBC says claimants are targeting . the Queen's Hospital in Romford in east London and Eastbourne District . General and blame them for early deaths. Yesterday it emerged that five more trusts - Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust - are to be investigated after they had higher-than-average death rates for two years running. The damning report into the scandal at Stafford Hospital points 'very clearly' to the cultural changes the NHS has needed for a 'very long time', former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said today. Mr Lansley, who left the job in last September's cabinet reshuffle, said his controversial reforms, which will see GP commissioning bodies manage services from this April, would not necessarily have prevented the scandal, but they will make NHS trusts more accountable to patients. His comments came as it emerged MPs had demanded a Commons debate on the findings of Robert Francis QC's report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009, which was published yesterday. It highlighted an 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients', many of whom were left for hours sitting in their own faeces, while food and drink was left out of reach and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean toilets themselves. Mr Lansley, now Leader of the House of Commons, told MPs his reforms to the structure of the way services were managed now meant it was possible to change the culture of the NHS. He said: 'Many members in this House will understandably feel very strongly about what Robert Francis had to say in his report. I feel pretty strongly about it. 'I think it absolutely demonstrates that it was the right thing to do to appoint Robert Francis to undertake that public inquiry and I think it points very clearly to the kind of changes in culture and behaviour that the NHS needs now and has needed for a long time. 'This is not about the structures, because frankly I think in this House in the course of these last two and a half years we have given the NHS the structures that it needs. 'Robert Francis in the introduction to his report makes clear that it is now about achieving those culture changes within the structure of the new reforms and it can be achieved in that way.' Tory MPs said they also wanted to see the NHS reformed. Christopher Pincher (Tamworth): 'After what we learnt yesterday about the culture of box-ticking managerialism at the hospital, it seems to me that those people who close their eyes to reform of the NHS should open them and let's get on with it.' Martin Vickers (Cleethorpes) said there was an 'evident lack of democratic accountability' in the NHS.","Francis Inquiry found 1,200 died unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009 .

A teenager who entered a beauty contest became the victim of nasty internet trolls who branded her 'ugly'. Outgoing Lizzie Flint, 19, turned into a 'depressed reclusive' after being 'bombarded' with abuse for competing to be Miss Cornwall 2012. She was picked as one of the 17 finalists but within days, sick insults began being repeatedly posted on her Facebook page. Abuse: Lizzie Flint, 19, fell victim to cyber-bullies after becoming a finalist in a Miss Cornwall competition . The cyber bullies said she 'didn't deserve' to be in the competition and told her to quit or they would 'smash her face in'. In an onslaught of more than 100 messages, she was called 'ugly' and attacked with a series of vile four-letter names, including 'c***'. Ms Flint, of Helston, Cornwall, put up with the abuse for months and eventually lost out in the contest to another girl. She says the bullying left her depressed and she suffers terrifying nightmares about bullies throwing acid in her face. Eventually she plucked up the courage to tell her horrified mother Mariana, 42, who called the police. Terrified: The 19-year-old received more than 100 vicious messages from trolls on her Facebook page . Three girls received official warnings and one wrote a letter of apology. Ms Flint has now vowed never to enter another beauty pageant or follow her dream of being a model. She said: 'I don't want to enter any more competitions or have anything to do with modelling any more. 'The cyber-bullying has rocked my confidence but I'm determined to speak out so other people don't have to suffer this sort of abuse. 'All of this bullying started on Facebook when I entered Miss Cornwall. 'I don't like talking about the messages, they upset me so much. But I kept some of them so the police could use them for evidence. 'I remember one of them said, ""You're a c***, you don't deserve to be in the competition"" - it was just the word ""c***"" all the time, I hated it. 'I used to get messages daily, horrible things written on pictures like I was ugly and things like that. 'I knew some of the people that were sending me them. Some days were worse than others. I got at least 100 messages in total.' Mrs Flint watched her daughter's confidence wear away before her tearful daughter finally confided in her in June last year. She said she had misgivings about her daughter entering a beauty contest and is convinced the subsequent abuse was fuelled by jealousy. Mrs Flint, a party planner who has two other children and a stepson with BT worker husband Scott, said: 'I was against the idea. I knew there would be jealousy from other girls. 'She hid it well from me but I noticed things changed in her - she stopped eating and became depressed. 'She had nightmares that someone was going to throw acid in her face. She was terrified and too scared to walk to school, which is just five minutes away. 'I used to have to literally drop her at her classroom door. Depressed: Ms Flint said she became a 'virtual recluse' after being taunted online . 'When she told me what was happening I was mortified and in tears. It had got so bad that people were even making fake profiles so they could befriend her. 'Some of the things that were said were pure evil. People would say they were going to smash her face in, threats like that. 'It is frightening to know that this sort of bullying can go on so easily behind a parents back. 'She was a giggly, soft-hearted girl before but now she has lost all trust in her age group.' The teenager, who is now training to work with children, wants others to speak out about online trolls to bring an end to cyber bullying. She said: 'My family and friends are very proud that I have spoken out. No one in this world should suffer at the hands of bullies. 'The police were great in my case, they took action straight away and the bullies got a full warning. Now I'm slowly trying to regain all the confidence they took from me. 'I finally can go out with my friends and not have to look over my shoulder all the time. 'I'd like to say to the bullies: you tried to knock me down when I was at my lowest, you didn't, you got caught and now my confidence is back.' A spokesman for the Miss Cornwall competition said: 'Elizabeth entered last year's competition. I was contacted by her mother about the cyber-bullying and we dealt with it. 'I'm sorry for Elizabeth but there's some things we can’t control, cyber-bullying being one of them. 'We have a page on Facebook, ""Miss Cornwall"", which is monitored and a few people have made comments on this year's competitors which were not very nice, but as soon as they make nasty comments they are banned and their comments are deleted.

Palm oil plantation workers were today blamed for the deaths of 14 pygmy elephants on the remote island of Borneo. Wildlife rangers believe that the creatures could have eaten toxic substances laid to keep away 'pests' from the highly lucrative crop. The animals live on land in the Gunung Rara . Forest Reserve which is very close to palm oil fields. Thriving: The orphan pygmy elephant is being cared for at a wildlife reserve where it was taken after the death of its mother . A total of 14 pygmy elephants are now know to have died. Four adults were discovered yesterday in addition to ten bodies found earlier in the week. Vets said that all the dead elephants had suffered severe bleeding and gastrointestinal ulcers, suggesting they had been poisoned. Among the survivors is a three-month-old calf which was pictured pitifully trying to rouse his mother after she dropped down dead. It is now being cared for at a wildlife park in Sabah where rangers have found it a home with other orphans. Wildlife workers fear that more elephants could have been poisoned and are lying undiscovered in the remoter parts of Borneo. Laurentius Ambu, . Sabah’s director of wildlife, said: ‘We are very concerned that . many more carcasses are going to turn up. 'Because the elephants . travel in herds they are going to be picking up the poisons together so . we fear that there are still more dead that are going to be found.’ 'Great loss': A three-month-old elephant calf attempts to wake its mother; one of ten pygmy elephants found dead in Malaysia's Sabah state . Attached: The baby elephant sticks close to the body of its mother, while a wildlife department official gives it a drink . He said that rangers were scouring the island for areas where poison could have been laid. ‘My hunch is that there may be more (carcasses). I don’t think it’s an accident,' he added, explaining that the area where the dead elephants were found is . part of a 100,000-acre (40,469-hectare) piece of 'commercial forest . reserve' land managed by state agency Sabah Foundation. He said the area . was slated to be used as a tree plantation for sustainable logging. So . far, two palm oil plantations and a logging company operate in the area, . he said. Mr Ambu said far too many jungle areas . in Sabah were being broken up by agricultural or logging activities, . without corridors linking them to allow animals to pass through. 'This shouldn't be. The fragmentation . of forests has disrupted the elephants' traditional routes to look for . food. 'It is highly suspected that the . poisoning is blatantly done or that it's a well-planned programme.' Police are investigating the deaths and officials have declined to say whether there are any suspects. Meanwhile, conservationists say they . are deeply concerned about the effects the palm oil industry is having . on the wildlife of Borneo. A spokesman for the WWF said that the dead elephants were found in areas being converted for plantations, giving fresh urgency to activists' warnings of . rising conflict between man and wildlife as development accelerates. 'The central forest landscape in Sabah needs to be protected totally from conversion,' the group said in a statement. 'Conversions result in fragmentation of the forests, which in turn . results in loss of natural habitat for elephant herds, thus forcing them . to find alternative food and space, putting humans and wildlife wildlife in direct conflict.' Suspicious: Conservation officials believe the elephants, discovered in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, had been poisoned . 'Sad day': A total of seven female and three male pygmy elephants have been found in the forest over the past three weeks . The first ten known deaths of the . pygmy elephants were made public this week, capturing wide attention as . only about 1,200 of the elephants exist worldwide. Authorities released several . photographs of the elephant carcasses, including a particularly poignant . one of the three-month-old surviving calf trying to wake its dead . mother. Most of the pygmy elephants live in . Sabah and grow to about 8 feet (245 centimetres) tall, a foot or two . shorter than mainland Asian elephants. Known for their babyish faces, large . ears and long tails, Borneo pygmy elephants were found to be a distinct . subspecies only in 2003, after DNA testing. Sabah is one of the poorest states in . Malaysia. Sabah Foundation was granted huge forest concessions, . totaling about 14 percent of total land area in Sabah, by the state . government to enable it to generate income to fund its aim of improving . the lives of poor rural people.

Nick Clegg tore into David Cameron's pledge to protect pensioner benefits for millionaires as neither 'explicable or justifiable' Nick Clegg yesterday tore into David Cameron’s ‘completely irrational’ decision to protect benefits for wealthy pensioners while imposing cuts on the rest of society. The Lib Dem leader launched an extraordinary attack on the pledge made by his coalition partner that free bus passes, TV licences and winter fuel allowances would continue for all pensioners, including wealthy over-65s like Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar. Mr Clegg said he would be ‘gobsmacked’ if Mr Cameron repeated the promise in the Tory manifesto in 2015, which he predicted would be the ‘first full-blown scarcity election’. Ahead of the last election Mr Cameron told voters they could ‘read my lips’ as he vowed not all pensioner benefits would continue. But yesterday Mr Clegg said it was not fair on public sector workers or people on working age benefits who have been hit with real terms cuts to continue to fund giveaways for millionaires. Mr Cameron is coming under growing pressure from senior ministers to drop the pledge or risk appearing to be shelter traditionally Conservative voters from cuts. In a contemptuous swipe at the Tories, Mr Clegg said: ‘When you are having to make… unprecedented savings, the idea that you exempt millionaire and multimillionaire pensioners uniquely from further savings is completely irrational. ‘I would be gobsmacked in that context if any sensible, responsible political party will somehow think its explicable or justifiable that millionaire or multimillionaire pensioners are not going to be affected at all.’ Mr Clegg said it was 'irrational' to protect benefits for millionaire pensioners like Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar while capping public sector pay and tax credits . Mr Clegg claimed even most wealthy pensioners did not think they should be exempt from austerity.. Nick Clegg struck a blow for the cool . reputation of onesies when he became the most high profile politician to . date who owns an all-in-one. In the final question on his new LBC radio . phone-in, Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but . he had never worn it. 'I . was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have . got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the . privacy of my own home,' he added. He later joked he was a 'Onesie Nation politician'. The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie. ‘Let me make a prediction. Any political party who goes into the next general committing to not touch a single hair on the head of benefits for the most affluent pensions in this country will be found out very quickly,’ he told journalists at a parliamentary lunch. ‘You cannot ask people to take big cuts in their housing benefit, in their other benefits and say it’s OK for Peter Stringfellow and Alan Sugar to be given a whole bunch of free benefits when they don’t need it, paid for by other taxpayers.’ However, Mr Clegg insisted he did not . back a call from former Lib Dem minister Paul Burstow that the winter . fuel allowance, worth up to £300 to over-80s, be limited to just the . 2million poorest pensioners. ‘The question is where do you have the cut off. We haven’t decided as a party,’ he added. Mr Clegg predicted that parties would offer two-tier manifesto commitments for 2015, to prepare for another coalition government. He said they would have to establish which policies they would ‘die in a ditch’ for, and which ones were negotiable. Of his party’s infamous U-turn on raising university tuition fees, he said: ‘We’re not going to make that mistake again.’ Mr Clegg said there was a ‘principled case’ that when doctors, teachers and nurses have had payrises capped at one per cent and benefits are capped at one per cent, it was wrong to say : . ‘Oh and by the way Alan Sugar you carry on – whether he receives it or not - carry on with your tax-subsidised entitlement to winter fuel payments, TV licences… . What a difference: It was all smiles on Monday when Clegg, left, and Cameron presented their Mid-Term Review . ‘The next general election in my view is going to be the first full-blown scarcity election.’ Chris Huhne should return  to the Cabinet if he is cleared of making his ex-wife take his speeding points, Nick Clegg said yesterday. Asked if he hoped the former energy secretary, pictured, would return to front-line politics, the Liberal Democrat leader said: ‘I would like to see Chris if he is cleared of everything. He’s an old colleague and a friend of mine and I want to see him at the top table of British politics.’ Mr Huhne is facing criminal charges for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over claims that he persuaded Vicky Pryce to take his penalty points for a speeding offence in 2003. He also backed another round of . leadership debates featuring himself, Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed . Miliband – but resisted calls for UK Independence Party leader Nigel . Farage to be included, even though UKIP’s poll ratings are now nearly . double those of the Lib Dems. ‘The format we had before [at the last general election] was a good one,’ he said. Yesterday Ken Clarke became the . latest senior Conservative minister to signal that the Tory pledge to . protect universal benefits must be ditched in the next election . manifesto. ‘Before the . election the Labour party started putting out leaflets accusing us of . planning to take away benefits from pensioners,' he said. ‘Very rapidly a promise was given that we wouldn’t reduce benefits to pensioners,’ he told BBC Radio 4. 'We . actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them. 'They, I’m sure, when we get round, which we haven’t yet, contemplating . our manifesto for the next election they’ll be an agenda item.’","Tories promised to keep TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel allowance .

Residents in Shirley and Freemantle, Southampton, have seen 10 front gates stolen recently as enterprising thieves try to cash in on the rising price of raw materials. And the epidemic of gate thefts is becoming so extreme homeowners are having to lock away their gates in their own houses to keep thieves at bay. PC Jordan Williams, of Hampshire Police, said the rising price of scrap metal meant private properties were most at risk, according to the Daily Telegraph. In Scotland, 30 homes had their gates stolen in one night by raiders who managed to get away despite having to load their haul onto trucks. Elsewhere 30 gates were taken from a street in Berkshire at the end of last year, along with livestock gates, drain covers and even guttering.

Little Polina wore pink bows in her braided hair to meet her American parents, Jason and Kendra Skaggs. After months of waiting and stomach-churning anxiety, the five-year-old could finally go home to Arkansas with the couple. But the Skaggs were one of only a handful of U.S. families who were allowed to legally adopt a Russian child, following the January 1 ban of American adoptions of Russian youth, which has left hundreds of hopeful parents in limbo. For Larry and Kelly Czocher, their story ended quite differently, as they were told not to travel to the Eastern European country, as they were told their 13-month-old son, Andre, was no longer coming to America. Scroll down for video . Happy family: U.S. mother Kendra Skaggs hugs her adopted daughter, Polina at an orphanage in Moscow earlier this year; Mrs Skaggs was able to adopt since her paperwork was filed before the Russian ban . Proud parents: Polina and her new adoptive parents, Kendra and Jason Skraggs; Polina also has a new older brother, Carter . The Skaggs were kept in limbo on their adoption status, but flew to Moscow from their home in Bella Vista, Alabama in mid-January thinking they would be able to bring Polina home, ABC News reported. Mrs Skaggs told a local news station that the past few weeks have felt like a lifetime, not knowing if they would be able to bring the sweet girl home. The nervous couple drove to the orphanage to see Polina for the first time in a month hoping for the best. They were able to adopt her as their papers received court approval on December 24, just shy of the January 1 ban. Polina, who suffers from spinal bifida and has other special needs, sat in a brightly-colored wheelchair and asked in Russian, ‘Momma, do I get to come home with you?’ the moment she saw Mrs Skaggs. ‘Yes, da,’ the mother replied, causing the young girl to beam with happiness. Bedtime stories: The happy mother cozied up to her new daughter Polina, who she said loves to cuddle . Denied: Heartbroken Larry and Kelly Czocher of Ft. Lauderdale hold pictures of Andre, the son they hoped to adopt from Russia . Mrs Skaggs told ABC News that she and her husband were fearful of the psychological damage that could have been done to Polina had they not been able to complete the adoption, saying that it might have been ‘torture’ for the young girl to think that her parents had abandoned her and left her to live at an orphanage. 'We lost everything. It's a horrible, horrible situation.' -Kelly Czocher . Mr Skaggs said after returning from Moscow that being Polina’s parent ‘is really feeling very natural.’‘She’s very cuddly in the morning. It’s wonderful as a mom to be woken up in the morning,’ Mrs Skaggs told local news station NEWhomepage, and said that Polina will receive frequent physical therapy to help her spinal bifida. ‘I don’t like being woken up in the morning,’ her brother Carter said, but later announced that he wants his parents to adopt a brother or sister from Japan next. But for the Czocher family, the odds were not in their favor. The Sun-Sentinel reports that Larry and Kelly Czocher were not able to bring home Andre, the 13-month-old boy they were slated to adopt from Russia. Ban: Russia's President Vladimir Putin, pictured on February 5 from Sochi, Russia, imposed a ban on all U.S. adoptions from Russia, effective January 1 . Orphans of the Nikolo-Solbinsky Convent, north of Moscow . Though they had painted a nursery for him and had a closet full of clothes for the young boy, the Czochers were among the hundreds of hopeful parents tied up in Russia’s political battle. Russia's adoption ban enforced into law on January 1 was retaliation by leader Vladimir Putin for a new U.S. law targeting Russians accused of human rights abuses. It also addresses long-brewing resentment in Russia over the 60,000 Russian children who have been adopted by Americans in the past two decades, 19 of whom have died. Cases of Russian children dying or suffering abuse at the hands of their American adoptive parents have been widely publicized in Russia, and the law banning adoptions was called the Dima Yakovlev Bill after a toddler who died in 2008 when he was left in a car for hours in broiling heat. They thought, since their paperwork went through ahead of the ban, that they would still somehow get little Andre. But according to the Sun-Sentinel, the adoption agency called them, saying that everything was over. ‘We lost everything,’ Mrs Czocher, 38, said. The couple had focused their efforts on adopting internationally because of the favorable odds. They had tried to conceive through in-vitro fertilization, but it did not take. ‘It’s a horrible, horrible situation,’ the devastated wife said. The U.S. is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two decades. The Department of State said it regreted the Russian Parliament's decision to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families. Amnesty International Europe and Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act. 'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Kremlin children's tsar Pavel Astakhov said that Russian families would now adopt the children. However, they earlier declined to do so - which is why the youngsters are available for foreign adoption. Commentator Yuliya Latynina dubbed the move 'worse than a crime.'

Criticism: Jemima Khan, who previously supported Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, became the first of his backer's to criticise him . Jemima Khan became the first celebrity backer of Julian Assange to publicly criticise his decision to jump bail and seek refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. She said his ‘instantaneous rock-star status’ made him feel he was ‘above the law and exempt from criticism’, even likening him to Scientologist L Ron Hubbard. Nearly eight months after the WikiLeaks founder took up residence in the diplomatic building, Miss Khan, who put up bail money for Assange, laid bare her frustrations at his attempts to dodge extradition to Sweden where he is wanted over rape and sex assault allegations. She gave an extraordinary insight into how Assange, whose whistleblowing website angered Washington by releasing thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010, has alienated some of his staunchest allies. In a reference to fictional spy Jason Bourne, she said: ‘I jokingly asked if Assange was the new Jason Bourne, on the run and persecuted by the state. ‘It would be a tragedy if a man who has done so much good were to end up tolerating only disciples and unwavering devotion, more like an Australian L Ron Hubbard.’ Miss Khan, 39, described how she had previously supported Assange - even after he was arrested over the claims in late 2010. But the socialite and former wife of cricket star Imran Khan now says that his female accusers have ‘human rights’, too, and that she had gone from “admiration to demoralisation” on the subject of WikiLeaks. She said in the New Statesman: ‘The timing of the rape allegations and the issuing of the Interpol arrest warrant for Assange in November 2010 initially seemed suspicious to many, including me. 'They came just two days after the release of the first batch of embarrassing state department cables.’ Rock star status: Miss Khan referred to Assange's ‘instantaneous rock-star status’ and likened him to founding Scientologist L Ron Hubbard . She went on: ‘It may well be that the serious allegations of sexual assault and rape are not substantiated in court, but I have come to the conclusion that these are all matters for Swedish due process and that Assange is undermining both himself and his own transparency agenda – as well as doing the US department of justice a favour – by making his refusal to answer questions in Sweden into a human rights issue. ‘There have been three rounds in the UK courts and the UK courts have upheld the European Arrest Warrant in his name three times. ‘The women in question have human rights, too, and need resolution. Assange’s noble cause and his wish to avoid a US court does not trump their right to be heard in a Swedish court. ‘I don’t regret putting up bail money for Assange but I did it so that he would be released while awaiting trial, not so that he could avoid answering to the allegations.’ Asylum: Julian Assange making a speech outside the Ecuador Embassy in London where he has sought political asylum . Miss Khan did not reveal how much bail money she put up for Assange although it has previously been reported she promised as much as £20,000. In August last year, two months after he went into hiding at the Ecuadorian Embassy, the fugitive, 41, emerged on the building’s balcony to portray himself as a martyr for free speech who faced oppression from a ‘war on whistle-blowers’. In a rambling speech, he accused the US of a ‘witch-hunt’ that threatened freedom of expression. Undermining: Miss Khan, who is associate editor of the New Statesman, said Assange is 'undermining both himself and his transparency agenda' Ironically, he then thanked a roll-call of Latin American countries, most of which are routinely criticised for their appalling track record over freedom of speech and human rights. It was the first time he had been seen in public since he walked into the embassy last June to claim asylum. Miss Khan, who is associate editor of the New Statesmen, said: ‘The problem is that WikiLeaks – whose mission statement was “to produce . . . a more just society . . . based upon truth” – has been guilty of the same obfuscation and misinformation as those it sought to expose, while its supporters are expected to follow, unquestioningly, in blinkered, cultish devotion.’ She said that in August last year, she tried several times to ask Assange to address points about his extradition battle which had been made by a New Statesman colleague, but he snubbed each attempt. ‘I was told that Assange was “very busy”, though I was invited to visit the Ecuadorean embassy, where he had recently taken refuge to avoid extradition, for a photo opportunity, which I declined,’ she said. ‘I have seen flashes of Assange’s charm, brilliance and insightfulness – but I have also seen how instantaneous rock-star status has the power to make even the most clear-headed idealist feel that they are above the law and exempt from criticism.’ Assange was arrested in Britain in December 2010 on an extradition warrant from Sweden. After losing a protracted legal battle to avoid extradition, which went all the way to Britain’s Supreme Court, Assange jumped bail and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London last June. He has been inside the building ever since. In October last year, a number of Assange’s supporters were ordered to forfeit £93,500 in bail money after the WikiLeaks founder skipped bail. Ms Khan was executive producer of a documentary film about WikiLeaks entitled “We Steal Secrets” which recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States. She said the film, directed by Oscar-winning documentary maker Alex Gibney, sought to present a balanced view of the WikiLeaks story but Assange had denounced it before seeing it.","Becomes first celebrity backer to criticise Wikileaks founder for jumping bail .

Reputed Philadelphia mob boss Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi will seek bail after a jury deadlocked on a racketeering charge against him, and deadlocked or acquitted him of all eight lesser counts in a gambling and loansharking case. The federal jury convicted underboss Joseph 'Mousie' Massimino and two others of racketeering, and convicted a mob associate of two loansharking counts. But the jury deadlocked or acquitted the seven defendants on most of the approximately 60 counts. Underworld: The alleged 'boss' of the Philadelphia mob Joseph Ligambi (center), with two unknown associates, is standing trial on extortion charges . Defense lawyers saw the verdict as a . slam of the government's 13-year investigation into illegal gambling, . video poker machines and loansharking in South Philadelphia. The jury . had heard one defendant complain on a secret FBI recording that 'it's a . broke, broke mob.' Verdict: The jury acquitted Joseph 'Scoops' Licata of the racketeering charge . Lead defense lawyer Edwin Jacobs Jr. called the prosecution 'an enormous waste' of taxpayer money. Unlike earlier mob trials in Philadelphia, there was no violence alleged, other than purported threats by debt collectors. 'We're . not talking about terrorists. We're not talking about schoolchildren . being shot up. We're talking about video machines that aren't hurting . anybody,' Jacobs said after the verdict. 'The only problem is they weren't controlled by the state.' The reputed mobsters also complain on . the tapes that legalized state gambling had cut into their video poker . and sports betting business. Federal prosecutors call the case important and say they will consider retrying the unresolved counts. 'We respect the jury's verdict,' Assistant U.S. Attorney John Han said. 'We will decide whether to go forward with the charges on which the jury was undecided.' The parties are due back in court . today when Ligambi and others not convicted are expected to seek bail . after about two years in custody awaiting trial. The . jury also convicted reputed mob soldier Damion Canalichio and reputed . mob associate Gary Battaglini of racketeering conspiracy. It . deadlocked on that for Ligambi nephew George Borgesi and Anthony Staino . Jr. Staino, who remains free on bail at least until Wednesday, was . convicted of two loansharking counts. The jury acquitted Joseph 'Scoops' Licata of the racketeering charge. Trial: Joseph 'Uncle Joe' Ligambi (pictured), reputed head of the Philadelphia mob, was on trial for allegedly selling illegal gambling devices to bars, restaurants and shops . The verdict follows a three-month trial and testimony from a series of mob turncoats, including an aging mobster who admitted killing several people before going into the federal witness protection program. When the trial started in October, there hadn't been a mob killing in Philadelphia in nearly a decade. That seemingly changed the day the government rested its case in December. Hours later, a convicted drug dealer suspected of cooperating with federal prosecutors was gunned down outside his house in South Philadelphia in broad daylight. Gambling figure Anthony Nicodemo was soon charged with the execution-style slaying. Nicodemo's name has come up at trial on FBI wiretaps. The racketeering trial evidence included testimony from former La Cosa Nostra members, FBI agents who infiltrated a New York crime family and thousands of FBI wiretaps. Five people pleaded guilty before trial; three more await trial. Prosecutors believe the quiet, business-like Ligambi assumed control of the Philadelphia crime family after flashy, young boss Joseph 'Joey' Merlino went to prison in 1999. Merlino was released last year and has settled in Boca Raton, Fla. Merlino's father died in prison in October. His mother has occasionally attended the Ligambi trial, joining the outspoken, tight-knit group of friends and family members from South Philadelphia who came to court each day.","Mob 'boss' Joseph Ligambi on trial in Philadelphia .

Big Brother star Jade Goody has been revealed as the inspiration behind the government’s wide-ranging reforms of the education system. She was ridiculed in her first appearance on the Channel 4 show when she thought East Anglia was a foreign country. But Education Secretary Michael Gove launched a spirited defence of the late TV celebrity, insisting she was let down by her teachers but was bright enough to turn her notoriety into millions of pounds which she used to send her children to a top school. Education Secretary Michael Gove said Jade Goody had proved that she was intelligent but had been let down by her schooling . Mr Gove even ranked Goody, who died from cervical cancer in 2009, alongside Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci when naming the influences on his reforms. He insisted Goody’s ‘lack of knowledge’ was the fault of her poor education but proved her intelligence by turning her brief spell in the limelight coming in Big Brother 2002 into a multi-million pound career. ‘When she first appeared on our screens in Big Brother Jade was regarded as paragon of invincible ignorance,’ Mr Gove said. ‘She was derided and mocked because she thought that Cambridge was in London. On being told that Cambridge is in East Anglia, she assumed that to be abroad, and referred to it as ‘East Angular’. ‘Her other misconceptions included the belief that Rio de Janeiro was a person and not a city.’ Mr Gove said that his reforms were not really Conservative, but uncompromisingly radical . Mr Gove said it was a ‘double cruelty’ to mock these errors. ‘Deriving entertainment from another’s misfortunes is wrong in itself. But in any case, her lack of knowledge was not her fault but the education system’s.’ But he said there was ‘no doubt’ that she was intelligent. ‘She exploited the notoriety she had earned to make herself a ubiquitous television and magazine presence, earning huge sums in the process and becoming in due course far wealthier than most of her detractors.’ And when diagnosed with cervical cancer she ‘husbanded her earnings’ for her two sons to attend ‘the most traditional, academically demanding prep school she could find’. ‘So they could enjoy the best education reality TV could buy.’ Mr Gove said Goody was an example of thousands of parents who want their children to do better. ‘Because parents – especially poorer parents – want their children to get up and get on. And that means acquiring a proper rounded rigorous education. In the hope that they can choose to go to university. ‘Jade knew that the most precious thing she could bequeath her children was not money but knowledge and the best guarantee of their future happiness was not the power to indulge whims with cash but the power to choose your own future through education. ‘The idea that there is a significant number of parents who lack ambition for their children, who are not aspirational, who scorn book learning and are hostile to academic excellence is just not true.’ He said that pupils should have a 'stock of knowledge' about history, . culture, maths and science in order to understand the world around them. Ministers are due to set out their new curriculum for primary and secondary schools within days. But Labour's Stephen Twigg today accused Mr Gove of pursuing an 'outdated' measure of educational achievement based on a narrow group of academic subjects. The shadow education secretary said he wants to see 'rigour in the whole curriculum', rather than in selected subjects. Mr Twigg said: 'For him it's only aspirational to pursue an academic route. This is one of the many false choices that he argues. 'I believe that high quality vocational education is something to aspire to, and as the evidence shows from many high performing countries in vocational education - like Switzerland and Germany - it's the high flyers who choose to study it. I want high quality academic and high quality vocational education.' Goody appeared on Big Brother in 2002 and the Celebrity version in 2007, turning her notoriety into a multi-million pound career before her death in 2009 . In a speech to the Social Market . Foundation last night, Mr Gove said his reforms were not conservative . 'but rather uncompromisingly radical'. He said: 'Because conservatives have always tended to suspect that many of the things which need to be protected from generation to generation - the Royal Opera House, the House of Lords, the Bar, Oxford High Table, agreeable homes with lovely views over the Downs, marriage, the bench of bishops, Lord Lieutenancies and Tate Gallery directorships - can only be protected if they're enjoyed by a minority. 'I don't look at the world that way. I think the things we need to protect and enhance - a love of literature, pride in our history, scientific curiosity, beautiful written English, innovative and creative mathematical thinking, joy in discovery, colleges and universities, liberal learning and openness to the world, female emancipation and social mobility - are all better protected if we make them as universal as possible. 'And I suspect that even if not every Conservative agrees with me, Jade Goody and Antonio Gramsci would.'","Education Secretary ranks late Big Brother star alongside Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci .

Sir David Nicholson: He has refused to step down and said the appalling standards of care were due to a 'system failure' The most powerful man in the NHS refused to quit last night despite presiding over one of Britain’s most appalling hospital scandals. While relatives of some of the hundreds of patients who died needlessly at Stafford Hospital called for his head, Sir David Nicholson said he was ‘not ashamed’ of his tenure in office. Sir David, who helped appoint the hospital’s chief executive, revealed he did consider resigning – but decided against it, concluding that the scandal had been caused by a ‘system failure’. ‘When I saw the patients’ stories…there was a moment when I did think about that [resigning], but I was pretty sure that I knew broadly what we had to do,’ he said. Relatives of victims and MPs lined up to castigate the conclusions by Robert  Francis QC that no one should be scapegoated over the disgrace. They said Sir David and former Stafford managers should ‘carry the can’ for the Health Service’s abject failure to ensure a proper standard of care at the hospital. As many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust between 2005 and 2008 with thousands of others subject to ‘inhumane’ and ‘degrading’ treatment. Sir David has been chief executive of the NHS since 2007, a job which comes with a £270,000 salary. Before that he was chief executive of the West Midlands strategic health authority which had overall responsibility for Mid Staffordshire Trust at the time of the scandal. The report did criticise the leadership of this authority, which Mr Nicholson headed from 2005 to 2007 – saying it ‘failed to be sufficiently sensitive to signs that patients might be at risk’. Yesterday, the NHS chief executive conducted a round of interviews. And he told ITV News: ‘I am not ashamed of being in my job today. Clearly I regret incredibly what happened to those patients. David Cameron said he shared concerns that not one doctor or nurse has been struck off for poor care, or that failing managers are often ‘recycled’ to different parts of the NHS. Sir David says he is 'not ashamed' of his tenure in charge of the NHS, despite the scandal at Stafford Hospital . The relatives of hundreds of patients who died needlessly at Stafford Hospital have called for Sir David's head . But both the Prime Minister and Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said they had confidence in Sir David’s . ability to stay in charge. Mr Cameron told the Commons it would be wrong . to ‘scapegoat’ him and said that he had ‘learned the lessons’. But campaigner Julie Bailey, who lost her mother due to failings at the trust, said: ‘We are asking for the resignation of David Nicholson, because he has presided over this disaster. Somebody must be held to account for these failings.’ The 1,780-page report revealed that doctors at the Mid Staffordshire trust admitted they became ‘immune to the sound of pain’ and patients were routinely abandoned on trolleys on without food or drink. Wards and departments were ‘ruled by fear’. Shame: Kath Mountford, 78, was admitted to Stafford Hospital with emphysema and chronic asthma. She died of pneumonia without being seen by the doctor, despite being there for 7 days .

Yesterday, as Mr Francis delivered his findings, he called for sweeping reforms to the NHS to ensure the mistakes could not be made again, including: . However, Mr Francis concluded no individual was to blame for the failings. ‘This is not a case where it was ever going to be possible or permissible to find an individual or a group of individuals was to blame for this,’ his report said. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the health select committee, demanded an investigation into claims in the report that Sir David dismissed the complaints of relatives of dead patients as ‘simply lobbying’.

Sheila Gilmore, Scottish Labour MP for Edinburgh East, tweeted her concerns about the closure of all the city's stores. 'News that all HMV stores in Edinburgh will close is devastating for workers,' she said. 'Thoughts are with them today.' Its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping. Recently, . the internet caused further problems for the struggling chain – when . staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account . of mass sackings at head office. Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters. Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired. The incident triggered panic among HMV . executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice . on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed. The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live . from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later . came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass . execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’ Final stand: The rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being 'ruined' so they had no other choice .

However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and . those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have . mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’ The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times. Poppy Rose Cleere, who described . herself as HMV’s social media planner, said she was behind . the tweets. Poppy Rose Cleere, Online Marketing & Social Media Planner at HMV, was behind the tweets . The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’ the importance of social media. ‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ she said in a message from her personal account. ‘Since my internship . started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance . of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to . build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable . real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over . 91 years.’ Staff at HMV, which employs more than . 4,000 people, have been afraid for their future since the chain went . into administration last month. There are hopes that many of the 239 . shops and their staff can be saved through a sale of the business to . Hilco, which specialises in rescuing failed brands.

The brother of a developer believed to have been held hostage for eight months has revealed he was threatened at gunpoint during his captivity. Property tycoon Kevin McGeever, who vanished last summer, was found wandering barefoot on a rural road in the west of Ireland last week and looked like he had 'just been released from a concentration camp'. His brother Brendan revealed his kidnappers repeatedly pushed a gun to his forehead and handed him notes warning him he had two more days to live. Kevin McGeever, pictured with his partner Siobhan O'Callaghan, was discovered wandering barefoot after his eight-month ordeal . 'They put a gun to his forehead one time and he said ""do it now, do it now, I've made my peace with my God, I'm ready"",' said Mr McGeever. 'And that happened quite a few times, that wasn't just the once.' The developer, originally from Swinford in Co Mayo, had been living in a gated mansion in neighbouring county Galway when he disappeared last June. The emaciated 68-year-old had a long beard, hair and finger nails when found and in a malnourished and dehydrated state near Ballinamore, Co Leitrim, on Tuesday, January 29. He had lost several stone in weight and remains in hospital in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, where he has been interviewed by investigators. Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan said the investigation is in its 'early days' and that gardai were considering out all of the aspects of the case. Mr McGeever came face to face with his . brother who looked like 'a weather-beaten 90-year-old man who was just . released from a concentration camp'. The brother does not believe his tycoon sibling will ever recover from his ordeal and will remain in hospital for a long time. Mr McGeever's home, 'Nirvana', in Craughwell, Galway. The property tycoon was kept in a darkened room and threatened several times, his brother claimed . 'It's like asking someone who's just released from a concentration camp when do you think you'll be going back to work,' he said. 'You've no idea what's going on inside his body, but I would say a lot of organs in there have never experienced anything like this before. 'He's the fittest guy I know for his age. He used to be 14 stone, now he's about half of that.' Mr McGeever said initially he was not worried about his brother's whereabouts as he often travelled around the world. He made a fortune building houses, first in his native county and then abroad, including Dubai, and fronted KMM Commercial Properties. But the family became concerned after two texts, one from England and one from Germany, were sent to his partner Siobhan O'Callaghan saying he was sorry he had to leave. He was discovered carrying a torch and a mobile phone by a local woman as she drove near the Cavan-Leitrim border last week after he had been thrown from the back of a van. It is understood he had been kept in a darkened room or container and survived on water and a daily sandwich which was given by his kidnappers, who kept their faces covered and only communicated by writing notes. Mr McGeever said he has no idea why the developer was taken, but stressed his brother has rubbished claims he was abducted by the Russian mafia as 'nonsense'. He maintained he has no reason not to believe his brother's story. 'When you look at somebody lying in a bed in the condition that he is in now, anybody that would have any doubts about anything would be totally convinced,' he added. During the boom times in Ireland – the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger economy from 1995 to 2007 – Mr McGeever sold luxury homes in Dubai to wealthy clients, including some from Britain. He also owned one of Ireland’s biggest mansions, a £3million property which was nicknamed Nirvana by locals in the west of the country and is surrounded by immaculate lawns. He drove a Porsche and travelled in a helicopter which had his initials KMM emblazoned across it.","Kevin McGeever, found on January 29, was told he had 'days to live'

Cllr Woodbridge started the campaign in 2002 after running as a Labour candidate for Swanley Town Council in 1999. He has now decided to name the campaign after Vicki as he continues the battle with Kent County Council to reduce the speed limit at the spot. The former Swanley Town Council leader said: 'The campaign started because there were so many car accidents along the road. 'Nobody has died there as far as I know but it is ridiculous that it has taken somebody to be killed for this campaign to come to light. 'This is a small little town with 30mph roads but this one is 40mph and there has been a number of crashes here in the past.

'I have been trying to persuade Kent County Council to do something for years but they haven’t done anything and neither has the Highway Agency. 'The reason nothing has been done is because of the cost of changing the limit but I don’t see how it can be so expensive. 'Once we have got the funeral out of the way I will go back to campaigning and hopefully something will eventually be done.' A spokesman for Swanley Town Council said it has consistently campaigned for the reduction of speeds throughout the town of Swanley and Swanley Village. He said: 'When invited to respond to various consultations, the town council has requested all speed limits be reduced to a maximum of 30mph on all roads in the parish and to 20mph on roads near schools, playgrounds and open spaces and that speed awareness signage be installed as various locations within the town.' Flowers and cards have been left at the spot where Vicki Woodbridge died. Her uncle campaigned for the speed limit to be reduced along the same stretch of road . Witness Gemma Kelsey was driving along London Road at 6pm on January 30 when she saw the car in front of her suddenly swerve. The driver of the car pulled over and was seen screaming as Vicki lay on the roadside. Miss Woodbridge died the day before her grandmother's funeral was due to take place. Kent Police is appealing for witnesses to come forward. A spokeswoman for Kent County Council added: 'In Kent, the number of people killed or seriously injured in road crashes fell significantly between 2000 and 2010, exceeding the government target of a 40 per cent reduction, as a result of improved road conditions and targeted publicity campaigns, and this figure continues to fall – down by 5 per cent in 2011, compared to the previous year. 'We improve the roads by investing in safety measures after analysing all crashes every year to establish whether there are patterns that can be tackled with specific action. 'We were extremely saddened to hear of the recent fatality in London Road, Swanley. 'We are currently awaiting notification from Kent Police of their investigation and although at the moment we have no plans to reduce the speed limit, we will fully consider any highway related findings when the investigation has concluded.'","Vicki Woodbridge was killed as she crossed a busy road in Swanley .

The former Anglo Irish Bank is to be liquidated after emergency laws were rushed through Ireland's parliament overnight. The deal that followed long-running talks with European chiefs aims to ease the burden of the 28billion euro (£24billion) bailout of the toxic lender. President Michael D Higgins signed it into law finally signed it into law after politicians sat through the night to pass legislation. Failed: Pedestrians are seen walking past what was branch of the Anglo Irish Bank in Dublin. The former bank is now set to be liquidated . Finance Minister Michael Noonan was forced to act when reports of an agreement with the European Central Bank leaked out yesterday afternoon. However, opposition lawmakers were angered at the short time they had to digest the highly . technical 58-page bill and complained that they did not yet know what, if . anything, would be agreed with Frankfurt. 'We cannot vote for this if we don't know the other part of the package,' said opposition lawmaker Shane Ross. But Kenny's large majority prevailed and the lower chamber voted in favour of . the bill by 113-36. People on Twitter dubbed the session #promnight, a play . on words on Anglo's infamous promissory notes, and one user said the late . night meant lawmakers finally had a legitimate reason to be asleep in . parliament. The liquidation will now be carried out under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) Bill 2013, the rebranded name for Anglo. The IBRC has assets worth 12billion euro (£10.3billion). Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan was forced to act on AIB when reports of an agreement with the European Central Bank leaked out . The Central Bank of Ireland has moved to reassure remaining IBRC deposit holders they will be paid under the liquidation programme . Liquidated: The former headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank in Dublin . Mr Noonan warned that not dealing . with the issue could result in potential liabilities of up to 40billion . euro (£34.5billion) for the country. He . said: 'As soon as the information relating to the proposal to liquidate . IBRC was made public, there was an immediate risk to the bank. 'Given . this position, I as minister for finance, took immediate action to . secure the stability of the bank and the value of its assets, valued at . 12billion euros (£10.4bn), on behalf of the state.' Mr Higgins last night cut short an official visit to Italy to sign the legislation and he will return to Rome later today. Irish President Michael Higgins signed the deal into law after politicians worked through the night . The liquidation will not affect court cases or legal action taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Government said. Anglo's . former chief executive, Sean FitzPatrick, and two former directors, Pat . Whelan and Willie McAteer, are awaiting trial on fraud charges linked . to the collapse of the bank. The contracts of 800-plus employees at . the IBRC have been terminated but most workers are expected to transfer . to the state's bad bank, the National Assets Management Agency (Nama). Nama will take on all of IBRC's assets and debts. Anglo Irish was at the forefront of the property boom in the Irish Republic under its former boss Sean Fitzpatrick, who is due to go on trial next month along with two other senior executives accused of alleged financial irregularities. The bank's near collapse in 2008 pressured the government into guaranteeing the entire financial sector, sucking it into a downward spiral and in late 2010, a €67.5bn EU-IMF bailout. That year, the bank posted a 17.65billion euro loss, the largest by any firm in Irish history. Under Dublin's plan, the 28billion euro in promissory notes will be replaced with . long-term government bonds, meaning that Ireland can make more gradual repayments. In a statement the Central Bank of Ireland moved to reassure remaining IBRC deposit holders they will be paid under the liquidation programme. 'The Central Bank will arrange the repayment of duly verified and eligible deposits, up to a limit of 100,000 euro per person, to eligible depositors at IBRC,' it said. The statement continued: 'Depositors do not need to take any action; the Central Bank will make payments directly by cheque where applicable.' Money is expected to be paid out over the coming weeks. In the wake of the parliamentary vote, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny also moved to reassure people, saying the liquidation of Anglo Irish was a significant milestone in Ireland's 'path back to prosperity and full employment'. 'It closes a sad and tragic chapter in our economic and political history,' he said. But he added: 'Let there be no doubt that this decision is not a silver bullet to end all our economic problems. The damage done by these economic institutions will take many years to rectify.' Pre 2007: Ireland enjoys a decade long property boom during which easy bank credit prompts new buildings to mushroom around the country. May, 2007: Anglo Irish Bank's shares peak at more than 17 euro (£15) each. September, 2008: Amid international banking turmoil, the Government announces a 400billion euro (£353billion) guarantee scheme covering the country's six main banks, including Anglo. December 18: Sean FitzPatrick (pictured right) resigns as chairman and admits he hid more than 80million euro (£70million) in secret loans from shareholders.

A new commuter rail concourse is being built 16 stories below Grand Central Station as part of a $15billion development. An army of workers is blasting through bedrock to create the shiny new area that will have more floor space than New Orlean's Superdrome. It is one of three hidden projects going on beneath the streets of New York City to expand what is already the nation's biggest mass transit system. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the Second Avenue Subway at 46th Street in New York City, part of $15billion improvements to the subway . A planned Mezzanine elevator in the Second Avenue Subway will look like this artist's impression in the planned works to ease congestion on Lexington Avenue trains . The most dramatic project will result in a . sort of 21st century, underground Grand Central Terminal mirroring the . century-old Grand Central Terminal above -a 350,000-square-foot, $8.3 . billion commuter rail concourse with six miles of new tunnels. Even with blasting and machinery grinding through the rock day and night, most New Yorkers are unaware of the construction below ground that includes a massive, eight-story cavern, miles of tunnels and watery, gravel-filled pits. Engineer Michael Horodniceanu, president of capital construction for the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority said: 'I look at it and I'm in wonder, I'm in awe. 'I feel like when I went to Rome and entered St. Peter's Basilica for the first time. I looked at it and said, ""Wow, how did they do that?""' In New York, they hauled out so much rocky debris from under Grand Central that it could have covered Central Park almost a foot deep, Horodniceanu says. Together, the three projects will cost an estimated $15 billion. And when they're all completed, estimated for 2019, they will bring subway and commuter rail service to vast, underserved stretches of the city, particularly the far East and West sides of Manhattan. 'They'll be a game-changer for New Yorkers,' says Horodniceanu. It will accommodate Long Island Rail Road trains that now bypass Manhattan's East Side as they roll east through Queens and straight to Pennsylvania Station on the island's West Side. This so-called East Side Access will bring about 160,000 passengers a day from Long Island to a new station in Queens' Sunnyside neighborhood, then about five more miles to the new, eight-track Grand Central hub. It is currently a construction site about five football pitches long. The Federal Transit Administration is kicking in $2.7 billion toward the estimated $8.3 billion budget, with the MTA state agency covering the rest using mostly taxpayer money. Crews have carved out tunnels and were preparing to lay down concrete on the construction of the Second Avenue Subway . Hundreds of workers are busy underground but are barely noticed by New Yorkers above . Also under construction is the Second Avenue Subway that eventually will serve Manhattan's far East Side, from Harlem to the island's southern tip. The planned eight miles of track will open Manhattan's East Side to millions of people who now squeeze daily onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 subway trains running under Lexington Avenue. Dubbed the 'The Line That Time Forgot,' the Second Avenue Subway has been a New York City dream since the 1920s. Then came the Great Depression and World War II, followed by lack of funds that stopped the project after several stretches of tunnel with tracks were built in the 1970s. The existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones. The first phase - 1.7 miles with stations between East 63rd and East 96th streets - is to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $4.5 billion. Funding and plans for the rest of the route are still up in the air. Finally, there's the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to a huge new real estate development on Manhattan's Far West Side, New York's biggest besides the World Trade Center. It's called Hudson Yards, a small urban village of high-rises, parkland, retail businesses and cultural institutions in the West 30s. Moody's Investors Service calls this subway extension - financed through $2.1billion worth of city-issued bonds - 'a key milestone towards attracting development.' 'These are vital projects, and they'll reinforce the infrastructure of the city,' says Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University. 'It's not just about people going to work; the New York subway and rail systems are busy 24 hours a day, taking people shopping, to theaters, to clubs.' The city's 468 subway stations register more than 1.6billion rides a year. The system is used by more than 5 million daily riders. The Metro in Washington, D.C., has about 800,000, and San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit has about 400,000. The three mammoth projects require creative solutions and the latest technology. The artist's impression of the new concourse is a far cry from the average New York subway . When crews prepared to drill the giant new cavity under Second Avenue, they first had to freeze the ground to about minus 20 degrees so as not to destabilize the buildings above as the boring machine cut through. For that, aluminum tubes were inserted from the street and a special chemical solution was poured into the ground and cooled by a refrigeration plant. The Second Avenue tunnels hold a space-age surprise: The ceilings are coated with a material once used to fireproof the space shuttle. The new line has another major improvement. Instead of ventilation grates that allow rainwater to pour in, the new stations will be aired using enclosed cooling plants. When Superstorm Sandy hit the city last October, floodwaters washing over the East Side did not penetrate subway construction sites. 'We're using the best technology available today, but this is really people-intensive work,' says Horodniceanu, who supervises a team of thousands of workers on any given day. 'I feel I have the most exciting job in the world,' he says. 'It's an incredible feeling to be able to build a legacy project. I hope that one day, my grandchildren will be able to say their granddad built this.'","Work is part of $15billion improvements to the New York subway system .

Mr Heath insisted ready meals were safe following the withdrawal of Findus beef lasagne meals, which have been found to contain up to 100 per cent horsemeat. But he said it would be ‘bad politics’ to follow former Tory Agriculture Minister Mr Gummer’s attempt to win public trust at the height of the 1990 mad cow crisis. Mr Gummer was photographed eating a burger and feeding some to his four-year-old daughter Cordelia. Scroll down for video .

In case he didn’t fancy Italian, we had a Findus cottage pie and Findus chilli con carni on stand-by to pop into the hall’s microwave. The smiling Lib-Dem Minister inspected our lunch offer and replied: ‘How kind.’ But, betraying a certain lack of trust, he asked: ‘Is this the one that’s been withdrawn?’ When we assured him it was spaghetti bolognese, purchased only two hours previously, Mr Heath replied: ‘Listen, my concern is that we went through this with John Selwyn Gummer and I think that was bad politics because it’s not a question of what I think – it’s what the public are happy with. Mane meal: Findus beef lasagne has been withdrawn but Mr Heath would not eat another beef dish from the company . ‘I don’t have a problem with the meal – the advice I get is that this food is safe. But put it all over the papers and it’s “Minister re-visiting John Selwyn Gummer”. ‘I’m not dodging it. I just think that was really, really bad politics at the time because people have got to take their own decisions. ‘We’ve got to give them the facts based on all the evidence that we have. Let’s get that evidence.’ He added: ‘What we’re doing at the moment is reading the riot act to manufacturers and processors and saying, “Look, you’ve got to test everything and give us an assurance.” ‘It’s the biggest test we’ve ever had on . beef products across the country.

Win: David Cameron pictured at the EU Budget summit at the European Council building in Brussels, has got his wish to see the EU budget cut . French president Francois Hollande dramatically snubbed David Cameron last night as Britain appeared on the brink of winning an historic battle for a real terms cut in the EU’s bloated budget. The move from the socialist president, who is resisting budget cuts, came as it emerged profligate EU bureaucrats have awarded themselves pay rises worth an average of £3,000 a year. In what was quickly dubbed ‘Le Sulk’ by diplomats, Mr Hollande caused astonishment at an EU summit by failing to turn up for talks with Mr Cameron, German leader Angela Merkel and European Council president Herman van Rompuy. Mr Hollande claimed meetings with the leaders of other spendthrift nations – including Italy and Spain – had ‘overrun’ and did not appear for any of a scheduled hour-long discussion in Brussels. Mr Hollande was said to be furious that Mr van Rompuy was on the point of agreeing to demands from Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel for a significant cut in EU spending. The Prime Minister has repeatedly threatened to veto a seven-year deal unless Brussels agrees to tighten its belt. Rumours swept the summit that Mr van Rompuy was ready to agree to a budget ceiling of around £819billion – a cut of more than £60billion from his initial proposal of £881billion. If approved, it would be the first time in the history of the EU that leaders have agreed to cut the budget. The EU’s last seven-year budget, which runs from 2007 to 2013, had a ceiling of £847billion. Arriving for talks, the Prime Minister said: ‘Frankly, the European Union should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we’ve had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely.’ Rift: Mr Hollande (right) failed to turn up for talks at the EU . summit with Mr Cameron, German leader . Angela Merkel and European Council president Herman van Rompuy . Demanding cuts: Mr Hollande was said to be furious that European Council president Mr van Rompuy was on the point of agreeing to demands from Mr Cameron and Angela Merkel for a significant cut in EU spending . He said the numbers on the previous proposal had been ‘far too high’, warning: ‘If they don’t come down, there won’t be a deal.’ Crucially, he has secured the support of Europe’s most powerful leader, Mrs Merkel, as well as the Dutch, the Swedish and the Finns. But although Mr Cameron has targeted the pay and perks of the 50,000 EU officials, it also emerged that a longstanding levy on their salaries has been allowed to lapse. It means they will now receive automatic windfalls worth an average of £3,000 a year – an increase of 4.47 per cent, and pushing the average pay past £70,000 for the first time. Chris Howarth, senior political analyst at the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘The EU budget negotiations have shown how difficult it is for member states to ask their taxpayers to continue to fund an unreformed EU civil service. The Prime Minister, pictured with Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said: 'Frankly, the European Union should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we've had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely' If member states are serious in reforming the EU budget, EU civil servants’ pay, allowances and tax privileges all need to be looked at.’ Eurosceptic MP Mark Pritchard, one of the Prime Minister’s harshest critics, who led a Commons revolt over EU spending, said: ‘If the PM comes back to the UK with a real terms cut in the EU Budget it will be a historic political achievement. He will deserve praise.’ However, the talks could be scuppered due to the demands of France, which is targeting Britain’s budget rebate, and Italy, which wants a higher overall EU budget to which it makes lower contributions. Mr Hollande wants to slash the annual rebate for Britain won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Tony Blair gave away a chunk of the rebate in 2005, in exchange for a promise of reform of agricultural subsidies that never materialised, but Mr Cameron has vowed to defend what remains to the hilt.","Francois Hollande failed to turn up for talks with the PM in Brussels .

A secret tunnel from a man's cellar led to a shipping container buried underground containing a cannabis factory. Adrian James, 43, used a mechanical digger to bury the container in the back garden of his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. The father-of-two then dug a tunnel from his cellar which led to the huge metal shipping trailer and hid the secret entrance with a board covered in tools. The tunnel was 16ft long and covered by 3ft of soil. His drug-cultivating operation included automatic watering systems so he could grow the haul with little effort. James was arrested in October 2011 after police raided his home looking for drugs following a tip-off. At first they only found cannabis plants in one room. But once they uncovered the secret tunnel, they soon discovered the huge container where the cannabis plants were growing. A standard shipping container measures 20ft by 8ft. Inside were hydroponics equipment with timer switches and an automatic watering system for the plantation. In total £86,000-worth of cannabis was seized from the house and container. Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court last Tuesday, James pleaded guilty to production of cannabis at a commercial level and was sentenced to three years in prison.

The diets of ancient apex predators is difficult to discern, because as they were at the top of the food chain there were fewer of them. But 'exceptional fossil sites' in Cerro de los Batallones, near Madrid, have yielded clues as to what three ancient carnivores fed upon, reports journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. This illustration depicts how the region of Cerro de los Batallones in central Spain likely looked 9 million years ago. Researchers used carbon to shed light on how saber-toothed cats and bear dogs shared space and prey during the late Miocene period . Researchers studied two sabre-toothed cats - one the size of a modern leopard and the other the size of a modern tiger - as well as a prehistoric 'bear dog'. The team calculated what kind of creatures lived in the area nine million years ago from dental records. They then compared the carbon isotope of the three predators to those of the herbivores, allowing them to make a calculation as to what the beasts ate. Dr Soledad Domingo, of the University of Michigan, said that the sabre toothed cats ate ancient horses, while the bear dog ate astroportax, similar to the modern buffalo. He said: 'The two sabre toothed cats consumed herbivores from more dense woodland, a habitat that would have allowed the smaller cat to hide from the larger one. 'On the basis of their different body sizes it is likely that these two cats avoided competition for prey by hunting herbivores of different size. Little has been known about how the sabre toothed tiger, shown here in a California museum, co-existed with other species . 'Analysis indicated that hipparionine horses were moderately to very feasible prey of these cats. 'The smaller cat probably incorporated additional prey species from more dense woodland.' He said a study of the bear dog found it 'implied prey acquisition from open woodland . 'Diet preferences indicate it was the only predator commonly consuming astroportax, that occupied more open woodland.' To arrive at their findings, the researchers conducted what's called a stable carbon isotope analysis on the animals' teeth. Using a dentist's drill with a diamond bit, they sampled teeth from 69 specimens, including 27 saber-toothed cats and bear dogs. The rest were plant-eaters. They isolated the carbon from the tooth enamel. Using a mass spectrometer, which you could think of as a type of scale, they measured the ratio of the more massive carbon 13 molecules to the less-massive carbon 12. An isotope is a version of an element that contains a different number of neutrons in its nucleus.Carbon 12 and 13 are both present in the carbon dioxide that plants take in during photosynthesis. Different plants make use of the isotopes in different ways, and so they retain different amounts of them in their fibers. When an herbivore eats a plant, that plant leaves an isotopic signature in the animal's bones and teeth. The signature travels through the food chain and can be found in carnivores as well.","Team analysed 'exceptional fossil site' near Madrid for the unprecedented look into the tiger's diet .

The engine, known to NASA engineers as No. F-6049, was supposed to help propel Apollo 11 into orbit in 1969, when Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins went to the moon for the first time. However, while the mission was a success, the engine was grounded because of a glitch during a test in Mississippi. Scroll down for video . The F-1 Engine tested at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which was originally built for the Apollo 11 mission . The 18-foot-tall F-1 engine, known to NASA engineers as . No. F-6049, was supposed to help propel Apollo 11 into orbit in 1969, . when NASA sent Neil Armstrong and two other astronauts to the moon for . the first time. During moon missions, five of them were . arranged at the base of the 363-foot-tall Saturn V system and fired . together to power the rocket off the ground toward Earth orbit. A single F-1 engine can produce 1.5 . million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and . refined kerosene, which was not used in the space shuttle . It was later sent to the Smithsonian Institution, where it sat for years, and now engineers are learning to work with technical systems and propellants not used since before the start of the space shuttle program, which first launched in 1981. Nick Case, 27, and other engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center ran a series of 11 test-firings of the F-6049's gas generator, a jet-like rocket which produces 30,000 pounds of thrust and was used as a starter for the engine. They are trying to see whether a second-generation version of the Apollo engine could produce even more thrust and be operated with a throttle for deep-space exploration. There are no plans to send the old engine into space, but it could become a template for a new generation of motors incorporating parts of its design. In NASA-speak, the old 18-foot-tall motor is called an F-1 engine. During moon missions, five of them were arranged at the base of the 363-foot-tall Saturn V system and fired together to power the rocket off the ground toward Earth orbit. Thursday's test used one part of the engine, the gas generator, which powers the machinery to pump propellant into the main rocket chamber. It doesn't produce the massive orange flame or clouds of smoke like that of a whole F-1, but the sound was deafening as engineers fired the mechanism in an outdoor test stand on a cool, sunny afternoon. The device produced a plume that resembled a blow torch the size of two buses and set fire to a grassy area, which was quickly extinguished. 'It's not small,' Case said. 'It's pretty beefy on its own.' And just like during the Apollo days, people in north Alabama heard rockets thundering in the distance during tests at Marshall. Apollo 11 taking off. The engine being tested was built for the 1969 mission, when NASA sent Neil Armstrong and two other astronauts to the moon for the first time . 'My wife and daughter were in our front yard and she said they could hear it, which was pretty cool,' Case said after an earlier test. 'We live about 15 miles away.' A single F-1 engine can produce 1.5 million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene, which was not used in the space shuttle. The tests were conducted at Marshall in a project conducted with Dynetics Inc. and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, which are studying NASA's possibilities for deep-space missions years from now. The space agency plans to use commercial launches to reach low Earth orbit; larger rockets are required to escape the planet's gravity. R.H. Coates, an engineer who works with Case in Marshall's liquid propulsion office, said young engineers can learn a lot from the work done by predecessors using slide-rules in the 1960s, but no one wants to simply rebuild the old Saturn V engine. Apollo 11 just after takeoff: Now experts say its rocket motor could be updated for future missions . 'This wouldn't be your daddy's F-1,' Coates said. 'We'd use new materials and try to simplify it, update it.' Case started at Marshall as a high school intern in 2002 and has been working there since graduating from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2008. He said today's technology allows things that weren't possible during the 1960s, but he has been impressed by what he learned taking apart the unused Apollo 11 engine. Engine No. F-6049 didn't fit properly on the Apollo 11 rocket, but it is invaluable now as a testing tool. Coates said a total of 85 F-1 engines were used on 17 Apollo flights without a single failure. About a dozen F-1 engines remain in Huntsville, Ala., home of NASA's main propulsion center, and others are located elsewhere. Most are on display. Case said engineers used engine No. F-6049 for the tests because it was the most complete.'It is really an excellent booster,' he said. 'The guys in Apollo had it right.'","F-6049 engine was supposed to help propel Apollo 11 into orbit in 1969 - buy was grounded because of a glitch .

"By . Daniel Miller and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:56 EST, 9 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 9 February 2013 . Boeing sent a 787 up on a test flight today, the first since the new airliner was grounded three weeks ago because of a battery fire. The company said the aircraft was flying in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle. The plan was to spend two and a half hours in the air, flying back and forth over the inland Columbia Plateau. The Federal Aviation Administration granted permission for test flights on Thursday. The 787 is the first commercial airliner to rely heavily on lithium-ion batteries, the same kind used in cellphones. Each plane has two of the 63-pound blue power bricks, one near the front to provide power to the cockpit if the engines stop, and one near the back to start up the auxiliary power unit, which is essentially a backup generator. Tailbacks: Being began test flights of its Dreamliners, seen here parked nose-to-tail near the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington . On January 7, a battery on a plane that had recently landed in Boston short-circuited and caught fire. Nine days later, a battery on an All Nippon Airways plane started smoking, forcing an emergency landing in Japan. Boeing Co. has billions of dollars tied up in research on the 787, and billions more dollars in 787s parked in Everett, Wash., and other sites that are waiting to be delivered. The test flight took place after it emerged Boeing were left to carry out their own safety checks on the lithium batteries that grounded all their Dreamliner jets as there were no federal guidelines in existence at the time. When the disaster-stricken airliner was in development, Boeing was granted what the Federal Aviation Authority called 'special conditions,' for its planned use of the new lithium technology. By the time official guidelines for the batteries were created in 2008, the Dreamliner had already been approved so it did not have to meet them. Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery occured in both incident . An investigation into last month's . battery fire in a Japan Airlines 787 'Dreamliner' while it was parked in . Boston, shows it began with multiple short-circuits in one of the . battery's eight cells. The results so far contradict some of . the assumptions that were made about the battery's safety at the time . the system won government approval, said the board's chairwoman, Deborah . Hersman. The NTSB investigation shows the fire started with multiple short-circuits in one of the battery's eight cells, she said. That created an uncontrolled chemical . reaction known as 'thermal runaway,' which is characterized by . progressively hotter temperatures. That spread the short-circuiting to the rest of the cells and caused the fire, she said. The findings are at odds with what . Boeing told the FAA when that agency was working to certify the . company's newest and most technologically advanced plane for flight, . Hersman said. Boeing said its testing showed that . even when trying to induce short-circuiting, the condition and any fire . were contained within a single cell, preventing thermal runaway and fire . from spreading, she told reporters at a news conference. Boeing's testing also showed the batteries were likely to cause smoke in only 1 in 10 million flight hours, she said. Charred: A CAT scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery's eight cells were all but destroyed . But the Boston fire was followed nine . days later by a smoking battery in an All Nippon Airways plane that made . an emergency landing in Japan. The 787 fleet has recorded less than . 100,000 flight hours, Hersman noted. The plane that caught fire in Boston . was delivered to Japan Airlines less than three weeks before the fire . and had recorded only 169 flight hours over 22 flights. 'There have now been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart on two different aircraft,' Hersman said. 'This investigation has demonstrated . that a short circuit in a single cell can propagate to adjacent cells . and result in smoke and fire. The assumptions used to certify the . battery must be reconsidered.' Battery experts said Boeing could try . to build more safeguards into the battery by using a greater number of . smaller cells and putting more insulation between them. Or, they said, the aircraft maker . could switch to a different type of lithium ion battery already approved . for aviation. Some business jets use lithium ion batteries as their . main batteries. Switching to another type of battery, . such as lead-acid or nickel-cadmium battery, is another possibility, but . that would involve changing the charging system as well, they said. Deliveries of Boeing's Dreamliner . passenger jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns, the . troubled manufacturer has admitted. Boeing . currently has orders for around 800 787s, however all 50 of the . problematic planes already supplied to airlines remain grounded until a . serious battery issue is fixed. Battery . malfunctions led to a fire on board a parked Japan Airlines (JAL) 787 . in Boston and an in-flight problem on another plane in Japan which was . forced to make an emergency landing. Airbus is considering dropping Lithium-Ion batteries and switching back to traditional units on its new A350 aircraft as safety investigators probe battery incidents on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, several people familiar with the matter said. The move comes amid a wider rethink in the aerospace industry on whether the powerful but delicate backup energy systems are technically 'mature', they said. An Airbus spokesman said the company would study and evaluate the outcome of the ongoing U.S. battery investigation. 'Let's not get ahead of ourselves', he said. Airbus said recently it had a plan B and time to respond to any rule changes. France's Saft, which makes both the new and old generation of batteries for Airbus, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One operator, Norwegian Air Shuttle, . which is due to launch a long-haul service, said it now plans to lease . other aircraft to replace the 787s they have on order. Boeing had warned the Norwegian Air . that deliveries were uncertain because of the investigation by the US . National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The carrier said in a statement this . morning: 'The extent of a possible delay and whether such delay will . affect later deliveries is presently not known. 'Norwegian is taking precautionary steps by planning for substitute aircraft capacity.' Earlier today the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing Co . to restart test flights of its grounded 787 Dreamliner in order to get . more data on potentially faulty batteries. The groundings have cost airlines tens of millions of dollars, and there appears to be no end in sight. Norwegian Air Shuttle, which is aiming . to take on established airlines in the overseas sector,  was due to . take delivery of eight Dreamliners in April. The firm had already sold a number of discounted tickets for its first overseas flights. They added: 'In the event that the 787 . is not operational in time for Norwegian's services to New York and . Bangkok replacement long-haul aircraft will be leased to ensure flights . are operated as scheduled.'On Thursday a one-off flight was approved to move a 787 from Texas to Washington state, where Boeing is based for examination. The introduction of the Dreamliner has been fraught with difficulties from the start. The first three 787s were found to be . overweight. There were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the . development of the on board software. Test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and Rolls Royce was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time. Positive step: Boeing was been given permission to carry out fresh test flights with the 787 Dreamliner jet on Thursday . In June 2010 Boeing stunned the . aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after . engineers discovered  structural flaws. Then in November that year a test . flight had to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after crew . notice smoke in the cabin. Earlier this week images of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in Japan were released. Pictures released by the Japanese . Transportation Safety Board showed the blackened lithium device with . frayed and broken earth wire. Investigators are trying to establish . the cause of an in-flight fire which forced an All Nippon Airways flight . to make an emergency landing in Japan last month. CAT scans of the overheated lithium . ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week . earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency . landing in Boston. The latest probe is said to have found . evidence of short-circuiting and 'thermal runaway' - a chemical . reaction which causes overheating. Pilots . and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the . batteries on board at all if the plane's battery system makes it too . unsafe to fly. The . Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion . batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving . shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. Mike . Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last month that the plane's . batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never . had an internal fault. He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.","Boeing said the lithium-ion battery-run aircraft was flying in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle .

A baby died because a hospital failed to spot a genetic fault that should have been detected before he was born, his parents have claimed. Jasper Allibone's parents were unaware he had a rare chromosomal abnormality when he was born and claim it led to the death of their  three-month-old son. They are now suing St George’s Hospital in south London for £300,000 for failing to spot the condition. Jasper's parents have begun proceedings against St Geoerge's Hopsital in Tooting for failing to provide a 'competent standard of care' Jasper's mother Catherine, 34, gave birth to him despite having had tests which should have identified it before he was conceived. Mrs Allibone has a rare abnormality . known as reciprocal translocation — when bits of genetic material known . as chromosomes break off and switch places. Tests to identify this were carried . out at St George’s Hospital during Mrs Allibone’s previous pregnancy which ended . in a miscarriage, but they were not scrutinised properly, the papers . lodged at the High Court claim. As a result, no tests were done to find out if Jasper had inherited the abnormality from his mother. Mrs Allibone and her husband Richard, who live in Kew, south-west London, have begun proceedings in the High Court against the hospital for failing to provide a 'competent standard of care' leading to the 'horrendous ordeal' of their son’s short life. Tests to identify a rare genetic disorder this were carried out at St George's during Mrs Allibone's previous pregnancy but they were not scrutinised properly, papers lodged at the High Court claim (generic picture) Jasper, who was born in September 2009, suffered from severe brain and physical disabilities. His parents were told there was no prospect of improvement in his condition. The claim details the catastrophic . impact that Jasper’s birth had on the couple’s work and home lives, and . the fall-out that occurred from the trauma and anxiety of dealing with . such a severely handicapped newborn. Mrs Allibone, 34, who works in public relations, told the London Evening Standard: 'We believe there were multiple failings in our case, but despite our horrendous ordeal we still regard the NHS very highly, predominantly due to the amazing care received at the Royal Brompton paediatric unit after Jasper was born.' Mr Allibone, 45, who runs his own consultancy firm, said: 'No one should go through this. It is a terrible experience, and we were let down.' Alison Eddy, a medical law expert at solicitors Irwin Mitchell who are representing the couple, said: 'Mr and Mrs Allibone started their legal action against the NHS when Jasper was alive and was likely to need a significant level of care and rehabilitation throughout his life. The couple remain committed to finding answers relating to his birth.' A spokesman from St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'As this is an on-going legal case it is inappropriate for the trust to comment at this time.'

While they may be horrified at the prospect of watching a movie from way back in 1981, the story of the schoolboy struggling with the agony, ecstasy and downright awkwardness of first love still has something to say to today’s world-weary youngsters. In fact, according to veteran film critic Barry Norman, Gregory’s Girl is the best teenage movie ever made. Top 49: The 1981 movie Gregory's Girl, starring Dee Hepburn and John Gordon Sinclair, is the best teenage movie ever made according to veteran film critic Barry Norman . He has included the Scottish romantic comedy in a list of 50 of the best British movies, compiled for the latest edition of Radio Times, alongside classics by Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall. Mr Norman said Gregory’s Girl, which was made for a mere £250,000, shows that Britain can produce cinematic gold at a fraction of the cost of Hollywood. Written and directed by Bill Forsyth, it starred John Gordon Sinclair, Clare Grogan and Dee Hepburn, who all received just £50 a day. Best Bond: 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, starring Sean Connery and Ursula Andress, also made the list which Mr Norman refused to rank in numerical order, saying it was an impossible task . 'British cinema is still going strong': The King's Speech, 2010, starring Colin Firth, was nominated as one of 49 films, with Radio Times readers being asked to nominate the 50th . ‘Gregory’s Girl is a low-budget classic,’ Mr Norman said. ‘They made it for a quarter of a million quid. It was quite a while ago now but nevertheless a film made for that little was remarkable in those days. ‘And it is the best study of adolescence I’ve seen in the cinema. ‘Most American films about  teenagers and school kids and college kids are about sex. Gregory’s Girl is about love, which is much better.’ 'Best study of adolescence I've seen in cinema': Stars of Gregory's Girl, including Dee Hepburn (centre), received just £50 a day . Mr Norman has chosen 49 films for the list, with Radio Times readers being asked to nominate the 50th. He refused to put his films in numerical order, saying it was an impossible task. ‘Lists always get people worked up,’ he said. ‘No doubt this list will be sneered at, and I’m sure I’ve left . some great films out. But nobody can say with any certainty what the . best film ever made is as it is entirely subjective. ‘I . could probably make another list tomorrow with 50 entirely different . films. But all of these ones had a great plotline, great dialogue, good . casts, good directors and good back-up crew. Cult classic: A Clockwork Orange, 1971, starring Malcolm McDowell, along with Barry Lyndon, 1975, were directed by American Stanley Kubrick but Mr Norman counted them as British because they were filmed here . Shortlisted: The Railway Children, 1970, starring Dinah Sheridan, Jenny Agutter and Bernard Cribbins, also made the list of films that had 'a great plotline, great dialogue, good casts, good directors and good back-up crew . 'Those are the keys to a good movie. I can’t abide people who say we don’t make them like we used to. Of course we do. British cinema is still going strong.’ One of his choices, the 1953 naval classic The Cruel Sea, had particular sentimental value for him as it was produced by his father Leslie Norman. Two of the films – Barry Lyndon and A Clockwork Orange – were in fact directed by an American, Stanley Kubrick. But Mr Norman said he counted them as British because they were filmed in the UK and made with a largely British cast.

A British meat company, which claims to supply schools and restaurants, has been identified as importing large quantities of horse meat. Flexi Foods, based in Hull, has been named as the key source of consignments of tonnes of beef that illegally included horse meat. Large blocks of what were supposed to be beef off-cuts were imported by Flexi Foods from Poland and then sold on to food manufacturers in the UK and Ireland. Contamination: Meat sold by Flexi Foods is likely to have ended up in homes and schools (library image) However, it has now emerged that much of this meat was horse and is likely to have ended up as burgers and ready meals in homes, fast food restaurants, market stalls and, potentially, schools. A large consignment of meat, where samples were up to 80per cent horse meat, was imported by Flexi Foods and sent to cold storage at Freeza Meats, northern Ireland. Flexi Foods also supplied 60 tonnes of beef, some of which is known to have been horse meat, to McAdam Foods, in southern Ireland, during 2012. It sold this on to Silvercrest, in country Monaghan, who made tainted burgers for Tesco, Burger King, the Co-op and Aldi, among others. The amount of meat involved suggests tens of millions of tainted burgers were produced during 2012. News of the British link to the horse meat scandal brought demands for urgent action by the Government and the Food Standards Agency (FSA). To date, British ministers and the UK food watchdog have largely left the investigation to their counterparts in southern Ireland, who first revealed the contamination three weeks ago. It now appears that a British food . company with connections to manufacturers, caterers, schools and market . stalls across the UK and Ireland had a central role. Gone: Aldi has withdrawn items from its Today's Special range and Tesco some of its Everyday Value products . Flexi . Foods, which was established in 1994, lists its headquarters as being . in Hull with other bases in Poznan, Poland and Copenhagen, Denmark. Its . partner companies include Northern Food Traders, while the firm's . website boasts: 'Northern Food Traders was established to service the . catering side like restaurants, schools and market traders. 'With . our modern storage facilities in Middlewitch and our refrigerated vans, . we have open up a complete new market which we see as being another new . string to our bow.' The . company's website says the management have been working in the meat . trade since 1989 and so have gained a 'reputation for being a reliable . and trust worthy partner in the meat industry'. The FSA will be investigating which food manufactures in the UK and beyond were supplied by Flexi Foods. It . will be keen to establish any links with the British manufacturer, . Dalepak, which is based nearby in Richmond, Yorkshire. It made burgers . contaminated with traces of horse meat for Iceland and Aldi. Careful: Spaghetti bolognese and lasagne were the beef products taking the hit . Labour's shadow food and farming . Secretary, Mary Creagh MP, called on the government to order urgent . tests on meat sold in schools, hospitals and other public services. She wrote a letter to the . Conservative food and farming Secretary, Owen Paterson, saying: 'The FSA . needs to conduct tests on food supplied to public sector caterers to . ensure that contaminated meat has not been served in hospitals and . schools. 'What guarantees . can you give that no adulterated meat has gone into school or hospital . food, or been supplied to other caterers in the public sector?' She warned consumer confidence in processed meat is being severely undermined. McAdam Foods insists it was shocked to be told that the meat supplied by Flexi Foods contained horse. It . said: 'The company, its management and staff are shocked and astonished . to discover that equine content has been identified in products which . have been imported and supplied through McAdam Foods.' Flexi Foods passed enquiries to its lawyers who did not respond to a request for a comment. It . has emerged that ready meal packs of lasagne made in France for the . Findus brand have been withdrawn from UK shops because of concerns they . may contain horse meat. At the same time, Tesco and Aldi removed packs of frozen ready meals which were made by the same French supplier - Comigel. Tesco . said: 'Following the withdrawal of Findus beef lasagne, which is . produced by Comigel(correct), we have decided to withdraw our frozen .

'There . is no evidence that our product has been contaminated and the meat used . in the Findus product is not used in our product.

Findus UK said it withdrew its 320g, . 360g and 500g lasagne meals as a precautionary measure. The company insisted it was not a food safety issue. 'Deserving consumers' trust is a key . priority for us,' said a Findus UK spokesman. 'As part of that . commitment, we have been constantly reviewing our supply chain.'

France is expected to keep a rapid reaction force in Mali to back up the U.N. force. Mr Le Drian said French aircraft are continuing airstrikes every night on suspected militant arms depots and mine-making sites. On the ground, troops have found war material, weapons manuals and makeshift laboratories for constructing improvised explosive devices. 'We discovered preparations for a true terrorist sanctuary,' he said. France launched a swift military intervention on January 11 against Islamist extremists who had taken over northern Mali, where they imposed a harsh version of Shariah law. The French-led troops have taken the key city of Gao and control the capital of Timbuktu, but plans to move forward on the last major city in control of the Islamist militants, Kindal, have been hampered by sandstorms.

An Orlando judge has ruled that a man who said he wanted get a 10-year-old girl pregnant must remain jailed. Dwipin Thomas Maliackal, 24, was arrested after he told an undercover FBI officer posing as the father of two girls, aged 10 and 13, that he wanted to have sex with them and impregnate one. Agents swooped on Maliackal after he traveled from his home in Seminole, Florida to the Orlando area to meet the man and his daughters. He had met the undercover agent on an incest chat room on December 7 where Maliackal, who graduated from University of South Florida this summer, used the name 'Horny_Indian'. 'Sick': Dwipin Maliackal, 24, was arrested after telling an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to have sex with his daughters. Maliackal just graduated from college, where he was president of his fraternity, right . As reported by the Orlando Sentinel, Maliackal's parents recently testified in court that their son could live with them if he was released from jail. Yet Judge Karla Spaulding firmly rejected the request, noting there are girls who live near the family home. 'The presence of minor female children in such close proximity to the Maliackal's residence provides the opportunity for the Defendant to attempt to act on his interest in molesting minor females if released,' the judge wrote in her recent order. 'Despite his family's best intentions, they cannot realistically supervise the Defendant every minute of every day,' she added. Spaulding ordered that Maliackal remains jailed pending further proceedings. Maliackal told the undercover agent that he had had sex with other children, including relatives and a neighbor, and that his youngest victim had been just five years old, according to the criminal complaint. He added that he wanted to have sex with the agent's 10-year-old daughter and make her his 'girlfriend', and that he hoped sex with the girls would be a 'regular thing', the complaint said. 'I would love to get her pregnant, if you're OK with that,' Maliackal told the agent. Aspirations: Maliackal had hoped to become a sports broadcaster. He is seen here in a university video . Dark past: He allegedly told agents he had had sex with children as young as five and with relatives and a neighbour. He said had been sexually attracted to 'prepubescent' girls since he was a teenager . The complaint noted other sex acts Maliackal said he wanted to perform on the young girls, the Orlando Sentinel reported. On December 19, he asked the agent if he could visit the family in Orlando and spend the weekend with the girls, and they agreed to meet at a restaurant in Maitland. Before the meeting, Maliackal emailed the agent saying: 'Not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous meeting you and . even more nervous about meeting your daughters lol [laugh out loud].' Maliackal arrived at the meeting place on December 20 and was arrested when he approached the undercover agent. He told agents he had planned to have sex with both of the girls and said has been sexually attracted to 'prepubescent' girls since he was a teenager. Busted: He met the agent on an internet chat room and used the name 'Horny_Indian' (file picture) He said the last time he had done 'this type of thing' was around four years ago, the complaint said.

Anti-wind farm campaigners claim Cumbria hosts as many turbines as all the other counties of England combined, according to the Daily Telegraph. Speaking to the newspaper, Mr Martin said there is a 'very, very strong feeling in Cumbria that we are taking more than our fair share' of wind farms. He has written to John Hayes, a Tory energy minster, attacking the Government's policy on wind farms. He said that communities felt they could not stop the march of the wind farms across the country. Mr Hayes has previously pledged to stop the spread of wind farms but was ruled over by senior ministers. The row comes after a 115ft wind turbine crashed to the ground after being forced over in high winds. The Lake District National Park is one of the UK's most stunning natural attractions, and attracts thousands of tourists every year . The £250,000 tower was left a 'mangled, blackened wreck with melted blades', say witnesses, after apparently struggling to stand up to 50mph gusts last week. Experts believe the winds were so strong the blades span out of control causing the massive structure to catch fire and collapse. It was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years – but has lasted just three. Renewable energy company Dulas installed the Endurance Wind Power E-3120 50kW turbine at East Ash Farm in Bradworthy, Devon, despite protests from villagers who said it would be noisy and spoil the view. In July a government agency admitted for the first time that wind farms can wipe tens of thousands of pounds off the value of homes. The Valuation Office Agency was forced to re-band homes into lower council tax categories, confirming what most residents who live near the giant turbines already know: they are detrimental to property prices. The move has made it harder for the wind farm industry to dismiss public concerns over the impact of their turbines.",Anti-wind farm campaigners claim Cumbria hosts as many turbines as all the other counties of England combined .

Efforts to restore the ancient Roman city of Pompeii are under a cloud after police launched an investigation into allegations of corruption at the historic site. A €105million (£90million) project to save the buildings which were frozen in time after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD started yesterday. But it has been overshadowed by the investigation into its boss and the arrests of two other officials involved with the restoration. Project: Restorers yesterday began work on two ancient Roman houses in the ruined city of Pompeii . Claims: The ¿105million plan has been overshadowed by allegations of official corruption . Italy declared a state of emergency at the World Heritage Site in 2008, after archaeologists complained that the city had been neglected despite drawing 2.5million visitors every year. Marcello Fiori was appointed to be special commissioner for the site, and oversaw the restoration of the city's main amphitheatre which was reopened in 2010. Allegations have now been made that contractors on the theatre project were paid five times more than the market price for their work. Luigi D'Amora, who was director of restoration at the time, has been arrested over the claims, while Mr Fiori is one of four other officials being investigated over the scandal. None of those involved have commented on the the investigation. Destruction: The House of the Gladiators, pictured, collapsed in 2010 lending urgency to the project . At work: EU officials vowed yesterday that the corruption claims would not slow the restoration . Caccavo, the restoration firm responsible for the work, has been banned from doing public sector work and has had more than €800,000 of assets seized by courts. One of its officials, Annamaria Caccavo, is under house arrest while police investigate her for fraud, aiding abuse of office and corrupting a public official. The corruption allegations have been linked to the influence of the local mafia, the Camorra, which is believed to be involved in many government and business projects in the area around Naples. EU funds for the restoration project include 'a variety of measures to protect itself from the influence of organized crime - the Camorra - which infects many parts of the region', according to officials. The latest stage of the project which began yesterday aims to restore two ancient homes, the House of the Dioscuri and the House of the Cryptoporticus. Unique: Pompeii gives an amazing insight into everyday life in the first-century Roman Empire . 'The arrest of a businesswoman involved in restoration has no connection to the new project,' European Commissioner Johannes Hahn told The Times. 'I’ve always said that we want to preserve the cultural tradition and not the criminal one.' Pompeii is considered one of the world's most important historical sites due to the unique insight it gives into the Roman way of life. The eruption of Vesuvius covered the town in volcanic ash and wiped out nearly all its inhabitants. The unfortunate townspeople were frozen in the poses they were in at the time of the eruption, and Pompeii's homes were preserved perfectly. Generations of archaeologists and visitors have been able to wander the streets, marvelling at Roman taverns, theatres and even graffiti painted on the walls.","Ancient Roman houses will be restored using €105million of EU funds .

A study found that those who wrote about their rows now and again were more satisfied with married life. Just three seven-minute essays a year, written from someone else’s perspective, made a difference. Writing just three seven-minute essays a year from someone else¿s perspective can make a difference to married life, according to Professor Eli Finkel of Northwestern University, Illinois . A little homework also boosted feelings of love, passion, intimacy, trust and commitment, the journal Psychological Science reports. It is thought writing from an outsider’s viewpoint helped people see conflict through fresh eyes. Researcher Eli Finkel said: ‘I don’t want it to sound like magic but you can get pretty impressive results with a minimal intervention.’ British experts said the exercise could help a lot of people – as long as they don’t bear grudges and are able to distance themselves from the situation. Professor Finkel, of Northwestern University, Illinois, tracked the marriages of 120 couples for two years. Some had been married for just a few weeks when the study began, others for more than 50 years. Professor Finkel tracked the marriages of 120 couples for two years, some of whom had been married for just a few weeks when the study began, others for more than 50 years . In the second year of the study, half . were asked to think about a recent row and write about it from the . perspective of a neutral party. They were encouraged to write about how . they could distance themselves in future. Professor Finkel estimated each essay took seven minutes – adding up to 21 minutes over the year. As previous studies have shown, marital satisfaction fell over the course of the first year. In those who didn’t do the  writing task, it continued to drop during the second year. But in those who did their homework, satisfaction stabilised. While they didn’t argue any less, their rows caused them less upset. And there were other benefits. The professor said: ‘Not only did the effect emerge for marital satisfaction, it also emerged for other relationship processes – like passion and sexual desire. ‘These effects emerged whether people were married for one month, 50 years, or anywhere in between.’ He added: ‘A high-quality marriage is one of the strongest predictors of happiness and health. ‘From that perspective, participating in a seven-minute writing exercise three times a year has to be one of the best investments married people can make.’ Relate counsellor Paula Hall said: ‘If you can step away from the emotion of an argument after some time has elapsed and maintain a sense of perspective, hopefully you can move on to see what you can do differently. Effectively, that’s what counselling does.’ A third of us have fallen in love at first sight, according to a study which suggests we’re still a nation of romantics. Not only do 31 per cent say they’ve been struck by Cupid’s arrow, but this rises to 37 per cent among those aged over 55. More than a third of us – 38 per cent – have fallen in love at work, but 16 per cent felt unable to tell the object of their affection. And the best way to share how you feel? According to the research by florist Interflora, 41 per cent of women say a  handwritten card or letter is the way to their heart.","Researchers found writing three seven-minute essays every year can help married life .

British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived for an EU Budget summit at the European Council building in Brussels today, demanding deep cuts in spending . David Cameron arrived in Brussels today for a fresh attempt at cutting the European Union’s vast budget. The Prime Minister insists he will not accept a deal unless the cost of running Europe falls for the rest of the decade. He has in his sights the European foreign service, run by British commissioner Baroness Ashton as part of a demand to cut £25billion reduction in the EU’s lavish spending plans. Mr Cameron was due to hold meetings with Dutch PM Mark Rutte and other allies this afternoon before tonight’s formal negotiations over dinner. Arriving at the summit building in Brussels, Mr Cameron fire a shot across the bows of other countries who are demanding budgets continue to rise. The Premier said: ‘The numbers are much too high. They need to come down - and if they don’t come down there won’t be a deal. ‘The European Union should not be immune to the sorts of pressure we have to reduce spending, find efficiencies and spend wisely - what we are all doing.’ Talks collapsed in November when Mr Cameron and other major contributors to the EU kitty rejected a cut from a planned spending package of about one thousand billion euros (£860billion) for 2014-2020 to about £756bn. Today German chancellor Angela Merkel, who spoke to Mr Cameron last night, admitted that national positions remained ‘far apart’. And French president Francois Hollande went in saying compromise was needed, but making plain cuts in EU agriculture spending - from which France benefits hugely - were not on his negotiating agenda. Mr Hollande said: ‘We must not weaken the (EU) economy. I am here for agreement, if a deal is reasonable. Europe must find compromise, but must maintain growth and solidarity.’ Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron met Swedish Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt (left) and Dutch PM Mark Rutte before the full summit got under way . The Prime Minister is demanding at least £25 billion in savings before considering a deal . Mr Cameron has also warned EU President Herman van Rompuy that he will veto a deal unless major savings are agreed over the next two days. He is expected to press for a reduction in staffing and spending at the European External Action Service, which is run by Lady Ashton, who is paid £70,000 more than the Prime Minister. The Labour peer originally pledged the foreign service would be ‘budget neutral’ but has presided over a five per cent rise in spending during the last year. Mr Cameron will also seek to slash the number of Brussels civil servants and cut back their pay and perks. But British officials privately admit that even if Mr Cameron gets his way, Britain’s contributions to the EU budget are likely to rise because of the continuing fallout from Tony Blair’s decision in 2005 to surrender a huge chunk of the EU’s annual rebate. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned EU countries remain ‘far apart’ while French president Francois Hollande insisted compromise was needed . British sources last night acknowledged it would be ‘tough’ to get a deal, but said the Prime Minister believed there was scope for Mr van Rompuy’s latest proposals to be slashed by ‘tens of billions’. William Hague yesterday denied that Britain was facing a ‘wall of hostility’ in Brussels following David Cameron’s pledge last month to hold an in/out referendum after the next election. The Foreign Secretary told MPs that he ‘didn’t detect any change in our ability to get our own way or any difficulties’ in his latest negotiations with European counterparts. He said Britain would accept the . result of the referendum ‘whatever the consequences’ - but conceded . civil servants were not making preparations for a possible withdrawal. Britain will hold the rotating EU . presidency in the second half of 2017 and Mr Hague said he could not . rule out holding the referendum during it, as the timing depended on the . progress of repatriating powers. He said it would ‘certainly make for a . particularly memorable presidency’. The situation is complicated by a series of competing demands from virtually all of the 27 countries involved. Germany, . Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are looking to have their existing . budget rebates extended for another seven years, while Denmark has . warned it will veto a deal unless it is granted a rebate for the first . time. Mr Cameron told reporters that the EU's budget deal was 'too high' and must be cut before he would agree to a deal . Before arriving in Brussels, Mr Cameron made a series of calls to EU allies who are also demanding a reduction in spending . France is looking to protect farm subsidies, while Italy’s Mario Monti, who is in the midst of a general election campaign, is seeking to ringfence spending on infrastructure. Any deal will also have to be signed off by the European parliament which has demanded an astonishing £910 billion budget. Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe said it was vital the budget was reformed, as well as cut, to focus spending on areas more likely to boost Europe’s flagging economy. He said: ‘We see a 35 per cent probability of a deal this week. If Italy and France keep on insisting on more cash to achieve short-term political gains, the talks will fail.’ If no deal is done by the end of the year then the current EU budget will be automatically rolled over into 2014 and increased by two per cent to allow for inflation.","Prime Minister tells reporters at summit building he will not settle for a budget freeze .

MPS who have smoked cannabis have ‘never recovered’ from the effects of the drug, former Conservative minister Peter Lilley has claimed. Mr Lilley – who served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet and John Major’s government – said he witnessed the effects of ‘immoral’ drug-taking of colleagues. Despite championing the legalisation cannabis a decade ago, Mr Lilley hit out at his associates who had consumed illegal substances. Attack: Peter Lilley, left, has claimed in a magazine interview that some MPs who took cannabis have never recovered from the effects of the drug. In the interview he also suggested that Environment Minister Greg Barker, pictured right, was 'barking mad'. There is no suggestion Mr Barker took cannabis. He told The House magazine: ‘I'm a total moralist on drugs. I hate the idea of getting stoned or drunk or anything. It’s immoral. God gave us a mind and a conscience and drugs effectively disable both your mind and your conscience.‘ . In remarks that will be seen as swipe at fellow MPs, Mr Lilley added: ‘The only reason that I have a clear head on cannabis is that I’ve never taken any. Much of my friends, colleagues in this place did. Mr Lilley said he witnessed the effects of immoral' drug-taking of colleagues during his years in the Cabinet . The former deputy leader of the Conservative Party had called for cannabis to be legalised through special off-licences in an explosive report for the left-wing Social Market Foundation think tank in 2001. He had argued that cannabis users were being forced into ‘the arms of hard drug pushers’. In his latest interview, Mr Lilley re-iterated his criticism of Environment Minister Greg Barker as ‘barking mad’. He had previously been filmed describing Mr Barker as a ‘nutter’. The MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: ‘He knows I think he's barking mad. And he probably reciprocates.’ The former deputy Tory leader also revealed he still had harboured hopes of a Cabinet comeback but admitted it might not be sensible for David Cameron to promote him. Mr Lilley said: ‘I would've been happy to, but I wasn't totally surprised that it didn't materialise.’ He added: ‘You can bring experience into a particular department, but it's not like the flu, you can't infect the rest of the Cabinet with experience. I can't really convince myself that it would necessarily be the best decision for Cameron to bring back people like me.’","Peter Lilley, who represents Hitchin and Harpenden, said he had witnessed the effects of 'immoral' drug taking of colleagues .

She also suffered a dislocated and fractured ankle, a dislocated toe and swelling on the brain. All but one of her vertebrae were damaged or broken. Incredibly, Faith, who is now nine months old, escaped the crash unharmed. Ms Stoneley said that it was a miracle of chance that her baby daughter survived - she is normally strapped into her baby seat on the driver's side of the car but on this occasion had been strapped in on the passenger side.

A girl was just two heartbeats from death - when she was given a heart transplant moments before her own heart failed. Jessica Elliott, 12, who was born with a congenital heart defect, suffered a stroke last year, and was wheeled in for life-saving surgery 10 days later. When removed from a patient, most hearts continue to beat for up to two minutes - but Jessica's stopped while still in the surgeon's hand, leading medics to conclude she had only seconds to live. Jessica (pictured in hospital, left) suffered a stroke in April 2012 and received a transplant 10 days later. She was moments from death during the operation but pulled through. She is now returning to normal life (right) Now Jessica, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is recovering and able to play with her friends and is going back to school. Mother Michelle, 46, and father Alan, 43, an aerial and satellite engineer, rushed Jessica to Newcastle Freeman hospital after she suffered a stroke in April 2012. Ten days later Jessica - who also suffers from cerebral palsy - was given the transplant that she desperately needed. Her parents even bought her a puppy, called Freddie, before she went into hospital - as motivation for her to get better. Mrs Elliott said: 'Jess was born 10 weeks early, with a congenital heart defect. She was tiny, just 3lb 7oz. 'She was on life support for two months before slowly improving. She had her first pacemaker when she weighed 6lb 10oz - at around eight months old. 'We struggled on with her condition for the next few years. She then had another pacemaker in 2008. 'We were devastated to learn in September 2011 that her only way forward was a heart transplant.' Recovering: Jessica was fitted with a pacemaker twice before she received a donor heart . Jessica with dog Freddie: Her parents bought the lhasa apso to give their daughter an incentive to get better . Mrs Elliott went on: 'She had a stroke in April 2012 and was rushed to Newcastle Freeman Hospital. Ten days later we were told there was a heart for her - which was flown up from London. 'When they found a heart for her, it was overwhelming for us - but we didn't want to scare her or disappoint her. 'She was in theatre for ten hours. I was terrified - I didn't know if it was the last time I would get to see her. 'They sent a message down from surgery to say her old heart had served her well - but we weren't sure what they meant. 'We knew she was cutting it fine. The next morning, her surgeon Mr Hasan said that when he took her heart out there was just two beats left - then the heart failed. 'Normally they can beat independently - but after two beats Jessica's just went. 'It was a very close-run thing. We felt huge relief and the surgery was just in time. We had no idea how close she was to dying. We were shocked that it had got so bad. She was sedated for days afterwards and came out of hospital three weeks later. 'The first thing she said when she came round was ""where's my dog Freddie?"" I was so relieved. 'The first year is really tricky, as we could never be sure that her body would accept the transplant.But Freeman hospital has one of the highest survival rates in the world. 'Since the transplant she's brighter and happier, she's back to her old cheeky self. 'Before, her lips were blue and she used to have to wear three pairs of socks because of poor circulation. 'She's going back to school and is working with the physio to help her cerebral palsy. She wants to get back to swimming and walking her dog Freddie. 'All the people at the hospital were amazing and we're extremely grateful.' Jessica Elliott was in and out of hospital after she was born with a congenital heart defect . Michelle said she was terrified when her daughter Jessica went in for the transplant op, in case it was the last time she saw her . Her surgeon Asif Hasan, 56, said: 'Her heart was on its last legs - she wouldn't have survived too long. The transplant came just in time for her. 'When I did the transplant her old heart seemed to fade away very quickly - suggesting it did not have long left. It was unusual. She was quite lucky. 'If she hadn't had the transplant when she did, she could have died suddenly. 'It's wonderful to know she's getting back to school and very satisfying to see her getting back to normal life. 'If a patient survives the first year after a transplant, like Jessica has, they're looking at a good outcome. I'm delighted for her.' Lynne Holt, Transplant Coordinator, from Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, said most hearts beat for up to a minute or two after removal. She said: 'Jessica's heart was obviously a very poorly heart.

A female Internal Revenue Service employee allegedly coerced a taxpayer into having sex with her in order to keep him out of hot water with his taxes. Vincent Burroughs, 40, of Fall Creek, Oregon, said Dora Abrahamson, 38, used her position with the IRS to sexually harass and intimidate him, according to a recently filed lawsuit. Burroughs says he initially resisted Abrahamson’s attempt to solicit him for sex until she told him that she could either impose no tax penalty or a 40 per cent penalty. Seduction: A female Internal Revenue Service employee allegedly coerced a taxpayer into having sex with her in order to keep him out of hot water with his taxes . Burroughs says the two had sex at his home in September 2011 and that the affair caused a rift in another relationship he was in. The IRS agent phoned the unsuspecting taxpayer to notify him that he was being audited, according to the lawsuit. Abrahamson allegedly told Burroughs ‘she knew who he was, and that it was lucky for him that this was the case, and that they should meet.’ Burroughs said he had no recollection of her. Abrahamson then went on to flirt with Burroughs over the phone and through text messages, offering him massages and at one point sending him a photo of her in her underwear, the lawsuit states. Offer he couldn't refuse: Vincent Burroughs says he initially resisted Dora Abrahamson¿s attempt to solicit him for sex until she told him that she could either impose no tax penalty or a 40 per cent penalty . Though Burroughs said that he did not respond to Abrahamson’s initial advances, he reportedly gave in to her demands after a ‘provocatively attired’ Abrahamson showed up at his home and propositioned him yet again. ‘She told (Burroughs) that she could be a bitch, or that she could be nice,’ the lawsuit states, ‘She said that she could impose no penalty, or a 40 percent penalty, and that if he would give her what she wanted, she would give him what he needed’ Burroughs had sex with the IRS agent that day ‘as a result of (her) coercive conduct,’ according to the lawsuit, which names Abrahamson and the United States of America as defendants. IRS spokesman Richard Panick told The Register-Guard that agency officials could not respond to questions regarding Burroughs’s allegations or Abrahamson’s employment history. Abrahamson declined to comment on the lawsuit when the newspaper contacted her by phone on Thursday. The former Eugene, Oregon, resident now lives in Cottage Grove, according to court records.Abrahamson is not believed to still be employed by the IRS, according to the Register-Guard. 'Forced affair': Burroughs says the two had sex at his home in September 2011 and that the affair caused a rift in another relationship he was on . Burroughs is asking a jury to award him unspecified punitive damages. He said that Abrahamson’s conduct caused him distress and ‘a rift in his relationship with his significant other.’ According to the lawsuit, Abrahamson’s advances violated Burroughs’s constitutional right to privacy and ‘were an excessive intrusion onto his person.’ The lawsuit states that the federal government is liable for damages because IRS officials provided inadequate supervision to Abrahamson allowing her to pursue a sexual relationship with Burroughs against his wishes. Burroughs said he did not initially report Abraham¬son’s sexual advances ‘out of embarrassment and fear that she would cause substantial financial penalties to be imposed upon him,’ the lawsuit states.

A female police lieutenant has been demoted after she sent sexually explicit videos and a raunchy photograph in her uniform to a lower-ranking officer, authorities said today. Diana Lopez, who was a public information officer in Tucson, was in a relationship with the male officer at the time. Police said on Monday that Lopez used her personal cell phone to send the videos and photos. Demotion: Diana Lopez had her rank lowered from lieutenant to sergeant at Tucson PD after she allegedly sent sexually explicit videos of herself to a lower-ranking officer...who she was also dating . Lopez was reduced to the rank of sergeant following an investigation that began last August 2012. She now works in the operations division. Anonymous letters sent to the police department about Lopez prompted the probe, according to the Arizona Daily Star. A police report says Lopez's boyfriend apparently showed the videos and photos to other officers between May and August 2011. It is believed that 13 people might have seen the footage - however no one admitted to it. The racy clips were never uncovered but there is 'no doubt they exist', authorities said. Police say Lopez violated several department regulations, code of ethics and professional standards. They say a recommendation was made to reduce her in rank. Rumor mill: Internal affairs believe that 13 officers had seen racy videos filmed by Lieutenant Lopez on her personal cellphone and sent to her boyfriend . During the lengthy investigation, Lopez admitted to kissing an individual in a station locker room while at work. The lower-ranking officer to whom Lopez sent the footage has not been identified. There is no suggestion that he will face disciplinary action although police spokesman Sgt Chris Widmer said the investigation was ongoing. Lopez's attorney Michael Piccarreta said she is considering a civil lawsuit against the city or appealing the demotion. He said that the case brought up constitutional issues over lawful off-duty behavior and violation of privacy.","Diana Lopez was downgraded from public information officer to sergeant in the operations division in Tucson, Arizona .

The Ministry of Justice has been branded 'shambolic' by MPs over its handling of a contract for court language services that in one case saw an unqualified man stand in for his wife as an interpreter during a murder trial. The department ignored warnings that the quality of services would be sacrificed when it outsourced the contract for providing court interpreters, the Justice Committee said. The department has also been told it may have been in contempt of parliament after it ordered court staff not to take part in the committee's inquiry. 'Shambolic': Sir Alan Beith (left) blasted the department over the outsourcing of the contract to provide court interpreters, but Justice Minister Helen Grant (right) said the MoJ had since taken 'swift and robust action' 'The Ministry of Justice's handling of the outsourcing of court interpreting services has been nothing short of shambolic,' committee chair Sir Alan Beith said. The contract with Applied Language Solutions (ALS), now known as Capita Translation and Interpreting after it was taken over, led to court proceedings being held up and even cases collapsing after it launched early last year. Justice Minister Helen Grant said while there had been 'significant' issues at the start of the contract, the department had seen dramatic improvements after taking 'swift and robust action'. A lack of registered interpreters, resulting in poor quality of services and a struggle to meet demand, was among the problems faced by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), the committee said. In one incident, an unqualified man arrived at the murder trial of mother-of-two Rajvinder Kaur to stand in as an interpreter for his wife. The man turned up at Winchester Crown Court 45 minutes late and concerns were raised after 30 minutes that he was not translating questions into Punjabi. Kaur was later jailed for life for bludgeoning her mother-in-law to death in a frenzied rage with a rolling pin. Other issues raised included interpreters being asked to travel long distances to attend court, often from the other side of the country, poor levels of pay, a lack of qualifications and mistranslation. 'Struggle to meet demand': In one case an unqualified man turned up to stand in for his wife as an interpreter during a murder trial at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) The committee was told that one interpreter mistranslated a defendant's statement, which ultimately gave the jury the impression that their evidence was not credible, but no action was taken. The MoJ did not have a sufficient understanding of the complexities of court interpreting work before it decided to put the services out to tender, the committee said. There was 'clear potential for problems' with ALS's ability to deliver on its promises, which were not dealt with by the MoJ or the firm, it added. The company 'clearly needed significantly more resources' than it had to deliver the service levels required. Commenting further on the MoJ's conduct, Sir Alan said: 'It did not have an adequate understanding of the needs of courts, it failed to heed warnings from the professionals concerned and it did not put sufficient safeguards in place to prevent interruptions in the provision of quality interpreting services to courts.' This was a particular cause for concern as the MoJ is about to launch a far-reaching competitive process for probation services as part of a 'rehabilitation revolution', the committee added. The highest priority for the MoJ and Capita is to prove the contract can attract and deploy an adequate number of qualified and competent interpreters, the MPs said. In the course of the inquiry, it emerged HMCTS instructed staff not to participate in the committee's online consultation. The committee said the actions of the MoJ may have constituted a contempt of the House of Commons, but as it received sufficient evidence from other sources to make a reliable judgement, it has not asked the House to take further action. Sir Alan warned that the committee members 'deplore the Ministry's ill-advised actions and there should be no repetition of them in the future'. Justice Minister Ms Grant said: 'There were significant issues at the start of the contract in early 2012 but we took swift and robust action, and have seen dramatic improvements, as the Justice Select Committee highlights. 'The vast majority of interpreter bookings are now being completed and complaints have fallen considerably. 'The changes we have made have led to major savings for taxpayers, totalling £15 million in the first year, and we continue to monitor the contract on a daily basis and demand continuing progress.'","Ministry of Justice outsourced contract for providing court interpreters .

Twice the legal limit: Mitchell Todd was not wearing a seatbelt and surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans when he crashed his car . Budding Scottish rugby star Mitchell Todd was twice the legal drinking limit and was not wearing a seatbelt when he crashed and died following a drinking session at Nottingham Rugby Club, an inquest heard on Tuesday. Former Scotland under-20 international and Nottingham player Todd, 21, was found in his Citroen C3, surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans, in a field near Normanton-on-the-Wolds in south Nottinghamshire last August by a member of the public. A post-mortem examination confirmed Todd, who represented Scotland under 20s in last season's Six Nations and featured in the Junior World Cup, died as a result of a catastrophic brain injury which he could not have survived, the inquest at Nottingham Town Hall heard. Todd had drunk excessively after an all-day training event with Nottingham Rugby Club at Trent College in Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire, on August 14 last year before being found in his car in the early hours of the following morning, assistant deputy coroner Jane Gillespie heard. His blood-alcohol reading was 172mg of . alcohol per 100mls of blood an inquest into his death heard today. The . legal driving limit is 80mg. Detective constable Mark Henshaw, from Nottinghamshire Police, told the inquest the young player, who was described by his club as an ‘exceptional talent’, drank free wine and beer at a meal at the end of the training event at the college. He then got a taxi into Nottingham city centre where he continued to drink beer and spirits with his team-mates until 2am. The rugby club had warned players not to drive after the event at the college but an intoxicated Todd ignored this advice and returned to his car. The officer told the inquest it was not known why Todd, who lived in Nod Rise, Coventry, had been driving on Cotgrave Road as he knew no one in that area. Residents in the area described hearing a loud thud around 3.15am on August 15 and seeing a small, dark coloured vehicle travelling at speed to the police. Todd's mother Delia Todd wiped tears from her eyes as Pc Robert Lloyd, a forensics collision investigator with Nottinghamshire Police, described the moments before the crash that claimed her son's life. The officer told the hearing the . Citroen had been travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit when Todd . lost control of his vehicle on a left hand bend. He then drove on the wrong side of . the road, clipping road signs and trees as he careered across grass . verges and kerbs before failing to take a right hand bend and crashing . through a fence and hedge into a field, Pc Lloyd told the inquest. Talent: Todd, a former Scotland under-20 international and Nottingham Rugby Club (pictured), had drunk excessively after an all-day training event with the Trent College before the crash . An inquest was opened and adjourned . for further investigation by police last summer after the car was found . lying on its roof in the field, pointing towards the road. Pc Lloyd told the hearing the car was found to have no defects but that Todd had not been wearing his seat belt. The officer said: ‘If he had been . wearing his seat belt I think there would have been a very great . difference to the outcome. He would have been shaken up but not have . sustained the serious injuries which he did.’ He confirmed no other vehicles had been involved in the incident and that Todd had been travelling alone in the car. Pc Lloyd said: ‘In my opinion the . cause of the crash was travelling too fast around a left hand bend while . the driver was intoxicated. The state of his injuries were compounded . by the lack of a seat belt.’ Summing up the evidence, Miss . Gillespie described Todd, who was born in Solihull and had just finished . a degree in sports therapy at Coventry University, as a rugby player . with a promising career in front of him. Recording a verdict of accidental . death, the coroner said: ‘This is a sad, unnecessary and preventable . waste of a talented young life and I very much hope that valuable . lessons are learnt as a result of this tragedy. ‘I find that the combination of . intoxication, excess speed and Mitchell's failure to wear a seatbelt . resulted in this terrible incident and the catastrophic brain injury . suffered by Mitchell, which he simply could not survive. Tragedy: Mitchell Todd was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, but died of a massive brain injury . ‘Taking into account all of the evidence available to me, my verdict is one of accidental death. ‘I extend my deepest sympathies to Mitchell's family and friends.’ Ms Todd made no comment following the verdict. Nottingham Rugby chief executive . Simon Beatham said: ‘Everyone at Nottingham Rugby continues to mourn the . death of an exceptionally talented young man. ‘The loss of Mitchell touched this club profoundly and our hearts, thoughts and sympathies are with all his family and friends.’ Todd signed a new contract with the . club in May and was expected to make a big impact during the 2012-2013 . season, the club added. He qualified for Scotland through his . Edinburgh-born father and had also represented Scottish Exiles from . under-17 to under-20 level. He won 10 Scotland under-20 caps and played . in the IRB Junior World Championship. Rob Brierley, the Scottish Rugby . Union's performance development manager for Exiles, said: ‘Mitch was a . quiet, sensitive bloke with a real steely determination never more . evident than on the rugby pitch. ‘He was a real athlete, somebody who was late to the game and was developing all the time.’ The Scottish Rugby Union added: ‘Scottish Rugby extends its sincere condolences to all Mitchell Todd's family and friends.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mitchell Todd, 21, was twice the legal drinking limit at the time of the crash .

A transgender man cleared of raping and assaulting a woman burst out of the courtroom weeping tears of joy. Nadine Natasha Williams, 39, of Pontrhydyfen, Port Talbot, south Wales, had been accused of rape and two counts of assault by penetration after luring the woman into a sex dungeon, the court heard. Pink-haired Williams, formerly Dean Williams, denied wanting sex with the woman ‘as a last throw of the dice’ before finally becoming a woman. Tears of joy: Transgender man Nadine Natasha Williams, formerly Dean Williams, was cleared of raping and assaulting a woman after allegedly luring her into a sex dungeon . Williams has been living as a woman for . more than two years as part of the process of eventually obtaining a . full sex change, the court heard. Williams was looking after the house of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked the woman, who is in her 30s, to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing. During his trial prosecutor Huw Rees said: 'Williams met the woman not long after he had announced he was transgender and wanted to be known as Nadine. 'He wore women’s clothes that day and was very open about his cross-dressing. 'The woman said she would support him through this period of change.' The prosecution had alleged that Williams pinned the woman down on a bed before raping her in October 2011. Swansea Crown Court heard that Williams was later arrested wearing just a pair of women's knickers. He told police: 'She was here earlier on and we had sex together, but but was consensual.' To become a woman: Williams has been living as a woman for more than two years (right in 2011, left on his Facebook page) as part of the process of eventually obtaining a full sex change . He denied the offences but admitted that he had sex with the woman but insisted the acts were consensual. Mr Rees described how the victim agreed to go with Williams for drinks and a meal at the Big Can pub in Neath, south Wales. Mr Rees added: 'They left the pub and went to the home of a friend of Nadine’s. 'Nadine had told her there was an S&M room there with cages, whips, chains and dominatrix apparatus on the walls in an upstairs bedroom they called The Dungeon. 'Nadine asked if she wanted to see the dungeon and his women’s clothes. 'They went into the room and Nadine suggested they try out some of the equipment but she declined. 'Nadine kissed her and she pushed him away and told him not to be so stupid. He offered to show her his clothes and they went into the next bedroom where he pushed her on the bed, straddled her and ripped off her top and bra. 'While he was doing this he was snarling and growling. Three not-guilty verdicts: Williams was looking after the house (on this street) of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked the woman, who is in her 30s, to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing . 'She was trying to kick him off and she bit his shoulder. 'Her jeans and boots were removed by him and he raped her. 'She said: “I told him: 'No, f*cking get off"".' The woman told the court: “Nadine was telling me about his cross dressing and I said I would support what he was doing. 'It was weird but I’d rather be a support to him than an enemy.' She also described her shock at being shown the sex dungeon. She said: ‘He was telling me he was becoming an escort and that Nicky was being paid to be a dominatrix and he was trying to get into it. Shrieks of delight: As Williams heard his not-guilty verdict, Judge Peter Heywood told jurors at Swansea Crown Court (pictured) that it was 'a rather unusual case' 'It was a bit freaky to be honest. I was trying to laugh it off, that’s when he went for me and tried to kiss me. “He said I should get into it but I said no.' Judge Peter Heywood explained to the jury: 'He’s altered his name by deed poll and as I understand it he is transgender and is awaiting a sex change operation in due course.' After the jury returned three not-guilty verdicts, the defendant audibly shrieked in delight in the waiting area outside Court 4. Judge Heywood thanked the jurors for their service. He said: ‘It has been a rather unusual case. ‘But jury service is one of the most important things you can ever do and I would like to thank you all very much.’","Nadine Natasha Williams was cleared of rape and two counts of assault .

Current lodgers will be allowed to see out the end of their contracts rent-free but there are fears that Fortune, who intends to appeal the decision, will escape through a 'legal loophole'. Threatened tenant Jaime Finn, 28, who stayed in the Lonsdale Terrace flat, said: 'He threatened everybody in the flat. He said, 'I will kick the f*** out of you,' and was boasting about having friends who had been locked up for shooting someone. 'As he left, he kicked the door in and went downstairs in a fit of rage. 'After that, we began to receive threatening phone calls.' Councillors were told Fortune had been convicted of offences directly relating his business of letting properties. These included an incident in March 2011 where he was fined £1,000 for operating an unlicensed House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) and September 2011 where he was fined £650 for threatening tenants. They also heard Fortune's appeal to the Sheriff for a previous refusal of an HMO licence from the Council had been rejected in January.

Jon Black, secretary of Edinburgh Private Tenants Action Group, which was founded by some of Fortune's ex-tenants, said: 'We are really pleased. 'But registering the properties under a different name could easily be a loophole here. Action still needs to be taken to tighten the system up.' In 2010 Fortune was also exposed as a blue-badge parking cheat after he left his £118,00 Ferrari F430 in a disabled bay outside the Crown Office in Edinburgh.

He added Mr Finn was in arrears on his rent and an eviction order against him in 2010 had been granted. He added: 'Having been on the landlord register since May 2006, the committee's decision was disappointing.

Police officers have been told to stay away from the internet after drinking alcohol when off-duty – to avoid giving away secrets or embarrassing their force. They have been instructed to use private chat rooms if they want to complain about their jobs, rather than log on to public websites such as Facebook and Twitter where their comments could ‘go viral’ and be seen by thousands of people. Officers must not post details of their jobs, pictures of themselves in uniform or details of their hobbies. Warning: Police officers have been instructed to stay away from the internet if they have been drinking, and advised not to complain about their jobs on social networks such as Twitter (file picture) And they are urged to keep an eye  on what members of their families  are posting too. The recommendations could lead to hundreds of officers editing their profiles. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) says that police risk breaching trust, leaking personal data, discrediting the service, giving away personal details and jeopardising operations if they fail to use the internet safely. Its ten-page guide is published as growing numbers of officers find themselves in trouble over their online activity. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary found 357 instances of ‘potentially inappropriate behaviour’ among 1,588 officers active on social media sites, mainly Twitter. The posts included offensive language (132 instances); comments on police procedures (119); negativity towards work (70) and ‘extreme opinions on [the] Government’ (36). Controlled tweeting: Officers have been warned that they should avoid using social media off-duty after consuming alcohol (file picture) A Metropolitan Police constable, James Patrick, is facing gross misconduct proceedings over comments he made on Twitter and in a book about police reform and service cuts. And a Greater Manchester officer, Andy Hall, quit the site after being given ‘advice’ by senior colleagues about his light-hearted tweets. In one message, he listed the high price of chocolate bars as a ‘crime update’. Northamptonshire Police deleted the Twitter accounts of four officers last year amid concerns they had wrongly discussed investigations or breached data protection law. The new ACPO guidance warns: ‘Police officers and staff should avoid using the internet and social media off-duty after consuming alcohol or when their judgment may be impaired for other reasons.’ It urges police not to use social media while on duty or on personal smartphones. Officers are warned to be careful when adding new friends to social media profiles; to ensure their privacy settings are at the highest level; and to remember that online users may not be who they appear to be. John Cooper QC, who will represent PC Patrick, said: ‘As with all guidelines relating to social media, these smack of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. One wonders why, for example, the police have to be advised not to tweet when drunk.’ Briefing: says that police risk breaching trust and jeopardising operations if they fail to use the internet safely.

A former policeman accused of selling stories about celebrities to the press was today charged with misconduct in public office. Alan Tierney, who worked at Surrey Police, is alleged to have received £1,750 for giving the Sun details of two cases linked to well-known public figures. One of the cases is believed to relate to an accusation that the mother and mother-in-law of Chelsea captain John Terry were caught shoplifting at a shopping centre in March 2009. The other is said to have been the arrest of Ronnie Wood after he was accused of assaulting his much younger girlfriend in December 2009.

Caution: Tierney allegedly caught the footballer's mother Sue Terry, left, and mother-in-law Sue Poole, right, shoplifting from a shopping centre in Surrey in March 2009 . Tierney was arrested as part of Operation Elveden, which was set up to investigate allegations of newspapers paying police officers for information. He is believed to have the . officer who issued a caution to Sue Terry and Sue Poole, the mother and . mother-in-law of former England football captain Mr Terry, after arresting them for shoplifting £800 worth of goods from Tesco and . Marks & Spencer in March 2009. Two days after the incident in Weybridge, Surrey, details appeared in the Sun, attributed to anonymous sources. In December of the same year, Rolling Stones guitarist Mr Wood was arrested on suspicion of beating up his Russian lover Ekaterina Ivanova, 42 years his junior, at his home in Claygate, Surrey. He was questioned by police and released with a caution for common assault - and once again, it took just two days for the story to appear in the Sun, including an interview with a witness to the fight. Fight: Tierney is also accused of leaking a story that Ronnie Wood, left, allegedly assaulted his then girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova, right, in December 2009 . Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: 'We have concluded, following a careful review of the evidence, that Alan Tierney, a former police constable with Surrey Police, should be charged with two offences of committing misconduct in public office. 'It is alleged that in 2009 Mr Tierney provided information to The Sun newspaper on two occasions in breach of the terms of his employment with Surrey Police and was paid £1,750. 'The first charge relates to an allegation that Mr Tierney provided details to the newspaper about a shoplifting incident in which he was the arresting officer. 'The second charge relates to an . occasion on which Mr Tierney took a statement from a witness to a . domestic violence incident. It is alleged that Mr Tierney passed the . witness's name, address and details of the incident to the newspaper. 'Both of these incidents were linked to high-profile people.' News International: Tierney is accused of selling stories about high-profile figures to the Sun . Ms Levitt added that prosecutors had considered whether or not the officer's alleged leaks had contributed to the 'public interest' sufficiently to outweigh the supposed crime. The Crown Prosecution Service refused to confirm or deny the details of Tierney's alleged leaks. He will appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 26 February. Evidence received by prosecutors last month also contained allegations against a member of the public, but officials decided to take no further action against the individual.

An abandoned pig was found wandering the streets of Leicester after his owners dumped him for getting too big. Eight-month-old Percy, who was found by policemen out on patrol, was left malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition on New Year's Day. The piglet was taken in by stunned RSPCA staff who discovered that he refused to eat normal pig food and was malnourished after being fed sandwiches by his former owners. Eight-month-old Percy is now living in an RSPCA centre in Leicester. The staff there are attempting to nurse him back to health . Percy turned his nose up at fruit and veg when staff tried to bring his weight up to normal, as the only food he would eat was bread. He is now being cared for at the Woodside RSPCA centre in Braunstone. Carrie Stoker, Animal Centre Supervisor at the RSPCA'S Leicester centre, said: 'Poor Percy was not in a good way when he was found, he'd obviously been kept by someone who had no idea how to look after a pig. 'He wasn't in a good state, and unfortunately the only thing he would eat was bread so we can only assume the only food he's ever been fed is sandwiches. 'I've never seen a pig abandoned on the . street before, it is unbelievably cruel, especially on New Years Day . when the streets were busy, fireworks were going off and he would have been very frightened.' Staff believe Percy is a Vietnamese pig, which are regularly used by breeders to farm 'micro pigs' Percy (left)  is a much happier pig now that he lives in the Woodside RSPCA centre being treated by Crissy Noble (right) Percy is the latest micro-pig to be abandoned after his owners found he grew too large . RSPCA staff have found that Percy will only eat bread, showing that his owners did not know how to feed and care for a pig properly . Ms Stoker added: 'He isn't tagged as a farm animal would be, so we think he has been kept in someone's home as a micro pig. He's at the age when they just start maturing and becoming a bit more aggressive and getting a lot bigger and it looks like someone has just thrown him out on the street. 'Percy is such a lovely boy. We are working on getting him back to full health and then finding him a knowledgeable home where he can roam around outside at his heart's content.' Micro pigs became fashionable after a series of celebrities, such as Paris Hilton, Charlotte Church and the Beckham's, bought them as pets. But experts warn that pigs are not easy animals to look . after, they will tear up a garden, and they have to have things to chew . on to wear down their teeth. When the tiny piglets grow bigger than their owners were warned, they often end up being handed in to animal rescue centres.

Despite having been given repeated chances to keep out of trouble, Claire MacGarva has persistently re-offended. The 32-year-old even embarked on a crime spree just two weeks after she was spared prison, stealing a computer and raiding high street shops for more than £400 worth of goods. Repeat offender: Serial thief Claire MacGarva, 32, has been jailed for two years at Newcastle Crown Court after clocking up her 182nd criminal conviction . However, tonight MacGarva was starting a two year prison term after Judge James Goss QC told the repeat offender she had run out of chances. 'Every effort has been made by the police, your supervising probation officer and by me to stop you committing crime but regrettably we have failed in our efforts,' said Judge Goss, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court. The court heard that when MacGarva went on her latest shoplifting spree she had been the subject of a drug rehabilitation order, conditional discharge, supervision and a suspended sentence. Judge Goss was also told that MacGarva has had continued efforts from agencies attempting to help her turn her back on a life of crime, but without success. The long-term heroin addict had been given a suspended jail term last September but just two weeks later stole a laptop during a burglary at the Sunderland Museum. Four days after that she stole £12 worth of deodorant from Poundland and £53 of protein products from Holland and Barratt in the city. On November 29 she then stole DVDs and watches worth £311 from Argos and on January 4 of this year was collared taking £35 worth of groceries from the Co-op in Shiney Row, Tyne and Wear. MacGarva, of Mowbray Road, Sunderland, admitted theft and burglary charges in relation to the offences. She also admitted thefts of £300 worth of food from the Co-op in Houghton le Spring, £26 worth of food from Iceland and televisions worth £396 from Asda - all committed last summer, before she was given the suspended sentence in September. Judge Goss told her: 'You have demonstrated you are unwilling or unable to stop offending. 'You were warned by me at a previous court hearing a substantial custodial sentence is inevitable. 'Continue and you will end up spending years and years in prison.' Ian Hudson, defending, said: 'Heroin is the catalyst for all her offending. 'She has to pay the price today.' Sentenced: Judge John Goss QC told MacGarva at Newcastle Crown Court that she was 'unwilling or unable to stop offending' and ordered her to spend two years in prison .","Claire MacGarva shoplifted despite being subject to suspended sentence .

The married New York mother who was murdered while on a solo trip to Turkey was reportedly seen with a second mystery man twice before her death - including the day she was supposed to fly home, it was revealed today. It follows reports that Sarai Sierra, 33, had sex the day before she vanished with a man she had struck up a friendship with on the internet months ahead of her trip. Police are also investigating whether the mother-of-two was involved with any criminal activity while in Turkey after she was seen with 'a criminal element'. Now a witness has told Istanbul police that he saw Sierra speaking to a different man outside the city's Sultanahmet Mosque on January 11, just days after she arrived in the country. He handed her a card and as she left the mosque, she took a walk with him and four or five other men, the witness claimed, Turkish newspaper Milliyet reported. Murdered: The body of Sarai Sierra, pictured left and right with her sons, was found in Istanbul on Saturday; a man she met on the internet claimed they had consensual sex the day before she went missing . Sierra flew to Amsterdam on January 15 and to Munich the next day, returning to Istanbul on January 19. The witness said he then saw Sierra talking with the same man on January 21 at Topkapi Palace - the day she was due to fly home, but she never boarded the flight. Turkish police and the FBI are reportedly looking into whether Sierra was involved with drug traffickers, human traffickers or jewellery transportation while on her solo trip. They have previously said the first people Sierra - who had been unemployed and declared bankruptcy in 2005 - met with on her trip were 'a criminal element'. Sierra's body was found with a single blow to the head and stashed by the city's ancient walls on Saturday, two weeks after she was meant to fly home to her husband and two sons in Staten Island.

The bigger a CEO's signature the more likely he or she is to be a narcissist, a new study claims. The research which compared the signatures of some 605 CEOs of U.S. firms found that size does matter where boss's autographs are concerned. It found that bosses with bigger signatures also tended to get the highest pay, but were in fact more likely to run their companies into the ground. Bosses: A study comparing the signatures of hundreds of CEOs of U.S. firms found that - when it comes to autographs - size does matter . Bold: Magnate Donald Trump's signature is seen scrawled at the bottom of this letter . The study by academics at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina took . the signatures of CEOs from company accounts filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The authors identify narcissism as an egotistical character trait 'associated with conceit and disregard for others'. 'Similarly, narcissism creates biased self-perception in the form of upwardly biased evaluation of one’s own abilities and performance,' they say in the paper. These qualities make them bad decision makers, the study says, but enables them to convince directors and shareholders of their competency to the extent that they get better pay. Flourish: President Barack Obama is seen signing his nomination for White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to be named Treasury Secretary . Top boss: President Obama left his sizeable signature alongside wife Michelle's during their visit to Westminster Abbey in London . Professor Sean Wang, one of three authors of the study, told ABC News . that the 605 signatures analysed were found largely on annual reports . and other documents filed by S&P 500 companies as of July 2011. The S&P 500 index tracks the most valuable 500 companies listed on U.S. stock markets. Signatures . were fed into a custom coded computer program which drew a rectangle . around each of them and measured the area they covered. 'We standardized the measure by dividing the area by the number letters in the CEO's signature,' Professor Wang said. Professor Wang said he and his . co-authors relied on findings from previous psychological studies which . claimed that bigger signatures mean bigger egos. 'Curly French fry': Jacob 'Jack' Lew's signature, which will appear on the dollar bill if he is confirmed as the new U.S. Treasury Secretary . Using . the size of the signature as a proxy for the writers' narcissism, they . found that 'narcissistic CEOs invest more in capital expenditures and . acquisitions but pay lower dividends, with overinvestments being largest . in magnitude when financial slack is high. Aggressive managers who bully their staff are more likely to enjoy career success than even their more competent rivals because people are impressed by their dominance, a study claims. Researchers found that people who were dominant had a greater influence on others, and could be easily and quickly picked out of a crowd. In a two part study, 200 participants completed a problem-solving task in small groups while being videotaped, with volunteers rating each other's dominance, prestige and influence during the task, as well as their own. The researchers defined prestige as the appearance of skill and competency, and dominance as having the ability to impose ideas on others through bullying and intimidation. Results showed those who were more dominant or prestigious had a greater influence on the task and were seen as more influential by the participants. In the second part, 60 extra participants watched a total of 120 seconds of short videos of the initial group interactions while wearing an eye-tracking device. The University of British Columbia team found these participants paid significantly greater attention to individuals who appeared more dominant or prestigious, indicating their higher levels of influence. The study also revealed while participants preferred leaders with prestige, they were more likely to choose dominant leaders, and were more forgiving of their behaviour. 'In . addition, narcissistic CEOs exhibit worse performance as measured by . the contemporaneous return on assets, with the effects being largest . when operating environments are most uncertain. 'Despite . the negative relationship between narcissism and firm performance, . these CEOs receive both higher cash and stock compensation, as well as . higher compensation relative to the next highest paid executive at their . firm.' However, other experts where sceptical . of the paper's conclusions because of its assumption that a larger . signature correlates to a bigger ego. James Westerman and Jacqueline Bergman of Appalachian State University told ABC that other factors can determine signature size, including high self-esteem and an extroverted personality. They also said that if high self-esteem was what lay behind a company boss's oversized autograph, it's possible that the firm could even benefit from such positive self assurance. Professor Wang conceded this could be the case, but countered that he and his colleagues do not claim to have found a one-to-one correspondence between large signatures and badly run companies, merely that the relationship holds true on average. To illustrate the point the researchers compared the relative performance of two companies competing in the same industry to the size of their CEOs' signatures. Dell boss Michael Dell has a smaller scribble that Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina, and HP underperformed Dell by getting a lower return on its investments. Professor Wang told ABC that the CEO they studied with the biggest signature was Timothy Koogle, former boss Yahoo as CEO between 1995 and 2001, and chairman between 1999 and 2003. Even allowing for the fact that Mr Koogle led Yahoo during the rise and fall of the internet bubble, the professor said he very much fitted their model.

The signatures of high-profile figures came under the spotlight in the U.S. last month when Barack Obama formally nominated White House chief of staff Jacob 'Jack' Lew for the post of Treasury Secretary. If Mr Lew is confirmed as Treasury Secretary his 'childish' signature - which has been compared to a curly French fry - will grace the dollar bill. The President joked that he had considered abandoning the nomination after learning of Mr Lew's bizarre and illegible signature.

Valentine's Day - the most romantic day of the year - falls on Thursday and many will seize the opportunity to go down on one knee. But for one UK woman romance is more than a day - it's a year round job. Jewellery designer and business owner Harriet Kelsall finds herself at the heart of hundreds of romantic and unusual proposals every year. Loved up couples flock to her studios in Hertfordshire and Cambridge to share their love stories and get advice on how to create the engagement ring of their dreams. So Harriet, 41, who launched Harriet Kelsall Bespoke Jewellery 13 years ago, seemed the perfect person to tell MailOnline about some of the unique proposals she has encountered over the years. Each of the couples has visited her for an entirely bespoke ring that tells the story of their love... Underwater love: Daniel proposed to Zoe by writing a message on a sea bed in Thailand . Daniel . Kurk, 30, proposed to Zoe Church, 35, on the bottom of the ocean. The . couple, from Watford in Hertfordshire, are planning a beach wedding this . year… . Daniel said: I . planned to pop the question in Thailand on our second joint holiday . there. I'd spent over a month on the island of Koh Tao when I'd been . travelling a few years back. It is where I qualified for my open water . and advanced diving licenses and I had become firm friends with one of . the dive shop owners. When I . returned to Koh Tao with Zoe I arranged for my friend to supply us with . snorkel gear and a dive bag and I told him my plans. I . booked a night's stay on the tiny island of Koh Nang Yuan about a mile . off shore and the following morning I got up at sunrise and snuck off . into the bay while Zoe slept. In joke: Kurt's 'wife me, LOL' message referred to an episode of Come Dine With Me the pair had enjoyed . Thumbs up: A snorkeling Zoe signals her assent . I . collected a dive bag full of dead coral that had washed up at the foot . of the beach and then swam out into the bay to write a message on the . sea bed. I managed to get back to our villa just as Zoe was waking up. Ring to reflect the proposal: It's shaped like a wave and the topaz gem is the colour of the sea . I . tempted Zoe into the water by pretending to have seen a turtle. We swam . into the bay and I kept making her swim further and further out. When . she finally saw the message she did a double take and started laughing . bubbles. She thought someone else had left the message. Then . she looked at me, looked back at the message, more bubbles and then . nearly drowned as she forgot to breath! We made it back to shore after a . few happy tears on her part. The . message itself is very silly.  Zoe's favourite TV show is Come Dine . With Me and during a WAG special, the wives talked about their . proposals. Emile Hesky's wife said Emile had proposed via a text message . and the narrator, Dave Lamb, screamed, 'What did it say, Wife Me LOL?'. It turned into one of Zoe’s favourite jokes for about the next six . months, so I didn’t really have much choice but to write that as my . proposal. Our ring needed . to be just as special as the proposal so Harriet's team designed one around the themes of water and the ocean. The ring was designed to look like the crest of a wave and the central . stone is blue topaz, to reflect the colour of the ocean. A perfect . symbol of our future lives together. Graham, 45, and Angela Gunn, 43, both have a special place in their hearts for Sylvester - their 1967 VW Beetle. The couple, from northern Scotland, tied the knot three months ago . Graham said: It has always been the three of us and we've had so many adventures together, travelling to car shows across Britain and even entering Sylvester into events. Drive of their life: The Gunns had to get engaged in the presence of their beloved VW Beetle Sylvester . I proposed to Angela in March 2012 on a beautiful beach in a Scottish village called Melvich. Everything was perfect, the sun was shining and the breeze was warm. Sylvester was all spruced up for the event and I'm even sure I could see him smiling for the photos. Perfect fit: The ring was designed to look like a VW headlight . I wanted Angela to be involved in her engagement ring so, when she said yes, our creative side went into overdrive. We wanted a ring that had features of Sylvester so we trawled through photos and chose headlights as our inspiration. This model of Beetle has a distinct, sloping headlight, so we took our photos and ideas to the designer and together created something stunning. Look at the ring and you'll see that the diamond represents a headlight and the setting is its holder. If you look closely you’ll even see how the headlight slopes but the actual light inside is vertical. Seeing our VW inspired ring come to life was amazing and made our engagement even more special. We got married last October and Sylvester was, of course, a key part. He took Angela to the church and was even the inspiration behind our wedding cake design. My mum made Angela’s dress and a friend embroidered Sylvester's registration number and sloping headlights on to her train. It was a day to remember. Aviation loving Alex Hockley, 27, took to the skies to propose to girlfriend Hayley Faithfull, 27. The couple, from Chandler’s Ford in Hampshire, are due to wed in April . Alex said: When I decided to propose I knew I wanted an utterly unique location and a ring which would have real meaning and which couldn’t be bought over the counter by anyone else. I wanted to propose in the sky but the first thing I needed to do was create a ring to match the occasion. I was brought up in aviation and flying is practically my life so I wanted to give Hayley a ring that either looked like, or represented, an aircraft. On the wings of love: Alex Hockley took to the skies to propose to Hayley in an RAF Bulldog aircraft . The largest aircraft I have ever flown is a Bechcraft Kingair so I took this as my inspiration and asked the designer to use a propeller to inspire a twisted shape in the ring. The cone of the aircraft is where the diamond sits and three stones were added at either side to create a shading effect, something similar to the look you get when a propeller spins around. I chose the blue stones to match the colour of Hayley’s eyes. Personal: The ring style was inspired by an airplane propeller and includes gems in the colour of Hayley's eyes . For the proposal itself I flew Hayley in an RAF Bulldog aircraft to Garmi, the boundary point between England and France, which is where I popped the question. But I couldn't get down on bended knees since I was flying! Hayley said 'yes' and when we landed I presented her with the ring. We are getting married in two months and, with an aviation inspired ring firmly on Hayley's finger, I know that flying will be in our lives forever. Graham . Finney proposed to his wife Caroline, both 30, with a ring inspired by . their first holiday together. They have now been married for six months . and live in Belfast . Graham says: Caroline . was learning to scuba dive when I met her. She convinced me to learn . too and we fell in love in the water and have been diving buddies since. Diving in: Graham and Caroline share a love of the water sport . Caroline had dreamed of having an octopus ring for years, ever since seeing one at a diver’s show. Holiday memory: Caroline's ring is made to look as though an octopus is clasping the diamond . Using an octopus as inspiration for . our engagement ring seemed an obvious choice, especially since it . reminded me of our first diving holiday together when the octopus we . spotted under water took one look at us and immediately hid itself in a . hole. Our guide managed to tempt it out by using the metal strap on . Caroline’s watch to catch the sun. It turns out octopus love anything . sparkly so it seemed perfect that an octopus should hold the sparkling . diamond in Caroline’s ring. I submitted sketches to Harriet and . the designer made exactly what I wanted. After having it commissioned I . hid our engagement ring for a whole year and waited until we were on our . cruise on the Nile, where I proposed at sunset on the captain's deck. Although we got engaged on dry land our diving buddies joined in to celebrate. It was perfect. Find out more about Harriet Kelsall Bespoke Jewellery visit www.hkjewellery.co.uk .","Daniel .

Unlucky in love: Hilary Devey divorced her husband Philip Childs in a 70-second hearing . They are renowned for their financial acumen, but the stars of BBC 2 series Dragons’ Den seem cursed in love – with self-made millionaire Hilary Devey the latest to divorce. The 55-year-old haulage tycoon, known for her flamboyant style, ended her two-year marriage to her third husband, property developer Philip Childs, at a 70-second hearing at the High Court last week. Her divorce – on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour on both sides – follows the marital splits of fellow Dragons’ Den entrepreneurs Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones. Mr Bannatyne, who amassed an £85 million fortune from his health clubs, took to Twitter last month to say he had to make staff redundant because of the cost of his divorce from his second wife Joanne McCue. And telecoms millionaire Mr Jones, who according to last year’s Sunday Times Rich List is worth £367 million, separated from his wife in the early Nineties after his business crashed in the recession. Last year Ms Devey revealed that she was living alone with her son from a former marriage. Her home – a wing of oppulent Rangemore Hall on the outskirts of Burton-on-Trent, which includes a swimming pool and gym – is now on the market for £1,950,000. Ms Devey has vowed she will never remarry and said her latest divorce was ‘probably one of the unhappiest periods of my life’. She said: ‘It’s bloody hard knowing that a third relationship has gone down the pan. I feel hurt, angry and just a little bit bewildered because I can’t seem to get it right with men.’ Bolton-born Ms Devey, who was just seven . when she started helping out in her father’s corner shop, launched her . freight distribution company Pall-Ex in 1996, made her first million . within three years and is now worth an estimated £100 million. Martial splits: Her divorce follows the divorce of fellow Dragons' Den entrepreneurs Duncan Bannatyne (pictured with ex-wife Joanne) and Peter Jones . She will leave Dragons’ Den this year to present her own show, The Interim, on Channel 4. Shortly after her marriage to  Mr Childs she had declared she was happier than she had ever been despite the fact he did not always like her fashion choices. At the time she said: ‘He tells me  I spend too much on clothes .  .  . if only he knew the actual amount.’ A spokesman for Ms Devey said last night that she would not be  commenting and was out of the country. Meanwhile, the decision last week of long-standing Dragon and stationery magnate Theo Paphitis to leave the show too has sparked speculation about replacements. Names mooted so far include  Richard Reed from Innocent Drinks, Angus Thirlwell of Hotel Chocolat, and former panellist on the programme James Caan, who is a  venture capitalist.

Alain Hubert, founder of the International Polar Foundation, said the penguins were curious rather than scared of them.

He said: ‘I spent more than five years of my life in the polar regions, but that was the kind of moment that I wouldn't have expect[ed] to be able to ... just enjoy.’ While the amount of poo was substantial, Mr Hubert said that because of the cold temperatures, it did not smell but, had it been any warmer, it would have produced a stench. Emperor penguins are the tallest of all penguin species and are the only penguin species that breed during the Antarctic winter. They trek up to 75 miles over the ice to reach breeding colonies which are often made up of thousands of penguins.","British Antarctic Survey researchers noticed the trail while studying satellite images in 2009 .

But now the Government’s advisers on England’s heritage are to investigate new evidence that might prove the true location of the Battle of Hastings is two miles from where historians have long accepted it took place. English Heritage’s battlefield committee is to look at two competing cases which challenge the long-held belief that the bloody encounter took place on land commemorated by the foundation of Battle Abbey, near Hastings in East Sussex. Scroll down for video . Historic site: An annual re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings underway at Battle Abbey in East Sussex . The alternative sites are on nearby Caldbec Hill, and two miles away near the village of Crowhurst. At the 1066 battle, William Duke of Normandy vanquished Harold’s army, securing the success of the Norman Conquest. Historian Nick Austin says there have been historical finds backing his claim in support of Crowhurst over the years. The case for Caldbec Hill is made by another historian, John Grehan. Last night English Heritage confirmed it was investigating, adding: ‘If there is a compelling case that the registered battlefield merits amendment, we will review the evidence.’ Doubts: It has been suggested that the Battle of Hastings, famously depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry (pictured), may in fact have taken place at a different location .","Historians believe Battle Abbey may not have been the site of the bloody encounter after all .

Hurled abuse: William Blything has been fined £2,500 and banned from entering sporting arenas after he yelled racial abuse at players in front of his family at a match last year . The merchant seaman from Wavertree, Liverpool was arrested when a complaint was made after the 1-1 draw between QPR and Everton at Loftus Road stadium, in Shepherd's Bush, London on October 21 last year. He shocked fellow Everton fan Neil Jordan so much that he tweeted a photo of Blything captioned 'racist tw*t' after hearing the abuse.

Michael Christian, one of the two Australian royal radio prank hoaxers, quietly slipped back onto the air today after lying low for two months. Mr Christian and his co-host Mel Greig caused international uproar on December 4 when they pretended to be Prince Charles and the Queen and were put through to the Duchess of Cambridge's ward at the King Edward VII's Hospital. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who innocently put the hoax call through, later committed suicide, resulting in the two DJs, who were working on Sydney's 2Day FM, being pulled off the air and an investigation being started by Scotland Yard. Back on the air: Michael Christian (right) and his co-host Mel Greig . caused international uproar on December 4 when they pretended to be . Prince Charles and the Queen . After giving a tearful TV interview . later, when they expressed their sorrow at the consequences of their . hoax call, nothing was heard of the pair – until today, when Mr . Christian's voice was heard on his original radio station, Melbourne's . FoxFM, which is part of the Southern Cross Austereo network. The company was quick to deny that it had arranged for Mr Christian to 'sneak' back on air. 'I don't think the organisation was trying to hide anything,' a spokeswoman told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper. 'His return was never going to be the subject of a bells and whistles-type announcement.' Nothing has been heard of Miss Greig, 30, and no announcement has been made when, or if, she will return to the air waves. Tragic: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate's ward, was found dead in nurses' housing three days after the call . When the pair gave their TV interview . in the wake of Miss Saldanha's suicide, Miss Greig appeared to be more . upset than Mr Christian. Through her tears she said: 'I remember my first question was ""Was she a mother?"" She added: 'There's not a minute that . goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going . through. 'And the thought we may have played a part in that is . gut-wrenching.' Both DJs declared they would be happy to help with any investigation by Scotland Yard. However, Britain's Crown Prosecution . Service said earlier this month that there was no evidence to support a . manslaughter charge. The network said that while the . couple's show, Hot 30, had been axed, the company was looking at them . 'returning to work when the time is right in roles that make full use of . their talents'. Now Mr Christian has made his first . appearance in the wake of the scandal, continuing with his announcements . without any reference to past events. Mr Rhys Holleran, the company's chief executive officer, said: 'We are happy to have Michael back on air. 'We have always supported our talent returning to work when appropriate and today marks that occasion for MC. 'We look forward to welcoming Mel Greig back when the time is right.' Just when that will be remains unknown. She has not been seen in public, nor made any comment, since the tearful TV interview. William and Kate pictured leaving the King Edward VII hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness . Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.' The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'. In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy. Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life. 'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through. And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.' Mr Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected. 'Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened. 'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.' Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank.","Michael Christian's voice heard on his radio station, Melbourne's .

Tiffany Jones, 33, filmed the entire incident in San Bernardino County, California, narrating over footage of the helicopter overhead. She said it made several low passes to 'scare' her before the pilot eventually landed. Scroll down for video . Flyover: The video opens with Tiffany Jones filming a helicopter she claims has been circling her . Questioned: Finally the helicopter lands and an unidentified Sheriff's office officer walks towards her while leaving the blades rotating . Critics say the video reveals a clear case of police harassment and a waste of police manpower - costing up to $1,000. The incident happened on January 24, well before the manhunt for Christopher Dorner spurred police searches across the state. An unidentified deputy from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office then approaches her, asking her name and for her purpose in the area. 'Just exploring and picking up rocks,' she tells him. He then calls in her name and date of birth over the radio explaining to her only that 'We're investigating something right now.' After police headquarters responds to his background check, he asks if Jones has any weapons. Call in: The officer proceeds to run a background check on her without offering a reason .

After finding no reason to detain her and nothing illegal in her possession, the officer finally goes back to her helicopter telling her to 'have a good one.' Commenting at InfoWars, writer Paul Joseph Watson speculates that it costs 'well $2,000 dollars an hour to fuel a . police helicopter.

Anti-animal cruelty charity Peta is offering a reward of up to £1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the culprit. Around 40 cooked cocktail sausages embedded with up to ten one-inch long metal nails have been found and could be lethal for any animal attempting to eat them. Lethal: Sausages embedded with metal nails have been found in a park popular with dog walkers in Wales . Police in Abergavenny, South Wales, have warned dog walkers to be vigilant after the sausages were discovered on playing fields popular with the pet owners. Peta spokesman Ben Williamson said: 'It is imperative that any community faced with such horrific abuse of animals take measures to find the culprit or culprits and stop the violence. 'Animal abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on whoever is available to them, human or non-human.' Vet Ben Hynes said he was 'shocked and appalled' after being shown some of the potentially deadly sausages. He added: 'Had it not been for these extremely observant people out walking their own dogs, we could have easily seen a spate of dogs facing a slow, but certain death.

He said: 'My dog, which was on a lead, started to sniff at a sausage on the ground, but I immediately pulled him back when I saw something shining back at me. 'On closer inspection I realised that it had about nine or ten nails in it and thought that this was no coincidence. 'I looked around and found a lot more of these sausages - I must have collected close to 40. I have been extra diligent while out walking my dogs since.'

Chuck Hagel, President Barack Obama's nominee for Defense Secretary, has hit back at critics of his national security record during a heated Senate hearing this morning. Senior Republicans - who are members of his own party and were once his colleagues when he served as a Nebraska senator - accused him of seeking to appease America's enemies. His critics have sought to portray Hagel, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, as a soft on Iran and anti-Israel, pointing to past comments that Hagel's supporters say were taken out of context or distorted. In his opening remarks, Hagel said all options must be on the table . to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon - language used to . suggest the possibility of a nuclear strike. Scroll down to watch excerpts from the hearing . Battered: Chuck Hagel, President Barack Obama's nominee for Defense Secretary, has had hit back at accusations he favors appeasement as military policy . Critics: Sen James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, launched the opening salvo of attacks on Hagel with his comment about 'appeasement' 'My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment,' he said. However, he later referred to Iran's . government as 'elected and legitimate' - even though President Obama has . criticized elections there and questioned their fairness. Although most observers expect Hagel will eventually be confirmed, at least three Republican panel members, including James Inhofe, the party's leader on the Armed Services Committee, have said they did not support his nomination. Even before Hagel started speaking, Inhofe spelled out his objections, calling him 'the wrong person to lead the Pentagon at this perilous and consequential time.' 'Senator Hagel's record is deeply troubling and out of the mainstream. Too often it seems he is willing to subscribe to a worldwide view that is predicated on appeasing our adversaries while shunning our friends,' said Inhofe. Hagel, speaking publicly for the first time since the attacks against his nomination began, sought to set the record straight, assuring the panel that he backed U.S. policies of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and supporting a strong Israel. Allies: Hagel, who is expected to eventually be confirmed, appeared with two former senators - Republican John Warner of Virginia and Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia . 'No one individual vote, no one individual quote, no one individual statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record,' Hagel said at his confirmation hearing. 'My overall world view has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world.' 'Senator Hagel's record is deeply . troubling and out of the mainstream. Too often it seems he is willing to . subscribe to a worldwide view that is predicated on appeasing our . adversaries while shunning our friends.' Sen James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma . Committee chairman Carl Levin said his concerns, especially over Hagel's past comments about unilateral sanctions on Iran, had been addressed. 'Senator Hagel's reassurance to me... that he supports the Obama administration's strong stance against Iran is significant,' Levin said. Hagel hit a potential landmine when, responding to a question from Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss, he said that Iran's government both elected and legitimate. Hagel was reponding to a question about why he voted against declaring the Iranian Republican Guard a terrorist organization when he explained that the U.S. had never before given that designation to a wing of a 'legitimate' government . 'When I say legitimate, it doesn't mean we disagree with Iran, but it is a member of the United Nations, almost all of our governments have embassies in Iran, so that's why I note an elected, legitimate government,' he said. President Obama himself has questioned the fairness of elections in Iran. The nation's Islamic leaders have the power to disqualify any candidates on religious grounds and brutal tactics have been used in the past to suppress protests. Freedom House, a nonpartisan group that monitors elections and democracy around the world, has said: 'Iran is not an electoral democracy.' Hagle later 'clarified' his statement, saying he meant to say that the Iranian government is 'recognized.' Another member of Obama's second-term national security team, Senator John Kerry, sailed through his nomination hearing before receiving the Senate's overwhelming support on Tuesday. But Hagel, who broke with his Republican party over the Iraq War, found a much more confrontational panel. Beyond tough questioning on Israel and Iran, he was also was grilled on his view of the Pentagon budget - Hagel is known as an advocate for tighter spending controls. THE LONE REPUBLICAN . In the entire Senate, which would vote on Hagel if he is cleared by the committee, only one of the 45 Republicans - Mississippi's Thad Cochran - has said he backs Hagel. Hagel, backed by the White House and Pentagon, has been on a charm offensive to win over recalcitrant senators since Obama nominated him this month to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Hagel held one-on-one meetings with 53 senators before his hearing. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, said on Tuesday she had spoken with Hagel for 90 minutes and been satisfied on several issues, but stopped short of endorsing him. Lone supporter: The only Republican senator who has pledged to vote for Hagel is Thad Cochran of Mississippi . 'We had a good discussion, but it's obvious that we have very different views on some fundamental issues,' she said. Hagel also detailed his views in 112 pages of written responses to wide-ranging questions submitted by lawmakers. In them, he said that if confirmed as the next defense secretary, he would ensure that the military is prepared to strike Iran if necessary but stressed the need to be 'cautious and certain' when contemplating the use of force. Hagel also voiced support for a steady U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan, pledged to ensure equal treatment for women and gays in the military and assured the committee that the United States would maintain an 'unshakeable' commitment to Israel's security. 'I will ensure our friend and ally Israel maintains its qualitative military edge in the region,' he said. Most observers expect Hagel will be confirmed by the committee, even if he the vote breaks along party lines at 14 Democrats to 12 Republicans. Democrats control 55 seats in the full Senate and can approve Hagel with no Republican support, but they will need some backing from Hagel's party to overcome procedural hurdles that could stop the nomination.","Critics say Hagel is anti-Israel, weak on Iran and wants to cut the military .

In a sombering interview Kyle, who has just launched his show in America, said this Christmas was a difficult time as he watched children Alice, nine, Ava, seven, Harry, three and 22-year-old daughter Hattie from a previous relationship, open presents. Former gambling addict Kyle admitted he thought it would be the last year he would be able to be with his family - a sobering thought for the chat show host. Terrifying: Jeremy Kyle has revealed he thought he would die after being diagnosed with testicular cancer and said the phone call to his wife Carla (pictured) was the hardest of his life . 'It has been the hardest two months of my life': Jeremy revealed his battle with cancer left him fearful over his future . Further tests revealed that the cancer had not spread to other parts of his body, but he was ordered to undergo chemotherapy as a precaution, which he described as 'like having a permanent migraine' and as if he had been 'shot in every limb'. Kyle, who launched his show in the US in 2011, returned to filming for his ITV show in Manchester to a standing ovation. Jeremy told The Daily Mirror: 'It has been the hardest two months of my life. I have had absolutely amazing support. Thank you all – it is overwhelming really. Devoted: Jeremy said his wife of ten years Carla has been an incredible support . 'And just so you know, I only have one testicle left. But I’ve got a false one and it only cost £289.99!' Visibly shaken Kyle wiped away tears as the audience applauded his return to the studio where he interviewed Amy Winehouse’s ex Blake Fielder-Civil on his relationship with the singer. Jeremy said he is grateful that he has survived his terrifying cancer battle and added although he was paranoid everyone will be looking at his trousers, he would rather have a prosthetic testicle than not be around to see his four children grow up. Testicular cancer usually affects men aged between 15 and 44. The most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in the testicles, though others include a 'heaviness' or dull ache in the scrotum. It is relatively uncommon, accounting for just one per cent of all cancers in men, and unusual in that it tends to affect younger men. Around 2,090 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer every year in Britain. White men are five times more likely to develop it than black men. It is not understood why. The number of cases of testicular cancer in Britain has doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons are not known. Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable forms of the disease. More than 95 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer will be completely cured, and there is an 80 per cent survival rate even when it spreads to other tissue. Deaths are relatively rare, with around 70 men dying from it in Britain each year. Treatment includes chemotherapy and the surgical removal of the affected testicle, which should not affect fertility or the ability to have sex as the other testicle increases sperm production.","Admitted he put off going to doctors after discovering a lump .

A prehistoric Transylvanian reptile which could walk on all fours or take to the skies on three metre wings has been unearthed by scientists. The newly discovered pterorsaur, which is 68million years old, was unearthed in Romania's Transylvanian Basin. The creature, named Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis, had a long neck and beak and could fold up its huge wings when it needed to walk on all fours. Preserved elements of Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis re-assembled as found in partial articulation: The 68million year old creature walked on all fours and had a wing span of three metres, scientists believe . Dr Darren Naish, from the University of Southampton, said: 'Eurazhdarcho belong to a group of pterosaurs called the azhdarchids. 'These were long-necked, long-beaked pterosaurs whose wings were strongly adapted for a soaring lifestyle. 'Several features of their wing and hind limb bones show that they could fold their wings up and walk on all fours when needed. 'With a three-metre wingspan, Eurazhdarcho would have been large, but not gigantic. 'This is true of many of the animals so far discovered in Romania; they were often unusually small compared to their relatives elsewhere.' Cervical vertebrae three and four in articulation, showing the presence of circular bitemarks (arrows): The newly discovered pterorsaur was unearthed in Romania's Transylvanian Basin . The discovery is the most complete example of an azhdarchid found in Europe so far and it supports a long-argued theory about the behaviour of these types of creatures. Dr Gareth Dyke, Senior Lecturer in Vertebrate Palaeontology, based at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton said: 'Experts have argued for years over the lifestyle and behaviour of azhdarchids. 'It has been suggested that they grabbed prey from the water while in flight, that they patrolled wetlands and hunted in a heron or stork-like fashion, or that they were like gigantic sandpipers, hunting by pushing their long bills into mud. 'One of the newest ideas is that azhdarchids walked through forests, plains and other places in search of small animal prey. 'Eurazhdarcho supports this view of azhdarchids, since these fossils come from an inland, continental environment where there were forests and plains as well as large, meandering rivers and swampy regions.' More vertebrae: The discovery is the most complete . example of an azhdarchid found in Europe so far and it supports a . long-argued theory about the behaviour of these types of creatures . Where the bones were found: The star on this map of Romania highlights the area in the Transylvanian basin where the researchers found the fossilised remains . Fossils from the region show that there were several places where both giant azhdarchids and small azhdarchids lived side by side. Eurazhdarcho's discovery indicates that there were many different animals hunting different prey in the region at the same time, demonstrating a much more complicated picture of the Late Cretaceous world than first thought, the researchers said. Their findings were reported in the open-access journal PLoS ONE.","The 68million-year-old pterosaur remains were discovered in Romania's Transylvanian basin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:30 EST, 23 May 2012 . A white supremacist has been convicted in a 2004 bombing that injured a black city official in suburban Phoenix, but his identical twin brother was acquitted. The federal jury Friday stopped short of finding Dennis Mahon guilty of a hate crime among his three other charges. The 61-year-old twins from Illinois were on trial for six weeks as dramatic testimony came from the bombing victim and a female government informant dubbed a 'trailer park Mata Hari' by defense attorneys. Split sentence: Daniel Mahon (left) was acquitted of his one charge while his twin brother Dennis Mahon (right) was found guilty on three charges for a 2004 bombing . The jury found Dennis Mahon guilty of three charges in the bombing but found Daniel Mahon, also a white supremacist, not guilty of the one charge he faced: conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosives. The verdict came nearly eight years to the day since the Feb. 26, 2004, bombing that injured Don Logan, who is black and was Scottsdale's diversity director at the time. Logan was hospitalized for three days and needed four surgeries on his hand and arm. The bombing also injured a secretary. Logan told The Associated Press that the verdict was bittersweet for him. 'It's not illegal to be a racist but it is illegal to act upon that racism, especially when you injure people,' he said. 'This, to me, is a hallmark case that reached that racial discord, that hate.' Dennis Mahon was found guilty of conspiracy to damage buildings and property by means of explosives; of malicious damage of a building by means of explosives; and distribution of information related to explosives. 'Trailer park Mata Hari': A courtroom sketch shows the ex-stripper-turned federal informant Rebecca Williams, 41, who wore revealing clothes and sent racy photos to gain Dennis Mahon and his brother's trust . He faces between seven and 100 years in prison at his May 22 sentencing. Both brothers had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charges. During the trial, prosecutors argued that the Mahon brothers bombed Logan on behalf of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, which they say encourages members to act as 'lone wolves' and commit violence against non-whites and the government. Prosecutors played surveillance tapes of the brothers referring to Logan in racial slurs and a voicemail that Dennis Mahon left at the diversity office just months before the bombing in which he angrily said: 'The white Aryan resistance is growing in Scottsdale. There's a few white people who are standing up.' Defense attorneys said that someone working for the city of Scottsdale was a likelier candidate because Logan's job made him unpopular. They also heavily criticized the use of 41-year-old Rebecca Williams as an informant, giving her the 'trailer park Mata Hari' nickname — a reference to the Dutch exotic dancer who was convicted of working as a spy for Germany during World War I. Victim: Don Logan, Scottsdale's diversity director at the time, was injured along with a secretary when the bomb detonated in his hands but was decided as not a hate crime . Williams, an attractive ex-stripper herself, was recruited by the feds to implicate the twin brothers. She moved into the same Oklahoma campground with a government-issued trailer, talked like a separatist and sent them racy photos of herself to win over the men's confidence over a five-year period. As the trial of Dennis and Daniel Mahon drew to a close, defense attorneys argued that the government's conduct was outrageous and that her actions amounted to sexual entrapment. The real Mata Hari: The Dutch exotic dancer, whom Williams has been named after by the defense, was executed by France in 1917 for spying on Germany . But during closing arguments late Tuesday, prosecutor Michael Morrissey told the jury that the hiring of the informant - identified in court records as Rebecca 'Becca' Williams - was 'entirely permissible and necessary' to the investigation of the 61-year-olds. 'There was no use of sex to obtain evidence,' he said. Among the information Williams gathered from Dennis Mahon was him telling her that the bomb used on Logan was a 1-by-5-inch pipe bomb, a fact that investigators never released publicly and that prosecutors said proved that Mahon was guilty because only the bomber could have known it. The brothers are accused of sending a package bomb in 2004 that maimed Don Logan, a black man who was the diversity director for the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale at the time. Logan, 54, was hospitalized for three days after the bombing and needed four operations on his hand and arm. Morrissey said the Mahons were believers in 'racial terrorism and violence as a way to accomplish their goals.' Logan testified Friday, choking up as he recalled the chaos after the bomb went off in his hand and describing how he frantically ran down a hallway before kneeling down, hearing a secretary scream and looking down to see blood dripping on the carpet. 'I heard a pop that sounded like a gunshot and everything slowed down,' he said. Logan said that every time he's been in court he tried to make eye contact with the Mahons, but that they never would look at him. But he noticed that they were watching him with intensity when he re-enacted the bombing during testimony. Scene: Dennis and Daniel Mahon were arrested at their home in David Junction, Illinois (pictured) in 2009, on separate charges . 'It was almost like they were getting off on me sharing that moment when they sent their prized gift and it detonated,' he said. Logan worked personally with the Justice Department to have prosecutors seek a hate-crime finding from jurors, which would have required whatever prison term Mahon gets to be longer. He said that when he speaks to U.S. District Judge David Campbell at the sentencing, he'll ask that Mahon spend the rest of his life behind bars. 'Dennis Mahon is a danger to any community, and to me, he doesn't deserve to be out,' Logan said. Williams, who is 20 years younger than the Mahons, said agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recruited her after they worked with her brother, himself an informant, to infiltrate the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. At the time, Williams testified, she was about to be evicted from her trailer and needed the money. She received a total of $45,000, including expenses, and said she was promised $100,000 upon the Mahons' conviction. On the move: The Mahon brothers were living in Tempe in the months before the 2004 bombing, but relocated to Catoosa, where the Feds sent their informant . Investigators had her pose as a separatist who was fleeing an arrest warrant and was interested in learning about Aryan resistance and how to make a bomb so she could use one on a child molester she knew. The story was a fabrication designed to get the brothers to open up about the Scottsdale bombing. Williams also gave the Mahons at least two racy photos — one that showed her in a black leather vest, fishnet stockings, chaps and a Confederate flag bikini bottom, along with a note that read: 'Thought you'd love the butt shot.' Another photo showed her in a white bikini top, a grenade hanging between her breasts, as she posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika. Williams testified last month, wearing a gray pantsuit with a dress shirt buttoned up to her neck and black high heels, her long, dark hair pinned up. Under tense cross-examination, she acknowledged previously being an exotic dancer and became bashful when asked whether she knows how to use her body around men. During closing arguments, defense attorney Deborah Williams accused the government of acting like a 'pimp' to get the Mahons talking. 'What you have in Dennis Mahon is a loud-mouth — sometimes drunk ... and looking for the attentions of a younger woman who throws herself at him, and she works him like she once worked a pole,' Deborah Williams said. 'And of course he fell for it.' The defense attorney also referred to footage of the informant covering up a video camera with a towel after a naked Dennis Mahon got into her hotel bed. Prosecutors said Rebecca Williams gave him a foot rub; the defense attorney said that was ridiculous. 'The whole investigation was scripted around sex, sex and more sex, from the grenade between the breasts to the sleeping with him,' Deborah Williams said. Judge David Campbell urged jurors to exercise particular caution when considering Williams' testimony, since she was paid for her involvement. The Mahons, who were living in the Phoenix area at the time of the bombing, but left days afterward and were arrested in 2009 in Davis Junction, Illinois, are charged with various explosives-related offenses, including conspiracy to damage buildings and property.","Dennis Mahon faces seven to 100 years in prison after found guilty of three charges .

The unnamed teenager was initially brought before the courts when the parents of the 'victim', 13, brought child abuse charges (file picture) A German teenager was placed on a sex offender's register alongside paedophiles, rapists and stalkers for giving his girlfriend a love bite. Now the highest court in the land - one usually devoted to issues like terrorism and human rights - must decide whether he belongs on it. The boy, 14, was also ordered to give a sample of his DNA to a court to be filed alongside his personal details, including school, friends and the youth club where he hangs out. Germany's highest court has now stepped in following an outcry over the ruthless treatment of a boy whose 'crime' is seen by most as a clumsy experiment in lovemaking. The DNA probe has been halted while the judges of the Constitutional Court probe the case and decide whether it is valid. According to media reports, the boy from the eastern state of Thuringia was brought before a court 15 months ago when the parents of his 'victim' - a 13-year-old female classmate - brought child abuse charges after their daughter came home with the passion marker on her neck. A police report read out to the Arnstadt Juvenile Court said: 'He kissed the girl in such a way that a love bite of clearly visible dimensions could be seen.' The boy was admonished by judges in the case for committing 'child sex abuse' and, as well as logging him on to the pervert register, he was ordered to undergo 60 hours of community service. The court has a reputation in Germany for fierce sentencing for juveniles. Four months later a higher court imposed the DNA order to be saved in the Federal Criminal Police Office 'relapse-prone offenders' file. On Friday, following an outcry, the highest court in Germany suspended the DNA order and will give its verdict within six months. The lawyer for the boy said in a submission to judges: 'From his point of view, the result of this love bite came out of mutual affection.' Judges at Germany's Constitutional Court have halted an order for the boy's DNA and will decide whether he should remain on the register .","The parents of the 'victim', 13, brought child abuse charges in 2011 .

He begged his wife not to return him there before he died during his final visit . A widow has condemned the 'horrific' treatment of her husband in an NHS hospital where he was left crying in wet nappies. Grandfather Andrew Beveridge, 80, who was suffering from leukaemia, was forced to wash in a basin when he was first arrived as the showers were not working. During his second stay he contracted staphylococcus and septicemia after being put in an open ward. Conditions were so bad he begged his wife Janet not to make him go back a third time during which he contracted a chest infection and died last month. Mrs Beveridge, 73, said her sobbing husband was left alone in wet nappies on more than one occasion. She said: 'Andrew used a sheath so that he didn't have to go to the toilet and they didn't have his size in the hospital. 'I packed some for him but nurses failed to do what they were supposed to and I found him crying in wet nappies on two separate occasions. 'It's the indignity of all these little things that upsets me.' Mrs Beveridge said she had to clean up another patient's urine in another care failure at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. She said: 'When Andrew was taken into hospital he felt unwell and was told he could lie down on a bed.

Mrs Beveridge also told how she had to pester staff to perform an X-ray on her husband after noticing that his stomach had become swollen. She said: 'I was really worried about it and said to one of the nurses but she told me not to worry about it. 'My sister had the same thing before she died two years ago so I was concerned about it and asked them to do an X-ray. 'I spoke to Andrew later that evening and he told me he had an X-ray.' It was the last conversation Janet had with her husband who died in the early hours of January 12. Janet said the indignities continued . after his death when she went to the hospital to collect his belongings . and was told to choose from a number of unmarked brown envelopes. She said: 'There were carrier bags full of other people's belongings lying on the floor and my daughter was horrified. 'There were no names on any of the envelopes and it was a case of 'take your pick'. 'My husband's expensive Rotary watch was in one of the envelopes and anyone could have taken it.' When daughter Elaine noticed her father's rings were missing from the envelope she was told they were probably still on his body and they would have to wait two hours until the mortuary opened. Janet said: 'I know that it was his time but it shouldn't have been the way it was. 'I'm having a meeting with NHS Fife but I don't know what will happen. I expect they will have their excuses ready. I'm just hoping that no other patients have to go through what we have.

"By . Chris Brooke . Created 10:23 AM on 24th November 2011 . The mystery of the dog stolen from Sir Ian Botham’s family home has taken a dramatic turn with the arrest of his son’s estranged wife. Sarah-Jayne Botham, 37, was arrested by police on suspicion of stealing Woody the spaniel and she has been released on bail pending further inquiries. The pet, belonging to Liam Botham’s fiancée Emma Sayle, vanished last Sunday shortly after being seen with Mrs Botham outside her home, which is owned by the cricket legend. They were said to have been captured on CCTV together and a short time later Mrs Botham drove off in her car. Missing: Woody disappeared from a private courtyard at former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham's home in Ravensworth, North Yorkshire . The mother-of-three has strenuously denied taking the dog or having any idea where he is. All the CCTV evidence has been handed . over to North Yorkshire Police by former rugby player Liam Botham, 34, . and the couple are desperate to find the 15-month-old sprocker spaniel – . a cross between a springer and a cocker. After discussing the investigation . with police Mr Botham increased the reward for finding Woody to £3,000 . ‘to show we are not messing around.’ ‘Woody has never run off in his life,’ said Mr Botham. Despite the arrest there have been no further developments in finding Woody. A police spokeswoman said a . 37-year-old local woman was arrested at 10pm on Thursday night in . connection with the incident. She was arrested in the neighbouring . County Durham area and later released on bail. Mrs Botham was not available for comment yesterday. Woody spends most of his time living . with Miss Sayle, 33, and Mr Botham in south-west London. But he has . three children from his 14-year marriage and regularly spends time . staying with his parents. His ex-wife still lives in the former . marital home in the grounds of Sir Ian’s property at Ravensworth, North . Yorkshire. However, they are in the final throes of an acrimonious . divorce and the decree absolute is due soon. Search: Sir Ian Botham and his son Liam, who has offered a £2,500 reward for Woody's safe return . Miss Sayle, whose company Killing .

A suburban Dallas mother charged in a bizarre vandalism prank faces up to two years in prison and a hefty fine after she allegedly helped some middle . school students prank a classmate's slumber party last year. Tara Mauney, 41, was indicted Thursday . She allegedly purchased 108 rolls of toilet paper for the caper and lead the group of students to put raw chicken in the mailbox, a toilet on the front lawn and graffiti on the home, causing $6,000 worth of damage. The pranksters were eventually spotted by the girls at the slumber party, who chased them to Mauney's home. At the time, her attorneys denied the charges against her, and claimed that she was only hosting a sleepover party for a group of girls at her home. If convicted, Mauney faces up to 2 years in jail and a $10,000 fine, according to The Dallas Morning News. None of the children were charged. According to an affidavit obtained by MailOnline, officers arrived at Jodie Rishel's home early July 25 to find the entire residence covered in toilet paper. They found raw chicken stuffed inside the mailbox and a toilet placed in the center of the driveway in front of the home with the words 'suck it' written in permanent marker on it. '[The Officer] also observed that written on the light colored exterior stucco walls of the home, in the covered drive area, were numerous writings, such as ""whore house"", ""CMS jokes"", ""suck it"", and ""sluts"" in black ""sharpie"" style ink.

Mauney, who the girls recognized from school functions, allegedly stopped outside of her home and asked the girls 'Could I help you?' 'You can clean up the mess you just made,' one of the girls responded, according to police. Police were called as well as the girls parents, which is when one of the girls' mothers remembered that she had seen Mauney shopping at the local Walmart at 10:30 pm that evening, with eight middle school aged children. Security footage of the store revealed Mauney 'chaperoning' a group of three boys and five girls posing for a photograph inside the store before they purchased three 36-roll packages of toilet paper.

When reached Monday by the Star-Telegram, Mauney declined to comment other than to say that 'the kids have retracted some statements.' Her attorney, Brian Willett, says that Mauney denies the charges and is prepared to take a polygraph test. 'She was never at that place,' Mr Willett said Monday.

NBA star Eddy Curry's young son - the lone witness in the savage murder of his mother and baby sister - identified their killer by name before police arrived, his grandmother testified today. Nova Henry, 24, and her 10-month-old daughter Ava were found dead in her Chicago apartment on January 24, 2009. They had been shot multiple times. Noah Henry, 3, who was found hiding under a blanket on a couch in the living room, had witnessed the shooting, but was not injured.

Both Noah and Ava were fathered by Curry, 30, a former Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks star who used to date Ms Henry. Testifying in court yesterday, Noah and Ava's grandmother, Yolan Henry, said that police had not yet arrived at the home when she asked the boy who 'hurt' his mother. She said: 'He turned around and . looked at me and said, ""Frederick."" He repeated, ""Frederick did it."" Then he put his finger to his lips and said, ""Shhh,""' according to the Chicago Tribune. Prosecutors say that 'Frederick' refers to the suspect, Frederick Goings, a Chicago attorney now on trial for the murder. On trial: Frederick Goings was reportedly identified as the killer by three-year-old Noah . Goings had represented Henry in a 2006 paternity case involving Curry, and the two had later begun a romantic relationship, which Ms Henry tried to end before the murder. Yolan Henry made the horrific discovery hours after the shooting while visiting Ms Henry's home with her boyfriend, Reginald Carter. Carter testified yesterday that Noah was sound asleep, and both his hands and his feet were covered in dried blood. Goings was arrested at a Comfort Inn in Indiana shortly after the bodies were found. In his car, police found a bullet that matched the gun used to kill Nova Henry and and Ava Curry-Henry, the Tribune reported. He was also spotted swimming in the motel pool without a bathing suit on, and scrubbing at his fingernails, which prosecutors said is an indication he was trying to wash away evidence. But Goings' legal team claims that there is no physical evidence that places their client at Ms Henry's home at the time of the murder.

A former hand surgeon who is no stranger to legal battles, is in trouble again after he allegedly grabbed a flight attendant by the neck during a recent transatlantic flight. Michael Glyn Brown, of Houston, Texas, is accused of making 'rude sexual comments' to the flight attendant as he grabbed her during a January 2 flight from London to Miami. The flight attendant told authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him a some food. Allegations: Michael Glyn Brown, pictured in court in 2011, is accused of making 'rude sexual comments' to the flight attendant as he grabbed her during a January 2 flight from London to Miami . A criminal complaint obtained by the Houston Chronicle said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped his hands around her neck and began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a strong woman?' When another flight attendant came over, the complaint stated that Brown grabbed her also and held them by his forearms. The Chronicle reported that Brown then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' things he wanted to do to the women. Eventually, the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into custody. Brown's New York City-based attorney, Robert Hantman, told MailOnline that the stress of his most recent divorce has Brown 'distressed and distraught' because he cannot see his children. Mr Hantman said that Brown had taken a . sleep aid called Restoril, which lists sleepwalking as a side effect. He said that he awoke with no knowledge of the episode. Not-so friendly skies: Brown was arrested after the plane landed at Miami International Airport, pictured . He said: '[Brown] doesn't remember what happened but is obviously apologetic.' Brown reportedly told investigators after the incident that he 'may have touched a flight attendant but not in a violent or inappropriate way,' according to the complaint. Two years ago, Brown went to trial accused of throwing a humanitarian award and two heavy vases at his fourth ex-wife Rachel Brown in August 2010, and was found not guilty. The early morning fight ended with Michael Brown being arrested for domestic violence at his home in the Memorial area of Houston, Texas. Before police arrived, Brown had to be 'taken down' by his own bodyguard after allegedly twisting his wife's arm behind her back, Assistant Harris County District Attorney Nathan Hennigan said at the time. Last year, Brown was the subject of a lawsuit involving a woman using the pseudonym Chris Stevens, who claims to be Brown's former lover, said he lied about his health and gave her vaginal and anal herpes during their affair. The suit said that in December 2011, the woman found out she had vaginal and anal herpes. She got the latter because Brown refused to wear a condom and 'forcibly had anal sex with the plaintiff,' the suit alleged. Brown's carpal tunnel clinic, the Brown Hand Center, is well-known in Houston for TV commercials in which Brown appears with his now ex-wife Rachel Brown and several children. The clinic, which also has locations in Phoenix, Dallas, Austin and Las Vegas, employs several surgeons. The business remains open despite Brown's medical license being revoked after he tested positive for cocaine in 2006, but he is remains at the helm of the operation. Ex-wife: Rachel Brown, the ex-wife of Michael Brown, is now romantically linked to baseball player Jeff Bagwell . Business: Brown's carpal tunnel clinic, the Brown Hand Center, which also has locations in Phoenix, Dallas, Austin and Las Vegas, has about 400 staffmembers . Mr Hantman confirmed that Brown recently . filed for bankruptcy to give himself some 'breathing room' from legal . fees stemming from the divorce battle with his fourth wife. He said that his client will then be free to 'move forward and provide the cures for many people with carpal tunnel and improve people’s lives.' Mr Hantman added: 'He just wants to see his children, be fair with his wife and move on with his life.' Since the divorce, Rachel Brown has been romantically linked to former Houston Astros star Jeff Bagwell.","Criminal complaint alleges that former doctor 'choked' and made 'rude sexual comments' during January 2 London-Miami flight .

A narcotics detective watched proudly this weekend as his ten-year-old daughter won her fourth-grade science fair for an experiment on cocaine. Emma Bartelt's project 'Drug Sniffing Dogs' featured an ounce of powder cocaine (with a street value of $1,300) and three police dogs along with the input of her father, Detective Douglas Bartelt. Her imaginative work earned Emma first place on Saturday at the science fair at Coral Gables Preparatory Academy in Miami, Florida. Experimental: Miami Detective Douglas Bartelt with retired drug-sniffing dog Franky who was used in his daughter's school science experiment involving cocaine . Winning: The ten-year-old's science project was based on the work that her father does as a narcotics detective . The experiment was conducted at a police training center by Detective Bartelt while  ten-year-old Emma wrote down the results. She never touched the drugs at any point during the process. It worked by placing an ounce of cocaine inside a metal box and hiding the box inside a room, according to the Miami Herald. The next step was to release one a K-9 into the room and begin timing -  then stop the clock when the dog sniffed out the drugs. After carrying out the experiment a number of times and using a second room, the average time that it took the dog to find cocaine was calculated. The experiment was tried with three different dogs to see which one was fastest -  Roger, a springer spaniel; Levi, a golden retriever or Franky, a retired brown Labrador. Hard stuff: The science experiment involved an ounce of cocaine which is used in training police dogs (stock image) Emma told the Herald that the project was her idea 'because I wanted to do my dad’s job'. The school district reportedly said that cocaine is not a banned material when it comes to science fair experiments. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from district spokesman John Schuster. Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Detective Aida Fina-Milian told MailOnline that Detective Bartelt's supervisor had approved the use of police facilities for the experiment but she had few other details.

Competitor: Flacco completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three first-half touchdowns, earning Super Bowl MVP honors . It was a tender moment as Flacco was embraced by guard Marshal Yanda, who yelled to the Super Bowl MVP: 'Holy s***, huh?' Flacco emphatically responded: 'F***ing Awesome!' The verbal vulgarity may grab the attention of the Federal Communications Commission, which has had trouble with Super Bowl broadcasts in the past. The FCC would not comment on the Flacco situation when reached by MailOnline today. Last year, the NFL apologized after singer M.I.A. gave cameras the middle finger during Madonna's halftime show. But none would be as notorious as Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during the big game in 2004. An FCC fine against CBS was later thrown out in court nearly eight years later. Win: Flacco pumps his fist as he walks off the field with his wife Dana after Super Bowl . Swearing: A live mic caught Yanda and Flacco in a profane exchange as confetti rained down on the field . Capping a perfect postseason, the . unassuming and unheralded Flacco completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards . and three first-half touchdowns, earning Super Bowl MVP honors. In post-game interviews, Flacco set aside any questions about just how good he is and whether he belongs in the conversation about the league's best quarterbacks, becoming only the sixth in 47 Super Bowls to throw for three scores in a first half. 'Now they're gonna have to talk about Joe Flacco,' center Matt Birk said. 'Joe's a stud. He showed it tonight.' MVP: Flacco holds up the Lombardi Trophy during the post-game ceremony at the Superdome . The admittedly mild-mannered guy, who played his college football far from the spotlight at Delaware, wrapped up Baltimore's four-game run to the title with a record-equaling 11 touchdown passes and zero interceptions, going 73 of 126 for 1,140 yards. But Flacco's job in the second half Sunday was more about being safe than spectacular. He had helped Baltimore take a 21-6 . halftime lead, and it grew to 28-6 when Jones returned the second-half . kickoff a Super Bowl-record 108 yards. That's when things got strange. First, the lights inside the Superdome cut out, delaying action for more than a half-hour. And when play resumed, San Francisco quickly scored 17 consecutive points to make things interesting. The Ravens held on down the stretch. Two short field goals by rookie Justin Tucker padded the lead, and the . Ray Lewis-led defense stopped the 49ers on a fourth-and-goal at the 5 . with under 2 minutes left. 'I was sitting there thinking, ""There's no way. There's no way we stop them here,""' Flacco said. 'But we did.' Neither Flacco nor his team appeared to be ready to take on all comers as the regular season concluded. After all, the Ravens lost four of their final five games to stumble into the playoffs. And Flacco, a fifth-year pro, . finished only 12th in the 32-team NFL in passer rating at a merely . passable 87.7 - way behind league leader Aaron Rodgers' 108.0 - while . compiling 22 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. Champs: Flacco congratulates teammate Ray Lewis, who has announced he would retire after the Super Bowl . Middle-of-the-pack, to say the least. But he and his team definitely did shine when the results mattered most. 'I tell you what: We don't make it easy,' said Flacco, who set an NFL quarterback record by leading his team to playoff wins in each of his first five seasons. He is 9-4 overall in the postseason, but was 0-2 in AFC championship games until this year. And now his contract is up. He could wind up with one of the most lucrative deals in NFL history, perhaps commanding somewhere in the neighborhood of $20million a year.

A lawsuit filed today has alleged that the reason a veteran police officer committed suicide was because he was forced to have sex with a female boss in order not to be punished by workload and scheduling. Officer Matthew Schindler, 39, shot himself on February 13 last year after pulling onto the side of the Long Island Expressway, New York on his way home from work.

Allegations: Gina Schlinder has filed a lawsuit that claims that her husband Matthew (right) committed suicide last year because he was under pressure for sex from his female boss . According to the suit, filed at Queens Supreme Court, the highway officer was 'made to understand that he would suffer tangible detriment in his job, job assignments, work conditions and future prospects if he did not submit to the sexual advances and demands...', according to the New York Post. The widow, who was left to care for the couple's five-year-old twin girls after her husband died, is suing the NYPD and the Sgt Hertzel. She is seeking unspecified damages. Mrs Schindler alleges that her husband had an affair with the woman from March 2011 until the time of his death. Officer Schindler reportedly tried to put an end to the relationship on February 13, saying he would kill himself over the guilt.

The married mother-of-two told U-T San Diego that she returned to her classroom the day after the tragedy, feeling that it was important to comfort students who had followed every step of her adventure. Waiting for her at home was a letter from Christa McAuliffe, from New Hampshire, filled with excitement about her space voyage and wishing her love. McAuliffe's unique trip, where she had planned to teach American students from space, gained the space program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had an immediate rapport with the media. She beat 11,000 others to the opportunity. Part of the craze surrounding the 'citizen astronaut' was the reason why so many people watched the launch first-hand - including many school children who had followed the teachers' journey. Mrs McMillan said: 'It was important for me to be in the . classroom and to be able to deal with the students who were grieving.

In honour: A photograph showing non-offensive graffiti and personal messages left by construction workers and visitors at the site of One World Trade Center, much unlike what can be found inside the tower . Many of the anonymous messages use the N-word and women are frequently targeted on the provisional plywood bathrooms located on every fifth floor of the 1,776ft tower. ‘Lame n**** be queit (sic),’ reads one racist and misspelled remark recorded by the New York Daily News. ‘Woman (sic) don’t belong in construction! Maybe painting, that’s it,’  directed at female construction workers on the site, was replied to with: ‘Then who’s gonna **** us?’ Not only African Americans and women are subjected to the offensive comments, with one worker demanding Irish people to 'take a bath ya smelly f****’. One urinal welcomes builders with ‘None whites only’ written in capitals, whilst another urinal is marked with the contrary ‘Whites Only’. Disgrace: The offensive remarks were left on the walls of provisional toilets inside One World Trade Center, most written with black marker and believed to be the work of the builders on the site . ‘Most of it’s racial,’ an insider told NYDaily. ‘Most of it - I mean, there’s a lot of stuff with the N-word.

'We’re all supposed to be there as one, the whole 9/11 thing’ another worker told the newspaper. He said the graffiti ruins his sense of pride of working on the 1WTC, commonly known as Freedom Tower, saying it should not be on its walls. Shocking scribbles: The walls inside 1WTC are rife with sexist remarks and racist slurs including attacks on African American, Irish and Jewish people . One World Trade Center is at the heart of the complex to be built on the site of the two towers destroyed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Lower Manhattan, New York.

More than 150 potential jurors are packing a hotel ballroom for the rape trial of a former University of Montana quarterback, as attorneys attempt to seat an impartial panel in a town where Griz football is king. Jury selection got under way Friday in Missoula in the trial of Jordan Johnson, who is accused of raping an acquaintance while they watched a movie at her residence on Feb. 4, 2012. Johnson says the sex was consensual. Friday's proceedings took place in the Holiday Inn after District Judge Karen Townsend said no courtroom was large enough to hold the number of potential jurors called. Former University of Montana quarterback Jordan Johnson was charged with rape last July and his trial began on Friday February 8 with jury selection . Just weeks after the female student claimed she was raped by the quarterback, the coach enthusiastically welcomed him back to spring drills and . lauded his 'character and tremendous moral fiber. The woman's lawyer, Josh Van de . Wetering, quickly complained to the athletic department that the comment . left his client 'less than confident in the university's commitment to . protect her.' Since then, . the case has played out against a backdrop of NCAA and federal . investigations of the school athletic department and the manner in which . rape allegations are reported on campus, investigated by police, and . prosecuted by the Missoula County Attorney's Office. The situation has left some worried that the football program - while successful on the field - was out of control off it. Jordan Johnson, center, scrambles against Cal Poly during an NCAA college football game in Missoula, Montana . District Judge Karen Townsend initially called 400 potential jurors for the high-profile case. An affidavit supporting the rape charge said Johnson and the alleged victim had known each other since 2010 and decided to watch a movie at her house on Feb. 4, 2012. The woman told investigators Johnson held her down and forced her to have sex with him in her room despite her protests. Court records show the woman texted her roommate: 'Omg... I think I might have just gotten raped... he kept pushing and pushing and I said no but he wouldn't listen... I just wanna cry... Omg what do I do!' Johnson, in a motion to dismiss the case, said the woman had flirted with him the night before at a party and consented to sex the next night, even asking if he had a condom. The motion also claimed the case was filed by county prosecutors to send a message about their efforts to pursue rape cases. The Grizzlies football team, pictured, has been successful on the field. But this rape case has been played out against a backdrop of investigations of the school athletic department . 'The collateral damage to Jordan and his family is immeasurable,' attorney Kirsten Pabst wrote. The judge rejected the motion, saying the proper place to challenge the state's case was at trial. Concerns about the handling of sexual assault cases peaked in December 2011, when UM President Royce Engstrom ordered an outside investigation after two students reported being drugged and raped. Former Supreme Court Justice Diane Barz later said her investigation found nine alleged rapes or sexual assaults involving students had occurred between September 2010 and December 2011, including at least two that hadn't been reported. One led to former Montana football player Beau Donaldson pleading guilty to rape and being sentenced to 10 years in prison. Engstrom said in January the investigation 'indicated an association with patterns of behavior from a small number of student-athletes.' 'We will not tolerate the tarnishing of the proud tradition of Grizzly athletics,' he said at the time. Barz suggested training faculty and staff on how to handle and report sexual assault allegations and rewriting student and student-athlete conduct codes. The University of Montana President, Royce Engstrom, ordered an outside investigation after two students reported being drugged and raped in December 2011 . Just weeks later, the university came under more criticism after the dean of students notified a Saudi national about sexual assault and rape allegations made against him. The student fled the country before the alleged victims could file a police report. Johnson's case surfaced on March 9, when the female student obtained a temporary restraining order against him. He was briefly suspended from the football team then reinstated when a civil no-contact order replaced the restraining order. Three days after coach Robin Pflugrad welcomed Johnson back, Engstrom announced he was not renewing the contracts of the coach and athletic director Jim O'Day. Both were immediately relieved of their duties, without an explanation from Engstrom. The move came after a season when Montana advanced to the Football Championship Subdivision semifinal game. The Grizzlies have advanced to the national title game seven times since 1995, winning twice. The team's success came even as players and former players were arrested for drunken driving, assault and other charges. The university received a grant from the DOJ Office of Violence Against Women that provides it with training in mandatory education for students and for disciplinary boards, community response teams and campus law enforcement . 'I'm sure the president has been reviewing all the different things that have been going on for some time and just decided, both in leadership of the department and in leadership of the football program, it was time to make a change,' O'Day said when he was relieved of duty. Last April, the federal Department of Education announced it was investigating a complaint alleging the university discriminated against female students, faculty and staff by failing to address a sexually hostile environmental caused by its failure to appropriately respond to reports of sexual assault. Soon after, the U.S. Justice Department announced its investigation into the handling of rape investigations and prosecutions, and the school announced in May the NCAA had been investigating its athletic programs for undisclosed reasons. The Department of Education said Wednesday it had closed the discrimination complaint because the allegations were being addressed by the Department of Justice investigation. The Justice Department and NCAA investigations continue. The university received a grant from the DOJ Office of Violence Against Women that provides it with training in mandatory education for students and for disciplinary boards, community response teams and campus law enforcement, spokeswoman Peggy Kuhr said Thursday. The campus has seen a rash of departures. Charles Couture retired as dean of students, Jim Foley stepped down as vice president for external relations, and chief legal counsel David Aronofsky retired from his post but said he would continue to teach classes. Aronofsky issued a memo in late February on legal issues and recommendations for the university's handling of sexual assault reports. It urged UM employees to use caution in referring student-athletes to outside attorneys to avoid the appearance of seeking free or low-cost legal help, which would be a violation of NCAA rules. Foley had earlier told the Missoulian he met two football players at an attorney's office on a Sunday in the fall of 2011 after they were arrested by police trying to break up a loud party.

A graphic photograph of Jodi Arias' ex-boyfriend with his throat slashed open has caused hysterical reactions at her murder trial with one sobbing family member running from the courtroom. In a dramatic move that led the judge to pause the trial briefly on Wednesday, the prosecution attempted to show jurors a . large photo of Travis Alexander’s head, his throat slit from ear to ear. Several of Alexander’s family members . wept and left the Phoenix courtroom while Arias also broke down. The judge later denied a motion for a . mistrial from defense attorneys. Scroll down for video . The accused: Jodi Arias looks back at the courtroom during her murder trial on Wednesday in Arizona . Overwhelmed: Murder victim Travis Alexander's family and friends sob during the trial this week as graphic photos of his body were shown . The shock tactic by the prosecution came as the defense’ portion of Arias' murder . trial began this week. The 32-year-old faces the death penalty if her . pleas that she stabbed Alexander 27 times and shot him in self-defense . are not upheld. Prosecutor Juan Martinez revealed the grisly photo while questioning Lisa Daidone, who dated Alexander in 2007 during his on-off relationship with Arias. The defense had introduced an angry email that Daidone had sent Alexander when she found out he was sleeping with Arias again. Showing the photograph, Martinez then asked: 'Do you think that even with everything . they claimed he put you through, do you think it is appropriate to take a . knife and slash somebody's throat?' The judge then called for a brief recess before warning those attending the trial to keep their emotions in check. Tactics: Prosecutor Juan Martinez (left) and the defense team Jennifer Wilmott and Kirk Nurmi speak to Judge Sherry Stephens as the trial was briefly paused on Wednesday following shock reactions to a graphic photo . The prosecution had aggressively grilled Miss Daidone as they attempted to debunk the defense's portrayal of Alexander as a lying cheat who was obsessed with sex. The ex-girlfriend had told the defense that she broke off her relationship with Alexander because she believed he was cheating on her with Arias. Miss Daidone testified as Arias defense lawyers began their portion of the trial. The defense claim that Alexander was sexually aggressive and mistreated Arias, who has now admitted to killing him after initially denying it, but said that she did so only in self-defense. Arias’ ex-boyfriend told the Arizona court on Tuesday that she was sexually aggressive and said she once took a nude picture of him in the shower, just like she reportedly did with Alexander. Daryl Brewer, Arias’ former live-in boyfriend, also testified that Arias borrowed two gas cans days before she killed Alexander, and that she would not explain why she needed them. Results: If sentenced to death, she will be the fourth woman on death row in Arizona . Prosecutors then produced receipts from two gas stations, where it is believed that she filled up the 10-gallon gas containers in quick succession. The prosecution’s working explanation for those stops is that she filled up the gas tanks so that she would not have to stop for gas on the way to Alexander’s house, potentially showing that she was trying to avoid leaving a trail of her trip to his Mesa, Arizona home. Mr Brewer was the most detailed witness of the first day of the defense’s case. He explained that he and Arias dated from 2002 to 2006, and lived together in a house he owned during the second half of that time period. Towards the end, she met Alexander, converted to Mormonism, and started changing in other ways. ‘She had continued to pay the mortgage, but she was not paying other household bills, she began getting into debt or financial trouble. For me it seemed she was not as rational or logical,’ Mr Brewer told the court on Tuesday. Mr Brewer, a 52-year-old divorced father of a teenage boy, also said that during the course of their relationship, Arias got breast implants, allegedly to ‘fit in with [his] crowd’. When asked about their sex life, he said that they had anal sex a number of times, but that she eventually stopped having sexual relations with him towards the end of their relationship, saying that she wanted to save herself for marriage. On her behalf: Gus Searcy, her former 'mentor' at work, said that she dressed in a feminine way . Another witness called on Tuesday was . Gus Searcy, who once worked with Arias at a company that designs, . underwrites and markets legal expense plans. 'She . was always dressed very feminine, but very conservatively,' Searcy . testified, noting that he never witnessed Arias acting sexually . inappropriate. Arias could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row if she's convicted of killing Alexander. Authorities allege that Arias shot Alexander in the face, stabbed and slashed him 27 times, slit his throat and left him inside a shower at his suburban Phoenix home after he tried to end their relationship. Prosecutors argue Arias went to Alexander's home intent on killing him after learning he planned to take a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias claimed she ended their relationship, but the two continued a sexual affair. Police say Arias' bloody palm print and hair were found at the crime scene, and they found sexually explicit, time-stamped photographs in the camera that placed Arias there on the day of the killing. Doomed: Jodi Arias pictured with Travis Alexander, the ex-boyfriend that she is accused of stabbing 27 times after her tried to end their relationship . Arias told police that on the day of the killing, Alexander invited her to his home for sex then became enraged when she dropped his new camera while snapping photos of him. She claims she had to fight for her life. The photos show Arias nude in Alexander's home and Alexander alive in the shower, then dead in the bathroom. Defense lawyers have yet to explain why she put the camera in a washing machine. Authorities say Alexander was shot with a .25-caliber gun, the same caliber weapon her grandparents reported stolen from their California home just days before the killing.

HMV chief executive Trevor Moore has been made redundant just weeks after saying he was 'convinced' the chain's future could be secured . HMV boss Trevor Moore today became the latest casualty of another swathe of redundancies at the failed music chain. Chief executive Mr Moore is one of 60 staff let go by administrators Deloitte across HMV's head office network at Eastcastle Street in London, Marlow and Solihull. The job losses come on top of yesterday's announcement that 66 of its 220 shops are to close over the next two months, impacting 930 staff. Mr Moore's exit comes weeks after he said he was 'convinced' the future of the chain could be secured. On . the day HMV went into administration, he said bosses remained . 'passionate' about the retailer and would 'like to be involved in the . business going forward if the opportunity presented itself'. Talks . are continuing between Deloitte and restructuring firm Hilco - the . group behind HMV Canada - which has already bought the company's debt. But any rescue attempt will see HMV emerge as a far smaller business. Nick . Edwards, joint administrator, said today's redundancies were a . 'difficult decision, but a necessary one in restructuring the business'. 'We would like to express our gratitude to staff for their continued support during the administration,' he added. It comes after staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account . of mass sackings at head office. Latest casualties: The HMV boss is just one of 60 staff from across the music chain's head office network to be let go . Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters. Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired. The incident triggered panic among HMV . executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice . on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed. 'Execution': Tweets from HMV's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting recently . The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live . from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later . came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass . execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’ Poppy Rose Cleere, Online Marketing & Social Media Planner at HMV, was behind the tweets . Another followed: . ‘Just overheard our marketing director (he’s staying folks) ask “How do I . shut down twitter?”.’ One message, spread over two posts, . read: ‘Under usual circumstances, we’d never dare do such a thing as . this. 'However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and . those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have . mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’ The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times. Poppy Rose Cleere, who described . herself as HMV’s social media planner, said she was behind . the tweets. The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’ the importance of social media. ‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ she said in a message from her personal account. ‘Since my internship . started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance . of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to . build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable . real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over . 91 years.’ Staff at HMV, which employs more than . 4,000 people, have been afraid for their future since the chain went . into administration last month.

A horsewoman today described how she was left 'absolutely terrified' after being shot outside her country home. Louise Leggatt sustained a single . gunshot wound after being shot by a gunman hidden in bushes as she went to check her horses. It is alleged the gunman was her spurned . former boyfriend, huntsman Brian Fraser whose bid to rekindle their romance she . had recently rejected. In the dock: Louise Leggatt, right, sustained a single gunshot wound after being blasted by a gunman hidden in bushes outside her country home. It is alleged the gunman was former boyfriend, huntsman Brian Fraser, left . The shooting, at about 9.30pm last March,  happened two months after arsonists attacked her home, forcing her to rent another property next door to where the shooting happened in the Kent village of Benenden. At Maidstone Crown Court, Mrs Leggatt - who worked in a veterinary surgery - fought back tears as she recalled how a gunman opened fire. She said: 'Every evening before I go to bed, I always check my horses to give them some hay and make sure that they are all right. I always go to see the horses between 9 and 10 at night. 'The patio door was locked. Since the fire I had become quite concerned about who was about so I always had the door locked. 'I initially unlocked the door to let my dog out, then closed the door, went back into the house and put my wellies and coat on. 'I then went to go outside. I opened the door and stepped outside to see that my dog was in the corner of the garden, very upset, very angry and barking, not like he normally is with a rabbit or a fox. Shooting: Ms Leggatt was shot as she went to tend to her horses at Apple Pie Farm in Benenden, Kent, on March 15 last year, it has been alleged . 'He was very angry, as if there was something there that he didn’t like. I could see where he was. I had a torch in my hand and I shone the torch to where he was in the corner.' Ms Leggatt went on: 'I didn’t get very far on to the patio and, as I shone the torch across the garden and shut the patio door at the same time, I was shot.' Ms Leggatt, a mother of two, said she could not see anyone. She said: 'First of all, I heard the sound and then I had a horrendous pain in my leg and hip, and I realised what had happened.' Her experience of going on shoots and of her sons’ involvement with clay pigeon shooting led her to believe she had been targeted with a shotgun. She went on to describe the frantic moments that followed as she crawled back into the house through the partly-opened patio door to try to raise the alarm. 'I pulled the door to but I didn’t manage to lock it. I was just desperate to get to a phone,' she said. 'My mobile phone had been hit because it was in my pocket so I crawled across the dining room where the house phone was and I managed to get the phone and dial 999.' Split: Mrs Leggatt finalised a divorce from her husband Philip Gorringe, pictured, in 2007 . Describing the thoughts running through her head at the time, she told the jury: 'I was absolutely terrified. I had never been so terrified in all my life. 'I was really really scared that whoever had done it was going to come back in and I couldn’t get back to lock the door.' Prosecutors allege that Fraser, 63, . who was a master of the Ashford Valley Hunt, tried to kill Mrs Leggatt . 'in a fit of pique' after she rejected his wishes for them to revive . their relationship. Fraser, of Shadoxhurst, . near Ashford, denies attempted murder but has admitted possessing a . firearm without a licence between March 14 and 17 last year. Mrs Leggatt said it 'seemed like . forever' for paramedics to arrive as an emergency operator told her a . firearms unit would have to be deployed first. 'I . was aware that my leg was bleeding very badly and there was a lady on . the end of the line who was very, very kind,' she told jurors. 'She said that a firearms unit had to come and the paramedics couldn’t come until the firearms unit had arrived. I was just so scared.' She was stretchered to an ambulance and taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells but still felt her attacker might try to reach her again. Mrs Leggatt said the wounds have healed but she has a large scar on her stomach where she was operated on and scarring on her leg. Some shotgun pellets remain in her leg, causing her 'shooting pain' as they sit by her sciatic nerve. She also said she has suffered a loss of feeling below her knee. She told how she met Fraser socially through hunting circles in the early 2000s. Mrs Leggatt, who finalised a divorce from her husband Philip Gorringe in 2007, moved in with Fraser.She explained that over time their relationship hit difficulties. She said: 'He spent a lot of time at his farm, an unreasonable amount of time. 'We spent very little time at weekends, he always seemed to have something else on or something more important to do. We just spent no time together and our relationship just died.' There were also disagreements between the couple, about finances in particular. Relationship: Fraser and Ms Leggatt (above) met through the Ashford Valley Hunt, in Kent, in 2006 but split in October 2011 when he went back to live with his wife . 'By 2011 we ended up sleeping in separate rooms after our relationship really came to an end.' Fraser left Mrs Leggatt’s home in November 2011, telling her that he was moving in with an older couple who had difficulties looking after their sheep. After a couple of weeks, Fraser started telephoning her, asking her to meet him. She said: 'I was quite upset that the relationship had deteriorated. 'But by the time he had moved out, I was relieved he had gone because his behaviour had become quite strange. His behaviour frightened me on a few occasions.' Asked by prosecutor Ian Acheson to give examples of his 'strange' behaviour, Mrs Leggatt said he had become 'very, very secretive'. She said: 'I knew that a lot of what he told me were lies and he never would tell me who he had been with or what he was doing. 'I could never contact him. His phone was always off. We never talked about anything.' Mrs Leggatt said Fraser had a 'foul temper'. She said: 'On a couple of occasion he did hurt me. He had such a foul temper that it could be sparked off by nothing in particular, and then it was as if it never happened.' Despite attempts by Fraser to woo her back with regular phone calls and text messages, Mrs Leggatt said she resisted renewing their relationship. 'I said ""no"", we can remains friends but that is all,' she said. Describing his reaction to the arson attack on her home two months before the shooting, she said she was surprised that he did not give her emotional support. She said: 'I was surprised that, given the circumstances - that I had lost the house and its contents - I was surprised at his detachment. 'He didn’t really offer me the support that I thought perhaps he would have done, emotionally anyway.' On Valentine’s Day, he bought her a large bunch of flowers, something she described as 'very unusual'. 'Things like Valentine’s Day, birthdays and Christmases didn’t mean a huge amount to him,' she said. He kept trying to maintain contact with her. Mrs Leggatt said: 'He knew where I was and what I was doing a bit too much.' The trial continues.

A married mother-of-four who wrecked the lives of two soldiers after she falsely claimed they raped her has walked free from court. Teresa Aldridge, 41, had consensual sex with one of the men at a party then drunkenly claimed she had been raped by him and another man. Up to 20 police officers investigated the allegations and within 24 hours had arrested two squaddies at their barracks, a court heard. The innocent men were 'degraded' as police took blood, pubic hair and DNA samples for a crime they had not committed. One of the soldiers was branded a paedophile and a rapist when he returned to his barracks. The other was forced to quit the army and move away from the area after his fiancee and children left him. But the day after the fabricated sex attack, a sober Alridge went to police and admitted she had made up the report. Aldridge pleaded guilty to wasting police time at Canterbury . Magistrates' Court. She was told she had come close to going to prison but was instead sentenced to 120 days jail suspended for two years. The court heard Aldridge told police she had been at a party on March 24, 2012 where she had been drinking vodka. At the time she claimed she was taken into a room at the house party in Canterbury, Kent, where she said two men had raped her.

Ambo Ella, a spokesman for Sidendeng Rappang District in South Sulawesi province, says about 10 monkeys took part in the attack. He confirmed today that the teenage boy was badly bitten and is being treated at hospital. He believes the troop came from a nearby forest protected by a local tribe. It's unclear why the monkeys, which are usually afraid of humans and flee when they hear human voices, emerged and attacked. Horror: About 10 monkeys were involved in the rampage in eastern Indonesia, which also left six other people injured . Local authorities are investigating to find out what prompted the attack, which caused panic among villagers. There are about 260 known living species of monkey which have varied relationships with humans. Many are kept as pets while some are used as model organisms for scientific research. In some parts of the world they are considered agricultural pests which can cause damage to crops. In some tourist locations, they have been known to attack humans.","The attack took place in Toddang Pulu in Indonesia .

Her family has paid tribute to their 'intelligent and beautiful daughter' as police continue to investigate the mysterious death. The young estate agent was said to be devastated after splitting from her boyfriend of three years, who was also at the party.

Venue: The event was being held at the Millennium Madejski Hotel, which is attached to Reading FC's stadium . Officials have not ruled out the possibility that she may have jumped to her death, though they are currently treating the death as 'unexplained'. Miss Cooke was found at the bottom of the fire escape in a hotel attached to the Reading FC ground. She was pronounced dead at the scene, and a post-mortem examination found she had died from head injuries consistent with a fall from a height. 'Danni was a generous, intelligent and beautiful young woman,' her family said in a statement. 'Our family is still in shock at her untimely death.' Detectives, who have not ruled out either suicide or foul play, have taken statements from partygoers at the Millenium Madejski Hotel.

The BBC's ongoing move to Salford has fuelled a massive property boom in the northern town, with house prices rising four times quicker than elsewhere in the country. A total of 2,300 BBC staff are expected to have moved to the town just outside Manchester, with many relocating from London. The average home in Salford is now worth £91,508, up 6.8 per cent on a year ago - the largest price increase in any part of Britain outside the capital. In England and Wales as a whole, average house prices rose by just 1.7 per cent, to £162,080, according to data released by the Land Registry. Rise: The price of property in Salford suddenly rose last year as BBC employees started moving in . Boom: Salford has seen its property prices rise faster than anywhere else outside London . Despite the runaway growth in Salford house prices, BBC employees who have relocated there are still better off than if they had stayed in London. Greater London was the only area which had a larger annual increase, as prices rose by 8.4 per cent to £371,223 - four times the average price in Salford. Elsewhere in the North-West, the average house price fell 3.5 per cent, adding to the evidence that the Salford property market has been buoyed by the arrival of the BBC at the MediaCityUK complex. Several of the towns which saw the greatest falls in prices are within 30 miles of Salford, such as St Helens, where the average house lost 7.8 per cent of its value, and Oldham and Bolton, where prices fell by 6.3 per cent. Headquarters: The BBC's new home in MediaCityUK has pushed up property prices in the city . Local estate agent Greg Davies, of Reeds Rains, attributed the success of the Salford property market to the offices which have been set up in the city by the BBC and other media companies. 'With the arrival of the BBC, it's definitely brought renewed interest especially, in Salford Quays - and rents are particularly buoyant,' he said. Mr Davies added that it was not only media workers themselves who were more keen on the area, saying that because of the new developments, 'People see it as an exciting place to live.' 1) Greater London 8.4% - £371,223 . 2) Salford 6.8% - £91,508 . 3) Brighton & Hove 5.3% - £229,004 . 4) Anglesey 5.1% - £134,328 . 5) West Berkshire 5% - £232,043 . The Corporation announced in 2004 that it planned to move several departments north in order to cut costs and increase regional diversity. Sport, Radio 5 Live, Breakfast and the BBC Philharmonic are all now based in Salford, as are the children's television channels CBBC and CBeebies. However, the BBC has been widely criticised for the £1billion cost of the move, as well as the lavish relocation deals offered to senior staff. Employees living in the South are entitled to claim payments of up to £1,900 a month for two years to subsidise the cost of rented accommodation in Salford. And Peter Salmon, the senior executive responsible for co-ordinating the move, has not yet bought a permanent home in the North, amidst rumours he could be offered another job which would allow him to keep his family in London. Some radio and television programmes supposedly based in Salford have recorded many of their editions in London after having difficulty finding guests who are willing to travel to the MediaCityUK studios. This three-bedroom house on Merchants Quay, less than a mile from the MediaCityUK complex where the BBC offices are located, is on the market with Reeds Rains for £240,000. The two-floor mews property in the formerly run-down docks area boasts a living room, garage and communal garden. The street where it is located has seen average house prices rise by more than £5,000 in the past year, according to property website Zoopla. Its situation is particularly desirable for BBC employees, given the proximity to the Corporation's headquarters and other new developments within walking distance.","House prices in northern city rise by 6.8% in one year .

Online: Internet retailer Amazon has made £13.5billion in worldwide sales in just three months - with one tenth of that coming from UK shoppers . High Street stores may be in serious trouble, but their web rival Amazon is booming, as its Christmas sale figures revealed yesterday. The world's biggest online retailer took in $21.3billion (£13.5billion) over the festive period as customers continued to desert bricks-and-mortar stores in favour of internet shopping. Amazon's massive Christmas revenues will increase pressure on the web giant to pay more tax in the UK, an issue which has seen it under fire recently. The firm said that international sales, including the UK, soared 20 per cent to $9.1billion (£5.8billion) in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total sales were up by 22 per cent, driven above all by the popularity of its tablet computer, the Kindle Fire. However, net income fell by 45 per cent to $97million (£62million) due to greater investment in Amazon's distribution network and its Kindle range of devices. The firm boasted that it now offers a selection of 23 million TV shows, songs, magazines, books, audiobooks and apps - up from 19million at the end of 2011. 'We're now seeing the transition we've been expecting,' Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said. 'After five years, electronic books is a multibillion dollar category for us and growing fast - up approximately 70 per cent last year.' The firm's revenues missed Wall Street's expectations, but investors still sent its stock up more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading. For the current quarter, Amazon expects revenue of between $15-16.6billion (£9.5-10.5billion). Boom: Amazon's Christmas sales are up 22 per cent; pictured is its distribution centre in Fife .

Sales of cheap CDs and DVDs helped hasten the decline of HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk.

A closeted gay man who embezzled £170,000 from his employer has claimed that he used the money to pay off his wife after she started blackmailing him over his sexuality. Christopher Brown is facing jail after being found guilty of exploiting his position as a finance director to write himself dozens of company cheques. He told a court he stole the money in desperation when his then wife Mandy threatened to out him after she discovered he had been calling gay chatlines. Brown, 54, claimed he spent the stolen funds on private school fees for the couple's son as well as buying his wife a ring and a new car. Theft: Christopher Brown, left, claimed he stole company money because he was being blackmailed by his then wife Mandy after she discovered he was gay . Mrs Brown said she 'completely denied' her ex-husband's version of events, and has not faced any police action over his allegations. Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Brown joined luxury home entertainment firm Dawsons in 1980, and worked there for more than two decades. In 1997 Mrs Brown, his second wife, discovered a telephone bill which showed how he was regularly calling gay chatlines, the court heard. He alleged that she had threatened to expose his double life unless he agreed to 'excessive spending' on their son's education and pricey gifts for her. 'I was desperate not to leave the family so I got into this financial mess,' Brown said. Employer: Brown worked for luxury electronics retailer Dawsons, pictured, for 23 years . The couple eventually split in 2003, at which point Brown left his job and moved from Lymington, Hampshire to France, where he opened a bed and breakfast with his male lover. Soon afterwards Dawsons, which sells high-end products from brands such as Bang & Olufsen, discovered that £170,000 had disappeared from its accounts. Brown refused to return to the UK for questioning, and a European Arrest Warrant for him was issued in 2009. He was arrested by French police in October 2011, and extradited to Britain in April last year. Court: Brown faces prison time when he is sentenced next month at Bournemouth Crown Court, pictured . He denied stealing the money from Dawsons, insisting he had only ever intended to borrow it and claiming he had already repaid £120,000. But he was found guilty on four counts of theft today, and a judge warned him that he should expect a prison sentence. Brown was bailed ahead of sentencing, on condition that his first wife agreed to a £100,000 surety. He is also subject to a curfew, has had to surrender his passport and must report to Lymington police station every week.","Christopher Brown spent money from company cheques on school fees .

A man is suing his twin sister over claims she manipulated their mother into cheating him out of his inheritance. Robert Simon has accused his sister Hilary Woolley of turning against him out of envy resulting from her own unhappiness. Mr Simon blames her for telling their dying brother to write to their mother and persuade her to alter her will to exclude Mr Simon from his fair share in her £2million estate. The twins' mother, Constance Simon, drew up a will in 1996 which left Robert her flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, as well as her shares in the family business, dividing the rest of the estate between all her children. At war: Robert Simon, left, is suing his twin sister Hilary Woolley, right, over their mother's £2million estate . But in 2005, she wrote another version which split the entire inheritance between Robert, Hilary and their brother Jonathan, with a trust being set up for the family of their late brother David. The document was drawn up and signed at Constance's 88th birthday party, which Robert did not attend. He claims that the new will is unfair because it blocks him from getting an effective controlling share in the family's plastic company, R.W. Simon Ltd, which he has run for more than three decades. The document was drawn up after David, who was dying from cancer, wrote to the other family members expressing concerns about Robert's 'cavalier attitude' to his relatives. Robert, 62, has taken Hilary and Jonathan, 63, to the High Court in an attempt to have the original will reinstated on the grounds that it better represents their mother's wishes. 'I showed Hilary kindness and generosity, as far as I'm concerned, at all times,' he told the hearing. 'I treat people as I wish to be treated. 'Hilary behaves like that because, unfortunately, happiness has eluded her. I have always been happy with my family. It's something that Hilary has found very difficult to accept.' Legal battle: The siblings are facing off against each other at the High Court in a bitter family feud . Robert, who lives in Chigwell, Essex, testified that after his father's death in the 1970s, he started running the family business in Torrington, Devon. He told judge Nicholas Strauss QC that he did not believe David was the sole author of the letter criticising his conduct, and claimed that his sister was 'in the shadows' influencing it. He had responded to his brother, complaining about what he said was a 'calculated and cold-hearted' attempt to influence their mother to change her will. 'I think that David was a tool, an easily used tool, and the author was Hilary,' Robert said. Dennis Sharpe, representing Hilary and Jonathan, disputed all the accusations, and criticised Robert for sending David a harsh letter when he was on his deathbed. Robert's barrister, Sarah Haren, argues that Mrs Simon's dementia was affecting her so badly before her death that she lacked legal capacity to execute the 2005 will and it was therefore invalid. The plaintiff told the court his mother's memory difficulties had begun in 2002, and said her condition had rapidly deteriorated until she forgot major family events and started talking to characters on the television. 'Mrs Simon was someone who wanted to please people and, in her impaired mental state, it was even more difficult for her to exercise her own judgment,' Ms Haren said. But Mr Sharpe pointed to the fact that Mrs Simon had not undergone a mental health assessment until 2008, a year before her death. 'It is the defendants' case that the deceased was very keen to treat her children equally and the 2005 will achieves that object, whereas the 1996 will does not,' he said. The court heard that, although the disputed company shares form only a tiny portion of the business, they are vitally important as they would give Robert more than 25 per cent, allowing him to block special resolutions. Mrs Woolley, who lives in Halifax, Yorkshire, said outside court: 'I love my twin very much and think that you do not take your family to court.' The hearing continues.","Robert Simon claims Hilary Woolley manipulated mother into changing will .

New fears about the effect Facebook could have on children have arisen after it emerged that prostitutes have been using the site to advertise their services. Social media has been flooded with hundreds of pages operated by sex workers, visible to any web user. While it has always been difficult to avoid adverts for prostitutes in sites such as phone boxes, the rise of social networking has made it even easier to access explicit content. Shocking: So-called 'escort' sites offering scantily clad women are freely available on Facebook . An investigation by The Times revealed that prostitutes and sex agencies openly solicit for customers on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The pages, which can be created by anyone and do not require approval by the sites' management, provide details such as addresses, phone numbers, prices and the specific services. Some are disguised as adverts for models or masseuses, but betray their true purpose with phrases such as: 'Bianca can satisfy physically like no other provider can.' One was even offering a giveaway competition to win a free home session valued at £150. Other adverts appeared to be searching for young women to work as prostitutes, promising they can 'earn about £9,000 a month and live in good apartments in Central London'. Danger: The pages can be accessed by young Facebook users and cannot be automatically shut down . Facebook removed a number of the offending pages after the newspaper drew attention to them. However, the web giant headed by Mark Zuckerberg admitted that it shuts down pages only if users of the site report them as being offensive. When Twitter was alerted to adverts for prostitution on its site, it refused to remove them unless someone could prove a breach of the law had taken place. Gavin Shuker, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on prostitution, promised to investigate the posts. He told The Times that current legislation on prostitution was a 'Swiss cheese' which 'sends mixed messages'. Police have previously been advised to monitor online advertising in order to crack down on sex trafficking, but they rarely take any action against individual sex workers or their clients. Facebook is believed to be used by millions of British schoolchildren - although the official age limit is 13, it is easy to circumvent the rules. Child abuse expert Jim Gamble warned that social media posts about prostitution could be a 'gateway' into paying for sex, as it encourages negative images of sexuality. Facebook said in a statement: 'We encourage people... to use the reporting tools on almost every page of the site so we can take swift action against content or behaviour that breaks our rules.'","Sex workers advertise in publicly accessible posts .

The reality of family life has not changed much since the 1950s with mums still responsible for most of the household chores, particularly at Christmas, watchdogs have ruled. An increasing number of women are in the workforce, bringing greater financial independence, while new men are apparently willing to take a turn at shopping and ironing. However, a Christmas TV ad for Asda, which showed a mum weighed down with all the festive preparations, has been cleared of being sexist on the basis it simply reflected real life. Scroll down for video . Off the hook: Supermarket Asda's Christmas advert from 2012, featuring a mother stressed out by festive preparations, has been ruled not sexist . The commercial showed the exhausted mum struggling to buy the presents and tree, decorating the home, wrapping the gifts, writing cards and cooking the festive feast. At the same time, the dad and the rest of the family were very much in the background, being waited on, feet up and having fun. The Advertising Standards Authority(ASA) received 620 complaints from both mums and dads, claiming the images reinforced outdated stereotypes and were sexist. While hundreds more joined the chorus of disapproval on Twitter and Facebook, including the Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter, Jane Garvey, who said she felt like putting her foot through the TV set. However, the ASA has ruled that despite . major changes in family life and the belief that men now carry more of . the domestic load, not much has changed in the last 60 years. Stereotype: The advertisement sees a young mother stress to create the perfect Christmas for her family whilst her partner and children play a minor role in the preparations . Row: Hundreds complained that the advertisement was sexist and reinforced outdated stereotypes . The voice-over at the end of the commercial stated: ‘It doesn’t just happen by magic. Behind every great Christmas, there’s mum, and behind mum there’s Asda.’ The supermarket produced research among 1,896 mothers who shop with them to back up its belief that women still carry the weight of running the home, particularly at Christmas. The research found that 86per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for presents, while 84per cent were mainly in charge of wrapping them. At the same time, the vast majority, 78per cent said they were mainly in charge of shopping for Christmas food. Asda said that while they appreciated the role of mother and father differed between households, they intended to portray a scene which reflected the actual Christmas experience of the majority of customers. Accurate representation: The Advertising Standards Agency ruled that the commercial was not sexist but reflects 'a significant number' of Christmases in Britain . The store also argued that while the . father was in the background, he played a positive role in helping with . preparations, hosting the family and making sure the children were . entertained. At the time the . commercial was running, Justine Roberts, founder of the Mumsnet . parenting website, said it was the subject of more than 1,000 comments . on its forums in less than 24 hours. ‘Most users were irritated by what . they saw as a patronising portrayal of an outdated version of family . life and argued that the days when men sit around demanding their tea . are long gone,’ she said. However, . she said a significant number also accepted that the theme reflected . the real division of labour in their households over Christmas. Among . the 620 to complain were members of Fathers 4 Justice. It even . encouraged supporters to stage a series of ‘occupy’-style protests at . Asda supermarkets, starting with a flagship store in Wigan. Upset: Complaints regarded the images and the voiceover which stated that behind 'every great Christmas, there's mum, and behind mum there's Asda' Some people felt the advertisement might be particularly upsetting for children who had lost their mother. However, the ASA rejected all the complaints, saying the images really did accurately represent the Christmas experience for ‘a significant number’ of families. As a result, it said the ad ‘was not likely to be seen as condoning or encouraging harmful discriminatory behaviour, or reinforcing negative stereotypes of men or women’. The watchdog said: ‘We acknowledged that single fathers and men with primary domestic responsibilities might find the presentation of the mother playing the central role in the Christmas preparations distasteful.’ However, it said this was unlikely to cause serious offence. Similarly, it rejected the idea that children without mothers would suffer any serious hurt.","TV ad showed a mother doing all the work to prepare for a family Christmas .
