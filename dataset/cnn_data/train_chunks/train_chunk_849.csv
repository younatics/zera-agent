"By . Hugo Duncan . The North East is the fastest growing region in the country in a sign the economic recovery is spreading, figures show today. Lloyds Bank said its index of activity among UK companies – where anything above 50 represents growth – dipped from 59 to a still robust 58 in June. Companies in the North East of England saw the strongest expansion last month, with the region clocking up a record score of 64.8. Industry: Companies in the North East of England saw the strongest expansion last month. Pictured is the Millennium Bridge in Newcastle . It was followed by the South West at 59.4, the East at 58.9, and London and the East Midlands at 58.4. The West Midlands was the weakest of the English regions, at a still positive 57.6, while Wales scored 59.3 and Scotland 55.9. The report undermines claims by Labour that the recovery is benefiting only a minority in London and the South East. Tim Hinton, managing director for small and medium sized businesses at Lloyds, said the ‘robust’ performance in June ‘rounds off a strong second quarter for both manufacturing and services companies’. He said: ‘Efforts to boost capacity and investment spending indicate that businesses are increasingly confident that economic conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year.’ The most recent statistics showing just a quarter of new jobs were created in London (pictured) since 2010 and just a fifth over the past year . The report shows jobs are being created in England at the fastest rate since records began in 2001. Although job creation was strongest in London, companies in the East, the South East, Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands reported the strongest rise in staff numbers for over 13 years in June. The figures will be welcomed by ministers as the government attempts to boost output in all regions of the country and restore prosperity to the great northern industrial heartlands. Ed Miliband recently said that the economic recovery is chiefly benefiting London and claimed four in five jobs created since 2010 were in the capital. But the Labour leader was left red-faced when it emerged that the figures were out of date, with the most recent statistics showing just a quarter of new jobs were created in London since 2010 and just a fifth over the past year. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The truth is that with the economy growing again we are now seeing record numbers of people getting jobs thanks to the government’s long-term economic plan. ‘Unemployment has just seen the biggest annual fall in 16 years and the unemployment rate is at a new five year low. ‘There is still more to do, but it should be welcomed that more people are in work than ever before and thousands of people are getting jobs every single day.’","Companies in the region enjoyed strong growth last month .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Louise Boyle . Chris Christie could not bring himself to watch his hero Bruce Springsteen sing a mocking duet with Late Night host Jimmy Fallon about the beleaguered New Jersey governor following his 'Bridgegate' scandal, it has been revealed. The song, 'Governor Chris . Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey Traffic Jam', joked about Christie's . involvement in the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge last . September. The New Jersey governor could not stomach watching the comic song based on the Springsteen classic Born To Run. Scroll down for video . Making a mockery: Bruce Springsteen, left, joined Jimmy Fallon, right, to sing about Chris Christie's bridge scandal on the Late Show. The New Jersey governor has long been a fan of the musician . Taking a joke: Chris Christie was told by his son Andrew that the Bruce Springsteen skit was funny after he couldn't bring himself to watch it . However Christie's 20-year-old son Andrew told him the skit was funny, the New York Times reported. Springsteen . and Fallon took to the stage last week dressed in ensembles reminiscent of . Springsteen's 'Born in the U.S.A.' era - denim shirts, red bandanas and . aviator sunglasses. Emails emerged earlier this month revealing Christie's aides punished Fort . Lee's mayor for refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter . traffic entering his town by the bridge. 'Oh . maybe this Bridgegate was just pay back,' Fallon sang. 'It's a b**** . slap to the state democrats. We gotta get out but we cant - we're stuck . in Chris Christe's Fort Lee New Jersey traffic jam.' Springsteen joined in: 'You got Wall Street masters stuck cheek to cheek with blue collared truckers. 'And man I really gotta take a leak but I can't, I'm stuck in Governor . Chris Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey traffic jam.' 'The . press conference went on and on,' Fallon continued - referring to . Christie's apology on the scandal, which stretched to more than an hour. Rocking out: The duo sang about the long waits that commuters had to endure on the George Washington Bridge following closures, with Springsteen adding: 'Man, I really gotta take a leak' Fallon: 'In the day we sweated out on the streets, stuck in traffic on the GWB, . 'They shut down the tollbooths of glory because we didn't endorse Christie. 'Maybe this Bridgegate was just payback, it was a b**** slap to the state Democrats. 'We got to get out while we can, We’re stuck in Gov. Chris Christie's Fort Lee, N.J., traffic jam.' Springsteen: 'Governor let me in, I want to be your friend, there'll be no partisan divisions. 'Let me wrap your legs 'round your mighty ribs, relieve your stressful condition. 'You got wall street masters stuck cheek to cheek with blue collared truckers. 'Man I really gotta take a leak, but I can't, I'm stuck in Gov. Chris Christie's Fort Lee, N.J., traffic jam.' Springsteen later added of Christie's apology: 'It was longer than one of my own damn shows.' 'It was longer than one of my . own damn shows,' Springsteen added as the song wrapped up. 'I gotta take a leak. I really gotta take a leak.' Christie has long been vocal about his love for The Boss. In 2012, he said he had been to 129 concerts held by Springsteen, The Star-Ledger reported. Christie later appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and sang a duet of Thunder Road with the host. He met and shared a hug with his idol during a benefit for Hurricane Sandy in 2012. According to Christie, Springsteen then said: 'It's official. We're friends.' The sudden closure of three bridge on-ramp lanes backed up traffic throughout the New Jersey town for four days in September, trapping children in school buses and angering commuters. After the emails emerged, Christie denied having any knowledge of the decision and fired a deputy chief of staff and dismissed a long-time political aide who ran his 2013 re-election campaign.

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . On the way up: Dr Liam Fox is set for a key role in the Cabinet ahead of next year's General Election . Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox was last night tipped for a dramatic return to the political front line in a Cabinet reshuffle this week. Senior MPs say David Cameron is considering giving Right-winger Dr Fox a key role in the run-up to next year’s General Election. The move emerged as the Prime Minister planned a radical ministerial shake-up, with major promotions for leading women Conservative MPs. Dr Fox was Defence Secretary for the first 18 months of the Coalition, but was forced to resign in disgrace in October 2011 in a row over his dealings with his best man and former associate Adam Werritty. Werritty, a lobbyist who did not have security clearance, accompanied Dr Fox on at least 18 foreign business trips. Dr Fox’s resignation came after a week of revelations about his relationship with Werritty, including disclosures that his friend’s activities were funded by firms and individuals that potentially stood to benefit from Government decisions. In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Dr Fox said he had ‘mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my Government activities to become blurred’. Conservative insiders say Dr Fox has impressed with his ‘diligence and loyalty’ since leaving the Cabinet and deserved a recall. His return would also placate restive Eurosceptic Tory MPs who feel under-represented in a Government dominated by metropolitan friends of Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne. A former Minister said: ‘Liam has paid the price for a silly mistake and deserves his return. The Government will be stronger for his experience.’ Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan is expected to join the Cabinet, while Employment Minister Esther McVey and Education Minister Liz Truss are also set to be promoted. Mr Cameron’s overhaul will see the final Cabinet exit of former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, 74, who was first made a Minister 42 years ago. Fellow veteran, Chief Whip Sir George Young, 73, will also step down. Universities Minister David Willetts is also tipped to make way for a new face. Winners: Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan (left) and Education Minister Elizabeth Truss are set to move up . Mr Osborne’s ally Greg Hands is the favourite to succeed Sir George, an appointment which would mark a key step in Osborne’s growing influence. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is thought to be vulnerable, despite a rearguard action to save him by fellow Right-wingers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is expected to hang on to his Cabinet seat, largely thanks to his appeal as a bluff Northerner. Similarly, despite a whispering campaign against Ulster Secretary Theresa Villiers, she is expected to survive to head off a row about her being a victim of ‘sexism’. On the way down: Veteran politicians Kenneth Clarke (left) and Sir George Young will leave their posts . Mr Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May are all expected to remain in place. Cameron had hoped to welcome back ‘plebgate’ MP Andrew Mitchell, the former Chief Whip who resigned after swearing at a policeman who refused to let him cycle through the gates at Downing Street. Mr Mitchell is said to be in talks to end libel proceedings over the case, but it is thought the failure to resolve the issue has cost him a return this week.","Former Defence Secretary among winners in pre-election shake up .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Former Saga chief and Downing Street pensions advisor has been asked by David Cameron to be the 'Business Champion for Older Workers' A former pensions advisor to Tony Blair has been appointed as the Government's new 'Older Workers' Champion', amid growing concern over the number of over 50s left on the scrap heap. Dr Ros Altmann will advise David Cameron on how to make it easier for older workers to stay in work or change careers late in life. There are currently about 2.9 million people aged between 50 and state pension age out of work in the UK. Dr Altmann, a former director-general of over-50s group Saga, will be tasked with making the case for older workers and challenging some firms' outdated perceptions, the Government announced. She has been highlighting the need to consider retirement as a phased process rather than a one-off event, enabling people to perhaps spend a period working part-time towards the end of their working lives rather than giving up work altogether. The former Saga chief said: 'Those who have already retired often miss work, not just because they have such reduced incomes, but also because they miss the social interaction and positive feelings that derive from work. 'Employers, too, often have ageist attitudes which mean they fail to make the most of the skills of their workforce. 'As the numbers of over 50s is soaring in coming years, it is so important that we ensure they have the opportunities to earn and save more, as well as continuing to contribute to the growth of the economy as a whole.' The appointment of Business Champion for Older Workers was announced by pensions minister Steve Webb. Mr Webb said: 'In appointing a business champion for older workers I wanted a powerful voice; someone respected amongst the business community, with a track record of speaking up for consumer rights without fear or favour. 'In Dr Ros Altmann that's exactly what we have. Pensions minister Steve Webb said the appointment of Dr Altmann would help businesses access the 'vast, untapped talent' of older workers currently being overlooked . The pensions minister added: 'Older workers have a huge amount to bring to any workforce and are a vast, untapped talent in the UK labour market. The business case is compelling and I am delighted that Ros will now be taking a lead in going out and making that case directly to the business community.' Minister for women Nicky Morgan said: 'I am delighted that Dr Ros Altmann has been appointed and with her breadth of experience, she will be a great advocate of this work.'","Dr Ros Altmann will become David Cameron's Older Workers' Tsar .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Forget arriving late for a meeting or offering up a weak handshake, what really annoys today's high-fliers is a reliance on technology.

"By . Jason Groves . Senior Labour party officials are said to be overhauling Ed Miliband's geeky image and presenting him as dull but competent . Labour is to present Ed Miliband as a ‘Mr Normal’ figure at the next election – in a bid to make a virtue of his lack of charisma. Senior party lieutenants concede that efforts to overhaul the Labour leader’s geeky image have largely failed, and are now drawing up plans to promote him as a dull but competent alternative to David Cameron. Opinion polls show Mr Miliband trails Mr Cameron badly when voters are asked who is more suited to the job of Prime Minister. The Conservatives have made no secret of the fact they plan to make the 2015 general election campaign a presidential-style fight, in which they will highlight Mr Miliband’s perceived weaknesses. His public image is so bad that one Labour frontbencher told the Daily Mail he should be replaced by animated characters in party political broadcasts. But aides believe Mr Cameron’s ‘flash’ personality can be countered if Mr Miliband adopts an ‘authentic’ approach. His wife Justine Thornton is expected to be given a much higher profile during the campaign to boost his image as a family man. A senior Labour source said: ‘He has to be authentic – there’s no point trying to pretend he’s something he’s not. Ed is a family man who loves spending time at home with his wife and kids. He’s just very normal. ‘We tried this kind of approach with Gordon Brown, but Ed is an easier sell than Gordon.’ Mr Miliband's wife, Justine Thornton is to be given a higher profile to boost her husband's image as a family man . Labour is studying the 1977 New York mayoral race, in which the then little-known Democrat Ed Koch successfully ran on the slogan: ‘Eight years of charisma ... why not try competence?’ But the party’s past efforts to portray Gordon Brown as ‘Not Flash, Just Gordon’ in 2010 were not enough to save him from a crushing defeat at the general election. In an interview with Labour Uncut website yesterday, former party leader Lord Kinnock acknowledged that Mr Miliband comes across as ‘weird’. He said: ‘Well yes he’s weird, but then so were Churchill and Wilson, and Thatcher was the weirdest of the lot ... he’s brave, he’s brainy and he’s measured.’ Meanwhile Mr Miliband was warned to avoid being humiliated like Neil Kinnock if he visits the US. The Labour leader is said to be ‘very keen’ to meet Barack Obama to show voters he has the bearing of a prime minister. The Labour leader is said to be 'very keen' to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in the run-up to the next election . His dream may even have come a step closer after he hired former Obama strategist David Axelrod. But Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, said a Washington trip was ‘the nearest the leader of the opposition gets to a job interview for prime minister’, adding: ‘If it goes wrong there are serious consequences. Neil Kinnock proved that.’ After Mr Kinnock went to see President Reagan in 1987, Labour put it out that the meeting had gone very well. But the trip turned to disaster when the White House revealed Mr Reagan’s concerns about Mr Kinnock’s desire for unilateral  nuclear disarmament. In 2009, Mr Obama refused five requests for a meeting with Gordon Brown.","Labour to present Ed Miliband as a dull but competent alternative to David Cameron .

"Rio Ferdinand is an interviewer, . programme-maker and football expert for BT Sport . By . Rio Ferdinand . As a former England captain and big England fan there is nothing I would love more than to see Roy Hodgson’s team reach a quarter-final showdown with World Cup hosts Brazil. What a tantalising prospect, facing Brazil on their own turf, in the spiritual home of the beautiful game, in a last-eight match that could feasibly happen on July 4 in Fortaleza. But if I was a betting man I would not risk money on England getting out of Group D, let alone making it within sight of the semi-finals. Samba showdown: England could face Brazil in the World Cup quarter-finals... should they get through their group . Uruguay: Luis Suarez . Italy: Andrea Pirlo . Costa Rica: Bryan Ruiz . Don't blame it on Rio! Ferdinand is not sure England will progress because they will be physically wrecked . I’m not damning their chances completely. But let’s have a bit of realism and accept that there are three teams in the section who have a shot at progressing, and three into two doesn’t go. I expect Italy to win the group. They have vast experience in their ranks. They’ve got players who have won a World Cup, with Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi among them. They’ve got big-stage temperament and high-class individuals, from Pirlo to Mario Balotelli. They’re well organised, always, and England could definitely have had an easier start than a rumble in the jungle in Manaus with the Azzurri. A point at least from the opening game is a minimum requirement for England, in my view, or an early exit will beckon. And a point is no gimme. So England will almost certainly need to get the better of Uruguay. That can happen, of course it can. It wouldn’t surprise me if both sides find the net in that second group game, especially if England have had a positive start. But is it feasible England could get beaten by one or both of Italy and Uruguay? Absolutely. Challenge: Wayne Rooney is still finding his fitness after three warm up games, including against Honduras . Azzurri: With players like Andrea Pirlo (2L) and Daniele Rossi (C) Italy will be favourites to win the group . Double whammy! England could also get beaten by Uruguay, especially if  Edinson Cavani is in form . I hope that does not happen but there are gruelling fixtures ahead, mentally and physically, and we can be our own worst enemy as a country in terms of how we prepare for these tournaments. The Premier League is brilliant; excitement every week, fantastically popular. But it lets us down as a national team because there is no winter break. We turn up for World Cups already disadvantaged because so many players are injured, bandaged up, drained. And that’s before a ball is kicked. I’m talking now as somebody who has seen this and lived it. We all play with knocks at times. We all play fatigued on occasions. No big deal. No problem. It’s part and parcel of our profession. But from inside experience of having been an England player at two World Cups, in 2002 and 2006, playing five matches at each, we were ending the group stages physically knackered, gone — before the knockout stage even started. Burn out: England players such as Jack Wilshere often arrive at tournaments exhausted from a gruelling Premier League season . Walking wounded: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain faces a fitness race after picking up an injury against Ecuador . Fitness is a huge factor in performance and undervalued far too often. Heavy legs and weary bodies are a real issue when the turnover of games is so quick. No doubt some people will say, hang on, what about all the foreign players who play in the Premier League and manage to shine? Yes, some do. Carlos Tevez famously went back and forward to Argentina and did the business. Oscar, to name one Brazilian example, plays a heap of games for club and country. But exceptional people being capable of exceptional feats does not get away from the fact that, as a group, England’s players have a uniquely long, hard, unbroken domestic  season. In the same boat: Chelsea's Oscar (L) will also have experienced a tough season for club and country . Rested: Didier Deschamps France (L) and Joachim Low's Germany have the advantage of a winter break . Germany have fewer games because the Bundesliga is only 18 teams, and they have a winter break. Spain and Italy: lower tempo leagues, and winter breaks. France? Winter break and arguably less intensity than England, where the pace and grinding physical demands do stack up. This is not an excuse. But, as someone who knows, I’m telling you that it is one contributory factor and, at elite level, margins matter. We’re going out there with Band-Aids before we get started. On a more upbeat note, the youth and vibrancy of Hodgson’s squad excite me. I was a kid myself, age 19, when Glenn Hoddle took me to the 1998 World Cup, even though I didn’t play. Give youth a chance: Rio Ferdinand (C) travelled to the 1998 World Cup under Glen Hoddle but didn't play . Young gun: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Fleet foot: Raheem Sterling . Saints alive: Adam Lallana . You get that call and your dreams are made — an opportunity to go to an event most people will never experience. There’s a buzz around the country, the flags come out, expectations build and you realise the size of what is expected. And if you’ve got the right mentality you thrive on that, desperate to deliver for everyone back home. I know the lads in Rio will be full of nervous anticipation and high hopes. If England are to deliver, though, the tournament has to start well, and that, for me, will entail stopping Pirlo’s magic. How? I recall one Champions League game against Milan for Manchester United at San Siro in early 2010 when Sir Alex Ferguson put Ji-sung Park on Pirlo. He man-marked him out of the game. Pirlo would typically make up to 90 of his incisive passes per match. That night he was limited to 32. We joked later that Park did such a superb job that when Pirlo woke up the next morning, Ji-sung was at the foot of his bed! Italian job: Andrea Pirlo ran rings around England at Euro 2012, including a cheeky penalty . Balotelli is also a huge talent but Pirlo is consistently brilliant and if England stop him — unlike at Euro  2012, when he cut us to pieces from start to finish — then that’s a start. In my ideal XI (see panel), I’d hand Danny Welbeck that task. Getting something from Italy could be the platform to progress, perhaps a second-round match against Colombia or the Ivory Coast. Then maybe that quarter-final. That for me would be a dream scenario. Over to Roy now. He’s had the courage to select a raw, young squad. Now I hope he gives them a chance to play — and takes off the shackles. Fortune favours the brave.","Rio Ferdinand would like to see England face Brazil at the World Cup .

We cannot allow that to happen.' It's all an illusion! The Home Secretary's flesh-toned dress may have confused viewers . Unaware: It seems that David Cameron was blissfully unaware of the optical illusion style dress that style savvy Theresa wore . So stylish: The MP has become well-known for her stylish dress sense and today was no different as she stepped out in an Aztec inspired print dress . Theresa has become quite the style icon in Parliament and it has been noted that the politician shares many similar sartorial tastes . with supermodel Cara Delevingne, who Ms May once described as . 'one of the most beautiful women in the world'. On previous occasions she has been pictured wearing an . eye-catching multicoloured coat paired with sassy knee-high leather . boots just like a pair worn by Miss Delevingne. At . the Tory conference she turned heads in a £1,190 Vivienne Westwood . tartan suit that was earlier showcased by the supermodel on her 21st . birthday. Sole mates: Theresa May may have been pictured in a pair of racy boots just like some sported by Cara . Delevingne, but the MP says she definitely doesn't share the model's . style . Dare to bare: Theresa went for the strapless look just like model du jour Cara at a New York event .

She is also well-known for her love . of leopard print, a style coveted by Cara, and famously wore a pair of . print kitten heels to the 2002 conference, as well as today in . Parliament. But the 57-year-old MP . has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21-year-old . supermodel. Speaking as . she collected the Spectator's Politician of the Year award last . November, she said: 'This is the second good thing that's happened to . me today because this morning, the Daily Mail asked: ""Is Theresa May the . new Cara Delevingne?"" 'For . those of you who don't know, she is 21, a supermodel and one of the . most beautiful in the world - so I think we can safely say that the . answer to that has to be filed by John Rentoul as a question, to which . the answer is no.'

"By . David Kent . Ecuador striker Enner Valencia is undergoing a medical at West Ham ahead of a £12million move from Pachuca. The 25-year-old scored all three of Ecuador’s World Cup goals, attracting the attention of a number of Barclays Premier League suitors in the process. It now appears that West Ham have won the race to sign Valencia - who will become manager Sam Allardyce’s fifth summer signing if the deal is completed following Monday’s medical. Although any fee is likely to remain undisclosed - Pachuca chairman Jesus Martinez has insisted Valencia will not be allowed to leave the club for anything less than a Mexican league record. World Cup star: West Ham target Enner Valencia was on top form for Ecuador in Brazil . Scorer: Valencia (right) celebrates his header in the friendly against England in Miami . 'There are . various offers for Enner Valencia, the strongest and closest to what the . player and us are demanding is from a club from England,' Martinez told Ecuagol. 'I . won’t talk about prices, but if he is sold, it will be the highest . transfer fee ever in Mexican football football, otherwise he won’t be . sold. 'We are seeking the . possibility that is convenient for him and the club and that he is sold . for the price that we like. We want to keep a percentage of the player . in case he is sold in the future to another big team in Europe. 'It . hurts me, I don’t want to sell him and neither does the manager or the . fans but we can’t go against the career the kid aspires to.' Busy: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has already brought in four players this summer . Allardyce . will be hoping that if Valencia is brought in he can prove stiff . competition with Carroll for the main striker’s berth in his side. England . international Carroll missed a large part of last season with a . troublesome foot injury and the Hammers struggled to score goals in his . absence. But, with Argentina . forward Mauro Zarate one of four players already acquired by West Ham . this summer, their options in attack will be much-improved when their . season kicks off at home to Tottenham.","Sam Allardyce close to completing signing of Ecuador international .

The 234.5-kilometres route from Epernay was the second longest stage of this year's race and lit up when the riders reached the day's second and final categorised climb. The summit of the Cote de Boufflers came with 5.5km to go, with Sagan (Cannondale) prominent over the top, but the leaders regrouped in the finale and Italian Trentin pipped Sagan by the narrowest of margins to claim Omega Pharma-QuickStep's first win of the 101st Tour.

The breakaway split with 40km remaining and Elmiger and Huzarski pressed on alone as the four others were caught. Their lead was less than 30 seconds with 25km to go as Team Sky led the peloton on the undulating terrain. Huzarski and Elmiger were caught on the slopes of the Cote de Maron, the day's first of two classified climbs in the final 20km. The teams were frantically fighting for position and there was a crash in the bunch which brought down Tejay van Garderen (BMC) among others. The American was unable to recover and finished more than a minute down. Leading the way: Vincenzo Nibali remained in the yellow jersey after stage seven .

Cannondale were again to the fore, working for Sagan, but Cyril Gautier (Europcar) was the first to initiate the attacks, with Tinkoff-Saxo's Nicolas Roche following and his leader Alberto Contador on his wheel. Nibali was tucked in behind Contador, but Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory Racing), one of the riders tipped for the stage, dropped out of contention. Greg van Avermaet (BMC) crested the summit with Sagan on his wheel, but it took time for the Slovakian to convince the Belgian to work with him on the descent.

Richie Porte (Team Sky) led a group of around 40 through the flamme rouge at 1km to go, sweeping up Sagan and Van Avermaet, with a crash splitting the leading group.

First class: Daily Mail's race horse at the West Ilsley Stables owned by trainer Mick Channon . The race, scheduled to be the second race on the card, has attracted 15 entries including several who have already been placed in races. First Class Mail made a pleasing start to his career, showing early pace until tiring in the final furlong when sixth to St Brelades Bay at Windsor on June 28. Channon said: ‘First Class Mail has definitely improved for his first run. The Brighton race looks the right one for him – I have had it in kind for a couple of weeks – and you would hope he would go there with a decent chance. ‘The ground shouldn’t be a problem. First Class Mail’s dam Hairspray seemed better when it was fast. I probably just wouldn’t want it really testing.’ Riding plans have yet to be finalised but the mount will either be taken by Channon’s stable jockey Willy Twiston-Davies or stable apprentice Charlie Bishop.

"By . Australian Associated Press . Women will have to wait another 75 years to be paid as much as men, a new report by Oxfam Australia has revealed. The report urges the world leaders meeting in Australia for the G20 summit later this year to make gender equality a priority in their discussions. Women are paid less than men, do most of the unpaid labour, are over-represented in part-time work and discriminated against in the household, markets and institutions, according to Oxfam Australia boss Helen Szoke. Women will have to wait another 75 years to be paid as much as men, a new report by Oxfam Australia has revealed ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane later this year . The report - titled The G20 and gender equality - How the G20 can advance women's rights in employment, social protection and fiscal policies - found another 20-60 per cent would be added to the GDP of G20 countries if unpaid work such as caring for children or carrying out housework was recognised and valued. Australia already has strong policies in place to support women in the workplace, but there is always room for improvement to address negative social attitudes, it said. 'Through its presidency of the G20, Australia is well-placed to show leadership and push the G20 to make good its promise to ensure that economic growth and employment outcomes benefit women and contribute to reducing income inequality between women and men,' Dr Szoke said. 'These are not women's issues alone - they are systemic issues that determine the wellbeing of everyone, in rich and poor countries alike.'","Oxfam Australia report urges world leaders to consider gender equality at G20 summit in Brisbane later this year .

"By . Helen Pow . and Daily Mail Reporter . On April 30, 1973, Richard Nixon admitted to the nation that the Watergate scandal that had tainted his administration and undermined confidence in the White House. Later that night, the embattled president was strangely high-spirited when he took a call from then-California Governor Ronald Reagan. The recording, which reveals Nixon rambling and at times slurring his words, has led some to suggest that the president got drunk after his national Watergate speech. Nixon greets Reagan's phone call with the upbeat response that he 'couldn't be better.' The California governor offers his support for his fellow native Californian, and Nixon responds by complimenting Reagan on his wife, Nancy. Scroll down to hear the conversation between Nixon and Reagan . Hello there? President Richard Nixon told then-California Governor Ronald Reagan that he 'couldn't be better' after giving a difficult speech admitting that the Watergate scandal had cast a shadow on his administration . 'Give my greatest love to Nancy - How-How'd you ever marry such a pretty girl? My God!' Nixon said. 'I'm lucky,' Reagan, clearly slightly uncomfortable, says. Steve Scully, the political editor for C-SPAN, was the one of the first observers to point out Nixon's strange manner, asking 'Was the president drinking?' Mediaite ponders whether Nixon was 'wasted' on the phone call. The fascinating conversation was just one excerpt from audio recordings that were made public last week by the National Archives and Records Administration. They capture some 3,700 hours of taped conversations between February 1971 and July 1973, with the most interesting of those containing conversations about the scandal that did, ultimately, see Nixon's head roll. President Nixon is also heard in the tapes, referring to the media as 'a law to themselves' with regards to the leaks. 'Press gets so concerned about this... bugging... why should they be a law to themselves? Why should they have a license to steal?' The recordings reveal that, in the hours after Nixon delivered a public Watergate address as the scandal exploded, two future presidents called him to express their private support - Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. Tapes: In this April 29, 1974, file photo, President Richard M. Nixon points to the transcripts of the White House tapes after he announced during a nationally-televised speech that he would turn over the transcripts to House impeachment investigators, in Washington . The April 30, 1973, calls were . captured on a secret recording system that Nixon regularly used to tape . discussions with colleagues in . Washington as well as his foreign counterparts. The . final chronological installment of those tapes — 340 hours — were made . public by the National Archives and Records Administration, along with . more than 140,000 pages of text documents. Seven hundred hours remain . sealed for national security and privacy reasons. Reagan, then-California Governor, called late in the evening of April 30 to support Nixon after the 37th president delivered a landmark speech about the Watergate scandal, which was rapidly ensnaring him. Two top White House staffers and close Nixon confidants, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, had resigned earlier in the day, as well as Attorney General Richard Kleindienst as the scandal picked up speed. White House counsel John W. Dean III was also fired that day. Reagan told Nixon the speech was the right one to make and sympathized with the staff exodus. 'I just want you to know, we watched and my heart was with you. I know what this must have been and what this must have been in all these days and what you've been through,' Reagan said. 'You can count on us, we're still behind you out here and I wanted you to know that you're in our prayers.' Reagon went on: 'I know how difficult it was, and I know what it must be with the fellows having to do what they did-' before Nixon cut him off: 'That's right, they had to get out.' Pals: The tapes also include conversations between Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, left, and President Richard M. Nixon from 1973 . At the end of the call, Reagan added . to the President: 'This too shall pass,' to which Nixon responded . 'Everything passes.' But it didn't. That . same evening, George Bush Sr., who had recently been appointed chairman . of the Republican National Committee, called to say he had watched the . speech with 'great pride.' This time, however, an angry and exhausted-sounding Nixon complained to Bush about the reaction from TV commentators. 'The folks may understand,' Nixon said, before adding later: 'To hell with the commentators.' Other interesting quotes pulled from the tapes by Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell include a conversation between the President and Kissinger in which they discussed what J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, would have done had he been alive for Watergate. Kissinger said: 'If J. Edgar Hoover had been alive he would have handled Watergate for you in a way in which it would never have surfaced.' To which Nixon replied: 'Hoover would have had these clowns nailed for misdemeanors and given them a few weeks in the hoosegow and out!' Kissinger then added: 'And started blackmailing a few newsmen and this thing would have worked out.' 'Yeah. He (Hoover) blackmailed,' Nixon responded. Evidence: The original Nixon White House tape and original tape recorder are shown in an undated file photo from the National Archives. The last 340 hours of tapes from President Richard M. Nixon's White House were released Wednesday, August 21, 2013 . Of his adviser Leonard Garment, Nixon is heard saying: 'Goddamn his Jewish soul!' Wednesday's tapes also include topics . such as Vietnam, energy and a lengthy recording of Nixon and Soviet . leader Leonid Brezhnev chatting warmly in the Oval Office before a . historic summit in June 1973. Nixon . and Brezhnev met one-on-one with only an interpreter present for an . hour on June 18 and chatted about personal topics, including their . families. The . conversation happened before the start of a historic seven-day summit . that was part of Nixon's larger strategy of detente with the Soviet . Union. 'We must recognize, the two of us, . that ... we head the two most powerful nations and, while we will . naturally in negotiations have some differences, it is essential that . those two nations, where possible, work together,' Nixon told Brezhnev. 'If we decide to work together, we can change the world. That's what — that's my attitude as we enter these talks.' The . conversation is remarkable because of the camaraderie that is evident, . said Luke Nichter of Texas A&M University-Central Texas in Killeen, . who runs a website cataloging Nixon's secret recordings. Both men . discuss their children and Brezhnev even talks about his grandson's . attempts to pass college entrance exams. 'These are Cold War archenemies who are talking like old friends,' he said. 'This is very unusual.' The recordings were released at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda and cover April 9, 1973, to July 12, 1973, the day before the existence of the covert recording system was revealed to a Senate committee probing Watergate. Previous tape releases show the president as a paranoid man who was not afraid to use bare-knuckle tactics to crush the enemies he saw all around him. Tapes released in 2009 show, in particular, Nixon's obsession with the Kennedy family. He considered Ted Kennedy such a political threat, for example, that he ordered surveillance in hopes of catching him in an affair. Nixon's second term was quickly overrun by the Watergate scandal, which began in 1972 when burglars tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 — a little more than a year after the tapes end — and retreated to his native California, where he was pardoned a month later by his successor, Gerald Ford. The Nixon Foundation released a statement regarding the release of the latest installment of tapes defending his presidency. 'Today's release of White House Records from the National Archives offers a classroom on major achievements of the Nixon Presidency,' the Foundation wrote.","The tapes include intimate discussions between President Richard Nixon, his aides and his colleagues in politics regarding the Watergate scandal .

"By . Julian Robinson . A scientist struck down by malaria seven times is leading the search for new drugs - to stop transmission of the deadly disease. Dr Rita Tewari, of Nottingham University, has completed what she describes as a 'Herculean study' into the roles played by enzymes as the malaria parasite develops in the body. Dr Tewari, born and brought up in Delhi, . India, said: 'This latest . study identifies how protein phosphatases regulate parasite development. Dr Rita Tewari, of Nottingham University, has completed what she describes as a 'Herculean study' into the roles played by enzymes as the malaria parasite develops in the body . 'Our research provides a systematic functional analysis for all the 30 phosphatases in Plasmodium berghei - the parasite responsible for causing malaria. 'These enzymes work in tandem with the protein kinases identified by the same team in a complementary study carried out in 2010.' Dr Tewari, who now leads her own malaria research laboratory at Nottingham University, added: 'If we can find out what proteins are essential for these parasites to develop and divide, maybe we can target those proteins and arrest them with drugs or vaccines.' Malaria remains one of the most deadly scourges of the developing world - killing up to one million people and causing disease in 300 to 500 million people every year. In humans the deadliest form of malaria is caused by the single cell parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Disrupting the life cycle of the malaria parasite could save the lives of millions of people. Malaria parasite development and cues controlling it is still not fully understood. What Dr Tewari’s team is trying to do is understand the basic developmental biology of these parasites. Dr Tewari’s new research was carried out in collaboration with the Medical Research Council’s National Institute for Medical Research (MRC-NIMR) in London, together with colleagues at Oxford University, Imperial College, London and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Malaria remains one of the most deadly scourges of the developing world - killing up to one million people and causing disease in 300 to 500 million people every year. Pictured is a red blood cell infected with malaria . Dr Tony Holder, Head of the MRC-NIMR Division of Parasitology, said: 'Inhibitors of protein kinases are already used in treatments for other diseases and there is growing interest to develop phosphatase inhibitors as drugs. 'Identifying the key kinases and phosphatases in the parasite life cycle will define the targets for drug development to treat human malaria and prevent its transmission in communities by the mosquito.' Dr Tewari added: 'Interestingly, out of the 14 genes that could be knocked out, six were found to be crucial for sexual development and hence could be drug targets for parasite transmission to and from the mosquito. 'The race to uncover new vaccines and more effective drugs to treat disease and block malaria transmission is becoming ever more important.' David Brook, Professor of Human Genetics and Director of Research in the School of Life Sciences at Nottingham University, said: 'Despite being a small research group, Rita’s lab packs a powerful punch and they are really putting Nottingham on the world map for malaria research.' Dr Tewari's findings have been published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe.","Dr Rita Tewari had malaria seven times as a child while living in Delhi, India .

"By . Ruby Warrington . I had a caesarean section 27 years ago – and still have a small bulge over the top of the scar, which seems to hang over the waistband of my size eight trousers. It’s not the end of the world but it does bother me. I’m  58 now, can you recommend any exercises that will help? I suspect you’re not alone in your problem. These days roughly a quarter of all births are by caesarean, making it one of the most common of all surgical scars. Healing movements: Pilates is a good way of targeting the stomach, if that is your problem area (stock image) Women who have this operation find that afterwards fat deposits unevenly over the front abdominals – perhaps because of the way the tissues are cut and then heal – and this can be difficult to get rid of. It must be frustrating for you because, as a size eight, you’re obviously slim elsewhere. It doesn’t sound like you need to lose weight, so going on a diet to reduce your overall body fat percentage probably won’t help. In terms of exercise, you don’t give any clues about what you’re doing already, but any workout that targets the core muscles should be your first port of call. Pilates is specifically designed to target this area, with the majority of the moves focused on engaging the core muscle group. Fit in the City columnist Ruby recommends 'any workout that targets the core muscles' for those suffering from c-section fat deposits (stock image) Although it’s very hard to reduce fat in a specific area, by improving muscle tone and posture, you might find your tummy’s appearance does get better. You could see if there’s a studio or class you can get to locally, but working one-to-one with an instructor in your own home will probably yield faster results. It’s not as expensive as you might think – take a look on pilatesunion.com. Given your age and that you had your surgery some time ago, it could be that the bulge is mainly sagging skin due to a loss of elasticity. A while ago, the only option might have been a mini tummy tuck. It’s an increasingly popular option but I’m ambivalent about cosmetic surgery. It’s a major operation  with a host of risks and a lengthy recovery time, even though the surgeon might be able to use the same  incision point as your caesarean, meaning no further scarring. Today there are a wealth of non-invasive options that use ultrasound, radio frequency, heat and freezing among other things to tighten skin and spot reduce fat. They do work but again there are risks and you really do need to do your homework. If you take this route, make sure you visit a qualified and experienced therapist, and not just some hairdresser who has decided to buy a fat-zapper machine. Go nuts: Almonds and other nuts and seeds could help with oestrogen production . Your recent response to one reader’s battle-of-the-bulge question, in which you suggested she increase her intake of foods that move excess oestrogen through the system, was really interesting. But are there any oestrogen-stimulating foods  to avoid? This is a great question, as there’s some confusion around the idea that cruciferous vegetables – such as cabbage, cauliflower and sprouts – and citrus fruits, avocado, nuts, eggs, organic dairy products (and tea and coffee) have ‘anti- oestrogen’ properties. I spoke to the London-based nutritionist Jackie Lynch for an expert opinion on this, and she had some different ideas. The key thing is to limit saturated fats, such as red meat or cheese. High levels of saturated fat in your diet can block the action of the essential fats such as omega 3, which play a key role in hormone balance. These produce anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and can help relieve symptoms of oestrogen-dominant conditions such as heavy or painful periods, or endometriosis. So replacing saturated fats with foods rich in essential fats such as raw almonds, walnuts, pumpkin or flax seed and oily fish, could combat the effects of excess oestrogen. Jackie also told me that foods  containing plant compounds called isoflavones are considered to have hormone balancing properties  – think lentils, chickpeas, beans  and soya. Eating organic where possible, will also reduce exposure to xenoestrogens – oestrogen-like chemicals which may be found in pesticides or plastics, for example. Cruciferous vegetables contain indole-3-carbinol, which helps to encourage the elimination of excess oestrogen, though Jackie says she generally doesn’t advocate tea or coffee, despite the potential antioxidant content, as they can deplete vitamins and minerals which may affect hormone balance and impact blood sugar levels. This generates the release of stress hormones, which, when out  of balance, can impact the balance of other hormones in the body. Looking for some motivation to go the extra mile in your workout – why not take the dog with you? We reported last month that Stand Up Paddleboard Surfing (SUP) is the fastest growing watersport in the world. One newly revealed fan is Mamma Mia! actress Amanda Seyfried, who has been taking her Australian Shepherd Finn out on the water with her. She posted this picture, right, on Instagram last week, along with the caption: ‘It was surprising, at first, that Finn was so eager to jump aboard. Now I can’t enjoy paddling without him.’ Fun with Finn: Actress Amanda Seyfried had her dog Finn join her on the paddleboard for her water workout . From the look on her face – and his – they’re having a whale of a time. In New York I see people running with their dogs every day. They live in such tiny apartments, they need all the exercise they can get – but it works both ways. Research by the Kennel Club has shown that more than a third of dogs in the UK are overweight – and their owners are likely to be less fit too. So, if you are looking at Rover thinking perhaps he could lose a couple of pounds, he might be thinking the same about you… . The latest craze in fitness-mad NYC? Precision Running – that  is, a specially designed treadmill workout that combines intervals of varying speed and incline with brief recovery periods. Personally, I’m not a fan of running – I get bored  too quickly – but when  I attended a class at my local Equinox gym the time flew past, with the instructor constantly changing the pace and intensity. Interval running used to be the domain of elite athletes,  but as some studies suggest it helps burn more calories in a shorter time period, as well as improve cardiovascular function faster than continuous-intensity exercise, it’s  no wonder it’s becoming  more popular. To try it out for yourself, after a warm-up run hard for two minutes so you get very out of breath, followed by two to three minutes of easy jogging or fast walking. The secret is actually in the recovery, as this is what allows you to really go for it in the next hard interval – but it still takes some discipline to push yourself to your limit. This is where classes come in, as it helps to have somebody telling you how fast and high to set your treadmill. I was amazed what I could do when I took myself out of my running comfort zone for once.",Transform your body and mind with advice from our girl in New York .
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Thousands of people will die from extreme heat because health and safety rules stop hospitals opening windows, a shocking report claims. New research suggests the number of deaths during scorching British summers is set to treble to 7,000 by the 2050s. Houses, hospitals and care homes are ill-equipped to deal with a heatwave, sparking calls for a maximum temperature to be imposed on wards. Top-floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk of overheating because of insulation and difficulting opening windows, the report said . The combination of an ageing population and climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme heatwaves means thousands more people are at risk. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises government on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, said more needed to be done to adapt to rising temperatures. By 2040 half of all summers will be as hot as 2003, when 2,000 people died. It warns of an increase in droughts, strong winds and wildfires, while ‘many homes, hospitals and care homes are already at risk of overheating’. It suggests that the Care Quality Commission should ‘consider setting standards for maximum temperatures in hospitals and make sure staff can control internal temperatures’. Around 90 per cent of hospital wards are prone to overheating, and the ability to control temperatures is often limited. Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the country needs to adapt homes to cope with heatwaves . Staff have only limited control over conditions because window opening has been restricted over health and safety fears, according to soon-to-be-published Cambridge University research. The work on hospitals has been led by Professor of Architecture Alan Short whose research group has been looking at ways to cool wards without resorting to costly air conditioning which could exacerbate the climate problem, . It found that while the Department of Health advocates natural ventilation for wards and offices, the policy was often thwarted because window opening had been restricted over fears about safety, infection control and security. The cost of installing the necessary improvements across 627 buildings was put at around £17.5 billion. Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, said: 'There is more to be done to counter the increasing risks of severe weather that are likely to be associated with climate change. 'As well as making vital infrastructure services more resilient to flooding and storms, the country needs to adapt homes and other buildings so they are suitable for higher summer temperatures. 'The impacts of climate change on the UK in the decades ahead are likely to include rising sea levels, more flooding, summer heatwaves, and perhaps more frequent storms and droughts.’ Newer homes are more likely to overheat. Top-floor flats and terraced houses are particularly at risk, as well as homes because they struggle to create a through-flow of air. ‘Examples of causes of overheating included improperly ventilated communal areas in blocks of flats, and an inability to open windows,’ the report said. Source: National Survey of summertime temperatures and overheating risk . Source: National Survey of summertime temperatures and overheating risk . Reducing indoor temperatures by 1-2C can cut annual heat-related mortality by 30-70 per cent. While better roof insulation and window upgrades can cool a room by 1.3C, insulated floors and walls can push temperatures up by 0.7C. To fit new and exitsing homes with air conditioning would cost £2.4billion over 15 years. Cheaper alternatives include shutting curtains during the day, applying tinted window film and painting roofs white.","Report warns number of heat-related deaths could trebled to 7,000 by 2050 .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Schoolgirls who ask their parents for healthy meals may be showing early signs of an eating disorder, a leading headmistress has warned. Jayne Triffitt, who is head of the Catholic girls boarding school Woldingham in Surrey, was speaking at an end of term assembly about mental health and eating disorders among teens. She said, due to social pressure, young girls feel they must look a certain way - and so may reduce their food intake in a bid to be thin. Warning: Jayne Triffitt, head of Woldingham School in Surrey, has warned that schoolgirls who ask their parents for healthy meals may be showing early signs of an eating disorder . The head of the £10,000-a-term institution warned parents to be wary of their daughters asking to follow a 'healthy diet' - as the request could be a 'euphemism' for eating very little. Mrs Triffit said: 'The biggest pressure is to be thin. 'But, of course, the catch is that if they reduce their food intake they will not have the energy to cope with a packed life here at school. 'All too quickly they could head for some type of eating disorder.' Pressure: Mrs Triffit said exam stress and heavy workloads - particularly in female pupils aged between 14 and 18 - can trigger mental illness, which in turn may lead to an eating disorder (library image) According to The Times, she added: 'Just a hint to parents, do not be caught out by your daughter's wish to eat a 'healthy' diet. This is often a euphemism for eating very little indeed.' Later in her speech, Mrs Triffit said exam stress and heavy workloads - particularly in female pupils aged between 14 and 18 - can trigger mental illness, which in turn may lead to an eating disorder. Mrs Triffit said pupils in this age range are under particular pressure as Universities demand 'ridiculously high grades' from applicants. Worry: The head said young girls feel pressured to look a certain way - so drop their food intake in a bid to be thin . The headmistress said: 'Some will become over-anxious and display particular mental health issues connected with this.' Mrs Triffit's warning comes as research indicates teenage girls could be more prone to depression and anxiety as they experience greater blood flow to the brain. Hormone . oestrogen drives more blood to the heads of young women compared to men . - and that could explain disparities in psychiatric disorders, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania claim. Blood flow is known to be higher in adult women than men, but the study now shows it is markedly different during adolescence when teenagers are going through puberty. According to the NHS Choices website, eating disorders are most commonly blamed on social pressures to be thin. However, those with a family history of depression are also more likely to develop the three main types of eating disorder - anorexia nervosa, bulimia or a binge eating. Eating disorders can affect people of any age - but often develop in teenagers. According to the NHS, around one in 250 women will experience anorexia at some point - with the condition usually developing around the age of 16 or 17. One in . 2,000 men will also experience such disorder. Bulimia is around five times more common . than anorexia, research shows, and 90 per cent of people with bulimia are female. The condition usually develops around the age of 18 or 19. Binge eating usually affects males and females equally and often appears later in life - between the ages of 30 and 40. Research conducted last year by Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) suggested that one in ten individuals admitted to hospital with an eating disorder were female and aged 15.","Jayne Triffitt said pupils asking for a healthy diet may have eating disorders .

"By . Julian Robinson . Children are five times more likely to become obese if their older brother or sister is overweight, a new study has found. An only child is 2.2 times more likely to put on excess weight if one of their parents is obese, according to a survey. But while parental influence is well documented, a child with an obese older sibling is much more likely to become overweight, with the risk shooting up 5.6 times. It comes as a second piece of research suggests eating out with healthy friends can help a person shed the pounds, as people are influenced by their peers' food choices. Children are five times more likely to become obese if they have overweight older siblings (file picture) A survey, which assessed more than 10,200 households in the U.S., found childhood obesity varied according to the number of children as well as their gender. Meanwhile, older children in a two-child household with an obese parent are 2.3 times more likely to be obese - but that number jumps to 5.4 times for those with overweight younger siblings. The research was carried out by experts from Massachusetts General Hospital, Cornell University, and Duke University. Their findings were published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Lead investigator Mark C. Pachucki said: ‘We found that obesity status of a younger child's older sibling is more strongly associated with a child's obesity than is the parent's obesity status.’ The report found that only children were less likely to exercise and more likely to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters . ‘This association is independent of a host of socioeconomic and demographic attributes, health behaviours, and overall health status.’ He added that the findings were ‘consistent with research showing that siblings tend to eat alike and have similar levels of physical activity’. The survey also revealed a link between gender and the risk of obesity with younger children more susceptible to the influence of an older brother or sister if that sibling is of the same sex. Only . children were also found to be less likely to exercise and more likely . to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters. But data also showed that having a very active older sibling upped the obesity risk for the younger brother or sister. Mr Pachucki added: 'Younger . children look up to their big brother or sister for behavioral cues, . often seeking their approval; and siblings may spend more time each . other than with their parents, often eating and playing sports . together.' Healthy friends can help influence our meal choices at restaurants, research has found . Eating out with healthy friends can have a positive impact on an individual’s food choices, a study has found. Research has revealed that diners tend to order similar dishes to their friends when in groups at restaurants. Experts looked at receipts from nearly 1,500 people who ate in groups at an eatery in Oklahoma, U.S. over a period of 19-weeks. Dishes were divided in to eight food categories such as soups, salads, pasta dishes and daily specials. While many of those who dined together appeared to choose different dishes, they tended to choose from the same categories. The research was carried out by experts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics. It found that the popularity of salads and vegetarian dishes shot up when more than one person in the group ordered healthier dishes. According to the website scientificamerican.com, study researcher Brenna Ellison said: ‘We want to be different from our friends a little bit, but not too different. She added: ‘People are happier spending money and eating more calories as long as their peers are.’","More than 10,000 homes across the U.S. were assessed as part of the study .

"By . Associated Press . A government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at a research center near Washington made a startling discovery last week — decades-old vials of smallpox packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. The six glass vials were intact and sealed, and scientists have yet to establish whether the virus is dead or alive, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. Still, the find was disturbing because for decades after smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia. Smallpox: This 1975 file electronmicrograph from the Centers for Disease Control shows the smallpox virus . Officials said this is the first time in the U.S. that unaccounted-for smallpox has been discovered. At least one leading scientist raised the possibility that there are more such vials out there around the world. The CDC and the FBI are investigating. It was the second recent incident in which a U.S. government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous germ. Last month, scores of CDC employees in Atlanta were feared exposed to anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse. The CDC began giving them antibiotics as a precaution. The freeze-dried smallpox samples were found in a building at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, that has been used by the Food and Drug Administration since 1972, according to the CDC. The scientist was cleaning out a cold room between two laboratories on July 1 when he made the discovery, FDA officials said. Officials said labeling indicated the smallpox had been put in the vials in the 1950s. But they said it's not clear how long the vials had been in the building, which did not open until the 1960s. No one has been infected, and no smallpox contamination was found in the building. Smallpox can be deadly even after it is freeze-dried, but the virus usually has to be kept cold to remain alive and dangerous. In an interview Tuesday, a CDC official said he believed the vials were stored for many years at room temperature, which would suggest the samples are dead. But FDA officials said later in the day that the smallpox was in cold storage for decades. 'We don't yet know if it's live and infectious,' said Stephan Monroe, deputy director of the CDC center that handles highly dangerous infectious agents. The samples were rushed under FBI protection to the CDC in Atlanta for testing, which could take a few weeks. After that, they will be destroyed. Peter Marks, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation, said the discovery was unexpected but not a total shock. He added, however, that 'no one's denying we should have done a better job cleaning out what was there.' In at least one other such episode, vials of smallpox were found at the bottom of a freezer in an Eastern European country in the 1990s, according to Dr. David Heymann, a former World Health Organization official who is now a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Heymann said that when smallpox samples were gathered up for destruction decades ago, requests went out to ministers of health to collect all vials. Investigation: The CDC, pictured, and the FBI are investigating the six vials of smallpox found in a storage room . 'As far as I know, there was never a confirmation they had checked in with all groups who could have had the virus,' he said. Dr. Donald ""D.A."" Henderson, who led the WHO smallpox-eradication effort and is now a professor at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh, said it is highly unlikely more such stashes will be discovered. But he conceded ""things were pretty casual"" in the 1950s. Decades ago, he recalled, 'I came back from many a trip carrying specimens, and I just put them in the refrigerator until I could get them to a laboratory. My wife didn't appreciate that.' Smallpox was one of the most lethal diseases in history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected, and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions. The last known case was in Britain in 1978, when a university photographer who worked above a lab handling smallpox died after being accidentally exposed to it through the ventilation system. Global vaccination campaigns finally brought smallpox under control. After it was declared eradicated, all known remaining samples of live virus were stored at a CDC lab in Atlanta and at a Russian lab in Novosibirsk, Siberia. The labs take extreme precautions. Scientists must undergo fingerprint or retinal scans to get inside, they wear full-body suits including gloves and goggles, and they shower with strong disinfectant before leaving the labs. There has long been debate over whether to destroy the stockpile. Many scientists argue that any remaining samples pose a threat and that the deadly virus should be wiped off the planet altogether. Others contend the samples are needed for research on better treatments and vaccines. At its recent annual meeting in May, WHO put off a decision again.","The freeze-dried smallpox samples were .

"By . Emma Innes . A young woman who became the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan ‘I’d Give You One’ has died from cystic fibrosis. Kerry Thorpe, 23, died before a donor could be found for her. She was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby and her condition rapidly worsened in recent years. Scroll down for video . Kerry Thorpe, 23, died of cystic fibrosis on Friday because a lung donor could not be found for her . She needed a double lung transplant but was told two years ago she would never be well enough to join the transplant list unless she put on weight and got her diabetes under control. Ms Thorpe, from Kesgrave, in Suffolk, managed to achieve these feats and was put on the transplant list. In 2011 she also posed for striking posters for a national campaign for the Live Life Then Give Life charity. The images, showing Ms Thorpe, also carried the tongue-in-cheek slogan ‘Would You Give Her One?’ But tragically, her own life-saving donor was never found and she died in hospital on Friday with her family, fiancé Joshua Nelli, and puppies, at her side. The charity said Ms Thorpe was still helping their campaign despite her death as 77,000 people have now viewed their Facebook page. Ms Thorpe was the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan 'Would You Give Her One?' Mandy Venters, Live Life Then Give Life’s chairwoman, said: ‘We were devastated to hear that our wonderful ambassador Kerry Thorpe passed away whilst awaiting a lung transplant. ‘She was a role model for many people. She fought her way on to the transplant list and battled hard to remain here for that call and second chance. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. Life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices . ‘Like many others, I was in awe of . Kerry’s determination and resilience and immensely grateful for the . fantastic support she gave Live Life Then Give Life. ‘She was dedicated to raising awareness of organ donation, not least during our “I’d give you one” campaign which made a significant impact over the past couple of years. ‘Over 77,000 people have reviewed our Facebook posting and more than 560 people have shared it on their timeline, so we hoped that Kerry continues to inspire people to “Think about it, Talk about it and Do something about it” as it would be the finest tribute to her.’ Posting on a tribute page ‘The Kerry Alex Thorpe Trust’ Mr Nelli, 26, said: ‘This page has been set up in memory of my inspiring fiancée Kerry Alex Thorpe. ‘Although her time with us was cut far too short she managed to make some amazing friends and raise an incredible amount of awareness for both cystic fibrosis and the desperate need for organ donation. ‘Myself and her family are passionate that all of Kerry’s hard work doesn’t go to waste so we will continue her legacy even after she’s gone.’ Friend Sharon Morphew wrote: ‘We were lucky to have been touched by this beautiful and amazing young woman, everyone should carry a donor card. I’m sure you will reach the target and so much more xx’ And Kerri Langley wrote: ‘Joshua, Jacqui & Kimberley you must be so proud of how many lives Kerry touched - a true inspiration x x x x’ Kimberley Liane Kneil also posted: ‘It’s still not sinking in Kerry. My beautiful lung warrior, you fought so hard & yet time just ran out. ‘I can’t believe we never got to walk the puppy dogs on the beach & we were only talking about it the other week... ‘I’ll . make it my mission to live life how you’d have wanted me too. Will miss . you loads sweet but we’ll meet again. Until then, party hard up their . my angel.’ Ms Thorpe leaves behind her mother, Jacqui Brett, father Gary Thorpe, 44, and sister Kimberley Thorpe, 21. Ms Thorpe was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was a baby but her condition worsened recently . When she was first put on the transplant register, she took to her blog to put up posts of her hopes for the future. She wrote: ‘Before I was listed, I was seeing myself going downhill fast, day-by-day. Yet there was no hope to cling onto, no light at the end of the tunnel, I was absolutely stuck in limbo but I still kept the belief and I carried on. ‘But now it’s different, no matter how ill I feel or how much of a bad day I am having, I have that hope of a call, and that is something I can hold onto because a call could come at literally any second, it’s exciting but damn right nerve-wracking at the same time!!!’ To visit the Facebook tribute page, click here.","Kerry Thorpe, 23, died on Friday surrounded by her family .

"By . Alice Robinson . Thanks to three school-aged children and a messy husband, suddenly my life seems to have become all about laundry. Our au pair recently left, so, for the first time, I’m having to tackle the mounds of dirty clothes by myself. But, despite my best efforts, everything looks grubby and stained. Scroll down for video . All about laundry: With three children and a messy husband, Alice is left to tackle mounds of dirty clothes . No wonder new research carried out by Samsung has revealed that British families damage more than £100 million worth of clothes every year by washing them incorrectly. So what to do? I turned to the internet and found countless women swapping imaginative, and sometimes bizarre, laundry tips. I decided to compile a selection and put them to the test. Laundry guru Steve Anderton, who runs his own professional washing firm, gave his verdicts on which ones work and which ideas just don’t wash. Just the tonic? Vodka has some benefit in removing stains . THE CLAIM: You can freshen up clothes by spraying them with vodka. The theory is the alcohol works in much the same way as sanitising hand gels and kills odour-causing bacteria. DOES IT WORK? As the children’s sports day approaches, I realise most of my summer dresses smell musty thanks to them hiding in the wardrobe all winter. I choose one I’m not too fond of — just in case this experiment goes horribly wrong — hunt down a water pistol and spray the dress from top to bottom with neat vodka. Initially, it reeks of booze, though I suppose it masks the musty smell. I hang it over a door and return an hour later. It smells much fresher — but this may be in part because it has been hanging outside the wardrobe. I would be wary of doing this on delicate material. STEVE’S VERDICT: Vodka has some benefit in removing stains because it penetrates grease very slightly, but it may affect colour on delicate fabrics such as silk. You’re better off using something like Febreze, which chemically neutralises the odour and is proven to work. THE CLAIM: Pour white vinegar into the washer drawer and run through your empty machine on a hot wash to get rid of bacteria and limescale. DOES IT WORK? I am a bit wary about this. I pour about half a cup of white wine vinegar into the washer drawer, which is black with mould, and then run the machine for an hour at 60 degrees. The door is much cleaner-looking and the machine has lost its slightly fusty smell. STEVE’S VERDICT: White wine vinegar is a good cleaning agent and will have a positive effect on bacteria and limescale build-up. Run the machine empty on the hottest wash once a month, with or without the vinegar, to help keep it clean and fresh. Cleaning the cleaner:  It's vitally important to keep your tumble dryer clean . THE CLAIM: Vacuuming the inside of your tumble dryer will get rid of lint — little bits of fibre that are released from the fabric as it dries and end up as grey fluff. Lint bungs up your tumble dryer and will leave fluff on your clothes. DOES IT WORK? When I look into our tumble dryer I am appalled at the build up of lint around the door. I have a nifty little hand-held Dyson vacuum which I use to remove as much as possible and then wipe away the remainder with a clean dry cloth. There was so much, I could have knitted a fluffy grey jumper with it. STEVE’S VERDICT: This is vitally important. Too much lint blocks the tumble dryer, reduces air flow and, therefore, reduces efficiency. Less air means that garments take longer to dry and so become worn-looking more rapidly. Remove the lint with your hand after every cycle, and give your tumble dryer a really good vacuum once a month. THE CLAIM: Use instant coffee to dye faded jeans black again. The natural dyes in the coffee will make them look as good as new. Some purists make dye from coffee grounds and use buckets to soak it in; others recommend chucking a cup of coffee into the washing machine, though they don’t specify whether it ought to be straight into the drum or powder drawer. DOES IT WORK? My favourite jeans ever are by Guess and were bought circa 1999. While they’re still going strong, you would never know they had once been black. I put them into the machine and throw a cup of very strong instant coffee into the drum. Amazingly, they emerge looking at least five shades darker. And, no, they don’t smell like I’ve spilt my Starbucks down them. STEVE’S VERDICT: This really does work, as coffee contains tannin which will dye the fabric. But I think you’d need buckets of coffee to get a really good result. You might be better off drinking it and investing in a specific clothes dye. Fluffy bedding: Tennis balls in your tumble dryer help to transfer heat to the middle of duvets and pillow cases . THE CLAIM: Washing duvets and pillows can leave the filling flat, but popping them in your tumble dryer with a couple of tennis balls apparently rejuvenates them. DOES IT WORK? Having never actually washed a duvet, I am first forced to do so in order that I can draw a comparison. So I am able to confirm that, yes, adding the tennis balls do make a great deal of difference. My duvet is gorgeously thick and soft when it comes out. STEVE’S VERDICT: This is fantastic. Usually the shell of the duvet dries, but not the inside. The tennis balls in your tumble dryer help transfer heat into the middle of the duvet and, together with the tumbling action, results in fluffy bedding. THE CLAIM: You don’t have to dry-clean silk. Instead, hand-wash it using ordinary powder, dry till damp, then pop it in the freezer to kill germs and loosen grease. When it’s frozen, just iron it, then hang it up again. DOES IT WORK? My beautiful cream silk Burberry scarf acquired a green stain at a party five years ago and I have been too idle to take it to the dry cleaners. I carefully wash it in my normal Fairy non-bio, lie it flat to dry, then pop it into the freezer on top of a family-size box of fish fingers. Not so n-ice: Your freezer is never going to be as good as a dry cleaner . When I remove it two hours later, the scarf is stiff with ice and cracks ominously. Nervously, I gently iron it on the  silk setting. But not only is the stain still there, the scarf actually looks less clean than it did before — placing it on the coloured cardboard of the fish finger box perhaps wasn’t the best idea, as it’s transferred some ink on to the material —  and the expensive sheen is completely gone. STEVE’S VERDICT: Sorry, but your freezer is never going to be as good as your dry-cleaner. The surface of silk may look powdery if you wash it too aggressively because the surface fibre breaks up very slightly. Silk is also not colour-fast. This means that the dye  isn’t very well chemically bonded to the fibre and may come out. THE CLAIM: Adding two tablespoons of table salt to the drawer of the washing machine will brighten colours as salt chemically reacts with detergent and makes it more powerful. It will also ‘exfoliate’ stains away. DOES IT WORK? I pop in some Saxa table salt along with a couple of my five-year-old daughter’s once luridly neon dresses, which are now a grubby off-yellow. After a 40c wash they look slightly brighter, but not eye-wateringly so. STEVE’S VERDICT: This will have some effect as table salt does react with detergent. However, two tablespoons won’t make much difference — you could try four. Certain delicate fabrics such as silk and wool will be destroyed by this, but it’s worth a go on cotton. Milk magic: Milk only slightly fades Biro stains . THE CLAIM: Milk gets Biro off clothes, possibly because of the lactic acid  it contains. DOES IT WORK? My nine-year-old has just been given a ‘pen licence’ at school. In . theory, this means that he is able to write neatly; in practice, . everything is stained with Biro. It is almost the end of the school year, so I am not paying much attention to how pristine the children’s uniform looks. Nonetheless, . I take a white vest that is stained with blue ink and soak it in some . semi-skimmed West Country milk. An hour later I rinse it. The Biro . smudge fades slightly but doesn’t disappear. STEVE’S VERDICT: . Biro is one of the hardest things to get out. Specialist stain remover . is probably going to be more effective than relying on the small amount . of lactic acid in milk. THE CLAIM: Soak greying whites in hot water into which you’ve dissolved five aspirin tablets. DOES IT WORK? My five-year-old’s new white socks are completely grey within a week. I dissolve five Anadin into a bowl and leave the socks for two hours. The water is filthy but the socks remain determinedly grey. STEVE’S VERDICT: Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which might act like a bleach. However, this is such a negligible amount that nothing is likely to happen. Five hundred pills might have some effect! For whites, I’d recommend using detergents with optical brightening agents. These reflect UV light as white light so that clothes look lighter. Whitening products also contain colour-safe bleaching agents.","Alice Robinson's three children and husband produce ton of laundry .

"By . Sophie Borland . A blood test for Alzheimer's disease that would diagnose patients several years earlier than current methods has been developed . A blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that would diagnose patients several years earlier than current methods has been developed by British scientists. It would enable sufferers to plan for the future and to spend more time with their loved ones before their memory fades. Crucially, researchers also hope it will pave the way for a cure by selecting patients in the very early stages of the illness to test new drugs. There have been few breakthroughs for Alzheimer’s over the past decade and many treatments which initially showed promise did not work when tested on large groups of patients. Scientists now think this is because by the time patients were given the drugs, the illness was too far advanced for them to have any effect. By diagnosing victims earlier, researchers can test drugs they hope are capable of slowing  or halting the illness before it takes hold. The new test, developed by a team at King’s College London, works by monitoring the levels of ten proteins in the blood, or biomarkers, which are raised in Alzheimer’s patients. A trial on 1,148 elderly patients found that it was 88 per cent  accurate in predicting which  of them went on to develop  the disease. The researchers believe the test will be ready to be used on patients in the NHS within  two to five years at a cost of several hundred pounds a time.In recent months scientists  have unveiled a number of blood tests that give early warning of Alzheimer’s, including one developed by Italian researchers based in Rome and another by an American team based in Washington DC. But the British researchers  say their test is more advanced and has been tried on many  more patients. It would be  used on elderly patients with intermittent memory problems, which could be simply due to  old age or else the early signs  of Alzheimer’s. Professor Simon Lovestone, who led the British study, said: ‘Alzheimer’s begins to affect the brain many years before patients are diagnosed. Sir Terry Pratchett became a patron of Alzheimer's Research UK in 2008 and donated the charity £1m however last week he said 'The Embuggerance' was finally catching up with him . ‘Many of our drug trials fail because by the time patients are given the drugs, the brain has been too severely affected. ‘A simple blood test could help us identify patients at a much earlier stage to take part in new trials and hopefully develop treatments which could prevent the progression of the disease.’ Around 800,000 Britons have been diagnosed with dementia, including Alzheimer’s, but this will rise to one million within a decade due to the ageing population. There is no cure. The British scientists, whose research is published in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia, will now carry out further studies on their test on up to 10,000 patients to check that it works and to make it more accurate. Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Finding a way to detect dementia before symptoms develop would revolutionise research into the condition. ‘However, this research does not mean that a blood test for dementia is just around the corner. Accuracy would need to be improved before it could be a useful diagnostic test.","Enable sufferers to plan for the future and spend more time with loved ones .

"By . Mark Prigg . It looks uncannily like the R2-D2 robot from the Star Wars films, but in fact this roving robot is already hard at work in a Pittsburgh hospital, zapping superbugs. The robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), all of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments.

The newest UV robot, nicknamed 'Violet,' was recently given to UPMC Passavant by the Passavant Hospital Foundation. Since February, the health system has used UV robots in a pilot project at three of its other hospitals – UPMC Presbyterian, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC Shadyside – and is considering them for additional hospitals. 'Hospital-associated infections are an issue nationwide and preventing them at UPMC hospitals is a top priority. Video Source YouTube . 'These robots, coupled with our many other infection prevention measures, are an important tool in ensuring patient safety. We are grateful to the Passavant Hospital Foundation for helping us to expand their use,' said Tami Minnier, chief quality officer of UPMC. 'The robot enhances the cleaning done by our employees. The robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), all of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments. Using a variety of methods, high-energy ultraviolet light in the area of the spectrum known as UV-C is produced by either mercury or xenon gas lamps. This UV-C energy passes through the cell walls of bacteria, viruses and bacterial spores. Once the UV-C energy is inside the microorganism, it is absorbed by the DNA, RNA and proteins. One of the primary mechanisms of damage created by UV-C is the fusing of the strands of DNA creating what is known as 'thymine dimers.' Once the DNA is fused, the organism can no longer replicate and is, therefore, no longer infectious. The technical term for this is 'deactivation.' 'The robot does not scrub surfaces or remove dirt; it kills microscopic germs that can be missed in even the most thorough cleaning,' said Joseph Romano, M.D., UPMC infectious disease physician. Previous peer-reviewed studies at hospitals outside the UPMC system have shown that UV robots reduce bacterial contamination in hospital rooms by as much as 95 percent and cut hospital-associated infections by more than half. Robots at work: The gadget raises its 'head' before emitting pulses of UV light . Healthcare associated infections, or superbugs, are infections acquired by patients during the course of receiving care for another condition, and can be contracted in a variety of ways. These infections, such as MRSA and C. diff, can be devastating and even deadly, and affect approximately 1 out of every 20 patients. In the U.S. each year, more people die from a lack of hospital infection control than from AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined, and have an estimated annual cost of $40 billion.","Emits UV light to penetrate through the cell walls of bacteria and viruses and destroy their DNA .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s more often than not thought that consuming more energy will ultimately have an increasingly negative effect on the environment. But is that necessarily the case? Experts have argued that increased energy consumption might actually be good, because we’ll be less dependent on nature. They argue that human innovation and ingenuity will eventually pull through and save us from a future climate-related disaster. A paper called 'Our high-energy planet' says that decoupling our planet from the environment means we can consume more and more energy without damaging the environment. As we move to more cleaner forms of energy such as solar (shown), we are beginning to decouple ourselves from environmental impact . The comments were made in a paper called ‘Our high-energy planet’, which was discussed at the think tank Breakthough Institute Dialogue 2014 in California in late June. A team of scientists has discovered that a giant 'burp' of carbon dioxide from the North Pacific Ocean helped trigger the end of last ice age, around 17,000 years ago.The recent study, led by Dr James Rae of the University of St Andrews in Scotland, found that changes in ocean circulation in the North Pacific caused a massive outpouring of CO2. This was released from the deep ocean into the atmosphere, helping to warm the planet sufficiently to trigger the end of the ice age. Previously, scientists have suggested that the Antarctic Ocean and North Atlantic were the only places likely to release CO2 as a result of glaciers retreating, due to their deep water formation. However, a change in rainfall over the North Pacific region caused by the East Asian monsoon and the westerly storm track made the ocean surface saltier and less buoyant, allowing it to form deep water, say the scientists. This resulted in CO2 stored in the deep Pacific being released into the atmosphere, where it helped warm the planet and melt back the ice sheets that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. The paper says that a massive expansion of energy systems in the Southern Hemisphere is turning our world into a high-energy planet. But, the authors say, this is not necessarily a bad thing. As we move to more cleaner forms of energy such as solar, wind and hydro, we are beginning to decouple ourselves from environmental impact. ‘The way we produce and use energy will become increasingly clean not by limiting its consumption, but by using expanded access to energy to unleash human ingenuity in support of innovating toward an equitable, low-carbon global energy system,’ say the researchers. Thus, as our sources of energy become cleaner and greener, there is not necessarily any reason to reduce the amount of energy we consume, once it is coming from the right source. In Germany, for example, 5.3 per cent of the country’s energy in 2013 was provided by solar power. By 2020 they estimate 35 per cent of their energy will be from renewable sources, rising to 100 per cent by 2050. The one major issue could be the boom in energy consumption from countries in developing nations but, the experts say, providing them with the right knowledge could prevent any further ecological disaster. This graph shows the rate at which the populations of various countries have increased in their access to electricity. It shows how the entire populations of places like the U.S. and UK have had access to electricity for some time, but other developing countries are only now going through an electricity boom . Innovation is the key to reducing emissions while expanding energy access, the experts claim. For instance, in order to reduce energy poverty within their borders, China and India are pioneering the use of advanced nuclear generation (pictured) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) More than one billion people globally lack access to electricity, and . billions more burn wood and dung for their basic energy needs. The . report outlines a radically new framework for meeting the energy needs . of the global poor. According to the authors, the massive expansion of . energy systems, mainly carried out in the rapidly urbanising global . South, is the only robust, coherent, and ethical response to the global . challenges we face, climate change among them. 'The time has come to . embrace a high-energy planet,' they write. Innovation is the key to reducing emissions while expanding energy . access, they claim. For instance, in order to reduce energy poverty within their . borders, China and India are pioneering the use of advanced nuclear . generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS). ‘It will take tremendous effort, capital, and political will to ensure that the ongoing expansionof the energy sector in developing nations provides all people with access to energy they can afford as soon as possible, and to support efforts that will make that energy progressively cleaner,' the researchers write. ‘Rather than limiting energy access and consumption on the basis of their potential climate change impacts, a coherent strategy for human development begins with the assumption that energy equity is necessary for a just, prosperous, and environmentally sustainable society.' And, they conclude, the negative climate effects of moving towards a high-energy planet can be negated, as long as humanity decouples its power consumption from the environment. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Despite the condition not officially being recognised until the 19th century, cases of Down’s syndrome have existed throughout human history. References in archaeological records are extremely rare, but researchers from France believe they have found a child's skull showing the earliest signs of the disorder dating back to the 5th century. The body of the child was also found buried in the same position and location as others in the necropolis - and archaeologists believe this means the five- to seven-year-old wouldn't have been stigmatised or treated any differently when they were alive. The body of a five- to seven-year-old (pictured left) was found in a 5th century necropolis in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes. Researchers used CT scans to examine the skull (pictured right), and this revealed features including a flattened occiput at the back of the skull and tooth inflammation that are consistent with Down's syndrome . The remains were found by archaeologists from the University of Bordeaux in a necropolis that dates back to the 5th century. The sex of the child is unknown. They were placed in the grounds of a church in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes in Eastern France. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that delays a person's growth and causes intellectual disability. People . with Down's syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, rather than . two. The condition was first detailed by English physician John Langdon Down in . 1862. He later characterised it as a mental disability in a widely published report in 1866. Despite . the lack of evidence in archaeological records, a number of historical . artwork is believed to portray Down's syndrome including the 16th century . painting The Adoration of the Christ Child. An infant showing facial signs of the condition is painted in the background. This latest case represents the earliest and youngest example of the condition in the archaeological record. Prior . to this, a possible case in a 9-year-old child from England, dating . back to 700 to 900, was found with a selection of consistent features. Using a combination of morphological and radiographic techniques, metrical data and scans, the skull of the child was compared with those belonging to people of similar age and location. They found the skull exhibited signs of brachycrany and metopism, in which the skull is short and broad with a disfigurement of the forehead. There was also evidence that the rear of the skull was flattened, and the teeth were inflamed. This combination of features is consistent with modern-day diagnoses of Down’s syndrome. Although less diagnostic, but important when taken in combination with the other features, the researchers also noted an absence of the frontal sinuses, a small face, low and thin mandibular ramus - jawbone running below each ear - and dental defects. According to the archaeologists, cases of Down’s syndrome in past populations are rare, frequently poorly described or discovered out of context. This case, therefore, represents the earliest and youngest example of the condition in the archaeological record. Although less diagnostic, but as important when taken in combination with the other features, the researchers also noted an absence of the frontal sinuses, a small face, low and thin mandibular ramus - jawbone running below each ear - and dental defects (pictured) The necropolis was in the grounds of a church in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes (pictured). The child was on its back, facing east to west. Other bodies discovered in the necropolis were found in the same position, suggesting the child's burial was no different - and archaeologists believe this means the infant wasn't stigmatised . Prior to this, a possible case in a nine-year-old child from England, dating back to 700 to 900 AD was found with a selection of these features. Elsewhere, . Professor Maïté Rivollat and his colleagues at the university also . noted that the context and funerary treatment of the child suggests that . they were was not stigmatised by other members of the community. For example, the child was placed on its back in the tomb, facing from east to west, with the head at the westward end. According to archaeologists, cases of Down's syndrome in past populations are rare, and this latest case is the earliest on record. Despite the lack of evidence in archaeological records, a number of artwork is believed to portray Down's syndrome, including the 16th century painting The Adoration of the Christ Child (pictured) Other . bodies discovered in the necropolis were found in the same position, . suggesting that the child’s burial was no different – and archaeologists . believe this meant the infant wouldn’t have been treated any . differently when they were alive. The cause of death, however, is unknown. ‘The results of our [study] lead us to conclude that the Saint-Jean-des-Vignes cranial skeleton reflects an individual who suffered from Down syndrome. ‘To our knowledge, this child represents the earliest and youngest case of this pathology. ‘It should be emphasised that, unlike previous published cases, the archaeological context is well known here, and provides evidence that this child was treated like the healthy members of the community.’ The child's skull was compared to the average skull of people of a similar age and location. This diagram reveals the differences and demonstrates the flattened rear .","Skull of the five to seven-year-old child was found in 5th century necropolis .

"By . Chris Pleasance . An Indian Jaguar owner has taken to driving round town in his new car with it being pulled by donkeys because he says it is the only way to make it move. Businessman Rahul Thackreym, 38, who lives in India's western Ahmedabad city came up with the idea after the brand new £53,000 car repeatedly broke down. He claims he went back to the dealership to get the Jaguar XJ model fixed on several occasions, but as soon as one problem was fixed, another cropped up. Indian businessman Rahul Thackreym, 38, hitched his brand new £53,000 Jaguar XJ up to donkeys and had them pull the car around after complaining that it kept breaking down . He said: 'I was fed up with going back and getting them to put things right only to have something else go wrong. 'In order to make sure I could at least still use it and to let the dealer know what I thought of their cars, I came up with the idea of having it towed around by donkeys. 'Basically, a donkey it seems is more reliable than a Jaguar.' He added: 'In my opinion, this car is worse than a sardine tin on wheels. 'I have taken it to many authorised dealers and garages but it has not helped me. It has so many problems I can't even list them all.' Mr Thackreym said the car was . He said that he had bought the car on May 7 when the trouble started: 'The lights first went off, I asked them for a change. They had no lights. I screamed, they changed the lights. 'Then the bumper fell off and it got repaired in 10 days when it is mandatory to repair it in 48 hours. And that was just the start. 'My family joked that it would have been better to buy a donkey cart, and actually I thought that wasn't a bad idea, so I got a few animals sent round and hitched up to the car.'

"By . Jack Doyle . and Matt Chorley . Nearly 100 suspected war criminals applied to stay in Britain last year – and barely a handful have been sent home. The figures prompted warnings that this country could be turned in to a ‘retirement home’ for torturers and murderers. Some 800 suspected war criminals have applied to remain here over the last eight years. Checks: Of the 99 suspects, three were deported last year, 20 were refused asylum and 46 had their citizenship bids turned down but are likely to have remained in the UK (file picture) However, human rights laws invariably . mean that the worse their crimes, the more difficult it is to send them . home. After confessing what they have done, war criminals can then claim . they face death or torture if they were to be returned home. They use Articles 2 and 3 of the Human . Rights Act – the right to life and the prohibition of torture – to . insist they must be allowed to stay. The figures, released under the . Freedom of Information Act, showed applications from nationals of . Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Rwanda, Serbia and Sri Lanka. Most of . the cases are thought to involve those who have been living in Britain . for a number of years. Critics are now demanding they are put on trial – . or are removed from the country. The figures, published by the BBC, . show that in the 15 months from January 2012, Home Office officials . researched hundreds of individuals applying for asylum who were . suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Genocide: Some of those refused British citizenship were linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people were massacred and thousands more refugees died . In 99 cases, . officials suggested they should not be granted asylum, citizenship or . leave to remain in the UK. However, of the 99 suspects, just . three were deported. Even those who were refused asylum are likely to . have remained in the UK under human rights rules. MUGABE HENCHMAN . In 2011 it emerged that Phillip Machemedze had been  allowed to stay in the UK – despite torturing critics of Robert Mugabe’s regime in Zimbabwe. He smashed one victim’s jaw with a pair of pliers and pulled out his teeth. But he was given the right to stay in case he faced ill treatment in Zimbabwe. Machemedze, 49, earned £151,000 while working illegally in the UK for seven years as a carer for those with learning disabilities and for drug and alcohol addicts. THE DARFUR MILITIAMAN . Mohamed Salim (right) claimed he helped ‘wipe out entire villages’ in his native Sudan. But he was allowed to stay here - because sending him home might put his life in danger. The former fighter in the Janjaweed militia is living on benefits in a semi-detached house in Handsworth, Birmingham. THE SERBIAN SOLDIER . Milan Sarcevic, 60, is accused of taking part in one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war, the 1991 Vukovar massacre when 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave. Last year, nine years after he came here, an immigration judge said evidence of his role in the atrocity was ‘not conclusive’, and said he must be allowed to stay because of his right to family life. Earlier figures suggested more than . 700 suspected war criminals were identified by UK immigration officials . between 2005 and 2012. James Smith of the Aegis Trust, which . campaigns against international war crimes and genocide, called for . prosecutions  to take place in the UK. ‘There’s a cost and it is difficult to . investigate crimes which took place in another country a long time ago. But if we don’t pursue those prosecutions, the UK could become known as . a retirement home for war criminals,’ he said. Michael McCann MP, chairman of a . cross-party anti-genocide group, called for greater transparency over . war criminals living here. He said: ‘I have deep concerns that . the Home Office isn’t being as forthright as it could be and I think we . should be drilling down into these cases in order to give the public . that security.’ In May, five Rwandan men were arrested . in Britain over suspected involvement in the 1994 genocide in the . country in which an estimated 800,000 people lost their lives. Three are . still in custody but two were freed on bail. Some of the men, who deny involvement in the genocide, have been in Britain for more than a decade. One was found working in a care home in Essex. In 2009, an attempt to extradite four . of the men failed after High Court judges ruled there was ‘a real risk’ they would not get a fair trial in Rwanda. One survivor of the Rwandan genocide, . Beatha Uwazaninka, told the BBC that the thought of meeting a Rwandan . war criminal ‘living happily ever after’ in the UK caused her ‘great . pain’. ‘It is very sad especially for survivors who have gone through so . much,’ she said. ‘If they cannot send the criminals to . Rwanda, at least they can be tried in the UK. It is sending a message . that wherever you go you will face the consequences of what you have . done.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Anyone . accused of these crimes should be put on trial in their home country and . we will always seek to return them to face justice.’","Warning Britain could be 'retirement home' for torturers and murderers .

"By . Misty White Sidell . It has taken 30 years of diligent collecting for David Bailey to amass 15,000 Hawaiian shirts – the world’s largest collection. Mr Bailey, the owner of Bailey's Antiques and Aloha Shirts in Honolulu Hawaii, says that he loves Hawaiian shirts, not only because they are a worthwhile investment, but also because they are a cool alternative to formal menswear. ‘I never understood suits. I don’t even own a tie. They’re creepy, actually, if you think about it. They turn people into little robot ants,’ the 69-year-old told Opening Ceremony’s blog in an interview. Biggest collector: David Bailey (pictured second from right) owns the world's largest Hawaiian shirt collection, which he sells out of his store in Honolulu . ‘When you wear a Hawaiian shirt it allows you to express yourself,’ he added of the style, which has recently been reinterpreted by high fashion labels like Prada and Dries Van Noten. Mr Bailey’s interest in prized vintage ‘aloha shirts’ as he calls them, started off as an accident – quite literally. He survived a 1,000-foot fall from a building – after which point he sold the jewelry store he had been managing in Santa Barbara to start collecting the shirts because they were both cheap and festive. Once he amassed a collection of 1,000 he transported the shirts to Waikiki in 1980 and opened a store, which would later move to Honolulu. Massive inventory: Mr Bailey's many shirts are priced up to $25,000 as many original Hawaiian shirts were hand painted and one-of-a-kind . Worthy investment: Mr Bailey says that the value of his shirts have only soared as he has owned them - making them a much more worthy investment than stocks . Its fans include Nicolas Cage, Anthony Bourdain, and Jimmy Buffett – the latter of which bought $20,000 worth of shirts from the store and has worn many of them on stage. Mr Bailey's most expensive shirts cost up to $25,000 and he says that vintage Hawaiian shirts are so expensive because many of them are wearable art. Early styles from the Forties were hand painted and enlisted artisanal stitching techniques. Prime location: Mr Bailey's store (pictured) is located near the water in Honolulu - the birthplace of the modern Hawaiian shirt . Like snowflakes: As Mr Bailey's collection points out - no two Hawaiian shirts are the same, and many include interesting details . Now, thanks to modern technology, many of these prints have been recreated on contemporary Hawaiian shirts, rather than hiring artists to create new landscapes and floral motifs – making the mass-produced fare much cheaper. Because of this, Mr Bailey says that the original aloha shirts (those created prior to the Sixties) have a bigger financial return ‘than the stocks I pick which all uniformly go down.’","David Bailey of Honolulu, Hawaii has spent the last 30 years collecting 15,000 Aloha shirts .

Insistent: Brittany Norwood, who says she is pregnant with a married Houston Texans player, has stood by her story after recordings emerged of her denying the claims in a phone conversation . But now, in an interview with KHOU, Norwood has stood by her initial claims. But she has conceding that, although Foster pressured her, he never used the word 'abortion'. 'I don't take back anything I’ve ever . said,' she said. 'I've been through a lot. I have. But I'm staying . strong, and I'm going to be a great mother.' Norwood’s attorney, Doug York, confirmed . that she did make the statements in the recording. He said she was just . trying to calm the waters with her ex-boyfriend ahead of the trial. Norwood says she started dating Foster about a year ago and fell . in love with him without ever knowing he had a wife and two children. Lawsuit: Norwood is suing Arian Foster (pictured), who plays for the Houston Texans, for child support and for causing 'severe emotional distress' after claiming he pressured her to get an abortion . No idea: According to Norwood, she didn't know . that Foster was married during the year they dated. On the right, Foster . is pictured with his daughter in Venice Beach, California . When she got pregnant, she says Foster and members of his family started harassing her about an abortion. 'He's . like, ""You can't have this, you can’t have this kid, like, we cannot . bring a child into this, like, think about my kids,""' Norwood told KHOU. Foster also allegedly pushed the abortion issue in a series of text messages. 'You . just can't bring a life into this world under these circumstances. It's . not fair to anyone. It's not just about you,' one message read, . according to Norwood. Norwood says that Foster has . refused to help her with medical bills, forcing her to to go on medicaid . despite his 'vast financial resources'. In the lawsuit, Norwood said she wants Foster to submit to DNA testing to prove his paternity so he can pay child support. Defiant: The University of Houston senior, 20, says that she will be keeping the baby boy . Support: Norwood's mother, Danna Sellers, said the two plan to feature in a reality TV show about hot mothers and daughters - and insisted the show would have nothing to do with Foster's baby . Norwood . is seeking damages because his behavior pushing for an abortion caused . her to 'suffer severe emotional distress'. She also wants a restraining . order against Foster. In . response to the lawsuit, Foster filed for a gag order to be placed on . Norwood who he says is planning to star in a reality show about being . pregnant with his child. Norwood . acknowledged that she was due to film a reality show called the . 'Blondashian' but that it was never supposed to be about her pregnancy . with Foster's child. She says the show was going to be focused on hot moms and their hot daughters, and she planned to shoot it with her mother. There's still a possibility the reality show could happen, she said.

"By . Nicholas Pisa . Dozens of baggage handlers working for Italian airline Alitalia have been arrested in an operation to clamp down on suitcase thefts. The 29 were held in dawn raids across the country while another 57 workers were also taken in for questioning as part of the police blitz which was codenamed 'Operation Clean Holds'. It followed a year long surveillance operation at eight airports across Italy but specifically targeting the main airport in Rome after 'tens of thousands of Euros' of items were stolen from suitcases which had been forced open after being taken from aircraft baggage holds. Crackdown: Dozens of baggage handlers working for Italian airline Alitalia have been arrested in an operation to clamp down on suitcase thefts . Operation: The 29 were held in dawn raids across the country while another 57 workers were also taken in for questioning as part of the police blitz which was codenamed 'Operation Clean Holds' Officers said they launched the investigation in cooperation with Alitalia after the airline received numerous complaints from passengers - both national and international - that suitcases had not arrived on baggage carousels or had been forced open and in some cases items stolen. Police said bottles of alcohol, cash and electronic goods as well as designer clothes were among items taken by the thieves who worked in unison with other baggage handlers across Italy in Milan, Naples, Venice and Lamezia Terme often sharing information on the best techniques to steal suitcases. In a statement police said that 29 had been bailed pending further investigations while another 57 workers were told they had to report to police stations on a daily basis, again while enquiries continued. Hunt: It followed a year long surveillance operation at eight airports across Italy . Focus: The operation specifically targeted the main airport in Rome after 'tens of thousands of Euros' of items were stolen from suitcases which had been forced open after being taken from aircraft baggage holds . Discovery: Alitalia after the airline received numerous complaints from passengers - both national and international . Alitalia said: 'During 2012 our security department worked in collaboration with police in Rome and Lamezia Terme in the study and development of an investigation which had the objective of identifying those responsible for a growing number of baggage thefts from Alitalia passengers.' The airline added that the cooperation meant that the operation 'culminated in this important result, which has led to the arrests of those presumed responsible,' and concluded by saying that ''Alitalia will continue to give total collaboration with the police and the judiciary.' Rome airport police chief Antonio Greco said: 'This was a very significant operation which has led to several arrests as well as people being questioned in connection with these thefts. Those convicted face six years in jail and they will obviously lose their jobs. The thefts totalled hundreds of thousnds of Euros and there were more than 100 across the country.' Launch: Officers said they launched the investigation in cooperation with Alitalia after the airline received numerous complaints that suitcases had not arrived on baggage carousels (file photo) He explained that surveillance cameras had been installed inside baggage holds on planes to catch those breaking open suitcases but Mr Greco also added that the recording devices did not affect aircraft safety. Italian airports have a reputation for baggage thefts and there are regular police operations to clamp down on the crime wave with one of the most famous taking place in 2002 when more than 40 were arrested and footage was revealed with employees picking up suitcases breaking them open and helping themselves to items inside.","Today 29 baggage handlers working for Italian airline Alitalia were arrested .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Chris Christie, the charismatic and hard-charging Republican who has seen partisan pressure ratcheted up as he contemplates a run for the presidency, ignored his swirling abuse-of-power scandals Tuesday as he began his second term as New Jersey's governor. He spoke only generally of a governing philosophy prefers substantive discussion to the hardscrabble slap-fests that make up much of Garden State politics. 'We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington, D.C.,' he said, 'the attitude that says, ""I am always right and you are always wrong,"" the attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave, the attitude that puts political victories ahead of policy agreements.' He also referred to his obligation as governor to deal head-on with controversy, speaking of 'solemn obligations to make the hard decisions, to raise the uncomfortable topics, to require responsibility and accountability, to be willing to stand hard when principles are being violated and to be willing to compromise to find common ground with all of our people.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Christie begins his second term amid controversy surrounding George Washington Bridge traffic and Hurricane Sandy relief distribution . Morning for the Christies began with a church service in Newark before the governor was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday . Governor Chris Christie kisses his daughter Bridget Christie in front of his family at the War Memorial Theatre in Trenton, New Jersey . A supporter braved the cold to show support for Christie on Tuesday as the inauguration carried on inside . Christie's commitment to that level of accountability has been challenged in recent weeks. His administration was rocked with allegations that top officials arranged for new traffic patterns on the iconic George Washington Bridge as a form of political payback against the Democratic mayor of a nearby town. That gridlock was brought to mind Tuesday as winter storms brought some traffic to a standstill and made many roads too treacherous to travel, causing Christie's team to cancel a planned post-inaugural party on Ellis Island. The irony of traffic concerns becoming great enough to inconvenience Christie loyalists while his office is under investigation for allegedly causing days of traffic chaos wasn't lost on most observers. In addition to the 'Bridgegate' scandal, Christie's lieutenant governor Kim Guadagno stands accused of threatening to withholding Hurricane Sandy reconstruction money from the mayor of Hoboken unless a commercial development that Christie favored was given a green light. Guadagno has forcefully denied the charges. She also received unwelcome attention on Monday when nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis accused her of ending his political aspirations in 2011 when she was the state's attorney general, striking him from a local ballot because he wanted to unseat a longtime Christie ally from the state Senate. Christie's day started with a service at Newark's New Hope Baptist Church before a swearing in and address in Trenton. Christie ignored his own parade of scandals during his inaugural address as legislators and dignitaries watched. Vincent Prieto (first row, 5th from L), the new General Assembly Speaker, is expected to have his knives sharpened for Christie as investigations proceed . Christie's planned post-inauguration celebration was called off because weather conditions on Ellis Island were too treacherous for guests to travel there . But . organizers already canceled the evening party on Ellis Island, a . symbolic spot synonymous with the promise of the United States, because snow promised to make travel dangerous. The island where some 12 million immigrants first entered the U.S. is divided between New Jersey and New York, but his party was supposed to be held in a hall on the New York side. Food prepared for the party will instead be donated to food pantries in the Jersey City area. Money collected for the $500 tickets to the inaugural celebration, and other contributions, will be used to help support three charities: Save Ellis Island, The New Hope Baptist Church and New Jersey Heroes, which was founded by first lady Mary Pat Christie. Christie won re-election in November by a 22-point margin over state Sen. Barbara Buono, a Democrat. Then: Christie started his term as the head of New Jersey after being elected in November 2009 (pictured) Warm reception: This fall, Christie won his re-election in a 22-point landslide . The Republican governor built a national following as a blunt-talking and often funny politician who strove to show that he could find common ground with Democrats on some key issues, including overhauling the state's public-worker pension program and making it easier to fire underperforming teachers. Christie became a fixture in speculation about who would seek the 2016 presidential nomination with his leadership after Superstorm Sandy slammed into his state in October 2012. He worked with President Barack Obama and took on Republican members of Congress who were reluctant to approve record levels of aid for storm victims, receiving high marks from his constituents and plentiful national attention. But his reputation has been battered since revelations this month that an appointee and a close aide appear to have ordered two of three approach lanes to the George Washington Bridge from the town of Fort Lee shut down for four days in September. The move was allegedly political retribution against Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christie for re-election. The U.S. attorney's office and two state legislative committees are now investigating. In the spotlight: Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno (pictured with Christie today) has been blamed in the latest scandal, but she denies ever having threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds . Carl Lewis, the legendary Olympic sprinter and long-jumper and native New Jerseyan, has put Lt. Gov. Guadagno in the hot seat with claims that she ordered his name off an election ballot in 2011 in order to protect a sitting state Senator who was close to Gov. Christie . Christie has apologized, denied any involvement with or knowledge of the plot and fired a deputy chief of staff at the center of the controversy. But questions have continued. Christie's administration also faces an allegation from the Democratic mayor of Hoboken that it tied the delivery of Superstorm Sandy aid to the low-lying city of 50,000 across from Manhattan to support for a prime real estate project. Mayor Dawn Zimmer said she was told by Guadagno that the ultimatum came directly from Christie. Guadagno strongly denied those claims Monday and described them as 'false' and 'illogical.' 'Any suggestion that Sandy funds were tied to the approval of any project in New Jersey is completely false,' Ms Guadagno said. In his re-election campaign, Christie did not make big new promises but said he would continue to work on recovery from Sandy, seek tax cuts and push for other previous priorities with which the Democrat-controlled Legislature has not been willing to go along. Christie has not ruled out a 2016 presidential run and has taken a more visible role on the national stage after accepting the position as the head of the Republican Governors Association. He spent this weekend down in Florida, and was feted by billionaire Republican donor and Home Depot co-founder Kenneth Langone who held a fundraiser in Christie’s honor.","'We .

He also led them in the Serenity Prayer, saying: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.' Madison's older sister Ashley struggled to contain her tears as she called her sister 'the best snuggle buddy I could have asked for'.

"By . Louise Boyle . and Lydia Warren . Tragedy: Authorities have confirmed that the remains Avonte Oquendo, 14, have been found . Human remains found washed up on a New York beach do belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo, the New York City medical examiner's office has confirmed. The identification of the remains, using DNA taken from the 14-year-old's family, was made as his mother, Vanessa Fontaine, said she plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the city. Attorney David Perecman said he will file . the legal claim on behalf of the family of Avonte, whose . remains were found at the edge of the East River last week. A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker . were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said . the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went . missing in October. The city's medical examiner's office announced on Tuesday that the remains belong to Avonte, but said it needed further time to determine the cause and manner of his death. Mr Perecman said Ms Fontaine was inconsolable after being notified of the findings on Tuesday afternoon. The news brings the three-month search for the missing student to a devastating conclusion for his family, who had rallied hundreds of volunteers to try to find him after he ran away from Riverview High School in Long Island City on October 4. The family first said in October that they would sue the city claiming he was not supervised properly. On Monday, the family said that, if the body was identified as Avonte's, they feared foul play because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear. The family's lawyer, Mr Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand. Scroll down for video . Search: An arm, torso and legs were discovered along the Queens shoreline on Thursday and authorities said the clothes found were similar to those worn by Avonte when he vanished three months ago . Investigation: The skeletal remains were removed by the medical examiner (pictured) last week, but further investigations are needed to determine the cause and manner of the boy's death . Avonte Oquendo disappeared from his Long Island City school, New York on October 4. The remains were found on a Queens beach nine miles from where he was last seen . 'If it is him, what that indicates to . me is that something happened,' Mr Perecman said on Monday, before the . confirmation of identity. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't . say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?' The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen. For months, the boy's family organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing . posters on the subway and in stores and raised a $95,000 reward. In . particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager was fascinated . with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even . played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy. Runaway: CCTV footage shows Avonte running through the corridors of his school on October 4 . On camera: Avonte left his school on October 4 through a security door that had been left open . Unknown: Avonte is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight. After his disappearance, his family launched a massive search . The . 14-year-old was thought to be particularly vulnerable because his type . of autism left him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. There were a few sightings of . teenage boys who closely resembled Avonte, raising the family's hopes as they continued to search. A Department of Education investigation was also launched into how the autistic boy managed to get out of his special needs school and how teaching staff handled his disappearance. Avonte's . mother, along with police, were not informed of his disappearance until . at least an hour after he ran from the school building. Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives at a vigil for her son on October 11 in Queens. The missing boy's family have been informed of the discovery of human remains .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Texas woman who is among the 100 million affected by December’s massive Target stores security breach says she’s since received a credit card in the mail that bears another woman’s photo. Houston dermatologist Lauren Campbell learned that someone had opened lines of credit in her name at multiple area retailers just days after Target said her confidential information may have been compromised. After spending weeks trying to preserve her identity, Campbell received the shocking piece of mail this past weekend: a Costco American Express card in her name but with the face of someone else. Shocked: A Houston woman whose personal information was hacked as part of December's massive Target breach received a Costco American Express card bearing another woman's photo over the weekend . Connected? Dermatologist Lauren Campbell says she's been battling an identity thief since just days after learning Target may have leaked her sensitive information . ‘I’m looking at the card,’ she recalled to KHOU. ‘And I turned it over and there’s her picture.’ While there is no direct link between the information stolen from Target and her most recent troubles, what matters to Campbell now is bringing the nightmare to a close. ‘Someone’s gone to like 20 stores and pretended to be me,’ she said. ‘They have a fake ID. They have a fake social security card. I mean, it’s just horrible.’ Campbell isn’t the only consumer who fears her hacked information has or will lead to thefts. Where's the info? Up to 110 million Target customers were affected in the credit card data heist from its stores at the end of last year and fears linger on that stolen information has landed in the hands of thieves across America . A recent Mexican border bust of a couple carrying dozens of credit cards containing the stolen information of South Texans had authorities fearing a widespread dissemination of the Target information had occurred. While any link between the crimes has since been refuted, further investigation into the Target hack has revealed additional potential victims and roped in retail giant Neiman-Marcus as a second target of December’s breach, according to CNN. In five days, Campbell’s identity thief managed to burn through $30,000 in fraudulently charged diamond rings, children’s toys at Toys R Us and other loot. Speaking out: The thief was able to spend $30,000 with a temporary card before Campbell ever received the shocking evidence. Now she's taken the proof to local news stations to help police nab the culprit . And it was all on a temporary credit card before Campbell received the faked card in the mail. She learned of the charges beforehand and says she spent an estimated 40 hours on the phone sorting out the mess with retailers and police. Then she received the card in the mail and decided to try and bring the culprit to justice. Campbell took her evidence to all her local news stations and asked that they tell her story. ‘Someone out there in my hometown – Houston is my hometown, I’m a native Houstonian – is running around pretending to be me, opening up accounts, charging other people money, using my name to commit crime,’ she said. ‘That really bothers me.’","Houston dermatologist Lauren Campbell says her identity was stolen within days of being informed she was one of the 100 million Target customers affected by December breach .

Each photograph takes about 200 frames and the milk is poured onto different areas of the models body for each one, captured mid-flow by the camera. These individual shots are then amalgamated using Photoshop into a single image, creating the illusion that the girl is wearing a single milk dress. The individual frames are simply layered - but not altered or 'filled in' in any way . Jaroslav who also works with other liquids, says there is no magic behind the pictures, just hard work .

Vladimir Putin pins a medal to the chest of Russia's most famous skater, Yevgeny Plushenko, as he meets the country's medal winners at Sochi.

"By . Ruth Styles . After a young woman was brutally gang raped and murdered in December 2012, the endemic violence against women and girls in India became front page news across the world. But as Ross Kemp reveals in his latest documentary, India's rape epidemic is just the tip of the iceberg. The country is also home to a trafficking trade that involves an astonishing 100 million people - 10 per cent of the population - and sees girls as young as nine being sold into the sex trade. Grim: Prostitutes wait for clients on a Mumbai street corner. Many are victims of trafficking . Man on a mission: Ross Kemp delves into India's seedy underbelly in search of traffickers . Among them is 12-year-old Mimoni, who was taken from her West Bengal home by traffickers when she was just 10 years old. Now back with her parents after escaping, Mimoni is one of the few to be reunited with her family - most, sadly, are ostracised, even if they were forced into prostitution against their will. 'He told me he could get me work,' she explains of the day she met the man who would make her life a misery for the next two years. 'I was at school. He promised me food . and a nice job paying two to three thousand rupees (£23) a month.' She agreed to go with him but her dream of a bright future soon turned into a nightmare. 'He would get . drunk, fondle me and rape me everywhere,' she says, facing Kemp and the camera with almost heroic frankness. 'It was anally, vaginally and . orally. It was twice a day for two years. If I complained I was beaten. In the end I escaped.' She adds: 'They [traffickers] are bad people who make lots of girls suffer.' Like Mimoni, the destination for most of the girls is one of India's megalopolises, with Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai among the most popular. Mumbai, India's most populous city, is also home to its largest concentration of sex workers, housed in a red light district that is the largest in Asia. Young: Like these women, photographed on Mumbai's Falkland Road, many victims are in their teens . Exploitation: Shockingly, prostitutes make as little as 23p a time from the men who use them . Here, women, many of them trafficked, are forced to work around the clock, controlled by violent pimps and policed by vicious criminal gangs. And it's not just bandits involved in the trade - local journalists report that the police, local politicians and government officials all get a slice of the lucre. One of the women who work in Mumbai's vice trade is Rajashri, a 27-year-old who was trafficked from village near Bangalore as a 12-year-old. 'I . was still at school when I was brought here,' she remembers. 'I was promised a job as a . bottle washer. I said OK but they sold me into this dirty trade. 'They . locked me in a room and the customers started coming up and I was a sex . worker.' Speaking of the first 'client' she ever encountered, she says: 'They told him I was a . virgin and he had paid lots of money for that.' Unlike Mimoni, she cannot go home to her family. 'At home, having sex . outside of marriage is taboo,' she explains. 'They would have killed me and thrown my . body in the river.' Victims: Most trafficked girls come from West Bengal, which is poor and has a reputation for beautiful women . Tough job: People in West Bengal make their living in the dangerous brick kilns or as prawn fishermen . But things are scarcely any easier for the families denuded of their daughters, many of whom live in the desperately poor West Bengal region. Among those to have lost their children to traffickers is Johana Sadar, whose 12-year-old daughter has been missing for a . year. 'I was working in the field, I don't know how they got her,' she says of the day her child was taken. 'She . was at home when I left at six in the morning. When I got home at 2pm, she . was gone. She was nowhere to be found.' Now, Mrs Sadar fears that her daughter is in the hands of a pimp. 'I'm . afraid she's been sold and I don't know what they are making her do,' she says as tears roll down her lined cheeks. 'I think she's been sold. What else? What else apart from the sex . trade could it be? 'I hope she comes back. I am desperate for her to come back. Only God knows what is happening to her.' With 20,000 girls trafficked from West Bengal every year alone, according to Indian government statistics, the chances of Mrs Sadar's daughter living a safe and happy life elsewhere would appear to be slim. Ross Kemp: Extreme World, tonight at 9pm on Sky One .","An estimated 100 million people are thought to be involved in trafficking .
Most kidnapped children become domestic staff or enter the sex trade .
Majority of girls come from West Bengal where 20,000 vanish each year ."
"By . Snejana Farberov . Brave: Tyler Doohan, 8, perished in a trailer home fire in western New York while trying to rescue his grandfather and disabled uncle . A community in western New York is in mourning the death of an 8-year-old boy who was killed in a trailer fire while attempting to rescue his disabled uncle and grandfather. Cpl. John Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said nine people were in the single-wide mobile home in the town of Penfield when the fire started around 4.45am Monday. The inferno claimed the life of 8-year-old Tyler Doohan, and also killed his grandfather, 57-year-old Louis Beach, and the boy’s amputee uncle, 54-year-old Steven Smith. A dog also perished in the blaze. Sheriff's deputies say Doohan, who was staying in Beach’s trailer overnight, apparently discovered the fire and roused six people who got out safely. Helfer said four adults and two children, ages 4 and 6, were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The Democrat and Chronicle reported that Tyler asked his mother if he could stay with his grandpa at 39 Fondiller Avenue because he knew he was off from school Monday for Martin Luther King Jr Day. A couple of hours before dawn, an electrical fire broke out at the front of the trailer and quickly engulfed the tiny residence that housed nine people who were sound asleep at the time. Tyler Doohan woke up first and alerted six of his relatives, among them two children, who were able to escape. Scroll down for video . Deadly inferno: An electrical fire engulfed Louis Beach's single-wide mobile home in the town of Penfield as nine people slept inside Sunday night . Fearless: Officials say Tyler (left) roused six of his relatives, and then ran back into the burning trailer to rescue his grandfather, 57-year-old Louis Beach (right), and his disabled uncle . Investigators believe the fourth-grader then ran to the back of the trailer where his wheelchair-bound uncle, who was missing a part of his leg, was sleeping. He never made it out of the home. The boy’s other uncle, Joseph Breyette, said his young nephew heard Smith calling for help inside the house and rushed in to get him. ‘The kid has got more guts than I know of,’ Breyette said. ‘I mean to run back in there and go through what he went through to try to save his uncle, what can you say for the kid?  He was a great kid.’ The child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a few feet away from the bed of his disabled uncle, who also perished in the fire along with the homeowner. Fatalities: The raging blaze killed Doohan, his grandfather and amputee uncle, who were unable to flee in time . Horrific find: Tyler's body was found in the rare of the scorched home, just feet away from the bedridden family member he was trying to rescue . The boy's relatives who managed to flee from the trailer were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital with non life threatening injuries. Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler Doohan's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher. 'He saved those other six people,' he said. Neighbors at the trailer park said the reason Louis Beach's mobile home was overcrowded with people Sunday night was because he often welcomed down-on-their-luck relatives who needed a place to stay. Those who knew the family described Tyler as a rambunctious boy who liked playing kickball and tag with other children in the area. Safe haven: Neighbors say Louis Beach was in the habit of letting relatives who didn't have a place to live stay in his home . Makeshift memorial: Tyler's friends and members of the community have been leaving teddy bears, flowers and other tokens in honor of the brave fourth-grader . According to his education records, the child had been in and out of several different schools over the past few years. He was currently enrolled as a fourth-grader in the East Rochester Central School District, where officials called the boy a hero this week. ‘He was the kind of young man who would bend over backwards for anybody. He was a very caring individual always came to school with a smile on his face. Always asking what can I do to help,’ Interim Superintendent Richard Stuntzman Jr told the station WHEC.","Tyler Doohan was found dead in the back of his grandfather's mobile home in Penfield, New York .

Jamie Carrillo posted a YouTube video last Friday where she can be seen calling her alleged teacher rapist Andrea Cardosa at her office in Alhambra Unified School district in California where she was currently working. The now 28-year-old mother said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. Scroll down for video . Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 years old . Jamie Carrillo confronted a teacher on the phone last week whom she alleges sexually abused her when she was 12 years old. She said that she did so as she did not want the woman, who is still a teacher, around other children . In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Andrea Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Actor Hugh Laurie has called for a Russian vodka boycott in protest against Vladimir Putin's comment that gay people are welcome at the Winter Olympics, providing they 'leave children in peace'. In a message to his 300,000 Twitter followers, Laurie, 54, urged vodka drinkers should switch to Polish brands instead. He wrote: 'I'd boycott Russian goods if I could think of a single thing they made besides the rest of the world depressed. Russian vodka is OK if you need to clean the oven. For drinking, it must henceforth be Polish.' Actor Hugh Laurie called for a . Russian Vodka boycott in protest against Vladimir Putin's comment that . gay people are welcome at the Winter Olympics, providing they 'leave . children alone' The Tweet provoked outrage in Russia, quickly becomming one of the most discussed topics on Russian-language Twitter. Popular blogger Ilya Varlamov wrote:'I want to officially send Hugh Laurie to hell along with his opinion of our goods and his plans to boycott them.' Another commentator Savva Mirosh, wrote on the website of state television channel NTV: 'That's right, go ahead and boycott us, but you'll have to start with gas, not vodka.' The House and Blackadder star's tweets provoked fury in Russia and he later retracted his comments . And sports journalist Stepan Chaushyan wrote on the website of the Argumenty i Fakty mass-circulation weekly saying: 'Hugh called for a boycott of all goods produced in Russia, in passing insulting one of the main brands of our country, Russian vodka. 'Hugh forgot one thing: Russian money could very easily boycott him', pointing out that Laurie has given several blues concerts in Russia. But the House and Blackadder star's outburst won praise from Russian gay rights supporters. 'With what irony and how correctly he noted everything. Thank you, Hugh,' wrote Matvei Alexandrov on the Gay.ru website.

Authorities: A Russian gay rights protestor wrapped in a rainbow flag walks past a police line during a recent protest . President Putin sparked fury earlier this month when he said that gay people would be welcome at the Sochi Winter Olympics, but added: 'They must leave children in peace'. In June, Putin signed passed a bill to enact a new law that punishes people for promoting homosexual ‘propaganda’. The law imposed fines on those who disseminate information aimed at minors ‘directed and forming non-traditional sexual setup’, or which may cause a ‘distorted understanding’ that gay and heterosexual relationships are equal. Russia's powerful Orthodox Church – of which approximately 64 per cent of Russians identify themselves as – demanded one step further, calling for a national referendum on criminalising homosexual relationships altogether, a return to a Soviet law enacted by Stalin. Despite reassuring visitors the laws . present 'no danger' to them, the Russian leader still suggested there . was a need to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the . country's birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a . law.

"By . Markus Berkmann . Now this is an odd one, Curious by name and curious by nature. Rebecca Front is an actress you will know from a thousand comedy shows on TV: she was in The Day Today with Chris Morris and Steve Coogan, played a hapless politician in two series of The Thick Of It, and was Simon Amstell’s mother in Grandma’s House. Last year, she was Mrs Bennet in Death Comes To Pemberley, and she has a nice recurring role in Lewis, as the grouchy boss every TV detective is obliged to have by law. It’s an impressive list of credits. Funny old world: Actress Rebecca Front has just written her new autobiographical book 'Curious' Like so many actors and actresses with brains and an excess of nervous energy, though, she writes as well. There have been Radio 4 shows and columns for The Guardian, and now there’s this book, a collection of autobiographical fragments that seeks to show us just how strange the world can be. These are true stories, she says, ‘though perhaps a little bent out of shape in the telling’. One senses that she is aiming at the widest possible readership. ‘If you recognise something of yourself in here, then great. If, on the other hand, it just confirms that yours is the only sane voice in an otherwise bonkers world, then that’s fine too.’ So we hear of her grandmother, who like many of her generation had a sitting room that was kept for best: ‘Nobody went in it, because it was there for “visitors”, and no one who came to the house ever quite merited that description.’ In the thick of it: Front playing hapless politician Nicola Murray alongside Peter Capaldi as the foul-mouthed Malcolm Tucker . Rebecca’s parents’ house, by contrast, was always a bit of a mess. Her grandmother spent a lot of time there, and when they had people round, she always insisted on helping them tidy up afterwards. ‘When the final cushion was plumped, the last crumb Hoovered up, Grandma would say with some pride: “There. It’s as if they had never been.”’ And that, Rebecca began to realise, was the point. For her grandmother, a tidy house was an end in itself. ‘As the years of her long life gathered behind her, she appeared to have come to the conclusion that the best way to keep her home fit for others to see, was never to allow anyone in to see it,’ Front writes. There are tales of disastrous childhood holidays, of humiliation at university, of claustrophobia and panic attacks, and of her lifelong inability to swim. She fears trains because of the tunnels. She fears planes because she doesn’t want to leave her children motherless. She undergoes hypnotherapy to cure her phobias, but can’t relax enough to enter a trance. Even though she has taken a strong dislike to the hypnotherapist, sheer politeness compels her to pretend that the therapy has worked like a dream. Like many of us, she suffers from the chronic disease of Englishness. I bet that when she eats a lousy meal in a restaurant, she doesn’t complain, she tells the waiter it’s delicious and silently vows never to  go back. One of the best chapters is entitled Normal. ‘I’m the sort of person who is so preoccupied with appearing normal that I can’t buy four bottles of wine without remarking in a jaunty voice that they’re not all for me.’ Curious and curiouser: Front encounters a rabbit on the bus . On a bus she sees a woman with a rabbit on a lead. The woman seems perfectly relaxed about it, but other passengers look at her and her rabbit as though she’s not normal. All except for one woman, who pets the rabbit fondly. But then she starts to stare at the rabbit, stare and stare and stare. The rabbit’s owner becomes uneasy. Does this person want to steal her rabbit? Does she want to cook it? Her body tenses and her face hardens. ‘Finally she did what all the other passengers had done to her: she turned her back and pretended the woman wasn’t there.’ Curious is full of such strange incidents, each of them reflected through the prism of Rebecca Front’s distinctive take on the world. My first impression, though, was of a slight lack of focus. It’s as though the publishers wanted one sort of book — a straight-down-the-line autobiography would be my guess — and the writer wanted to try something more ambitious, more akin to the work of the American humorist David Sedaris. The result isn’t quite either, and nor is it ‘a beguiling celebration of the curiosities of life’, as the blurb-writer has put it, possibly tearing his or her hair out with frustration. Nonetheless, a theme does emerge from the book, and that’s anxiety. Rebecca, who admits she has become the Jewish mother she was always destined to be, has anxieties to burn, and writes amusingly and perceptively about them. Only she, having inadvertently shoplifted a bulb of garlic, could go back to the supermarket a few  days later to pay for it, and then, having embarrassed herself utterly in conversation with the manager, walk out with a basket of goods she later realises she hadn’t paid for. This isn’t curious, this is round the bend. And something close to normal life for a lot of us . . .","Actress Rebecca Front adds a book to her impressive CV .

"By . Misty White Sidell . Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has struck a deal to reinvent the Charles James label – the subject of this year’s Costume Institute exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A spokesperson for Mr Weinstein confirmed the Miramax co-founder’s ‘partnership’ with James’s relatives to MailOnline this evening. He has installed his wife and Marchesa co-designer Georgina Chapman, as well as her brother Edward, to come on board as creative consultants. Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein (left) has confirmed that he has 'struck a deal' with the family of couturier Charles James to reinvent the brand with the help of his designer wife Georgina Chapman (right) Sources tell MailOnline that in striking the deal, Mr Weinstein has also partnered with the MET to transport the Costume Institute’s Charles James: Beyond Fashion retrospective – whose opening was feted last evening with the museum’s annual star-studded gala -  around the country as a traveling exhibit. They said that ‘In taking the exhibit around the country, [Harvey’s] hope is to reinvent Charles James, and bring it back to being a luxury label that stands alongside Oscar de la Renta and Christian Dior.’ It is understood that Mr Weinstein’s ‘partnership’ with Mr James’s relatives is a licensing contract, which will allow him to extensively develop the brand. Charles James, a British designer who passed away in 1978, was the choice couturier of mid-century American socialites including Babe Pailey, Millicent Rogers, and Austine Hearst.They favored his designs for their swan-appropriate appearance. In utilizing yards of precious fabrics, James was able to create ball gowns that were majestic in texture, shape, and color.But aesthetics aside, the designer himself took a greater pleasure in fashion design's constructional complexities. It allowed him to play with dimension, shadow, and weight - using fabric as the figurative means to a larger experiment. James's work was a favorite among mid-century American socialites, and is best recalled through this Cecil Beaton photograph, which captures the designer's creations and muses as if they were part of the Eighteenth century French court . The MET’s exhibit showcases James’s interest in construction – using modern technology including robotic cameras and X-ray animations to, somewhat ironically, highlight the inner workings of his gowns’ old-world glamor. But while his body of work was successful from a cachet perspective, James lacked the extensive business panache required to sustain a fashion label. Throughout his career, the Charles James brand encountered numerous financial disasters – which forced the designer to embark on multiple licensing deals, a taboo at the time. Due to his many monetary pitfalls, James died penniless and alone – his name as a designer nearly forgotten. But the MET’s exhibit, which opens to the public on May 8 and runs until August 11, hits a more positive note by focusing on James’s golden period from the Thirties to Sixties. Luckily, this angle seems to have worked. Chatter surrounding Charles James has been endless since the exhibit’s initial announcement in September – exacerbated by a flood of very public teasers released by the MET, as well as Vogue. However infinite these promotional efforts may have been, they helped create an opportune time for a revival of the Charles James aesthetic. Charles James's vast body of work is currently being celebrated with an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (pictured) The first of the exhibit's two galleries use pattern and X-ray animations to give visitors a more in-depth look at the gown's intricate construction . The concept of bringing a label back from the dead may have seemed daunting in previous years, but the recent reboot of Schiaparelli– a fabled brand that rose from extinction in 2013 with help from Tod’s CEO Diego Della Valle – made the prospect of an actual James resurgence seem not so far-fetched. It seemed like only a matter of time before a buyer came forward. And today he did. In restarting the Charles James label, Mr Weinstein has wife Georgina, the co-designer of Marchesa to help guide the brand’s likely ballgown-heavy ship. Ms Chapman herself is an avid fan of eveningwear. Her label, which she designs with Keren Craig, is known for its heavily-embellished gowns that are favored by starlets like Blake Lively and Diane Kruger. Mr Weinstein has a bit of fashion experience himself too. In 2007 he attempted to restart Halston – the iconic label that served as an archetype for the Seventies’ disco fashions. While accomplished, James (pictured) unfortunately died alone and penniless following years of life in solitude and numerous business fall outs . The project began with good intentions – and an impressive creative team that included Jimmy Choo’s Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe – but it never seemed to quite get off the ground. Following multiple changes in design leadership (which at one point even included Sarah Jessica Parker as chief creative officer) and a lack of financial promise, Mr Weinstein departed the label in 2011. Coincidentally for Mr Weinstein – or perhaps something of a nightmare - Charles James actually was a mentor to Halston founder Roy Halston in the late Fifties, when he was still an unknown. The two later presented a joint collection in 1970, which Halston hoped would revive James’s career – one that had already lost steam following numerous financial downturns. Sadly, the collection was panned, and is said to have permanently soured their friendship. Hopefully Mr Weinstein’s attempt at resuscitating the Charles James name will result in a more positive outcome.","Mr Weinstein has entered a partnership with James's relatives to revive the Charles James label as a luxury house .

'Although we want to enjoy the moment we'll soon need to start to work hard in training to improve even more. 'You have to give compliment to both teams, both gave 100 per cent - and although Chile finished second I think they go far in this tournament.' Manager Louis van Gaal adjusted his tactics and team-shape to cope with Chile's threat and it worked perfectly. Head boy: Leroy Fer broke the deadlock and gave Holland the lead with this header . 'We limited Chile to a handful of opportunities, we neutralised them extremely effectively,' he said. 'We did have to change our style - and I will always pick a system and a strategy that will help us win. 'However, we're not perfect - in possession we still need to improve, but I do think we're very good without the ball.' Despite that, Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli was satisfied with his side's progress so far. 'We kept going and fighting for 90 minutes, but ultimately we didn't get the result,' he said. 'I felt that our intensity and commitment was outstanding. Our players should have their heads held high as we've played well in the three games so far and we're now through to the round of 16.'","Holland beat Chile 2-0 in Sao Paulo to finish top of Group B .

"By . Misty White Sidell . A nine-year-old fashion blogger from Boston is set to give a TED Talk this evening, as part of the organization’s TEDxCambridge conference. Tobias Otting - a fourth-grader who lives in Newton, Massachusets, just on the outskirts of the state’s capital - is expected to give an informational talk on ‘the importance of finding your voice and sharing it,’ reports The Boston Globe. Tobias captured the attention of TED’s higher-ups through his blog, called the Junior Sartorialist, which he started at the age of eight. Rising star: Tobias Otting (pictured) pens a blog called the Junior Sartorialist, in which he posts his musings on fashion, food, ballet, and culture . The young aesthete, who goes by Toby, announced the talk on his blog last month with a post that read: ‘Quickly dropping the news, before I scurry off to school, that I’m giving a TEDx talk in just a few weeks, on June 5, in Cambridge.  I’m so honored to be part of a group of such impressive speakers, and can’t wait to learn about them and hear their talks.’ Toby’s talk is scheduled among other presentations from TED’s more typical array of intellectual luminaries, including a cosmic explorer and a cognitive scientist. In the last year, Toby has already accrued 11,591 visits to his site, with subject matter that extends beyond fashion, with topics like music, food, culture, and dance. Standing at just four-and-a-half feet, Tobias is already interested in the finer aspects of life. He . wears a tie to school every day and enjoys frequent trips to the Boston . Ballet, followed by high tea at some of the city’s most luxurious . hotels. These musings, among . others, comprise a majority of the content on his blog – which he . writes with the help of his mother, Laura Gassner Otting. Style fixture: Toby, as he is known, is among Boston's style pack and enjoys wearing a tie to school . Helping hand: Toby is shown here with his mother Laura Gassner Otting who helps him pen his blog posts . ‘I thought if he was going to do this then there should be some substance behind what he’s doing. So he’s not just throwing out opinions and leaving them out there,’ Ms Otting told the paper. Their collaboration works as such: Toby will brainstorm various article topics and then sit down with his mother, who will type his ideas. She’ll inquire into the deeper aspects of why her son finds these subjects important – the responses of which she also jots down, helping Toby sharpen his articles’ focus as a result. ‘She wanted me to articulate myself better, but she doesn’t tell me what I’m supposed to say,’ Toby said of the process. Earlier this year, Toby’s blog . captured the attention of TEDxCambridge’s executive producer Tamsen . Webster, who is a friend of his mother’s. He . was required to audition for the honor alongside a pool of 30 other . applicants. He won a spot, for which he is required to deliver an . eight-minute speech to a packed auditorium on the Massachusetts . Institute of Technology’s campus. Eye on fabric: Toby favors plain suitjackets, bright ties, and thick-frame glasses . On stage: Toby will give an eight-minute presentation at tonight's TEDxCambridge event on the MIT campus . Ms Webster says of Toby’s appeal: ‘[He] can’t just get onstage and say that everyone should write a blog. You can look at Toby and see that there’s no gap in integrity between his idea and his passion for that idea. There are people of all ages who are unable to demonstrate all the pieces required to put together a TEDxCambridge talk. But there was never a question about Toby.’ While Toby admits that he is nervous in the lead-up to his talk, he says that there are some perks involved in the appointment. ‘My teacher said she may not give me as many writing assignments because I’m doing the talk,’ he said. ‘Now I just need to get out of my math assignments.’",Toby will give a speech at tonight's TEDxCambridge event at MIT .
"By . Hayley Peterson . and Steve Nolan . and Associated  Press Reporter . The founders of Twitter look set to vastly increase their already impressive wealth after they announced that the company is preparing to float on the stock market. After years of speculation, the social networking site, which has more than 200 million users worldwide, will finally follow in the footsteps of the likes of Facebook by filing an IPO. The move could take the collective wealth of Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone, who co-founded the site back in March 2006, from its estimated $3billion to more than four times that. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) attended the Allen & Company Sun Valley tech conference in July with girlfriend Kate Greer . This is the first ever tweet sent by creator and co-founder Jack Dorsey on March 21, 2006 . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey . (right with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) has told CBS's '60 Minutes' that . he wants to run for mayor in the future . Christopher Issac 'Biz' Stone, co-founder of Twitter and his wife Livia Stone, left, and Evan Williams and his wife Sarah, right, are to increase their wealth through the floatation . The company . announced on Thursday that it had filed paperwork with the U.S . Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its first step toward an . initial public offering. It is expected to debut at a valuation of between . $14 billion and $20 billion. The move is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major social networking sites to go public. Evan Williams . Age: 41 . Net worth: $1 - $2billion . Potential worth: $8billion . CNN Money estimated that he has a 30 to 35 per cent share in the company. His firms have also founded Blogger and Medium. Williams, a vegetarian, lives in the San Francisco Bay area with his wife Sara Morishige and the pair have two children. Role: Co-founder and former Chief Executive of Twitter . Jack Dorsey . Age: 36 . Net worth: $1.1billion . Potential worth: $3.1billion . Mr Dorsey sent the first ever tweet in March 2006 and is thought to own a 10 per cent share in the company. Although he made his name with Twitter, most of his current fortune is thought to have been amassed through his estimated 25 per cent stake in mobile payment start up Square. He is a certified masseur and lives in San Francisco. Role: Executive chairman at Twitter, CEO at Square . Biz Stone . Age: 39 . Net worth: Thought to be around $200million . Potential worth: Around $2billion . As well as Twitter, Stone, full name Christopher Isaac, helped to create and launch Xanga, Blogger, Odeo and Medium. He is also CEO of a 2012 start-up called Jelly Industries, thought to be a mobile app. He has written two books on blogging and made his directorial debut as part of Project Imaginat10n with Ron Howard. Role: Co-inventor and co-founder of Twitter, CEO of Jelly Industries . It comes after Facebook floated on the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion (£66.2 billion) and, despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence. It is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 2,000 investors. Although the IPO was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions, naturally, with a tweet last night. The confidentiality should help Twitter avoid the media scrutiny that surrounded Facebook's decision to float. The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation. But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue. Under the law, Twitter's financial statements and other sensitive information contained in the IPO filing must become publicly available at least 21 days before company's executives begin traveling around the country to meet with potential investors - a process known as a 'road show'. The decision to float the company is likely to see the company's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone stand to gain huge financial windfalls. The site was founded in March 2006 but has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years. Dorsey introduced the world to the site by sending out the first ever tweet which read: 'Just setting up my twttr'. The 36-year-old is also the founder and CEO . of Square, a mobile payments company. He is reportedly living in a $10 . million home in San Francisco and dating his longtime girlfriend, Kate . Greer. Dorsey's interest in programming . began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He . came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz . Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software . startup Odeo. Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company. Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures. Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase threefold. Biz Stone's wealth could jump from $200million to $2billion, while Evan Williams, thought to be the richest of the three, could see his personal fortune jump from $2billion to $8billion. Biz Stone is one of Twitter's three co-founders. He is pictured here in 2012 at at Canon's Imaginat10n Lab. He has also helped create Medium and Blogger . Big name: Dorsey originally approached Evan Williams (pictured) about getting a job at the old company he used to run with Glass called Odeo. Williams was famous in the tech world at that point for selling Blogger to Google for millions . Others . that stand to gain from Twitter going public include early investors . Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Spark Capital, as well . as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, Ron . Conway and Naval Ravikant. The . company delivered the news of its planned IPO Thursday in a tweet sent out at 5 p.m. The tweet read, . 'We've confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.' That tweet was followed up by a second post: 'Now, back to work.' Bloomberg reports that Goldman Sachs is expected to be the lead underwriter of the offering. Twitter had been working to boost ad revenue in . preparation for the move. It  recently acquired MoPub, a mobile advertising company that has a $100 . million annual revenue run rate, and in July, the company hired a number . of people with IPO experience. Rowghani Ali, COO of Twitter, is pictured. Twitter has filed paperwork in its first step toward an initial public offering of stock . Big business: Twitter is following in the footsteps of other major social networking websites that have gone public, such as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook which now has a share value of some $108billion . EMarketer . estimated in March that Twitter's revenue will be $582 million this . year and close to $1 billion in 2014. Twitter will be hoping to fare better than when Facebook floated last year, a move which was initially a flop. Facebook . priced its IPO in May 2012 at $38 per share, but the stock fell almost . immediately, trading well below its launch price. The stock continued to . fall over the next couple months, trading at $22 per share by September . 2012. A year later, . however, share prices have made a full recovery. By the time the markets . closed Thursday, Facebook's stock was priced at $44 per share. Twitter’s CEO is Dick Costolo, the company’s former Chief Operating Officer - a position now held by Rowghani Ali. Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day.

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Steven Gerrard claimed England’s Young Lions are ready to take the World Cup by storm ahead of Saturday’s final warm-up game against Honduras. The England captain will lead his team out against the 33rd-ranked team in the world in 32-degree heat at the Sun Life Stadium before they head to Brazil. Hodgson will meet Honduras officials and the match referee to discuss a drinks break midway through each half as a precaution against the heat here. Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling, who is suspended from Saturday’s game but is in Roy Hodgson’s thoughts for next Saturday’s opener against Italy in Manaus, have all settled into the squad. Faith: Steven Gerrard believes England's youngsters have what it takes to impress at the World Cup . Bright future: Ross Barkley put in an encouraging performance in his first start for England against Ecuador . More to come: Raheem Sterling (left) has impressed during training in Miami this week . Ready for action: Gerrard believes every player in Roy Hodgson's squad is capable of starting against Italy . Gerrard, who will win his 111th cap, said: ‘The biggest compliment I can give them is that they are ready to play. They’ve brought their form from their club sides into the England set-up and that’s what I’ve noticed. ‘Hopefully they can continue that into the World Cup itself. There are two players pushing in every position to get into the starting XI and not much between them in every position. ‘The manager could pick five teams for the Italy game and you wouldn’t see a big difference in the standard. That’s what gives me hope.’ Sterling, who was the best player in an open training session on Friday, misses out today after his dismissal in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium. Hodgson said: ‘As you can imagine, Raheem was absolutely gutted to be sent off, as were we. ‘It was an over-exuberant challenge and a slightly reckless act. It was his desire to help us out of a difficult situation, using his incredible pace to reach Antonio Valencia. ‘I was impressed with Valencia’s comments afterwards. ‘The referee was entitled to send him off, so it was strong of Valencia to do what he did.’Hodgson initially intended to play Sterling in the final friendly against Honduras before the squad travel to Brazil. Cool customer: Jack Wilshere puts a towel over his face to keep cool during training . Heated battle: Daniel Sturridge and Leighton Baines fight for the ball . Safe hands: Hart makes a save during training . And England’s head coach made it clear that he has been so impressed with the Liverpool forward that he could face Cesare Prandelli’s team in Manaus on June 14 in the opening group game. Italy haven’t won in seven games and drew 1-1 with Luxembourg, the 120th-ranked team, in their final officially recognised friendly in Perugia. Hodgson added: ‘Be careful going down that route. I’ve worked in Italy. I know the Italian mentality and their players. ‘They have a much healthier attitude to warm-up and friendly games, and the importance they attach to them. It doesn’t bother them. The actual team won’t be bothered.’ Hodgson is also continuing to monitor Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s injury to his medial knee ligaments as the squad prepare to travel to Brazil. England’s manager will wait until 24 hours before their opening game, as per FIFA rules, to decide whether to keep him with the squad. Hodgson added: ‘I don’t think it’s a gamble at all. At the moment we have 23 men: three goalkeepers and 20 outfield players. Possession game: Wayne Rooney wins the ball from Jack Wilshere during training . Watching on: Alex Oxlaide-Chamberlin watches the training session from the sidelines . ‘He was chosen for a reason. He fits in our balance. I don’t think anyone we choose to replace him will give us anything additional to the squad. We’re very anxious to keep him here. I’ll have to listen to the doctors and see what he’s likely to miss and when he’s likely to be fit, but I won’t be dashing out because he might not be fit for the first game. ‘We’d want people like him around. I’m neither confident nor lacking in confidence. ‘I’m waiting to see what happens. I’m not a doctor. I’ll be accepting with what the doctors tell me. A decision will be made. They’ll tell me their prognosis and then we’ll make a decision.’ England face Honduras in almost unbearable heat on Saturday afternoon in Miami and they will head for their base camp in Rio de Janeiro straight after today’s game. Gerrard is thriving in his role as captain and revealed pointedly  yesterday that former England manager Fabio Capello did not believe in his leadership skills. ‘Capello didn’t believe in me as his No 1 captain,’ the Liverpool  midfielder said. ‘He did believe in me as a player, he rated me as a player and our relationship was fine. ‘At the time we picked the captain, he had Rio Ferdinand and John Terry and he thought they offered something different for him.’","Steven Gerrard believes England's youngsters are capable of starting at the World Cup .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Russia has announced plans to build a super-heavy carrier rocket that could propel its cosmonauts to Mars. The rocket will rival Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) which is expected to come in two variants capable of lifting 70 and 130 tonnes into orbit. Construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway, according to Roscosmos chief Oleg Ostapenko. Scroll down for video... The final frontier: A Russian Soyuz rocket takes off for the International Space Station last month. The Kremlin has announced plans to o build a super-heavy carrier rocket that will propel its cosmonauts to Mars . The second stage is to build a carrier rocket capable of lifting from 100 to 120 tonnes of payload into low-earth orbit. Meanwhile, Nasa has said the first test flight of the smaller SLS design is scheduled for 2017. Last year, Russia said that it will develop new huge rockets for manned flights to the moon and Mars, by 2030 – the same year that Nasa is aiming for the red planet. RIA Novosti reports that a working group has looked at proposals for a heavy-lift rocket, including the revival of the Energia launcher. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Super-sized plans: Oleg Ostapenko, right, head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos, said the second stage is to build a carrier rocket capable of lifting from 100 to 120 tonnes of payload into low-earth orbit. In this image he is shaking hands  with U.S. astronaut Steven Swanson, left . The Kremlin's space-age boasts . come less than three years after the U.S. was forced to start hitching . flights on Russian rockets. Nasa ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts. Just . two weeks ago a Soyuz rocket carried two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut to the International Space Station (above), despite the crisis . in Crimea. But there could be hope of a new space race - as Nasa announced earlier this month of  hopes to land humans on Mars within 20 years. Energia is the highest payload rocket ever built in Russia but the project was scrapped 20 years ago during the country’s economic crisis. It isn't just the red planet that Russia is planning to conquer. Earlier this month, deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin said: 'We are coming to the moon forever.' In an article in the government's own newspaper headlined 'Russian Space', he spoke of targeting Mars and other 'space objects' as future priorities. 'Flights to Mars and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon, but in many senses imply this process.' He wrote of 'colonisation of the moon and near-moon space'. In the next 50 years, manned flights are unlikely beyond 'the space between Venus and Mars' But 'it is quite possible to speak about exploration of Mars, flights to asteroids and flights to Mars'. Currently, Russia has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade. The first mission, the long-delayed Luna-25, is slated for launch in 2016, to research the moon's  south pole. Moon mission: Vladimir Putin (left) looks at exhibits as he visits the Cosmonautics Memorial Museum in Russia.

The next two missions will include an orbiter to monitor the moon in 2018, and a year later a polar lander with a drill will search for water ice. By 2040, Russia plans to create a lunar base for long-term missions to the Earth's natural satellite. Rogozin said that the moon is the only realistic source to obtain water, minerals and other resources for future space missions. A lunar laboratory complex will also be used for testing new space technologies.","Roscosmos chief said construction of first stage of rocket is underway .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A manhunt has been launched after a 12-year-old girl was raped by two men. The girl was in Walthamstow, east London, between 12.15am and 12.30am on Saturday when she met three men, Scotland Yard said. She was taken to a garage area at the end of Hibbert Road, near Theydon Street, where she was pinned down and raped by two of the men. The girl managed to call a friend who came to the scene and they left together. The suspects then left the area. Manhunt launched: A 12-year-old girl was raped by two teenagers near a garage area in Hibbert Road (pictured), Walthamstow, just after midnight, police have said . The girl, who reported the rape on Saturday, did not know any of her attackers, Scotland Yard said. The trio are described as being between 17 and 19 years old. The first was dark-skinned and of mixed race, with a diamond stud in his left ear and a London accent. He told the girl his name was Mo and that he was 17. He had big brown eyes, short hair, was very skinny and wore a black puffa-style jacket with a hood, black chinos, black trainers and a grey/black T-shirt. The second was described as black and very tall with big lips. His hair was partly shaven and he wore black trousers and a red and blue shirt. Investigation: Scotland Yard detectives said it was a 'nasty attack on a vulnerable girl' The third, who did not rape the girl, was black and had a moustache. He wore a blue-coloured hooded top and a red and blue cap, and told her his name was Miles. Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw, who is leading the investigation, said: 'This was a very nasty attack on a vulnerable girl just 12 years old by a group of older males who engaged her in conversation before leading her to a secluded area. 'She was pinned down and two of the males then brutally raped her. 'I would appeal for anyone with information or any witnesses to please contact police as soon as possible.' Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0208 217 7408 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Girl met three men aged 17 to 19 in Walthamstow at around 12.15am .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Visit: Chinese premier Li Keqiang (right) is said to have demanded to meet the Queen . China is to be allowed to design, own and operate a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain despite concerns about  the implications for national security. A deal signed yesterday during a visit by China’s premier Li Keqiang will let Chinese state-owned nuclear firms control British power plants if they meet the requirements of regulators. Mr Li and David Cameron also agreed that the £50billion HS2 high-speed rail project could involve massive Chinese investment. China says it wants to pour money into major UK infrastructure projects and has signed £14billion in trade deals to mark the premier’s three-day visit. Mr Li is accompanied by dozens of Chinese business leaders eager to discuss investment in areas such as energy where China has faced opposition elsewhere in the world. The Chinese premier is said to have demanded to meet the Queen although it is relatively unusual for her to receive world leaders who are not heads of state. Yesterday she welcomed him to Windsor Castle where they were joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room. Later he went to Downing Street for lunch with the Prime Minister and business leaders where he was served a Chinese-themed menu including claypot chicken in a savoury sauce with shiitake mushrooms. One major deal is expected between BP and China’s National Offshore Oil Corporation worth about £11.8billion over 20 years. Negotiations to end a Chinese ban on imports of British beef and lamb, imposed in the 1980s during the BSE scandal, are also to take place. The state-owned China Development Bank is expected to invest in HS2 and the next generation of nuclear power stations. Lucrative: David Cameron and the Chinese premier signed trade deals worth more than £14billion . Chinese firms are already heavily involved in a new £14billion Hinkley C reactor planned for construction in Somerset. Yesterday, the UK and Chinese governments signed an agreement to co-operate on civil nuclear power that could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds to British companies. A separate agreement stated that Chinese companies could own and operate a Chinese-designed nuclear power station here, if they meet the requirements of the UK’s independent regulator. However, the deal is likely to provoke controversy. Some experts have warned against giving China a controlling stake in the industry on national security grounds, saying it would leave Britain at the mercy of the communist regime. Mark Pritchard, a Tory member of . Parliament’s national security strategy committee, said: ‘Chinese . investment in the UK is very welcome, but we should always consider the . national security implications when it comes to critical national . infrastructure and sensitive technologies.’ Ministers, however, said investing in nuclear . will both diversify the energy mixes of both countries while playing a . role in tackling climate change. The leaders were all smiles outside 10 Downing Street, but critics say the deal could leave Britain vulnerable . The . Prime Minister hailed the burgeoning trade links between the two . countries, which he said was ‘central’ to the Government’s plan to . revitalise the UK’s economy. Chinese . investment into the UK in the last 18 months than in the last 30 years, . he added at a press conference in Downing Street. ‘Today . we have signed deals worth more than £14 billion, securing jobs and . long term economic growth for the British and Chinese people,’ Mr . Cameron said. ‘Ours is truly . a partnership for growth, reform and innovation. The figures tell the . story - bilateral trade at record levels, our exports to China up 15 per . cent in 2013, they have more than doubled in the last five years and at . a billion a month, they are growing faster than France’s or Germany’s.’ Mr Li yesterday became the latest world leader to line up against Scottish independence when he backed a ‘strong, prosperous and united United Kingdom’. He said China and the UK should view each other’s economic development 'as an opportunity'. He added: 'We both believe that we should increase mutual political trust, engage in equal co-operation and accommodate each other’s core interests and major concerns to solidify the political foundation of bilateral ties.'","Deal signed yesterday by China's premier Li Keqiang on visit to Britain .

"A rusty 103-year-old electric car rendered obsolete by the invention of the automobile is tipped to sell for £50,000 as it has turned out to be way ahead of its time. While electric cars are being hailed by many as the future of transportation today, a rudimentary version was being manufactured in the early 20th century. Looking like a cross between something from the Wacky Races and a golf buggy, the car had a top speed of just 25mph. Dodo, a 103-year-old Detroit Electric Model D that was thought for a century to be an evolutionary dead end has emerged for auction - and has now turned out to be way ahead of its time . The six foot tall recharging station for the Detroit Electric Model D, which gave the car a range of 100 miles on a full charge . It had a range of 100 miles but had to be plugged into a giant 6ft tall charger before every journey. Manufacturing came to an end in the 1920s when the mass production of the petrol car left it trailing in its wake. The 1910 Detroit Electric Model D that has now emerged for sale would have cost £1,500 at the time, the equivalent of £85,000 today. Modern-day electric cars such as the Nissan LEAF are now priced at around £25,000. In the early 20th century, the electric car was preferred over the early petrol versions as it was simple to operate and was a lot quieter. Henry Ford, founder of The Ford Motor Company, bought two Detroit electric cars for his wife Clara for this reason. Rupert Banner, a car specialist at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Electric cars are all the rage now but Detroit Electric was doing very well with them 100 years ago. 'The company became the most successful manufacturer of electric cars and this is a very early version of what they produced. 'They were very popular into the 1920s. 'This one still has the same interior it had back then and has been well preserved. 'It's like stepping back in time. 'It has been in a museum for a number of years now. Experts at Bonhams say the car is relatively easy to restore, and could soon be in full working order . 'It's a very interesting car and it still has its original transforming unit with it, which is extremely rare. 'It looks like something you could power an entire grid with these days, it is so big. 'Once the petrol car came in the days of the Detroit Electric Model were always going to be numbered. 'People could go longer distances and there were now no limitations, which especially in a country as big as America, made all of the difference. 'Detroit were unquestionably the most successful at the electric cars though, that is without question.' The 103-year-old Detroit Electric Model D that was thought for a century to be an evolutionary dead end but has now turned out to be way ahead of its time . The car comes with its original charger and experts believe it will provide a straight forward restoration project for the new owner. It went defunct in 1939. In recent years Detroit Electric has been in negotiations with companies in China and Malaysia about reviving the brand. The car will be sold at auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, US, on January 17. The 1910 Detroit Electric Model D was a popular vehicle for thousands of motorists in the early years of the 20th century before the widespread production of petrol cars rendered it obsolete. The car, which has been in a museum for the past decade, is expected to fetch £50,000 when auctioned by Bonhams this week .","The 1910 Detroit Electric Model D has a range of 100 miles and can reach 25mph .

"By . Misty White Sidell . While fashion most often celebrates clothes that are visible on the outside, a new exhibit diverges from the norm by focusing on what’s worn underneath. The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology’s new show ‘Exposed: A History of Lingerie’ explores the evolution of underpinnings from the 18th century to modern day. In doing so, the exhibit's 70-some artifacts uncover how the shape and tone of clothing has shifted as a result – tracing the differences in color, shape, and idealized body forms along the way. Tracing history: The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology's new exhibit Exposed: A History of Lingerie, traces the evolution of underpinnings throughout time (pictured, a 1951 Christian Dior petticoat and a 1949 Poirette bra exemplify the mid century feminine form) Exercising restraint: Throughout time, lingerie has yo-yo'd between phases of freedom and constriction, the latter of which is the case with these two corsets (pictured, a Waneris design circa 1960, left, and a 1954 Marie Rose Lebigot for Lily of France, right) Leisure: The Forties, lingerie-wise, are epitomized by their glamorous loungewear, like this printed robe by Jay Thorpe, circa 1942 . The exhibit opens with a series of relatively modern garments to epitomize this journey. A nylon evening gown by the mid-century designer Claire McCardell is displayed beside a nylon nightgown by the decade’s equally celebrated lingerie label Iris. In doing so, curator Coleen Hill pinpoints how Ms McCardell was an innovator in her own right, by pulling inspiration from one of the more personal aspects of a woman’s wardrobe. She was among the first designers to take nylon from a lingerie-specific affair and appropriate it for every day, conventional use. A similar argument is made with two 19th century corsets, shown beside a 2007 Peter Soronen corseted dress who’s boning is exposed with bright topstitching. Even though the garments were created centuries apart, their foundations - so to speak - share a likeminded seed. Carrying on, the exhibit runs in chronological order – displaying lingerie’s true journey from functional objects with distinctive social purposes to accessories that prioritize fashion and frill. The 17th and 18th century’s requisite corsets, which not only pushed a woman’s bust to exorbitant heights, but also shrank their waists to similarly small lengths, displays how women were best perceived at the time. Deeper meaning: Buried within the beauty of this intricate Rococo-era corset (circa 1770) is a socioeconomic message; Due to the artifact's constrictive nature and French court hue, its wearer likely led a life of work-free leisure . Striking shape: The rise of steel in the industrial 19th century led to innovations in fashion as well,  including this underskirt and corset - used to cut the era's infamous S-curve silhouette - which utilize metal instead of whalebone to achieve its structure . As is typical with historical fashion exhibits, FIT’s exploration of lingerie delves into each decade’s high-fashion, premium trends - which until the late 20th century, were dictated by aristocracy. With this in mind, it is clear that within the corset’s constrictive whalebone gussets lies a deeper, socioeconomic message. One of the show’s artifacts - a cornflower blue corset that dates back to the 1770s - is an example of this larger discussion. Not only do its structured lines imply that its wearer would be rendered nearly immobile, but its frilly bow epaulets and royal hue (at least by French court standards) demonstrate that its wearer led a life of work-free leisure. And that is not to mention how the corset’s laced closure - positioned up the back - required at least one servant’s help to tighten, and later loosen, the strings each day. While the Rococo movement’s corsets displayed a wash of restrained color, by the end of the next century things had turned comparably acid toned – courtesy of the development of artificial dyes. But by the turn of the 20th century the western world’s then-longstanding tradition for busty appearances and voluptuous waistlines suddenly took a sharp turn towards androgyny. On view: The 19th century's social standard for house calls meant that even the most leisurely of women needed to look well-dressed, even when relaxing at home; Garments like this French tea gown from 1900 was enlisted in the lives of aristocrats who needed to be ready to accept visitors at the drop of a hat . Sweet dreams: Compared to the 1920s straight flapper silhouette, this nightgown from the Thirties demonstrates how the decade preferred a more shapely figure, while still cutting a slim form . This is most evident in the exhibit’s showing of lingerie from the Twenties, which provides little in the way of support, lift, or shaping. A delicate bandeau bra from the decade is more of an aesthetic experiment in ribbon and lace than it is an aid in supporting one’s assets: emphasizing how the ideal flapper body’s straight lines took a larger hold on consumer culture at the time. Women of more diverse proportions were better accommodated the following decade with the Thirties’ penchant for all-in-one girdles that provided a support to the bust, a lightly corseted nip to the waist, and a delicate slip for coverage underneath the era’s filmy, feminine dresses. The return to a curvier form became even more exaggerated in the Forties, where strong shoulders and a tiny waist were widely favored. But where the decade stood out most, lingerie-wise, was in its approach to chamber dressing. Diaphanous nightgowns and robes were popularized through golden-age films, where Hollywood femme fatales like Ava Gardner and Vivien Leigh could be seen wearing at-home attire that could have hold its own at a debutante soiree. Au natural: By the 1970s, the advent of synthetic fibers and a new natural look helped pave the way for underpinnings like this 1977 set by Shelly; Its wireless, padding-free design allowed for a woman's natural breast shape to remain intact while wearing . This . preference for unabashed femininity was taken to a new level in the . Fifties, where the advent of crinolines, as well as conical bras, was . instrumental in creating an iconic look. Without . these two underpinnings, the decade’s pluming skirts and pert sweater . sets would not have received their necessary lift – leaving what is now . known as the Betty Draper look without its precarious oomph. But like most things in fashion, for those who inhabited the era, this look soon became stale and tired – making room for the refined and somewhat radical freedoms of the Sixties and Seventies. The era’s au natural movement heralded unlined, unwired bras. Those who wished to retain a modicum of conservatism found a bit of comfort in relatively miniscule slips. Loungewear, or pajama-dressing as it is known today, was widely welcomed in the Seventies, when at-home entertaining was a weekly social standby. Again turning a leaf, the Eighties, as FIT’s exhibit points out, was home to high-octane cuts, bust lines, and sumptuous fabrics that reflect the decade’s more-is-more sensibility. Modern fare: This Jean Yu set from 2005 is just one of the many choices available to the modern lingerie consumers, who now has more choices than ever before when shopping for underpinnings . Modern lingerie - as is highlighted through artifacts by designers including Jean Yu, Chantal Thomass, and Hanky Panky - is defined by its ability to strike a balance between function, form, fashion, and novelty. As is the case with many commercial items today, consumers have access to the widest array of products perhaps in history – rendering the trajectory of lingerie as one that is dictated by its wearers, rather than industry. FIT’s Exposed: A History of Lingerie, is on view in the museum’s Textile History Gallery through November 15.","Exposed: A History of Lingerie is currently on view at the Museum at FIT .

Legal action: Tracy Morgan was released from rehab on Saturday as he is suing Wal Mart after one of the company's truck drivers smashed into his limo leaving him seriously injured . Morgan is suing Wal-Mart over last . month's highway crash that seriously injured him and killed a fellow . comedian. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New . Jersey, claims Wal-Mart was negligent when a driver of one of its . tractor-trailers rammed into Morgan's limousine bus. The . complaint claims the retail giant should have known that its driver had . been awake for over 24 hours and that his commute of 700 miles from his . home in Georgia to work in Delaware was 'unreasonable.' It also alleges . the driver fell asleep at the wheel. Not guilty plea: Kevin Roper (leaving court on June 11), a Wal-Mart truck driver from Georgia, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7 . 'As . a result of Wal-Mart's gross, reckless, willful, wanton, and . intentional conduct, it should be appropriately punished with the . imposition of punitive damages,' according to the complaint. Morgan's lawsuit seeks a jury trial and punitive and compensatory damages. In a statement issued Saturday, Wal-Mart reiterated that it was 'cooperating fully' in the ongoing investigation. Deadly: . A Walmart truck driven by Kevin Roper crashed into the limo bus and the . driver pled not guilty to charges of death by auto . Devastating damage: Investigators have released images that show the extent of the damage to the Mercedes Benz limo van Morgan was riding in when the accident happened .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Upstate New York music festival meant, in part, as a nod to the 1969's Woodstock, was canceled Sunday due to torrential rains sweeping through the area. The Hudson Project was meant to last from July 11 to July 13, but Sunday evening's acts including Bassnectar were rained out. The music was supposed to go on at least through the early morning hours Monday, but rains turned the Saugerties campground into a muddy scene more reminiscent of the summer of 1994's famously sloppy Woodstock followup than the summer of love.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Serial philanderer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reported to have kept a list of dozens of women filed under the letter ‘G’ in his cell phone, including his soon-to-be-wife actress Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan, his alleged mistress who is currently involved in a bitter divorce battle. Allegations about a cell phone full of women’s numbers, have emerged at a tricky time for the 60-year-old, twice-married, father-of-six. Later this month he is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, in a ceremony expected to take place over the weekend of July 25, during the annual Kennedy family reunion in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Robert Kennedy Jr, 60, is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, in a ceremony expected to take place over the weekend of July 25, during the annual Kennedy family reunion in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts . RFK is also in the potentially embarrassing situation of being deposed on July 22 by lawyers for plastic surgeon Laurence Kirwan as part of his bitter divorce battle with his wife Chelsea. Allegations recently surfaced that RFK had an affair with the 42-year-old mother-of-four for two years behind Hines’ back. If all this wasn’t embarrassing enough for RFK and his bride-to-be, the New York Post has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist had contact details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone. The Post reports that Kennedy’s late wife, Mary Richardson, told a friend about the list just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012. Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr . She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under ‘G’ because of the Italian slang for mistress - ‘goomah’. When RFK had contact details for several women with the same first name, he would distinguish them by listing either their profession or city. His list included at least five women from Toronto and other in Paris, Palm Beach, Florida, and Aspen, Colorado. The Post contacted several women on the list, some of whom confirmed that they had met Kennedy. One described him as a ‘big flirt', while another described him as a ‘charming and talented man’, but denied that they had ever been romantically involved. The exact nature of RFK’s relationship with Chelsea Kirwan could be revealed in court later this month when her husband will appeal to try and modify the protection order currently in place over his visitation rights for his three children with ex-wife. Robert Kennedy's late wife, Mary Richardson, is reported to have shared details about a list of 43 suspected mistresses with a friend just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012 . A source told MailOnline; 'Chelsea has learned that Laurence's lawyers are serious about calling Bobby to court later this month. She fears they want to discredit her as a wife and a mom.’ This isn't the first time that details about RFK's serial philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child. Kennedy used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten. The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse. Alongside more prosaic details of Kennedy’s political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. The 48-year-old actress and 60-year-old environmental activist took part in Fourth Of July celebrations in the Hamptons area of New York and didn't try to hide their jewelry ahead of their wedding this month . Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he described them. On days when he didn’t cheat, Kennedy wrote ‘victory’ to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation. ‘I’m . like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001. The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012. The diary later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year. ‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’ At the start of the journal the 59-year-old son of the assassinated U.S. senator announced that his wife was pregnant with their fourth child. Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside in 2012 with their children, wrote in his 2001 diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her . But soon Kennedy was writing about far seedier matters. He often wrote as if he was the victim of the incidents and uses the word ‘mugged’ as shorthand for being seduced. ‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team of [two women]. It was tempting but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no,’ he wrote on February 6, 2001. On May 21, he wrote that after hosting dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio, he drove the actor into Manhattan and met up with someone. He noted that he ‘got mugged on my way home,’ recording a 10 with the name of a woman next to it. ‘I’ve got to do better,’ he added. In another entry, he said he needed to ‘avoid the company of women. You have not the strength to resist their charms’ and to ‘be humble like a monk. Keep your hands to yourself. Avert your eyes.’ Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia, the United States Navy training facility on the island of Vieques. Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility. He wrote positively about his incarceration because it temporarily freed him from the desires of his raging libido. ‘I’m so content here,’ he wrote. ‘I have to say it. There’s no women. I’m happy! Everybody here seems happy. It’s not misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.’ On July 8, just days before son Aiden was born, he wrote lovingly about his wife: ‘I finally spoke to my wonderful wife and that was a joy. She is very strong and cheerful.’ ‘I’m so proud of my Mary. She has become the woman I fell in love with - through hard work. She has overcome her fears, enshrined her faith, abandoned self-pity and blame and immersed herself in gratitude and God gave her a baby... a beautiful and serene and happy soul. 'I am so happy. I couldn’t be happier or more grateful for the life and the wife God has given me.’ Robert Kennedy, far left, photographed in 2001 at a charity event for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. According to his secret diary, Kennedy had dalliances with three different women, including intercourse with one, during the evening . He also found time to contemplate his own weaknesses and his feelings of insecurity in trying to live up the legacy of his father. ‘After daddy died I struggled to be a grown-up... I felt he was watching me from heaven. Every time I was afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I began to lie - to make up a character who was the hero and leader that I wished I was,’ he writes on July 25. Near the end of his jail sentence he wrote of a ‘three-point plan’ for ‘fixing my greatest defect... my lust demons’ - but he never wrote with the plan was. By mid-August, he is out of jail and once again women’s names started to appear in the back of his journal. ‘I have been given everything that I coveted - a beautiful wife and kids and loving family, wealth, education, good health and a job I love yet always on the lookout for something I can’t have. I want it all,’ he wrote. ‘No matter how much I have - I want more.’ November 2001 was an especially busy month for infidelities and he lists at least one woman’s name on 22 different dates, including on 13 . consecutive days. Three dalliances even occurred on the same day - one is marked a ten - when he attended a black-tie fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria on Nov. 13 for Christopher Reeve’s charity.","Robert F.

"By . Corey Charlton . Angelina Corpuz was sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid community work for her 'appalling' behaviour . A nursing home employee has admitted to 'snapping' and spitting at an 85-year-old dementia sufferer she was supposed to be caring for. Angelina Corpuz, 59, assaulted the elderly man, who suffered from dementia and had severe mobility and communication issues, while she was working nights at his nursing home. Corpuz and another care assistant were taking him to his room when he became frustrated and began spitting at them. She eventually 'snapped' after coming 'to the end of her tether' and spat back at the frail father. Her concerned colleague alerted bosses at Wilton Manor Nursing Home, in Southampton, and she was sacked from her job. Corpuz admitted spitting at the man at Southampton Crown Court. She insisted she didn't mean for any saliva to land on the elderly man and claims she only retaliated to show him that he shouldn't spit. But in her victim impact statement read to court, the victim's daughter, who does not want to be named, said: 'I can't help wondering if the assault contributed to his death.' After the case, she added: 'My dad was a lovely, caring man who lived for his family. 'We kept him at home for so long with mum but there came a point where he needed proper care and we put our trust in the staff at the nursing home, and on that night that trust was betrayed. 'You are literally handing over the life of someone you love into someone else's hands and that is one of the most difficult decisions. 'I can't begin to imagine what my dad went through on that evening, he must have been terrified. 'It was a gross act of inhumanity that has disgusted and appalled me.' Judge Derwin Hope said that Corpuz had 'recklessly assaulted' the victim, who had been in the home for eight months, but accepted that it 'arose from the strain' of her job. He added: 'It was a terrible way to treat anyone, particularly one so vulnerable and who relied upon you to treat him with care and decency, as did his family.' Corpuz, who now works as a cleaner, was sentenced to complete 120 hours of unpaid community work. She was ordered to pay 200 pounds costs and a 60 pound victim surcharge. A spokesperson for the nursing home said: 'Everyone at the home was shocked by Angelina Corpuz's behaviour last year. 'None of us can understand how an experienced and fully trained care assistant could behave this way. Corpuz was working at Wilton Manor Nursing Home, pictured, in Southampton, when the assault took place . 'Our people used our whistle-blowing system to raise concerns about this individual's behaviour and we acted immediately by suspending this person and calling in the police. 'The actions of this individual last year do not reflect the home or the committed people who work here. 'Our residents' welfare is always our number one priority.'","Elderly man suffering from severe dementia spat at by nursing home carer .

"By . Jaya Narain . Junior doctor: Hannah Farnsworth, 26, alleged that she had been dragged into an office at night, threatened with a knife and injected with drugs . A junior doctor who claimed she was brutally raped by two men at the hospital where she worked today admitted she lied about the attacks, a medical tribunal was told. Hannah Farnsworth, 26, alleged that she had been dragged into an office at night, threatened with a knife and injected with drugs. The attackers were said to have tied her up with ropes, cut her with a knife and burnt her with a cigarette lighter while raping her. But today she admitted had lied but maintained she had been the victim of two genuine attacks and had exaggerated so senior managers would take her seriously. She told the hearing she was very distressed and upset after she was pinned down and kicked in two incidents at the hospital. But the medic decided to 'embellish' the attacks by saying she had also been raped, sexually assaulted and also became pregnant as a result. She said: 'The whole event was very distressing. It was a shock and I found myself more nervous, more anxious, not sleeping very well, more tearful than usual. 'I wanted some support and to ensure I was supported I did embellish my account. I think it was a way of trying to express the distress I was feeling. 'I didn't feel that I was entitled to feel as distressed as I did. I was worried other people might have a similar view to me, that they might feel that it was not that serious and wonder why I was not my usual self and why I was anxious and distressed.' The medic, who qualified in 2010, added: 'I was worried that unless the attack itself had been serious that people would not take it seriously.' Scene: The alleged incidents happened at Bassetlaw District General Hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire . The doctor, who has been in a same-sex relationship since 2005 and is expecting a baby next January, was appearing before a panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester who will decide whether she is fit to continue with her career. The hearing was told that as a result of the false complaints of rape the hospital trust launched its own investigation and spent around £10,000 to increase staff security. The alleged incidents happened at Bassetlaw District General Hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire and were reported to police. She now admits the rape allegations were false but insists she was physically attacked on two occasions, on April 1 and June 3, 2011. She said: 'I was walking back towards the doctor's office at about 4am as it had got to a stage in the night when I was able to take a break so I was going back to the office. Outside the hearing: The attackers were said to have tied Hannah Farnsworth up with ropes, cut her with a knife and burnt her with a cigarette lighter while raping her . 'The door had a combination lock on it and as I walked in I felt somebody's arm around my neck and shoulders and was pushed down to the ground. 'I felt I was being held down on the ground. Somebody had pushed my head and shoulders to the ground and I felt I couldn't get away. They started kicking me. 'I thought there must have been two [attackers]. I knew I was being held down but also being kicked to my left side, by my ribs.' She added: 'At one point, I managed to get to my hands and knees but was quite quickly kicked back down to the floor. I felt something sharp. I felt a sharp pain in my left upper arm. 'The kicking continued again and I did . manage to get back on my hands and knees, but was kicked so that I was . left facing underneath the desk to the back wall of the office. I heard . the door opening and then it was quiet.' The second alleged attack happened in the hospital car park when she was tripped and thrown to the floor before being repeatedly beaten and kicked. When she was asked to give a full statement on July 19 after the case was passed on to the Nottinghamshire Police she retracted the allegations. Sergeant Melanie Ball of Nottinghamshire Police, told the panel they decided not to charge the woman with wasting police time after she told them she never intended to make an official complaint. She said: 'Fairly quickly she said she had been meaning to get in touch with us and the sexual element had not happened.' 'She maintains something happened but that she exaggerated to her colleagues. Once she said this they reported this to the police.' She added: 'We chose not to prosecute for wasting police time.' She admits lying about the rapes but maintains certain details of the attacks did occur and denies dishonest and misleading conduct. And she took the opportunity to apologise to former colleagues in the public gallery saying: 'I apologise for my behaviour to everybody concerned. I know it was inappropriate and I'm glad I had this opportunity to apologise in person.' Dr Farnsworth is facing a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester where if found guilty, she could be struck off the medical register. The hearing continues.","Hannah Farnsworth, 26, alleged she was dragged into an office at night .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Wayne Rooney could be offered an unlikely route out of Manchester United by Spanish giants Real Madrid this summer. With Rooney now in to the last 18 months of his contract at Old Trafford and unlikely to sign a new one, he knows that there is no way United will sell him to one of their own domestic rivals. However, it has emerged that Real have the 28-year-old on a list of three centre forward targets this summer, behind Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Monaco's unsettled Colombian goalscorer Radamel Falcao. Exit door? Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has emerged as a surprise target for Real Madrid . Re-United: Any move to Spain for Rooney would see him link up with former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Wanted man: Real are also eyeing up Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, here scoring against West Ham . Cristiano Ronaldo - United 2003-2009 . - Real 2009-present . David Beckham - United 1993-2003 . - Real 2003-2007 . Michael Owen - Real 2004-2005 . - United 2009-2012 . Gabriel Heinze - United 2004-2007 . - Real 2007-2009 . Ruud van Nistelrooy - 2001-2006 . - 2006-2010 . Laurie Cunningham  - Real 1979-1984 . - United 1983 (loan) With City highly unlikely to let Aguero go and Falcao tied in to a long contract in the south of France, Rooney would represent a cheaper option for Madrid who are by all accounts attracted by his form this season and the fact he can play as a front-running striker or as a number ten. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti knows all about Rooney from his own time at Chelsea, of course, but the real driving force behind any move is president Florentino Perez, who has been an admirer of the England star for some time. United will try to resist any attempts by Madrid to force through a transfer, happier to let Rooney run down his contract and leave for free in the summer of 2015. Just at the weekend, informed that . Chelsea's Jose Mourinho had predicted Rooney would be sold abroad this . summer, manager David Moyes said: 'I disagree'. Meet the new boss: Real manager Carlo Ancelotti knows all about Rooney from his time at Chelsea . Foreign climes: Monaco hitman Radamel Falcao is also on Real's list of transfer targets . The records of the three Real rivals this season... Wayne Rooney: Games: 25 Goals: 11 . Radamel Falcao: Games: 17 Goals: 9 (League only) Sergio Aguero: Games: 23 Goals: 22 . Worryingly for Moyes right now, meanwhile, is the fact that neither Rooney or his strike partner Robin van Persie trained as expected. It is understood that Van Persie has been held back while Rooney's groin is only giving him a 50-50 chance of playing in the Barclays Premier League game against Cardiff next Tuesday. Neither player will feature in the Capital One Cup against Sunderland. Making his point: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho predicted Rooney would be sold to an overseas club . Meanwhile, United are confident of landing Juan Mata from Chelsea in a £37million deal by the end of the week. Talks regarding the 25-year-old Spain midfielder are so far advanced that Mata is convinced he will have a medical before the weekend.

"By . James Chapman . A Home Office minister has launched an extraordinary attack on the Iraq War inquiry’s decision not to publish secret notes between Tony Blair and George Bush. Norman Baker said key evidence was being ‘filleted’ and urged Mr Blair to intervene to insist that it is included in the long-delayed official report into the 2003 conflict. Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry has been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between the then US and UK leaders private. Home Office minister Norman Baker insisted the public had a right to know about notes sent between Tony Blair and George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war . Mr Baker, a Liberal Democrat minister who is a longstanding critic of the Iraq war, told the Daily Mail: ‘The British people have a right to know what was done in their name without it being filleted by those who would like to keep some matters secret. 'Iraq is perhaps the most serious undermining of democracy for decades and we need the full facts. We are now led to believe Tony Blair is happy to have everything published. I urge him now to call for that publicly.' Last month, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run-up to the 2003 conflict, insisting that only their ‘gist’ is included in Sir John’s findings. In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President: 'You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I'm with you.' The official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private. But Whitehall sources claim security chiefs and officials in Washington have been firmly against their release. 'The British people have a right to know what was done in their name without it being filleted by those who would like to keep some matters secret' Sir John said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘gists and quotes’ from some of the messages. He said this was crucial in order for people to understand the inquiry’s conclusions. But the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘minimum necessary’, and following the protests from the US, no details of Mr Bush’s messages will be published. Mr Baker’s intervention comes after former prime minister Sir John Major warned that the decision not to allow the Chilcot inquiry to publish the full correspondence would allow conspiracy theories to 'fester'. He said it was a 'pity' that only the gist of the notes and conversations would be published, and also urged Mr Blair to publicly call for the details to be published in full. Mr Blair, who is expected to face heavy criticism in the report, has always denied trying to block the release of the messages. Sources close to the former prime minister insist it is in his interests for the Iraq Inquiry report finally to be published because it will allow him to ‘make the argument’ about why he took Britain to war. The Chilcot inquiry held its last public hearings in 2011, but publication of its conclusions has been held back by wrangling over the publication of the private communications between Mr Blair and Mr Bush. Sir Jeremy is said to have backed concerns from intelligence services and diplomats that publishing the documents might jeopardise the ‘special relationship’ between the UK and the US. Senior Whitehall figures are also said to have expressed alarm at the precedent that would be set by disclosing private discussions between a British prime minister and another world leader. Sir John is thought to have wanted to publish sensitive material, covering some 200 Cabinet-level discussions, 25 notes from Mr Blair to Mr Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between the PM and the US president, in full. The deal that was agreed last month between the Cabinet Office and the inquiry broke the deadlock, and means the findings are expected to be published at the end of this year.","Norman Baker urges Tony Blair to intervene to release all exchanges .

"By . Sam Webb . Jailed: English Defence League founder Stephen Lennon has been sentenced to ten months in prison for using a friend's passport to enter the U.S. The leader of the English Defence League was today jailed for 10 months after admitting using someone else's passport to travel to the United States. Stephen Lennon, 30, pleaded guilty to possession of a false identity document with improper intention, contrary to the Identity Documents Act 2010, at Southwark Crown Court. Lennon used a passport in the name of Andrew McMaster to board a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow to New York, but was caught out after his fingerprints were taken by customs officials. He left the airport and entered the U.S. illegally but left the country the following day, using his own passport to return to the UK. The court heard that Lennon, who had previously been refused entry to the U.S., used his friend's passport to travel to the country in September. He used a self check-in kiosk to board the Virgin Atlantic flight at Heathrow, and was allowed through when the document was checked in the bag drop area. But when he arrived at New York's JFK Airport, customs officials who took his fingerprints realised he was not Mr McMaster. Lennon was asked to attend a second interview but left the airport, entering the U.S. illegally. He stayed just one night and travelled back to the UK the following day using his own legitimate passport - which bears the name Paul Harris. The court heard that is the name that appears on the EDL leader's passport, although he uses aliases. Lennon, who was arrested in October, was jailed for 10 months today. The court heard that he was previously jailed for assault in 2005 and also has previous convictions for drugs offences and public order offences. Sentencing the 30-year-old, Judge Alistair McCreath, told him: 'I am going to sentence you under the name of Stephen Lennon although I suspect that is not actually your true name, in the sense that it is not the name that appears on your passport. 'What I have to deal with you for is clear enough. 'You knew perfectly well that you were not welcome in the United States. 'You knew that because you tried before and you had not got in, and you knew the reason for that - because, rightly or wrongly, the U.S. authorities do not welcome people in their country who have convictions of the kind that you have. Unwelcome: Stephen Lennon, who uses a number of aliases, was banned from the U.S. for previous convictions . 'With that full knowledge, you equipped yourself with a passport. I am told that it was given you by way of a loan from your friend Andrew McMaster, to which you bore, I am told, some resemblance. 'And by use of that passport you did what you could to get into the United States. 'But you did not get in because they took your fingerprints and they worked out that you were not who you claimed to be. 'I am told that, by whatever means, you slipped away from the U.S. authorities, got into the country and then very rapidly - and understandably so - got out of it.' He said Lennon had used his own passport to get out of the U.S., adding: 'You did so, I am quite sure, in order to avoid the consequences that would have fallen upon you had you been caught by the authorities in America.' The judge went on: 'What you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the United States are entitled to have. Extremist: Lennon, seen here at an EDL demonstration, bears a resemblance to the man who lent him the passport, the court heard . 'Had it been known in this country that you were proposing to leave under a false passport, you would not have been accepted on to the plane and you would not have been permitted to leave this country on a false passport. 'It's not in any sense trivial.' He sentenced Lennon to 10 months in prison, minus the days he has already served in custody. Prosecutor Simon Sandford said it was the Crown's case that Lennon committed the offence while on bail for breaching an International Football Banning Order - of which the court heard he was acquitted. Opening the case, Mr Sandford told the court: 'On Monday September 10 2012, the defendant travelled from Heathrow Airport to New York on a Virgin Atlantic flight, travelling using a passport in the name of Andrew McMaster, believed to be a colleague of the defendant. 'He checked in using a self check-in kiosk at Heathrow before proceeding to the baggage drop area. 'The defendant then proceeded through security and boarded the flight.' He added: 'Upon arrival in New York, he was the subject of immigration checks as with everybody else. 'He identified himself to the United States Customs and Border Protection officials as Andy McMaster.' Lennon passed through Heathrow on the passport without incident, but suspicions were raised at New York's JFK Airport . Photographs and fingerprints were taken, and U.S. customs officials realised that Lennon was not who he said he was. 'He had been previously refused entry to the U.S. on the grounds of his previous convictions and he was directed to attend a secondary investigation but he did not report for that,' the prosecutor said. 'He left the immigration and customs area, entered the United States unlawfully and then he returned to Heathrow, via Shannon Airport, and used his passport in the name of Paul Harris, which is a name he does go by.' The court heard that although Lennon has only one passport, which is in that name, he uses aliases. US officials produced fingerprints and photographs proving that Lennon was not Mr McMaster, the court heard, and there was also CCTV from JFK Airport showing him arriving. Lennon was arrested in October and did not reply to questions in interview. In mitigation, his defence barrister, Giles Cockings, told the court that Lennon had not stolen the passport, and had only used it for a day. Authorities at JFK realised Lennon was not the person in the passport. File picture . He told the court his client had pleaded guilty straightaway, demonstrating 'a certain amount of courage'. 'Firstly, this passport was not stolen, it was lent by a friend for whatever purpose,' he told the court. 'Secondly, he was only using the passport, it transpires, for a day and a half. In fact he only spent one evening in the United States of America. ""I think the intention was simply to avoid a necessity for a visa into the United States. 'Upon realising that in actual fact it was not going to assist matters, on realising he had committed an offence, he used his own passport to come back. 'It is not, I would suggest, the most aggravating of cases of this kind.' The EDL has held many demonstrations across the country since it was formed in Luton in March 2009 after Muslim radicals disrupted a homecoming parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment. It has become the most significant far-right street movement in Britain since the National Front in the Seventies.","Stephen Lennon pleaded guilty to possession of a false identity document .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Liesl Testwuide's eight-year-old son left for summer camp, she hoped to receive a letter detailing his frog-catching adventures and sleeping under the stars. But what the mother-of-three boys received was a very honest - and hilarious - note about what really goes on at camp. 'I've ate more push-pops then anyone. I've ate 23 since Monday. Still two days left, 37 is the rekerd and I can beat it. Sweet!,' the Wisconsin boy wrote last year. Writing home: Liesl Testwuide, pictured with her three boys, received a hilarious letter from her youngest son . The funny letter has recently gone viral, despite single mom Testwuide sharing it on hairpinturnsahead.com, her blog about parenting and dating, in July last year. The youngster appeared to be having a great time, and showed great resourcefulness. He wrote: 'I used my toothbrush to dig for werms. Don't freek out. The guy in the bottom bunk lets me use him.' The letter contained other gems about the perils of horse riding, the horrors of eating oatmeal and the best way to say the alphabet. 'I don't know his name (boy from camp) but he can burp the alphabit like me. A kid named Zack can burp the alphabit backwords. I'm practicing that,' Testwuide's son wrote. Dear mom: Liesl was surprised by the letter her son sent from summer camp . New experiences: The youngster was excited to share the new skills he was learning, such as burping the alphabet backwards . Happy to share: Liesl's son wrote that he was looking forward to showing off his new-found skills . 'Good you packt extra underwear since I had diyareeya. It got on my . shoes but not my pillow.

"By . Amanda Williams . Richard Otunga, 37, repeatedly plunged a knife into Shamim Gabriel, 33, in a 'horrifying' and savage attack at their flat in Northolt, west London . A jealous Royal Mail worker who stabbed his wife 32 times for texting other men before inviting her father around to show him her dead body was jailed for life today. Richard Otunga, 37, repeatedly plunged a knife into Shamim Gabriel, 33, in a 'horrifying' and savage attack at their flat in Northolt, west London. The Old Bailey heard that Otunga had called his father-in-law and said that he had argued with his wife and that she had no serious injuries. But Ms Gabriel’s father, Gabby, arrived to find his daughter lying in a pool of blood, wearing only her underwear. He asked Otunga: 'Is this what you called me for, to show me the body of my daughter?' He told the court that his son-in-law simply replied that he was 'very sorry'. Otunga later told detectives his wife came at him with a knife and he was trying to defend himself. He said: 'I killed her. She was getting text messages from men at work, we both work for Royal Mail. 'We argued and she went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and said she would kill herself, so I took it and killed her.' The postmortem revealed Ms Gabriel had suffered 32 wounds. Otunga, . who had a history of domestic violence, claimed he had 'lost . consciousness' during the incident on December 29, last year. The . court heard that Ms Gabriel had repeatedly complained to her family . about Otunga’s jealous behaviour, and that in July 2013 he held a knife . to her throat threatening to kill her. A few months later he threatened to run the man who was texting his wife over with his car and murder Ms Gabriel as well. Otunga, of Northolt, west London, was found guilty of murder. He had admitted manslaughter. The court heard that Ms Gabriel had repeatedly complained to her family about Otunga's jealous behaviour, and that in July 2013 he held a knife to her throat threatening to kill her. The postmortem revealed Ms Gabriel had suffered from 32 wounds . Sentencing Otunga, Judge Timothy Pontius said: 'This case and the evidence upon which the jury convicted you of murder presents a truly tragic picture of a marriage which was for much of the time happy and loving, but one which was polluted by your possessive and jealous behaviour towards your wife.' He added: 'On 29 of December last, you took a kitchen knife, or knives, and attacked her with such unrelenting savagery that 32 stab wounds were identified by the pathologist, many of which were fatal. 'So ferocious was the attack that she did not stand a chance of survival. She had fallen pouring blood to the floor. More than half and hour passed before you rang 999, and only then upon the instinct of your father in law by which time of course, any chance of her life being saved - if any chance existed - had long gone.' Otunga, of Northolt, west London, was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey, and jailed for 22 years. He had admitted manslaughter . Judge Pontius said that he had attacked his wife with 'horrifying savagery', and added: 'It doesn’t take much imagination to picture the terror your wife must have felt as you struck those blows again and again.' In a statement to the court, Mr Gabriel said he would never be able to forget seeing his daughter lying dead. He added: 'Shamim was a very generous and caring person and would provide emotional assistance to her sisters. 'When she was alive she was the centre of our family. As far as I am concerned, Shamim’s death had effected me very badly. I will never ever forget seeing her lying on the kitchen floor with just her panties on. 'Shamim’s murder has left my family incomplete. Her murder had brought a sort of numbness to our family and emptiness.'","Richard Otunga, 37, repeatedly stabbed Shamim Gabriel, 33, in brutal attack .

"By . Amanda Williams . An 85-year-old woman is fighting for her life after she was repeatedly stabbed and possibly raped in her own home. Police say the pensioner - who was attacked in the Morningside area of Edinburgh - was stabbed several times, . suffered blunt force trauma to her chest and face and a cut to her neck. They said some of her injuries suggest she was sexually . assaulted. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, remains unconscious in a critical but stable condition in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and officers are treating the incident as attempted murder. An 85-year-old woman is fighting for her life in hospital after she was repeatedly stabbed and possibly raped in her own home, in Morningside, Edinburgh . Detective Chief Inspector Keith Hardie, who is leading the investigation, said officers were keen to find a man aged between 18 and 30 who was seen by a neighbour in the doorway of the woman’s home at around 3.30pm. It is still unclear whether the incident was random or if the woman knew the attacker. She was alone in her home between 3pm and 4.30pm while her husband went out to the local shops, and officers are still working to pinpoint a time when the assault took place. DCI Hardie said: 'On his return he found her collapsed in the living room, and initially suspected she had fallen, but inquires found she had been the victim of a very very serious and life-threatening attack.' Detective Chief Inspector Keith Hardie (left) and Chief Inspector Richard Horan. They said officers were keen to find a man aged between 18 and 30 who was seen by a neighbour in the doorway of the woman's home at around 3.30pm . He said time of the reported sighting of the man in the doorway - 3.30pm - was a 'crucial time' for officers. It is believed the attacker left via the back door of the property. 'He was 18 to 30 years old, of average build with short dark hair. It was more of a glance what the witness got of him, because he wasn’t doing anything particularly suspicious,' said DCI Hardie. 'We are not ruling out whether it was random or targeted. I would certainly not discount the fact that the attacker has seen the husband leave the house and thought he was leaving an empty house, but at this stage in the inquiry it’s crucial to keep an open mind.' Officers remain certain that there was only one person responsible for the attack. DCI Hardie said: 'I would find it almost unfeasible for two people to be of a like mind to be prepared to do that to an elderly individual.' Cabinets in the living room, which was at the rear of the house, were open, but it is not yet known whether anything was stolen as the property is still being examined for forensic evidence. DCI Hardie added: 'In my experience within the service I have never really heard of anything to this extent or its nature, a vicious attack and an attempt to take her life. 'We are dealing with undoubtedly an attempted murder, there’s a potential sexual element to it and we can’t rule out a theft. Perhaps the lady has disturbed somebody carrying out a theft. At this stage we can’t rule anything out by way of a motive.' He urged anyone with information to come forward.","Woman was stabbed several times in brutal attack in Edinburgh .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is the airline that is famed for hitting passengers with a huge fee if they forget to print their own boarding pass. But now Ryanair is going high-tech. The budget airline has launched an app that will allow passengers to store their boarding pass on their phone and avoid having to print it out at all. Ryanair has long talked about its wish to . get rid of check-in desks altogether and to that end has charged . passengers who go to the airport without their boarding pass already . printed. Charm offensive: The new technology is part of Ryanair's attempts to improve its service, along with allocated seating and increased cabin baggage allowance . Now, passengers can download their boarding pass on to their phone and show the digital version at check-in, rather than printing out a paper copy. The boarding passes will be available offline and more than one can be carried on a single phone. The app, which was officially launched . today but has been available since Friday, is currently being offered in . English, Italian and Spanish and the company said further language versions . would follow. It also . allows passengers to view live flight information, make flight . bookings, choose their seats, and add baggage to their booking. Passengers must check in online up to one week - but no less than four hours - before their flight. The only snag? You have to be in possession of a smartphone. If not, you will have to print your boarding pass at home or face a €15 (£12) fee at the airport. And, if your phone runs out of battery before you reach the airport, you will still have to pay the €15 fee to have your boarding pass printed out at check-in. Plus, 10 per cent of airports that Ryanair flies to do not offer mobile check-in services. The company said that these airports would be listed on its website. The new app means passengers with smartphones no longer have to print their boarding pass - but they have to make sure their phone doesn't run out of battery before they reach the airport . Ryanair’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, said: ‘We’ve worked hard to develop a product which we’re proud of and which will make travelling with Ryanair even better and our customers can expect regular app updates that will make it an even more useful travel tool. ‘Our ‘Always Getting Better’ programme has delivered better services, more choice and enhanced inflight and digital experiences for our customers and we look forward to making further improvements for the 84m people who will fly with us this year.’ The latest technology is part of Ryanair’s attempts to improve its image after issuing its first profit warning in over a decade last year. It introduced allocated seating, increased its cabin baggage allowance and cut the fee for printing a boarding pass, which used to cost €60 (£48). Not foolproof: Anyone whose phone dies before they reach the airport will have to pay a 15 euro (£12) fee to print their boarding pass at the airport . Last month, in a desperate attempt to appeal to family travellers, Ryanair announced its new family product, Ryanair Family Extra, offering families a range of discounts on travel and an improved service on all flights. With the new plans, families are offered fifty per cent allocated seating discounts on children’s seats, fifty per cent off checked-in bags for children and discounted priority boarding. They also announced fifty per cent off travel insurance for children, reduced infant fees (now £20), a free 5kg infant bag allowance. Appealing to their passengers travelling with very young children, Ryanair bosses announced that there will now be bottle warming and baby changing facilities on board every plane (something most parents expect). Families will also be allowed two free pieces of infant equipment, such as buggies, booster seats, car seats or travel cots in the hold. As an extra added bonus, regular fliers will get a Fly & Save bonus – giving them twenty per cent off their third family flight when their family fly twice. Change of heart? In 2012, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary called a passenger who was charged £236 to print five boarding passes 'stupid' and an 'idiot' In 2012, the airline’s chief executive Michael O’Leary called a passenger who forgot to print her boarding pass an ‘idiot’. He claimed that 99.98 per cent of Ryanair passengers printed their boarding pass in advance and said: ‘To those who don’t, who say quite politely: ‘B***** off'.' Passenger Suzy McLeod was charged €300 (£236) to print out five boarding passes before a flight from Alicante to Bristol. The Ryanair boss branded her 'stupid' and an 'idiot' for failing to comply with the agreement at the time of booking. Mrs McLeod, 35, from Newbury, Berkshire, criticised Ryanair’s rule and said she was unable to print her family’s passes while they were in Spain for 15 days last month. Passengers could not print out boarding passes more than 14 days in advance. She was backed by more than 350,000 Facebook users after complaining of her ‘unfair’ treatment by the Irish no-frills airline, which has been frequently criticised for its extra charges. But Mr O’Leary said she should have printed the passes at an internet cafe or asked a friend to print and fax them to her. Instead, he said, ‘she then comes home and gets on Twitter, God help us all, and somehow we are going to change our policies. No, we’re not’.","Free app was officially launched today but has been available since Friday .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A former network TV executive filed a malicious-prosecution lawsuit against a former aspiring actor who recently withdrew a lawsuit that accused the executive of sexually abusing him in the late 1990s. Garth Ancier, 56, who was a high-ranking executive at the NBC, Fox and WB networks, filed his lawsuit in a federal court in Honolulu two days after Michael Egan III, 31, voluntarily dismissed his case. The lawsuit also names two of Egan's attorneys, Jeff Herman, of Florida, and Mark Gallagher, of Hawaii. Ancier lawsuit states his reputation was damaged by Egan's claims that he was sexually molested by the executive and other entertainment industry figures, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, on a trip to Hawaii in 1999 when he was 17 years old. Legal wrangle: Former TV executive Garth Ancier has filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit against Mike Egan (center) and his attorney Jeff Herman (right) as well as another attorney . Suing: Garth Ancier says Mike Egan and his attorneys knew a lawsuit accusing him of sexual molestation when Egan was a teenager was false . Ancier and Singer have denied being in Hawaii at the time Egan says he was abused. Ancier's suit claims that Egan and his attorney sought to 'smear, harass and severely injure Mr Ancier as part of an avowed and . very public campaign by Mr Egan’s counsel to troll for new clients who . would enable them to shake down other entertainment industry executives . with threats of sexual assault charges.' Egan's attorneys did not respond to requests by Ancier's attorneys to produce evidence that supported the sex abuse lawsuit, the new case states. Ancier was in Los Angeles and New York developing lineups of shows for NBC at the time Egan claims he was abused. His lawyer, Louise Ann Fernandez, has said Ancier never visited the estate in Hawaii where Egan claimed he was abused. 'This fabrication of facts in Hawaii . that never took place, to create jurisdiction in a forum where there was . none and to drum up more business for Mr Egan's counsel, requires that . defendants be held to account for malicious prosecution and abuse of . process,' the lawsuit states. Dismissed: Michael Egan III has dropped a third child sex abuse lawsuit against theatre producer Gary Wayne . Ancier's . complaint states he has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars . defending himself against Egan's claims and is seeking punitive damages. 'Mike . Egan maintains that he was sexually abused by Garth Ancier in both . Hawaii and California.

"By . Ashley Collman . A Massachusetts hospital is under investigation after two women died giving birth to healthy children within a month of each other. Maternal deaths in the United States are quite rare and happened just three times in the state last year. Colleen Celia, 32, died last week during a planned Caesarian section at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth. She was preceded in death by Christie Fazio, 30, who died on December 14. According to family, the two women were able to hold their children before passing away. Left behind: Paul Celia (left) and John Fazio (right) became widowers within a month of each other after their wives Colleen Celia and Christie Fazio died in childbirth. Above, Mr Celia holds daughter Mya and Mr Fazio holds son Johnathan . Under investigation: The South Shore Hospital in Weymouth is being investigated by the state public health department over the deaths . On Sunday, the hospital released a statement saying that their staff did all they could in attempting to save the women. 'It is too early to know the exact nature of the underlying factors that led to these tragic outcomes,' the statement read. 'All signs suggest that the two situations were unrelated, unanticipated and unpreventable.' Hospitals are required to report maternal deaths and other serious injuries within seven days and file an additional follow-up report after 30 days. Mrs Celia, a patient coordinator at Vanguard Medical, was already a mother of three children, ages 14, 9 and 6. She had given birth to her other children vaginally but delivered daughter Mya Rose via c-section after her pregnancy was ruled high-risk. High risk: 32-year-old Colleen Celia had previously given birth to three other children, but scheduled a Caesarian section at South Shore Hospital last week since her pregnancy was deemed 'high-risk' Mother taken: Mrs Celia left behind four children including her newborn Mya. Her previous children range in age from 6 to 14 . Doctors told her family that she died from an amniotic fluid embolism which happens when there is a blockage in the bloodstream. Her husband Paul Celia, 31, was in the room as she slipped away. 'I wouldn’t leave her,' Mr Celia told the Boston Herald. 'They tried everything they could to save her.' Mr Celia says he's not angry at the hospital, but he would like to make sure it doesn't happen again. It was unclear whether Mrs Fazio underwent a c-section or vaginal birth. She was able to briefly hold her son Jonathan before doctors noticed she was bleeding and tried to save her. Meeting her son: Christie Fazio died on December 14. She was briefly able to hold her son Jonathan before doctors noticed her bleeding and tried to save her . Her husband John Fazio, 27, also spoke with the Herald and said he is dealing with her death by taking comfort that she is 'with the lord'. Mr Fazio also treasures the newborn son she left behind. 'I definitely see Christie’s face in him,' Fazio said. 'I get strength from that smile.' Mr Celia echoed the same sentiment, calling newborn daughter Mya a gift. Hospital staff are also having a hard time dealing with the deaths. Previous gifts: John Fazio says he takes comfort in his newborn son who has Christie's face. 'I get strength from that smile,' he said. Spokesman Sarah Darcy told the Enterprise News that the maternity ward 'has been understandably devastated'. 'Their focus right now is on supporting these two families,' Ms Darcy said Sunday. The Board of Registration in Medicine lists no discipline or malpractice decision against any obstetricians at the hospital. Maternal deaths happen just 650 times a year in the U.S. Maternal deaths have been on the rise and are double what they were 25 years ago, but most of that is contributed to better reporting and environmental reasons.","Colleen Celia, 32, and Christie Fazio, 30, died in childbirth at South Shore Hospital just one month apart .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nicola Benedetti, whose album Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy has entered the top 20 of the UK Official Album chart . She became BBC Young Musician of the Year when she was 16, was named one of Britain’s most powerful young women earlier this year and already has an MBE and eight honorary degrees. But Nicola Benedetti has added yet another string to her bow. Yesterday she became the first solo British violinist since the 1990s to enter the Top 20 of the official UK albums chart with her record Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy. She is also the first ever Scottish classical artist to enter the Top 20. It’s at number 19 and expected to rise. The last British violinist to score a Top 20 album as a solo performer was Vanessa Mae in 1995. Nigel Kennedy achieved the same feat in 1989. Miss Benedetti, who is due to perform at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have reached the Top 20, not something a classical artist ever expects. This is a deeply personal recording inspired by Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy. 'The project took me deep into the heart of Scottish culture. I hope the music, in all its diversity, is providing some uplift  and pleasure.’ Earlier this year the 26-year-old lashed out at critics who claim glamorous classical musicians succeed because of their sexy image rather than their artistic ability. She said it amounted to sexism when talented female artists were judged on their looks, adding: ‘Classical music can be prouder of its integrity than many industries. People are basically chosen for their ability.’ Miss Benedetti’s latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work. She was named in Britain’s Top 30: The Young Female Power List, published in the Times in February, alongside the likes of Adele, Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge. Miss Benedetti's latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work . Her rendition of Scottish Fantasy, a piece of classical music written in 1880 by the German romantic composer Max Bruch, now sits in the mainstream chart alongside pop acts such as Will.i.am – a judge on BBC talent show The Voice. The number one spot was claimed by the rapper and producer. His new single has gone straight in at the top of the charts to give him his 10th UK number one. It’s My Birthday, featuring 17-year-old American singer Cody Wise, tops the pile 11 years after The Voice judge’s first number one, 2003’s Black Eyed Peas hit Where Is The Love, . He knocked reigning chart queens Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea down to two with Problem, while Ella Henderson also slides one to number three with Ghost, according to the Official Chart Company. The pop star now has five solo number one singles in Britain, the same as he has with the Black Eyed Peas.","Nicola Benedetti's new record enters official UK album chart's top 20 .

"It turns out people aren't the only ones who like kissing as these smooching lizards show. The pair of amorous reptiles were spotted by a family visiting the Henri Pittier National Park in Venezuela. Mother-of-two Mariana Ramos de la Rosa was exploring the rainforest which, at 5,900 feet metres above sea level, is the highest point in the South American country. Mariana Ramos de la Rosa took this picture of a pair of lizards in the rainforest in Venezuela . The 48-year-old fine arts student said: 'At the time I wasn't wearing my glasses and there wasn't much I could see. 'But I saw this beautiful and bright blue turquoise in the distance and prepared my camera and took two shots and showed them to my son. 'I thought there was only one lizard and to my surprise my son told me, 'mum it's not one, there are two and they are kissing!'. Close up reveals lizards are enjoying a kiss in the rainforest . 'I took another shot but the female had disappeared and the male was looking all over the place for her.' The blue and green lizards are also known as Rainbow Whiptails and are found in Central and South America and some Caribbean Islands. They have a streamlined body, a pointed head, a slightly forked tongue and females usually lay their eggs between March and December. The Rainbow Whiptail lizard is a popular pet and enjoys feeding on crickets and mealworms . They can grow up to 12 inches and can live up to four years. Their striking colouring makes them a popular exotic pet. Because they are fast and agile, a large aquarium, at least 75 gallons, is advised to house them in. Typically the lizards like to bask in the sun, so a sunning area should be provided at 110F.","Lizards were spotted in rainforest in Venezuela .

"By . Rob Cooper . Scandal: Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigned amid allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests . Disgraced former Cardinal Keith O’Brien is to leave Scotland for several months after admitting inappropriate sexual conduct during his church career, the Vatican has said. Britain’s most senior Catholic cleric resigned earlier this year amid allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests. The Vatican confirmed today that O'Brien will leave Scotland 'for spiritual renewal'. The cardinal stepped down as leader of . the Scottish Catholic Church at the end of February after admitting . that his sexual conduct 'had fallen beneath the standards' expected of . him during his almost 50-year career. He indicated that he would not contest . claims by three priests and a former priest of inappropriate behaviour . dating back to the 1980s, and intended to retire permanently from the . public life of the church. O'Brien was an outspoken critic of homosexuality which he had called a 'moral degradation'. Last year he was named 'Bigot of the Year' by gay rights group Stonewall and he had campaigned against moves to legalise same-sex marriage. However, as the scandal broke there were claims he was in a 'longstanding physical relationship' with one of the men who made the allegations. A Vatican statement said: 'His Eminence Cardinal Keith Patrick O’Brien... will be leaving Scotland for several months for the purpose of spiritual renewal, prayer and penance. Any decision regarding future arrangements for his eminence shall be agreed with the Holy See.' It was reported earlier this month that the cardinal, originally from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, was to settle in Dunbar, East Lothian. Senior cleric: Cardinal O'Brien was the most senior member of the Catholic Church in Britain . The Vatican said today his departure from Scotland was 'in agreement with the Holy Father'. When he resigned the cardinal issued as apology saying: 'I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal. 'To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise. 'I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland.' The cardinal had been the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh since 1985. Ordained as a priest in 1965, he was proclaimed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in October 2003.

"By . Katy Winter . The world's tallest model, Amazon Eve, has finally found love - and her Mr Right is only four inches shorter than her. The 34-year-old beauty stands at a lofty 6ft 8in and completely dwarfs most men she meets. But now the towering brunette from Turlock, California is in a relationship and is enjoying barely having to stoop to kiss her new man. Scroll down for video . Amazon Eve and her boyfriend Dennis Hargrove draw looks when they step out together as they tower above most passers by . Always tall, by the age of 14 Amazon Eve was already 5ft 9, she towered over her classmates and teachers, but the small height difference between her and her new love means she no longer has to tower over men . Her American boyfriend Dennis Hargrove, who is in his 60s and lives in LA, measures a generous 6ft 4in - making the couple a near perfect match. Dennis said: 'I have no problem being with a taller woman, in fact my friends are envious of my girlfriend.' The pair met when Dennis started working as Eve's accountant and they hit it off straight away. Amazon Eve, also known as Erika Ervin said: 'The first time I met Dennis we were going over some tax preparation, not the most romantic encounter, but then when I heard him speak French I just fell head over heels. I remembered the time I was all alone in Paris and wished I had a boyfriend. He's not like any other man I've dated.' Dennis, who began his accounting business 1993 says: 'Eve is a tender loving companion to me. She sometimes complains about her height from time to time, but I know she enjoys being tall. 'She likes to live out a superhero fantasy, imagining herself as wearing a costume, riding the world of evil with her brains, martial arts and sense of justice as her only weapons. 'My nickname for Eve is ""Victory"" as to me, she represents the statue Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Louvre Museum in Paris. 'Eve is very spontaneous and energetic, I love her for who she is and I always look forward to the next time we are together.' Despite having thousands of admirers, Eve's longest relationship before Dennis had lasted just six months as she struggled to find Mr right. Although Dennis is four inches shorter than her, Erika says that her difficult dating experience has taught her to be open to different possibilities . 'I've dated men of all sizes, even a . 5ft comedian,' said Erika, who started modelling four years . ago after appearing on the front cover of Zoo Weekly magazine. 'But . the short men I dated saw me as a replacement for their mother and the . few taller men I've dated were either too old, not available, too boring . or struggled to cope with the fact I could look them directly in the . eye. 'I did worry I'd never find true love.' Eve has also worked as a personal trainer, . paralegal and political lobbyist, and now the full time model and actress also makes money by charging $400 an hour for men to . wrestle her. Although she says that she lets Dennis wrestle her for free, even sometimes letting him win. Dennis says: 'I love to challenge Eve to a game of table tennis, I always beat her, but there is always the thought at the back of my mind that she could throw the bat at me at any time. Erika used to worry her height meant she would never find love, but is happy with Dennis who she met when he was her accountant . Gushing over her new man, she said: 'Dennis is very personable and kind hearted. 'He knows when I've had a tough day or I'm under a deadline and he manages to ease my mind with a well timed back rub. 'I used to have a long list of wants in a man, but my dating experience has taught me to be open to different kinds of possibilities. If there's no chemistry then it won't work. 'Guys forget that Amazon Eve is an alter ego I play in the entertainment biz. Guys who approach me with a focus to be with me because of my height tend to see me only as a fetish object - albeit just a surface attraction. Erika says that being introduced to fitness training by a previous boyfriend gave her body confidence . 'Dennis is shorter than me at 6'4"" and I'm content with that. It's hard to have a 'wish list', you end up placing your world in a box and you don't see the good outside that box.' One of the worst dating disasters the model experienced was with a man who after their first meet, grabbed her crotch and asked 'you don't have a penis do you?' As a child Eve was always tall and by the age of 14 and 5ft 9, she towered over her classmates and teachers. 'While all the girls were getting breasts, I just kept growing skywards,"" said Eve, whose mum Patricial was 6ft 1in and dad William 6ft 7in. 'People called me 'giant' and 'stretch' because I was ridiculously tall, flat chested and lanky. 'I hated my body so much I hid myself away and avoided the boys I fancied because I didn't want to be rejected. 'No-boy was interested in taking me to the school prom.' Over the next five years Eve suffered terrible growing pains as she shot up 11 inches, and by 19 stood at 6ft 8in. 'It was one of the worst times of my life,' said Eve, who struggled to find clothes to fit her 40-in inside leg and shoes for size 11 feet. 'Whenever I walked into a room everyone gawked at me.' Eve eventually took up acting classes to boost her confidence. 'I dreamed of being a Hollywood star, but the main parts I won were as aliens or monsters,' explained Eve, who has starred as Shelley Godfrey in hit T.V series Hemlock Grove. It wasn't until 2004 that she finally found the courage to start dating men, after meeting Karl, a 5ft 10 airline mechanic in a bar. Although the relationship fizzled out after four months, he introduced Eve to fitness training, which hugely boosted her confidence and made her appreciate her body. Erika says: 'The first time I met Dennis we were going over some tax preparation, not the most romantic encounter, but then when I heard him speak French I just fell head over heels. He's not like any other man I've dated.' Eve then joined a dating website but had little success after a handful of dates. Then when she was 27 and working as a fitness trainer, Eve dated a 5ft 6 Italian bodybuilder for six months but eventually the relationship became very one-dimensional and she moved on. 'Rico was lovely and his height didn't make a difference when lying down, but I realized I wanted a man who could sweep me off my feet intellectually as well as physically. 'Taller men find me too much too handle because they're used to a woman looking up to them and short men see me as a trophy. 'Dennis isn't like that, he is successful in his own right, confident and loves me for who I am.' Eve credits her height to genes - saying her German and Dutch heritage is the reason why she is so tall. She said: 'All the women in my family are tall.' Now she has said goodbye to single life and looks forward to a future with Dennis, and the couple have spent the summer holidaying in Paris and Barcelona.","Amazon Eve, or Erika Ervin, is 6ft 8 and worried she would never find love .

"By . Stephen Wright . A 'lorry load' of evidence relating to an investigation into alleged police corruption over the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was systematically shredded over two days, it was reported today . THE mass shredding of files from a major Scotland Yard corruption inquiry was yesterday branded ‘an out and out disgrace’ by a murder victim’s brother. Alastair Morgan, whose private eye brother Daniel was killed by an axeman in a plot allegedly involving police officers, hit out following reports that a ‘lorry load’ of documents from a top-secret corruption probe had been destroyed over two days. The latest revelations deepened the Metropolitan Police ‘shredding scandal’ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force. The large-scale destruction of corruption files was a key finding of a review of the Stephen Lawrence case, published earlier this month, which suggested possible links between an allegedly corrupt officer involved in the Lawrence case – former Detective Sergeant John Davidson – and the investigation into the Morgan murder. Married father-of-two Daniel Morgan, 37, was found with an axe in his head in a south-east London pub car park in 1987. His murder remains unsolved, despite five investigations. An independent judge-led panel of experts is now reviewing the police handling of the murder, amid claims corrupt officers prevented convictions. Mr Morgan’s family say he was on the verge of exposing police corruption when he was killed. His brother Alastair added: ‘We need a supervised outside investigation into the shredding of the Met’s corruption files. 'This is not a mistake.’ Inquiry: The Bishop of Stepney, Sir William MacPherson, Tom Cook and Dr. Richard Stone - at the preliminary hearing of the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry in 1997 . Following publication earlier this . month of the review by Mark Ellison QC, it is now feared corrupt . officers who thwarted justice in the Morgan case could also have . shielded those who murdered Stephen in a racist attack in Eltham, . south-east London, in 1993. Buried . in the review is a reference to a police intelligence report, dated . April 28, 2004, concerning Operation Abelard, the investigation into . Daniel Morgan’s murder. The report had ‘specific emphasis’ on Davidson, and stated that he was attached to the initial Morgan investigation in 1987. It . said: ‘DS Davidson has been investigated by this command . (Anti-Corruption Command) in the past and is known to associate with . some of the subjects of not only Operation Abelard but also several . other Directorate of Professional Standards investigations.’ Mr . Ellison’s report found evidence to suspect that Davidson had acted . corruptly in the Lawrence case, and that material had been withheld from . the subsequent 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into the police’s handling of . the black teenager’s murder. The . material that was shredded in 2003 was from a wider, top-secret . investigation into possible police corruption that began in 1993 and . came to be known as Operation Othona. The . Ellison report said it needed to see the Othona files to investigate . possible links with the Lawrence case, and to establish what was known . about police corruption at the time of the Macpherson Inquiry. The latest revelations deepened the Scotland Yard's ¿shredding scandal¿ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force . It . is alleged that when Stephen was murdered, Davidson was having a . corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, the gangster father of one of . his killers, David Norris. The ex-detective denies this. Some . computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard . drive in a cardboard box in the Met Police’s professional standards . department in November 2013. But . paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was . told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003. One source told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been a ‘lorry load’ of documents, photographs and videos. In . a message on Twitter yesterday, Alastair Morgan made clear he does not . accept an innocent explanation for the mass shredding. He . told senior officers: ‘Don’t take the public for fools gentlemen. The . shredding of the Othona files is an out and out disgrace.’ Yesterday . Davidson, 65, said: ‘I am not corrupt. I would like to speak but I . can’t basically. I am paying a lot of money to my solicitor and he’s . told me to talk to nobody. That includes the Press.’ Scotland . Yard said: ‘The Met was informed by a former employee on February 4, . 2014 that in 2003, two staff were tasked to shred a quantity of . documents that related to corruption inquiries. The information supplied by the witness was scant but the Met felt it necessary to pass it on to Mr Ellison’s review. ‘Met . officers now intend to meet the witness to clarify their account. At . this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the . shredding.’","Large quantities of evidence relating to possible corruption in the Met Police were destroyed over 48 hour period in 2003, it emerged today .

"By . Martin Robinson . The cost of transatlantic flights could be slashed after the Government announced it would allow more international airlines to use Gatwick, Stansted and Luton. A price war is being predicted that could break Heathrow's stranglehold on routes to America because rival airports will be able to reduce their landing fees. The proposals set out in the Government's draft aviation strategy come after ministers were put under intense pressure to enable UK airlines to cash in on growing markets across the world. Busy: Heathrow has the majority of flights to and from the US but these could be spread across other airports . Spreading the routes across other UK airports could make more routes . financially viable, experts claim, and it could also increase the number . of flights between the two countries. It would also benefit people who pick up flights from America stopping over in Britain on the way to Asian destinations like Japan and China. And the frustrating long immigration queues for those trying to enter America could also be cut for passengers. Talks between US and British officials have already started to allow the four million Britons who go there every year to be cleared for entry at the UK airport they leave from. American dream: Four million Britons go to the US every year but the plans could increase that number . Meanwhile the Government is still to set out its plans to solve the lack of runway space in south-east England - where the majority of people fly from. The controversial plans to add a third runway at Heathrow or Boris Johnson's idea of a huge new airport in the Thames Estuary remain the two main options. Critics say the lack of a decision will damage the British economy, and it is claimed the Coalition is split over the issue. But Transport Secretary Justine Greening says no decision can be made until to the options are sure to be economical and green, which has infuriated industry leaders. 'The Government cannot keep kicking this issue into the long grass while our competitors gain at our expense,' Simon Buck, chief exec of the British Air Transport Association told the Telegraph. Baroness Valentine, chief executive of business pressure group London First added: 'Difficult decisions on the location of additional  hub airport capacity cannot be avoided.' The aviation strategy also includes stricter fines for noisy aircraft  to protect people whose lives are blighted by it. Any breaches of noise limits would lead to a £1,000 fine, doubled from the current £500.","Rivals to Heathrow - Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton may be able to cut landing fees to attract airlines ."

"By . Mark Prigg . At 1,200 feet wide, it could have caused an explosion measured in megatons and would have wiped out a city if it were to hit Earth. Just days ago, a huge asteroid nicknamed 'the Beast' passed less than a million miles from us. Today, Nasa revealed it captured these stunning images as it passed by - thankfully at a safe distance. Scroll down for video . Behold the beast: Nasa scientists used Earth-based radar to produce these images of the asteroid designated '2014 HQ124' but known as the Beast as it passed by Earth on June 8, 2014. To obtain the new views, researchers paired the 230-foot (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, with two other radio telescopes, one at a time. Using this technique, the Goldstone antenna beams a radar signal at an asteroid and the other antenna receives the reflections. The technique dramatically improves the amount of detail that can be seen in radar images.To image 2014 HQ124, the researchers first paired the large Goldstone antenna with the 1,000-foot (305-meter) Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. They later paired the large Goldstone dish with a smaller companion, a 112-foot (34-meter) antenna, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. A recent equipment upgrade at Arecibo enabled the two facilities to work in tandem to obtain images with this fine level of detail for the first time. Captured on June 8, 2014, the new views of the object designated '2014 HQ124' are some of the most detailed radar images of a near-Earth asteroid ever obtained. The radar observations were led by scientists Marina Brozovic and Lance Benner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The JPL researchers worked closely with Michael Nolan, Patrick Taylor, Ellen Howell and Alessondra Springmann at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to plan and execute the observations. According to Benner, 2014 HQ124 appears to be an elongated, irregular object that is at least 1,200 feet (370 meters) wide on its long axis. 'This may be a double object, or 'contact binary,' consisting of two objects that form a single asteroid with a lobed shape,' he said. The images reveal a wealth of other features, including a puzzling pointy hill near the object's middle, on top as seen in the images. The 21 radar images were taken over a span of four-and-a-half hours. During that interval, the asteroid rotated a few degrees per frame, suggesting its rotation period is slightly less than 24 hours. At its closest approach to Earth on June 8, the asteroid came within 776,000 miles (1.25 million kilometers), or slightly more than three times the distance to the moon. Scientists began observations of 2014 HQ124 shortly after the closest approach, when the asteroid was between about 864,000 miles and 902,000 miles (1.39 million kilometers and 1.45 million kilometers) from Earth. Each image in the collage and movie represents 10 minutes of data. The new views show features as small as about 12 feet (3.75 meters) wide. This is the highest resolution currently possible using scientific radar antennas to produce images. Such sharp views for this asteroid were made possible by linking together two giant radio telescopes to enhance their capabilities. To obtain the new views, researchers paired the 230-foot (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, with two other radio telescopes, one at a time. 'By itself, the Goldstone antenna can obtain images that show features as small as the width of a traffic lane on the highway,"" said Benner. 'With Arecibo now able to receive our highest-resolution Goldstone signals, we can create a single system that improves the overall quality of the images.' The first five images in the new sequence -- the top row in the collage -- represent the data collected by Arecibo, and are 30 times brighter than what Goldstone can produce observing on its own. The newfound asteroid will safely pass Earth on June 8 from a distance of about 777,000 miles (1.25 million kilometers), more than three times farther away than our moon. Designated 2014 HQ124, the asteroid was discovered April 23, 2014, by NASA's NEOWISE mission, a space telescope adapted for scouting the skies for asteroids and comets. The telescope sees infrared light, which allows it to pick up the infrared glow of asteroids and obtain better estimates of their true sizes. 2014 HQ124 is designated a 'potentially hazardous asteroid,' or PHA. This refers to those asteroids 460 feet (140 meters) in size or larger that pass within 4.6 million miles (7.4 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit around the sun. There are currently 1,484 known PHAs, but none pose a significant near-term risk of impacting Earth. It is tearing through space at 31,000 miles per hour or 50,400 kilometers per hour. It will, however, pass within a million miles on Sunday - equivalent to 3.2 lunar distances or about 716,500 miles. 'There is zero chance of an impact,' said Don Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'In fact, it's fairly common for asteroids to pass near Earth. 'You'd expect an object about the size of 2014 HQ124 to pass this close every few years.' Astronomers say their main concern is that The Beast, or Asteroid 2014 HQ124 was only detected on April 23 before its nearest approach to the Earth despite space surveillance systems scanning outer space for asteroids and other threats. 'HQ124 is at least 10 times bigger, and possibly 20 times, than the asteroid that injured a thousand people last year in Chelyabinsk, Siberia,' Slooh space telescope astronomer Bob Berman said. 'If it were [to] impact us, the energy released would be measured not in kilotons like the atomic bombs that ended World War II, but in H-bomb type megatons.' Berman said that object was 'maybe the size of a movie theatre,' while NASA compared its size to a bus. 'It's not a super-large one. You call it The Beast, but there are much bigger ones,' American physicist Mark Boslough, an expert on planetary impacts, told Slooh.com during the webcast. 'We've discovered most of the ones greater than a kilometre.' Experts say the asteroid would wipe out an entire city and be similar to a nuclear warhead detonating if Earth were to be hit . Boslough said that a planetary strike with an object the size of HQ124 would have a catastrophic effect. 'It's moving at a relative speed of 14 kilometres per second. 'But if it were headed toward us, gravity would speed it up and it would hit the Earth with a speed of 18 kilometres a second,' he said. Based on its size, and assuming it would still be a solid rock at the time of impact, it would lead to an explosion of about 2,000 megatonnes, enough to wipe out an entire metropolitan area,' Boslough said. The Beast was discovered by the NASA Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer. It is tearing through space at 31,000 miles per hour or 50,400 kilometers per hour. The Beast has been classified as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid.","Impact would have been similar to a nuclear warhead detonating .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida woman whose life was turned upside down when her ex-boyfriend posted naked pictures of her to a revenge porn website is picking up the pieces after the embarrassing ordeal. Holly Jacobs, who has changed her named from Holli Thometz, says her former boyfriend Ryan Seay distributed private intimate photos she had shared with him on the internet in 2009 after they broke up. Now she is on a crusade to help other women who have been victimized in cyber stalking schemes and trying to move forward with her life. Hopeful future: Holly Jacobs is putting on a brave face and trying to move forward after her ex allegedly distributed naked pictures of her in 2009 after they broke up . The horrifying ordeal began in January . 2009, when a friend called Jacobs told her that naked pictures of her . had surfaced on the web. The woman spent months in a state of constant fear, Googling herself constantly to try and get the photos taken down. After two years, she became fed up and is speaking out in hope that it can help other women. 'I'm coming out because I'm tired of hiding,' Ms. Jacobs told the New York Observer's BetaBeat blog. 'I hope that I'll set an example and show this is how you overcome this: by coming forward,' she said. 'You're not exposing yourself–you’re already exposed on the internet. Instead, you’re exposing what is happening to you. 'Everybody’s going to see me naked, and everybody’s going to see me do things I never wanted anybody to see except the person I was with. But if it’s in the name of the cause and to change the laws about this, then I’m happy to do it. We’re all naked underneath our clothes.' Activist: Now Holly is offering comfort to women who have similarly been the victims of cyberstalking . She has accused Mr Seay with distributing the pictures without her permission, saying he was the only person who had access to the photographs, but he has denied the claim. For several months she Googled her name on a constant basis, fervently trying to get website to take down the pictures. But the person behind the cruel joke actively tried to keep the pictures alive on the web. Then the mastermind behind the sex pictures emailed copies of the photographs to her boss and coworker at the Florida International University, where she was working as a Teaching Assistant. Though she called the police, authorities told her that they couldn't intervene because she wasn't a minor. New phase: Holly says she spent two years trying to scrub her embarrassing internet footprint until she decided to put the ordeal behind her and move on . She also sought help from the state's attorney's office but they initially failed to pick up her case. After months and months trying to fight to erase the embarrassing experience in 2012 she decided that she was fed up with the entire episode. 'He wants me to spend all of my time taking down my Google results instead of moving on with my life and being free and being in a good relationship and getting my Ph.D.,' she told the BetaBeat blog. 'I felt like the only thing I could do was part from that identity that had been completely defamed and I wanted to just get on with my life,' she added. She has created an online effort, End Revenge Porn, to lobby for state measures to punish those who post images to revenge porn websites. She also formed a support group for women similarly victimized. The Florida State's Attorneys office has now decided to take on her case and she is optimistic about her future. Mr Seay faces numerous charges including one count stalking, two counts harassment by use of personal identification info and one count unlawful publication. His attorney claims that he is also a victim and he has denied the allegations.","'Revenge porn' is the practice of posting intimate photos of a former lover online to humiliate them .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Confession: Ukip councillor Malcolm Small, pictured arriving at court, admitted one count of arson after burning his wife's clothes . A Ukip councillor is expected to resign after being handed a 12-week suspended prison sentence for burning his wife's clothes during a petty row. Malcolm Small, 48, grabbed a handful of 'treasured items' belonging to Kim Van Opdorp and set them alight in the back garden of their marital home. The couple - who had been in a relationship for ten years - had argued about who they wanted to join them as guests at a Mayor's Ball that coming weekend. The gown and tuxedo they were due to wear at the event were among the £2,000 worth of clothing burned, Basingstoke Magistrates' Court heard. Miss Van Opdorp moved out of the home to stay with friends following the row and found her clothing had been destroyed when she returned to collect it. Prosecutor Kate Prince said there had been a history of domestic violence between the couple, who are now divorcing. She said: 'On this occasion, while Mr Small was out of the property, she returned to the home address to collect some of her items. 'When she checked in the wardrobe, she found all her items had been removed, apart from her wedding dress and her winter coat. 'Treasured items, including a nightie belonging to her grandmother and a ball dress she was due to wear that Friday night, had been burned in the garden at the back of the property. 'Mr Small admitted he had done it because he was angry and he did not look to see what it was he was taking. 'Ms Van Opdorp is not able to say exactly how much the items are worth but it is thought to be thousands, probably £2,000.' Ruth Cassidy, defending, said Small is suffering from depression and has struggled to cope with the fact their relationship has come to an end. She said: 'Mr Small does not agree with the value. Miss Van Opdorp had packed her bag and taken her main clothes to her friend's. 'He says it was only a few odds and ends left and she bought relatively cheap clothes.' She added: 'He says he did it in a complete moment of rage. He just saw red. 'Immediately on seeing the flames he felt remorseful. It was irrational. 'He was careful to burn the items on a palette outside, and tidied up after.' Resignation: Small, 48, is expected to resign from Rushmoor Borough Council after being sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 24 months . Small, from Farnborough in Hampshire, was elected to Rushmoor Borough Council as a member of the West Heath ward in 2012 for a three-year term. But the court heard the council's chief executive had warned him he would have to quit if he was given a custodial sentence. Small admitted one charge of arson at his home on February 4 this year. He sat grim-faced in the dock as magistrates jailed him for 12 weeks, suspended for 24 months, and gave him a 24 month supervision order. The politician, who also runs a hot dog business, must attend 32 sessions of a building better relationships programme. He was given a 24-month restraining order, banning him from contacting Ms Van Opdorp, other than through a solicitor. And he was ordered to pay £85 costs and £80 into a fund for victims of crime.

"By . Harriet Arkell . The daughter of Ground Force star Tommy Walsh had her throat slit during a brawl at an upmarket London nightclub, a court heard today. Leanne Bloomfield, 28, used a shard of glass to slash Natalie Walsh, 22, upwards from her neck to her chin at Café De Paris near Leicester Square in central London, jurors heard. Bloomfield allegedly pulled Miss Walsh's hair back before attacking her at the cabaret club, favoured by stars from Made In Chelsea and TOWIE, Southwark Crown Court heard. Cut: Tommy Walsh's daughter Natalie, 19, left, is said to have been attacked by Leanne Bloomfield, 28, right . She also kicked the 22-year-old, as she lay on the ground, and later texted a friend to say she'd had a 'massive punch up with some girl', adding: 'ha ha, b****, she got me good in the nose through', jurors were told. Bloomfield allegedly went on to say: 'Me and my sister did a number on her, she was in a heap. They didn't catch me, ha ha.' But she was caught because her Santander bank card had fallen into Ms Walsh's bag after their belongings spilled onto the floor during the row, the jury heard. Ms Walsh also suffered a 'nasty cut' to her thumb, and needed an operation for a severed tendon, as well as treatment for the cut to her throat. Bloomfield appeared in court wearing a white blouse and black, high-waisted, pencil skirt today. Describing the incident, prosecutor Simon Ward said: 'Ms Walsh walked towards the dance floor and got into an altercation with the defendant. 'What she remembers is being grabbed by the hair by a girl with long brown hair. Her hair was pulled upwards stretching her neck. The alleged brawl happened at London's Café de Paris, a nightclub and cabaret favoured by celebrities . 'She tried to fight her assailant off and tried to elbow her away. All the while this was going on, she got the feeling someone else was attacking her from behind. 'She was cut with a piece of glass from the neck to the chin in an upward movement.' He went on: 'She found herself on the floor.  Her bag had opened and all of her stuff was strewn all over the floor.' Bloomfield was arrested on 4 February, the day after the incident, at her home in Colchester, Essex, when she is said to have told police: 'Yeah, I was there, I had a fight, she punched me.  It's not serious is it, she's OK?' 'She was cut with a piece of glass from the neck to the chin in an upward movement.' - Simon Ward, prosecutor . The text messages were discovered after officers analysed her mobile phone, the court heard. 'What she seems to be doing is boasting about what happened,' Mr Ward added. Bloomfield attended the nightclub, where a birthday party for a Big Brother star was being held, with a group including her sister, Vicky, and friend, Katie Cooper. Both Bloomfield and Cooper are seen to kick Miss Walsh on CCTV footage, the court heard, but Bloomfield has been the only person to face court action as a result of the alleged attack. Miss Walsh, 22, who is 6ft tall, said she couldn't move her thumb at all after the attack because the tendon had been severed. The court heard how she had been out for dinner and drinks at the Beach Blanket Babylon restaurant in Shoreditch, east London, before heading to the club with two friends. She drank three Jack Daniels and Diet Cokes while she was at the venue, but was not out of control and 'could handle it', jurors were told. Miss Walsh, who said she was wearing waist-length hair extensions that night, said she could not remember actually being glassed because the 'episode was so sketchy'. The celebrity builder, who became famous in the BBC's gardening show . Ground Force with Charlie Dimmock, attended Southwark Crown Court today . to hear the case against his daughter's alleged attacker . She said: 'I remember someone being behind me I was trying to get off, I felt someone on my right shoulder, then I just tried to get them off me, I tried to push them away. 'That's all I really remember. I remember my hair being pulled up by the root [and] I was on my knees at the end of it. It was just so quick.' She said she had done nothing intentionally to provoke her attacker and denied pushing her in the face. 'I might have thrown a punch but I didn't push her in the face,' she said.  'What can you do when someone is attacking you but defend yourself?' Miss Walsh's father, celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who became a household name appearing with Charlie Dimmock in BBC gardening programme Ground Force, joined other relatives to watch the trial from the public gallery. He has also featured in television shows including Tommy's DIY Survival, Our House and Celebrity Fit Club. Bloomfield, of Highwoods, Colchester, Essex, denies a single count of wounding with intent. The trial, which is expected to last up to three days, continues.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . With its tranquil blue waters, palm trees and rock pools, this idyllic river in the Philippines is nothing short of paradise. But the Hinatuan River, which runs on the island of Mindanao - the second largest and southernmost in the region - is no ordinary hideaway. Because the salt water river seems to have no source. Scroll down for video... Peaceful: The Hinatuan River in the Philippines is one of a kind - because it appears to have no source . Idyll: The 50ft deep waters are popular with sunbathers, swimmers and those who wish to practice their diving skills . The exact source of the beautiful paradise - nicknamed the Enchanted River because of its unknown beginnings - is surrounded in mystery and has never been determined. Due to its close proximity to the sea, some believe the idyll was created when seawater flowed through long tunnels and caverns deep below the ground, finally resurfacing at the spring - which is 50ft deep in areas. But others offer slightly different solutions - including one urban legend that suggests the river was created by fairies and pixies. The river, considered one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in the Philippines flows straight into the Pacific Ocean at Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur. The area's deep waters and boulders to dive from see tourists travel from miles around to bathe in its virtually clear waters. With numerous fishes and other creatures living in its deep waters, the area is popular with snorkelers as well as divers and explorers. And if swimming is not your thing, the area can be viewed from dry land on the metres of ricekerty woodern viewing bridges that surround the water's edge. Popular: Regarded as one of the most beautiful spots in the Philippines, the area attracts tourists from around the world .","Hinatuan River, which runs on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, appears to have no source .

"By . Associated Press . Miss Venezuela came in third in the Miss Universe contest, a disappointment for the South American nation that has won more crowns in the pageant than any other country besides the U.S. But Irene Sofia Esser Quintero was the talk of the Internet on Thursday after she attempted to answer a question in English during the pageant's finals. Her answer was unintelligible at times - one of several examples where the language barrier came to the forefront during the pageant. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Positive outlook: Miss Venezuela Irene Sofia Esser Quintero looked upbeat before the question was read . Fatal choice: She opted against using a translator, but that proved to be a poor decision . Pageant officials provided a professional translator so top-five Miss Venezuela could understand her on-stage interview question: 'If you could change one law, what would it be and why?' Esser was allowed to answer in her native Spanish, but stepped out of her comfort zone and tried her English with this response. 'I think that any leys (laws) there are . in Constitution or in life, are already made. I think that we should . have, uh, a straight way to go in our similar, or, eh, in our lives as . is this. For example, I'm a surfer, and I think that the best wave that I . can take is the wave that I wait for it. So please do our only, eh, law . that we can do. Thank you, Vegas!' Better in a bikini? Bloggers and observers on Twitter seized on the brunette beauty's comment, with some lampooning her English and calling the answer nonsensical . Bloggers and observers on Twitter seized on the brunette beauty's comment, with some lampooning her English and calling the answer nonsensical. Others defended her as brave for trying a second language under the glare of the spotlight. Back home in pageant-crazy Venezuela, which has produced six past titleholders and numerous finalists, her loss was front-page news. An article in the newspaper El Nacional, noted Esser looked quite good, 'but an unintelligible answer in the round of questions lost her the crown.' Because the pageant doesn't release scores publicly, there's no way to determine how the answer affected the outcome. The newspaper also referred readers to an online poll asking whether they liked Esser's response. About 90 per cent of those who answered, many of them in Venezuela, said 'no.' While Esser stepped out with English, other finalists shied away from the pageant's lingua franca. In videotaped interviews aired during the telecast, top 10 candidates Miss Mexico and Miss France opted to talk about themselves in Spanish and French, respectively. In the live interview, top-five contestant Miss Brazil took her question - about whether bikinis turn women into sex symbols - in Portuguese, and gave her answer in Portuguese. She finished fifth. The pageant has no language requirement and pageant spokeswoman Brenda Mendoza said organizers are proud their contestants come from around the globe. They have translators on hand to facilitate interviews for non-English speakers. Accepting everyone: The pageant has no language requirement and pageant spokeswoman Brenda Mendoza said organizers are proud their contestants come from around the globe . Miss Philippines Janine Tugonon addressed the topic directly in the on-stage interview. When asked whether English should be a prerequisite for Miss Universe because she's an international ambassador, Tugonon gave this reply in her own, slightly accented English. 'I think that any leys (laws) there are . in Constitution or in life, are already made. 'I think that we should . have, uh, a straight way to go in our similar, or, eh, in our lives as . is this. 'For example, I'm a surfer, and I think that the best wave that I . can take is the wave that I wait for it. 'So please do our only, eh, law . that we can do. Thank you, Vegas!' 'For me, being Miss Universe is not just about knowing how to speak a specific language. It's being able to influence and inspire other people. So whatever language you have, as long as your heart is to serve and you have a strong mind to - to show to people, then you can be Miss Universe.' She got loud applause and cheers in reply. Newly crowned Miss Universe Olivia Culpo may have a little trouble of her own with the language barrier. She either didn't hear or declined to answer when a reporter at a post-pageant press conference asked her in Spanish whether she spoke Spanish. (Culpo speaks some Italian, but not Spanish). Knowing the language could be a big interviewing asset for a Miss Universe winner - the pageant is a big enough hit among non-English speakers that it was simulcast in Spanish on Telemundo. Culpo said she enjoyed the diversity of the contestants and did her best to help the non-English speakers navigate the U.S. in the weeks before the competition. Disappointment: Venezuela has won more titles than any other country so the loss came as a blow . 'They looked at me for advice, for translation, for “what does this button do,” “how do you get the paper out of the dispenser,”' she said on Thursday. But she acknowledged that contestants from non-English-speaking countries are at a disadvantage. 'It definitely makes it harder. But if you're going into this job, I think you need to be prepared to speak English because you live in New York City and a lot of your events are in New York City. And we speak English,' she answered. Last year's winner, Angolan beauty queen Leila Lopes, spoke in deliberate English, perhaps refined by Miss Universe appearances and business management studies in England. Her road to the Miss Universe crown last year in Sao Paulo involved winning over the crowd by speaking in Portuguese, their shared language. Angola, like Brazil, is a former Portuguese colony.","Irene Sogia Esser Quintero was asked what law she would change .

"By . Maggie Harbour . Days of our Lives star Bryan Dattilo, who plays Lucas Horton, is a dad again! Dattilo and his wife of three years, Liz Cameron, welcomed their first child together on June 11. Little Delila Cameron Dattilo arrived just before 3 am., with Bryan having to report to work on the set of Days just 4 hours later! 'Luckily my baby daughter was born at a hospital very close to work so all I had to do was show up with a smile on my face, and the make - up people took care of the circles under my eyes,' he tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview. Oh baby! DOOL star Bryan Dattilo and his wife Liz Cameron are the proud parents of Delila, who weighed in at 6lbs 13oz . Heartthrob: Bryan has been playing character Lucas Horton for 20 years on TV's longest running soap . Dattilo, 42, says it’s been an adjustment being a dad again 14 years after his son Gabriel was born. 'First I think it’s going to be different parenting a little girl compared to being the father of a boy,' Dattilo tells MailOnline. 'I want Gabe to grow up to be a strong man, so sometimes I think I am a bit hard on him.  But I’m afraid I’m going to be putty in the hands of a little girl. 'When I first looked into Delila’s little face, I saw a lot of myself. She has my mouth and eyes, and there is something very familiar about her.' Dattilo, whose son from his first marriage lives with him and his wife, says some of the best times he shares with Gabe are watching and participating in sports, and he can’t help but wonder if Delila will chose shopping trips with mom or curling up on the couch with the boys to watch. 'I coach Gabe’s basketball, football and baseball teams,' says Bryan.'And it’s been a great bonding time for us. I’d love to coach Delila too, and am hoping she will be interested in tennis, soccer or softball. But I will be just as happy sitting in the front row watching her first dance recital. Whatever makes her happy will make me happy too!' Big brother: Bryan's son Gabriel, 14, is beaming with pride over the new addition to the family . Bryan and Liz also chose to bank the baby’s cord blood with a company called Cryo-cell. 'We did a lot of research into banking cord blood,' says Dattilo. 'And one of the prime uses for stem cells is to help treat Lymphoma or Leukemia. And Delila has grandfathers on both sides who have those illnesses. 'So who knows, maybe someday the blood we banked will benefit one of them.' Banking cord blood taken from a newborn’s umbilical cord is becoming very popular practice because the stem cells found in the cord are younger and more flexible than those found in adults. The stem cells also know how to ‘find,’ injured cells and repair them. Currently the stem cells are being used in transplants and for the treatment of more than 80 diseases including certain cancers, anemia, and Leukemia. The cells are also a perfect match for baby should she need it sometime in the future. An affair to remember: What DOOL fan can forget Sami Brady, played by Alison Sweeney, and Lucas Roberts' wedding in 2007 . And when it comes to the kids wanting to follow in their famous father’s footsteps Dattilo admits he’s not sure. 'Of course I want both of them to do whatever makes them happy,' he says. 'But I will explain that being an actor isn’t as easy as it looks. There are a nights where I have to memorize 20 pages of dialogue only to turn around and do the same thing the following day. 'And the audition process, with its high rate of rejection, is really hard on a person. It’s one of the only careers where you can work hard and do your very best and still not book the job.' Bryan has been starring in DOOL for 20 years.","Hunky soap star Bryan Dattilo and his wife Liz Cameron have welcomed  baby girl Delila, who weighed in at 6lbs 13oz, to their family .

"By . John Mcgarry . At the age of 28, with a wealth of Champions League and international experience under his belt, Charlie Mulgrew has long since moved beyond the point in his life where he might become star struck at anyone walking through the doors at Lennoxtown. Nonetheless, Celtic’s Mr Versatile admits the appointment of John Collins as Ronny Deila’s No 2 last week momentarily transported him back to a time he was just another kid with a ball at his feet and a head full of dreams. For any Celtic fan of Mulgrew’s age, those formative years following the club were testing times. The early to mid-1990s were a barren period in the club’s history. VIDEO Scroll down for Charlie Mulgrew: Pre-season training and Neil Lennnon . Ready: Mulgrew helps unveil Celtic's new away kit for the forthcoming season in the SPL . Collins and his midfield colleague Paul McStay did not so much carry the team as prevent it falling off a cliff. Despite — to put it kindly — the mediocrity that surrounded the pair in that era, their talents still shone like beacons in the dark. Some 18 years may have elapsed between Collins’ departure as a player and his return as assistant manager but, to those old enough to remember, those flashes of brilliance are still inspirational. ‘When I was growing up, John was the player I looked up to,’ Mulgrew recalled. ‘He wore No 11 for Celtic and he was one of my heroes. I remember him scoring a free-kick at Ibrox. He was a great player and servant for Celtic. I’m sure everyone is delighted to have him back.’ New challenge: Mulgrew admits he knew little about new manager Delia before his arrival in Glasgow . Collins, who plied his trade at Monaco, Everton and Fulham after leaving Celtic in 1996, would have required no introductions to the vast majority of the players who gathered for pre-season training on Tuesday. Deila, by contrast, was a low-profile choice. But if the name of the man who took unfashionable Stromsgodset to the Norwegian title prompted some frenzied internet research when he was first linked with Celtic, the impression he has made with the squad since they  reconvened has been overwhelmingly positive. ‘I didn’t know much about Ronny before he got the job,’ added Mulgrew. ‘I thought he came across really well and it has been the same meeting him. ‘We had a couple of meetings to get to know him and to get an idea of the way he wants to play. They were positive and everyone responded well. There are differences (from the last regime) but he is trying to get his ideas across. Prepared: Mulgrew, Adam Matthews, Scott Brown, Stefan Johansen and Liam Henderson pose together . ‘I’m sure he has looked at some games and seen things we did well, but there will be things he will think we can improve upon. Hopefully, we can do well for him.’ It would be foolish to rush to judgment on the new regime. But there is no escaping how defining the forthcoming three Champions League qualifiers are. Hurdle the three trip wires and the wind is in Deila’s sails. Come a cropper and there is no disguising the deflation. KR Reykjavik present a testing but hardly ominous opening assignment in Iceland on July 15. Yet these are not unfamiliar tests for this crop of Celtic players. Twice in succession now they have faced up to potentially treacherous ties in the middle of summer and have lived to tell the tale. Familiarity, Mulgrew hopes, will breed contentment. ‘It gives you experience and you know what you’re up against,’ he explained. ‘Last year, against Elfsborg, they were into their  season and you could see playing the game how much they wanted to be in the Champions League. ‘Karagandy away was difficult, a hostile atmosphere. Every team is scrapping to get there. It doesn’t matter about ability when a club wants it and the prize at the end is so big.’ New man: Collins has put any old disagreements behind him as he prepares to get started at Celtic .","Celtic's Mr Versatile looked up to Collins as a kid .

A report by broadcaster CCTV criticized the iPhone's 'Frequent Locations' function for allowing users to be tracked and information about them revealed. Chinese state media has branded the iPhone a threat to national security because of the smartphone's ability to track and time-stamp user locations . Apple is estimated to have sold more than 150 million iPhones in China. In the most recent quarter, 25% of Apple's global revenue came from greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Sales have grown 13% in the region during the past year. 'This is extremely sensitive data,' said a researcher interviewed by the broadcaster. If the data were accessed, it could reveal an entire country's economic situation and 'even state secrets,' the researcher said. Apple was not available for immediate comment. Apple has frequently come under fire from Chinese state media, which accused the company of providing user data to U.S. intelligence agencies and have called for 'severe punishment'. It has also been criticized for poor customer service. The California-based company is not the only U.S. firm to suffer from Chinese media ire. Google services have been disrupted in China for over a month, while the central government procurement office has banned new government computers from using Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system. Apple has frequently come under fire from Chinese state media, which accused the company of providing user data to U.S. intelligence agencies and have called for 'severe punishment'.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . CCTV cameras that automatically issue parking fines are to be made illegal in a victory for motorists and privacy campaigners, ministers will announce today. Static and car-mounted cameras have been used to issue at least ten million fines, totalling more than £300 million, in the past five years. Some 75 councils currently have permission to use ‘approved devices’ rather than traffic wardens to enforce parking restrictions, under Labour’s 2004 Traffic Management Act. In these areas, a third of all parking fines are now thought to be issued via CCTV rather than parking wardens. CCTV spy cars are set to be made illegal after issuing automatic fines totalling over £300million . Councils insist the cameras help to keep roads safe, especially near schools, but the first the motorists know they have been given a fine is when it appears in the post. Ministers have now concluded they are being used in an ‘overzealous’ way by greedy local authorities and should be outlawed altogether in a new Deregulation Bill. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will today announce further pro-motorist measures, including a new right to allow local residents and firms to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines, and lowering penalties that deter many motorists from appealing unfair tickets. Mr Pickles said: ‘CCTV spy cars can be seen lurking on every street raking in cash for greedy councils and breaking the rules that clearly state that fines should not be used to generate profit for town halls. 'Over-zealous parking enforcement and unreasonable stealth fines undermine the high street, push up the cost of living and cost local authorities more in the long term. ‘Today the Government is taking urgently needed action to ban this clear abuse of CCTV, which should be used to catch criminals and not as a cash cow.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles  said: 'CCTV spy cars can be seen lurking on every street raking in cash for greedy councils' Parking guidance to councils will also change to prevent aggressive action by bailiffs over unpaid fines, support local shops and reinforce the prohibition against parking being used to generate profit. However, Dr Kevin Golding-Williams of charity Living Streets, which campaigns for the rights of pedestrians, said: ‘Inconsiderate parking can be hazardous. CCTV devices can be useful tools for both monitoring and enforcement. ‘This hasty proposal is contrary to any strategy to encourage families to walk or cycle and once again places priority on motor traffic above the safety and ease of pedestrians.’ But Emma Carr, acting director of the anti-surveillance campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Making the use of CCTV cars illegal is a clear step towards bringing proportionality and rational decision making back to the traffic enforcement process. ‘Too many councils’ CCTV cars have become a means of boosting their revenue, with millions of pounds in fines being handed to drivers across the country.’","Ministers will announce CCTV cameras issuing parking fines will be illegal .

"By . Chris Pleasance . It may look odd to us, but in the Ethiopian Suri tribe, this enormous lip plate is actually a sign of beauty. When girls hit puberty they have their bottom two teeth removed in a bizarre ritual before a small hole is cut into their bottom lip. A clay disc is then inserted into the hole, which is steadily increased, stretching the lip, much like flesh-tunnel piercings which have become popular with teenagers in the UK. The larger the lip plate the more cows the girl's father can demand in dowry when his daughter is married - usually 40 for a small plate and 60 for a larger one. Men on the other hand take part in the considerably less-painful ritual of body painting. A basic paint is made from herbs and plants mixed with soil, before the tribesmen cover themselves with it, sculpting it into patterns. In recent years, some young women from the tribes are refusing to have their lips pierced, and removing their teeth can be a violent and sometimes traumatising task. A Suri tribeswoman from Ethiopia is pictured wearing a large lip plug which is a traditional sign of beauty .

But it will not have escaped keen-eyed fashion observers that we have seen the dress before, on the back of Angelina Jolie at the Oscars in March.

The only difference between the two . gowns (aside from color) is how Ms Fonda’s gown is heavily beaded in a . trumpet shape towards the bottom, and Ms Jolie’s has a softer hemline . that somewhat resembles a tutu.

"By . James Chapman . The scale of the leadership crisis engulfing Ed Miliband was revealed yesterday when Labour was forced to wheel out Neil Kinnock to defend him. Lord Kinnock, who led the party to two crushing general election defeats in 1987 and 1992, sought to blame the media for the leader’s woes. His desperate defence came as allies claimed Mr Miliband’s leadership is only being criticised because he is  on course to become Prime Minister next year with a Commons majority of at  least 40 seats. Mockery: Ed Miliband's similarities to Lord Kinnock led the Guardian to publish this photomontage of him morphing into his predecessor . Loyal Shadow Cabinet members took to the airwaves to allege that a mysterious nexus of ‘vested interests’ involving banks, energy firms and the media were seeking to undermine Mr Miliband because they felt threatened by him. But Mr Miliband was rocked by more disastrous poll results. A YouGov poll found that 51  per cent think he is a weak leader, 56 per cent think he is out of touch with ordinary people, and 60 per cent think he would not  be up to the job of leading the country. Lord Kinnock condemned the ‘vindictiveness’ of the media attacks on Mr Miliband. But he added: ‘It won’t stop him; his genuine strengths of thought, action and toughness will get through and help to win victory. ‘Ed has great personal and political courage. The way in which he’s taken on [Rupert] Murdoch, big energy, banks,  and effectively prevented  our military engagement in  Syria – just some examples – shows that. He’s got high  intelligence and articulates  deep concerns.’ When Mr Miliband defeated his brother David to become leader in 2010, Lord Kinnock was said to have exclaimed, ‘We’ve got our party back.’ Lord Kinnock, who led the party to two crushing general election defeats in 1987 and 1992, sought to blame the media for the leader's woes . Lord Kinnock and Miliband at the Labour Party Autumn Conference at the Manchester Conference Centre.Lord Kinnock condemned the 'vindictiveness' of the media attacks on Mr Miliband . On Saturday the Left-leaning Guardian newspaper highlighted the similarities between them  by publishing a photomontage  of Mr Miliband morphing into Lord Kinnock. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘You know things are getting desperate when Labour resorts to rolling out Neil Kinnock to shore up Ed Miliband. ‘Ed Miliband’s supporters  can blame the media all they like, but people in the Labour Party are realising he is a weak leader who just isn’t up to the job.  Miliband has no plan for  the country. He is a shameless opportunist. The only thing he stands for is more borrowing and higher taxes.’ Yesterday there were damaging claims of fresh tensions between Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is said to want to install his wife Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, as party leader. And John Denham, a former Labour frontbencher who  has long argued Labour needs  to try to rebuild support in  the south of England, warned that the party is losing working-class voters. It emerged that he told a conference earlier this month that working-class voters ‘don’t believe they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country’. Senior figures inside the party have been voicing doubts about Mr Miliband’s ability to connect with the electorate  for months, following poor  local and European election results and a series of gaffes, including a photocall in which  he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich. Lord Kinnock led the party to two crushing general election defeats in 1987 and 1992 - when he delivered his now infamous 'We're Alright' speech . Yesterday, Phil Taylor,  a former speech writer for Mr Miliband, said his relationship with Mr Balls was ‘just as bad as the Blair-Brown era’ and Labour’s economic policy was ‘nonsense’. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told BBC Radio 4 that pressure was only increasing on Mr Miliband ‘because he has put us in a position where we can win in ten months’ time’. He said ‘vested interests’ in the media, big business and the financial sector were using their ‘powerful influences’ to ‘destabilise’ the Labour leader, who they felt threatened by. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, Rachel Reeves,  told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme: ‘Opinion polls  today show that if there was a general election today we’d  have a majority of more than  40. Ed’s going to win next year and he’s going to make a great prime minister.’ Labour will ‘pause’ the Government’s flagship welfare reform if it wins power, pending a review by spending watchdogs, Miss Reeves said. She said her party supported the principle of universal  credit, which is gradually  replacing six out of work benefits and tax credits, and hoped to ‘rescue’ it. Miss Reeves claimed the programmes had been in ‘chaos’ under Iain Duncan Smith. But the Work and Pensions Secretary said implementation of universal credit, which is designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or more hours while on benefits or tax credits, was now ‘working well’.","Lord Kinnock led party to two crushing election defeats in 1987 and 1992 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . An 18-year-old man was convicted of murder in the shooting of a baby who was riding in a stroller alongside his mom in a town in coastal Georgia. Jurors deliberated about two hours before finding De'Marquise Elkins guilty of 11 counts, including two counts of felony murder and one count of malice murder in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago in Brunswick. The man's mother, Karimah Elkins, was on trial alongside him and was found guilty of tampering with evidence but acquitted of lying to police. De'Marquise Elkins faces life in prison. At the time of the shooting he was 17, too young to face the death penalty under Georgia law. Guilty!: De'Marquise Elkins faces life in prison after being convicted in th shooting death of a 13-month-old toddler . Sherry West testified that she was walking home from the post office with her son the morning of the killing. A gunman demanding her purse, shot her in the leg and shot her baby in the face after she told him she had no money, she said. Prosecutors said De'Marquise Elkins and an accomplice, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, are the ones who stopped West. Prosecutors say the older teen pointed a small .22-caliber revolver at West and demanded money. When West refused several times to turn over the money, Elkins fired a warning shot, shot the woman in the leg and the baby between the eyes, prosecutors said. The killing in the port city of Brunswick drew national attention, and the trial was moved to the Atlanta suburb of Marietta owing to extensive publicity locally. Prosecutors have said information from . Elkins' mother and sister led investigators to a pond where they found . the revolver. Elkins' sister also was charged with evidence tampering. A tragedy: Toddler Antonio Santiago was shot dead while lying in his stroller . Lang, who was a key prosecution witness in Elkins' trial, is set to go to trial at a later date. De'Marquise Elkins' attorney asked for bond for his client while they appealed, which the judge denied. The defense tried throughout the trial to prove that the investigation was flawed and that police refused to consider other leads or investigate further once they had Elkins in custody the day after the killing. 'They finished their case in 25 hours. Everything else they did after that they just sugarcoated,' Lockwood said. The prosecution's witnesses - many . with a criminal history and some drug users - lied repeatedly and . changed their stories throughout the investigation, Lockwood said. The . defense also said several law enforcement agents backtracked in their . testimony to make sure what they were saying fit the state's version of . the story. The baby's . mother, Sherry West, made different identifications of the suspect and . behaved strangely after the shooting, occasionally joking and laughing . while being questioned by police and making other bizarre statements, . Lockwood said. The baby's father, Louis Santiago, was in the vicinity . when the shooting happened and showed no warmth toward the child's . mother afterward, Lockwood said. Lang testified that Elkins is the one who . asked West for money and fired the shots, but admitted lying . repeatedly, Lockwood said. And Lang's cousin, Joe Lang, was in the area . on the day of the shooting and fits the description of the shooter. Suspicious behavior: Sherry West, mother of slain toddler Antonio Santiago, changed her story about the shooting and even joked with police shortly after the baby's death . But police never really investigated the baby's parents or the Lang cousins, Lockwood said. The defense had strongly suggested in pretrial motions that the baby's parents were the killers. Lead defense attorney Kevin Gough, a public defender, made several suggestions to the same effect during the trial. But much of his questioning that seemed to be heading in that direction - including attempts to bring up details about the backgrounds of both of the baby's parents - was blocked by the judge after the prosecution objected. Prosecutors said the defense presented a lot of theories and speculation but that the evidence and facts in the case proved Elkins' guilt. Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson showed jurors a string of still images pulled from video cameras around Brunswick during her closing argument. They all showed Elkins in specific locations at specific times the day of the shooting. Johnson also reminded jurors of the testimony of two young women - one who said Elkins walked her to school at 8:45 the day of the shooting and another who said she spent the night before with Elkins and ate with him later that morning, which was backed up by video stills of them at a convenience store. Then Johnson reminded jurors of what . Elkins told police, that he woke up around 10:30 that morning, that no . one else was home and that he left for school around 11:30 a.m. Heartbroken: Ashley Glassey, estranged daughter of Ms West, testified that she believes her mother was involved in the baby's death . The only person whose story didn't match the evidence in the case was Elkins, Johnson said. The story Dominique Lang told police was very similar to the one West told, Johnson said. While there was no video of the shooting itself, video evidence in the case supports other parts of Lang and West's stories, Johnson said. Johnson also took exception to the accusation that police stopped investigating once they arrested Elkins, noting that they pulled video from various cameras around town and went diving in a pond to recover the gun the following week. Johnson also slammed the defense for picking on West and her behavior following the shooting: 'Does anyone know what the protocol is for how you're supposed to act when you've just watched your child get shot in the face?'","De'Marquise Elkins was found guilty of 11 criminal counts and faces life in prison .

"By . Mario Ledwith . The publishers of the Daily Mirror have become embroiled in the phone hacking scandal after it was revealed that four individuals have launched legal action against the company’s titles. One of the claims, launched at the High Court by ex-England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, alleges phone hacking at the Daily Mirror while Piers Morgan was editor. Three other claimants, including David and Victoria Beckham’s former nanny Abbie Gibson, have alleged phone hacking at the Sunday Mirror and the People newspapers, also published by Mirror Group Newspapers. Legal action: Two claimants are ex-England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson (left) and actress Shobna Gulati (right) The legal action is thought to signify the first time that a claim has been made for hacking against a publication in the UK other than one belonging to Rupert Murdoch’s News International, publishers of the Sun and the News of the World. Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati and former Blackburn Rovers captain Garry Flitcroft are the other claimants. Piers Morgan, who is now a New York based television presenter, denied phone hacking took place at the Daily Mirror when he appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards last year. He said: ‘Not a single person has made any formal or legal complaint against the Daily Mirror for phone hacking.’ 'No legal complaints': Piers Morgan, who is now a New York based television presenter, denied phone hacking took place at the Daily Mirror when he appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards last year . Mr Morgan was asked if he had listened to Ulrika Jonsson’s voicemail messages to uncover her affair with Mr Eriksson. He denied the claim. No further details have been included in the claims against the Mirror Group titles but they allege ‘breach of confidence and misuse of information’ in relation to telecommunications. The claimants, who are being represented by media lawyer Mark Lewis, have four months to file the particulars of the claims. A spokesman for Trinity Mirror, parent company of Mirror Group Newspapers, said the company was unaware of the legal action at the High Court. He added: ‘We have no comment.’ Lord Justice Leveson is expected to release his recommendations into regulation of the UK press in the coming weeks.","Claim by Eriksson alleges phone hacking .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Millions of pilgrims are expected to descend upon Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, for this year's Hajj pilgrimage although health officials are concerned of a deadly new virus spreading . Fears over a global outbreak of a deadly new virus which has emerged in the Middle East are growing as millions of religious pilgrims prepare to visit the region. Health officials in Saudi Arabia are preparing for the annual Hajj pilgrimage this autumn, which sees millions of Muslims visit the country each year. But concerns in the area have been increasing over the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is thought to be more dangerous than SARS, after more than 60 cases were reported in the last year by the World Health Organisation. Officials in Saudi Arabia, where many of the MERS victims have been, are now doing all they can to track down the virus and prevent it from spreading during the pilgrimage, according to Foreign Policy. There have been 77 laboratory-confirmed infections as of June 26. A total of 62 of these cases have been in Saudi Arabia, where 34 of the victims have died. Last year approximately 6 million pilgrims travelled through the country as part of the event, which saw millions circle the Kaaba, in Mecca, alone. The disease, which can spread easily between people, has been compared to SARS, which killed 800 people during an outbreak in 2003. Some experts have noted resemblances between the two as both spread easily between hospitals. Symptoms are also similar with a fever and cough that develops into pneumonia. But, doctors note that the fatality rate is higher. Eight per cent of SARS patients died, while 65 per cent of MERS cases are believed to have been fatal. Doctors have not been able to pinpoint exactly how the illness is spread in every case, as some appeared to catch it when they had not been in contact with an infected person. Cases have also been reported in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Tunisia. But, most cases have been in Saudi Arabia, which is also set to receive millions of Muslim pilgrims during Ramadan next month. Doctors are worried after the new MERS disease (pictured) showed the potential to become as deadly as SARS . Experts say that despite the small number of cases, MERS must be watched as it has the potential to cause an outbreak. WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said: 'We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.' WHO is set to meet in Cairo next month to discuss MERS and its potential threat. Most cases of the disease have been recorded in Saudi Arabia, which is also expecting millions of Muslin pilgrims to visit this month during Ramadan .","Health officials in Saudi Arabia prepare for Hajj pilgrimage this autumn .

"By . Mark Prigg . Controversial surveillance blimps that can spot a person 340 miles away have been unveiled by military firm Raytheon. It boasts the project can offer '360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time' - and revealed the US Army has already bought two. One is being trialled over Maryland, with the other being kept in 'strategic reserve'. Scroll down for video . The 'JLENS' blimp, built by Raytheon, which can spot objects 340 miles away using highly sensitive radio systems. The US Army is about to begin testing two of the craft over Maryland, sparking privacy fears. 'By putting JLENS in strategic reserve, the Army is giving combatant commanders around the globe the ability to pick up the phone and, in short order, receive this incredible air defense capability in their area of responsibility, said Raytheon's Dave Gulla, vice president of Integrated Defense Systems' Global Integrated Sensors business area. The system is called JLENS -- or Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System -- which is composed of an integrated radar system on two tethered, 80-yard blimps. The blimps fly at altitudes of 10,000 feet above sea level and remain aloft and operational for 30 days, enabling the use of defensive measures against cruise missiles, low-flying manned and unmanned aircraft, and moving surface vehicles such as boats, mobile missile launchers and tanks. Threats can be detected from as far as 340 miles away. how they work: The blimps can 'see' for 340 miles. They are moored to base stations, and offer 360 degree surveillance capabilites. They are designed to look for cruise missiles. The Maryland systtem can detect missiles from Boston to North Carolina on the coast and as far inland as Lake Erie, according to the Washington Post. Raytheon, which makes the craft, advertises them as useful for 24/7 surveillance. 'What if there was an affordable way the U.S. and its allies could always “see” the threat, instead of having to hope they had a ship or airplane in the vicinity to detect the threat?,' it says on its website. 'JLENS, an affordable elevated, persistent over-the-horizon sensor system uses a powerful integrated radar system to detect, track and target a variety of threats,' Raytheon says. Aerostats, as they are now called, are already used to protect American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are outfitted with cameras and used to track insurgent and U.S. troop movements. The dirigibles famously snared Army Staff Seargent Robert Bates slaughtering 16 civilians in Kandahar in March 2012. Old-fashioned: Blimps have been around for decades, but they only recently came back into usage by the U.S. Army . The two blimps work together to identify threats such as missiles entering the nearby area. Video showed Mr Bates returning to the base under what he thought was the cloak of early morning darkness. The footage showed him carrying the rifle used to carry out the mass murder. The blimps are also used at the U.S. – Mexico border to try to catch illegal immigrants, CBS News noted. The army has commissioned defense contractor Ratheon to provide the airships, which will hover at an altitude of about 10,000 feet over the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, for the multi-year trial run. Only missiles: The Pentagon insists the aerostats will only be used to search for missiles, but they are already used overseas to monitor insurgent movements . Will Big Brother be watching: The ACLU is also concerned the airships will be used to watch people on the ground . Privacy advocates worry the blimps will also be equipped with high-resolution cameras and radar to track the movements of civilians. ‘Right now there are no rules,’ Christopher Calabrese, of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CBS News. ‘There's nothing that bars us from having high-powered cameras monitoring our every public movement.’ Another ACLU analyst echoed those thoughts to the Post. ‘That's the kind of massive persistent surveillance we've always been concerned about with drones,’ said Jay Stanley. ‘It's part of this trend we’ve seen since 9/11, which is the turning inward of all these surveillance technologies.’ The blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet. Maker Raytheon boasts the project can offer '360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time' - raising major privacy concerns over the project. HIghly visible: People as far away as Baltimore will be able to see the blimps high above them . The Army insisted in a letter to the paper that the aerostats, which can fly for as long as 30 consecutive days, will be the first line of defense against incoming missiles. ‘The primary mission... is to track airborne objects. Its secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such as vehicles or boats. The capability to track surface objects does not extend to individual people.’ The government also said that there are currently no plans to put cameras capable of tracking people on the blimps, but it could not rule out doing so in the future. As it is currently constructed, the program is expected to cost $2.7billion. Civilians as far away as Baltimore will be able to see them from the ground.","Blimps can offer '360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time'

Mrs Powell, who was in her 80s and lived in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, died last month after suffering a heart attack and worked as a royal nanny from the 1980s until the early 1990s. During an interview she gave last year before William's wedding she said: 'I have a very normal relationship with them. 'Their upbringing was very normal and their parents wanted them to have as ordinary a childhood as they could. 'If they saw a muddy puddle they wanted to jump in it and if there was something to climb, they wanted to climb it.'

The former nanny remained in touch with the royal brothers and was reportedly invited to a number of major events in their lives including the royal wedding and William's passing-out parade at Sandhurst in 2006. Kate will now carry out a series of events in Newcastle and Stockton-on-Tees on her own on Wednesday, including meeting community groups at Newcastle Civic Centre and elsewhere chatting to organisations which have benefited from the Royal Wedding Charitable Gift Fund or have the Duchess as a patron. Today, the Duke and Duchess will open the Football Association's new national training complex. William and Kate will be given a tour of the £100million St George's Park site in Staffordshire which aims to be a centre of excellence for training football coaches. The royal couple will step on to a practice pitch to meet England manager Roy Hodgson and his squad who are preparing for their 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino on Friday. Hope Powell, England women's national coach, and a number of players from the England women's team will also meet the Duke - the FA's president - and his wife during their tour. David Bernstein, FA chairman, said: 'The opening of St George's Park is truly a momentous occasion in the history of the FA. 'Next year we will celebrate the FA's 150th anniversary, and this moment will be recorded as significant as any that has gone before us in the last 149 years. 'We are particularly delighted that both the Duke and Duchess can join us to open this facility.' David Sheepshanks, chairman of St George's Park, said: 'This is a wonderful reward for all of the people that have worked so hard to bring St George's Park to reality. 'The local community have embraced every aspect of St George's Park and this will be a red letter day for Burton upon Trent and the surrounding locality.' The national football centre aims to produce better coaches and in turn better players - and ultimately a new England manager - as it attempts to replicate the success of world and European champions Spain. The facility covers 330 acres and has 11 external pitches, a dedicated practice and training area for goalkeepers and sports pavilions for post-training debriefs.

Shunning the simple life, the Turkish herdsman can now stay online, updating Facebook and catching up on the latest episode of Breaking Bad. The farmers also claim that during birthing season, the panels are particularly helpful in providing extra lighting. Ser-Gün, a Turkish solar panel producer, is behind the ‘plug and play’ panels which cost 2,800 Turkish Liras (£775 or £1320). ‘We aim to better the daily comfort of the producer in the countryside, providing sustainability for sheepherding,’ Ser-Gün Chairman, Tamer Uğurluel, told Cihan news agency. Mr Uğurluel added that the project was the result of a 30-year-old collaboration between the local sheepherding association in the province and the government. The Turkish state covers half the cost for the solar panels using public funds used to support development in the countryside.

"By . Tara Brady . Universities should be free to charge what they like for degree courses as long as they offer help to poorer students, a vice-chancellor has said. Sir Howard Newby, vice-chancellor of Liverpool University, said that the 'most rational' way to fund higher education in the future would be to lift the current £9,000 cap and replace it with a 'sliding scale' of fees. In an interview with the Times Higher Education (THE) magazine, Sir Howard said he thought that the current fee system is unlikely to change for at least three years. Under major higher education reforms, fees for English universities were tripled to a maximum of £9,000 in 2012. Sir Howard Newby, the vice-chancellor of Liverpool University, said that the 'most rational' way to fund higher education in the future would be to lift the current £9,000 cap and replace it with a 'sliding scale' of fees .

He added: 'The most rational way to deal with the financing of higher education is to have fees which are uncontrolled, with no cap, but in return (universities) have to make adequate provision for looking after students who can't afford to pay that fee.' This system would mean 'a sliding scale where the higher the fee, the more money is devoted to meeting the cost of higher education', Sir Howard told the THE, adding it would be in line with recommendations made in the Browne Review of higher education funding in 2010. His comments come just months after a report warned that universities will need more money in the future if they are to cope with increasing numbers of students. The study, by vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, argued that the tuition fee hike has not given many universities extra cash with the income largely replacing cuts to government funding. It suggested that institutions will need funds to invest in areas such as buildings and facilities if they are to offer students a decent university experience and keep up with other countries. Under major education reforms, fees for English universities were tripled to a maximum of £9,000 in 2012 . The report followed suggestions by a number of higher education leaders that tuition fees will need to rise in the coming years to allow universities to meet their costs. Universities UK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden has said that there was a case for raising the £9,000 fee cap in line with inflation. In an interview he said that fees 'can't remain frozen forever' and that in real terms, by 2016, on current inflation rates the maximum fee will be worth about £8,250. And Oxford vice-chancellor Professor Andrew Hamilton has argued that a university's charges should be linked to what it offers, saying that the cost of an Oxford education totals more than £16,000 per undergraduate each year.","Sir Howard Newby is the vice-chancellor of Liverpool University .

Allegations of the use of improper language by supporters at games between Brazil and Mexico and Cameroon and Mexico have been passed on to FIFA by Fare - the organisation in place to tackle discrimination in football. The allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates into 'whore' and has been heard in games in Fortaleza and Natal. Controversy: FIFA has been contacted by the Fare network about discriminatory chanting allegedly heard during Brazil vs Mexico . Concern: The allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates into 'whore' FIFA said that while Fare had passed on concerns about both of the matches - played last Friday and on Monday - it was already engaged in disciplinary proceedings against Mexico. It said in a statement: 'We can confirm that we have been contacted by Fare. Prior to this, disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mexico for improper conduct of spectators during the match Mexico - Cameroon. 'As the proceedings are ongoing, we are not in a position to comment further.' FIFA also reiterated its position on discrimination of any time. 'FIFA takes a firm, zero-tolerance stance against any form of discrimination and racism and this is enshrined in the FIFA Statutes in article 3 which stipulates that: 'Discrimination of any kind against a Country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion',' it added.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Victim: Roger Pratt (left) was murdered on his yacht while celebrating his wife Margaret's (right) birthday . Three men are set to be charged with the murder of the Briton who was bludgeoned and drowned while on a round-the-world yachting adventure to celebrate his wife's 60th birthday. Autopsy results revealed Roger Pratt’s death in St Lucia was caused by 'asphyxiation, secondary to blunt force trauma.' Police said three men, in their 20s, were co-operating with the inquiry and set to be charged. Speaking for the first time since her husband’s death, Mr Pratt’s widow, Margaret, who was left badly bruised and needing facial stitches in the savage attack, said she and her husband had not suspected any danger on the Caribbean Island - until her husband's slaughter. 'We had not felt unsafe in St Lucia until the events of those final tragic minutes,' said Mrs Pratt, who came under siege with her husband when three robbers boarded their boat, beat Mr Pratt and left his lifeless body floating in the ocean. Mr and Mrs Pratt, who left Lowestoft in Suffolk last July both attempted to defend themselves during the violent attack on their 41ft yacht, Magnetic Attraction. Sources from the Vieux Fort region suggested that Mrs Pratt scratched at the assailants' faces and bit one of their fingers, as she and her husband tried to protect themselves. Mr Pratt, 62, was thrown into the sea by the attackers, who fled in a small rowing boat. He was not stabbed as previous police reports suggested. 'One of the suspects had deep bite marks on his finger and they all has scratches on their faces,' said a local source from the low-income 'shanty town' region of Bruce Ville. Local reports alleged that a notorious gang called the Pepper Yard Crew may have been responsible for the murder. Margaret Pratt said she had not felt unsafe on the yacht (pictured) until the moment three robbers boarded, beat her husband and left his lifeless body floating in the ocean . The group of unemployed males are known for causing trouble in the local community in Vieux Fort, a port in the southern most tip of the island. 'They carry guns on their waist or in their hands in broad daylight to intimidate people, they are very feared,' said a local who did not wish to be named for fear of retribution. Vernon Francois, the commissioner of the island’s police force, said: 'This appears to have been intended as a robbery and went out of control.' Three suspects are already in custody and are due to be charged imminently. Under St. Lucia law, suspects can be held for 72 hours without charge unless an extension is granted by the magistrate. 'In this case we have enough evidence to get an extension before they are charged,' said Corporal Aniel Innocent of the Royal St Lucia police force.","Autopsy results reveal Roger Pratt was murdered on his yacht in St Lucia .

"By . Sam Webb . A PCSO with a photographic memory, who has tracked down 250 suspects after recognising them in the street, has been given an award by police bosses. Andy Pope has the skills to identify criminals from the tiniest of details - and has arrested 247 wanted suspects in the last two years. Mr Pope, from Redditch, Worcestershire, was this week given a ‘Putting the Public First Award’ for an unbelievable identification in August 2012. Memory man: PCSO Andy Pope's photographic memory has tracked down 250 suspects. He memorises their faces at briefings and has seen many out on the beat . The PCSO of eight years even recognised a suspect a whole year after seeing his image, just from a tiny mole on the suspect’s cheek. The dedicated officer was able to track down the suspected burglar after a dramatic chase through Birmingham city centre, ending with Mr Pope being threatened with a weapon. In 2012, he identified 180 people, having memorised their images from CCTV still photographs and police briefing meetings. And this year so far, he has identified a further 67 suspects. Total recall: Mr Pope spends hours scrutinising mugshots and CCTV to track down suspects . Gift: Mr Pope has the skills to identify crooks from the tiniest of details - and has nabbed 247 wanted suspects in the last two years . Mr Pope has been working on the Safer Travel Team since 2008, and first started identifying people three years ago. He said: 'I never really thought anything of it at first. 'But three years ago my previous inspector called me in for a meeting and said ""look, you’re doing these identifications more than anyone else - you’ve got a gift"". 'I always thought it was normal but my boss assured me it wasn’t normal. Some people call it a photographic memory but I just think I’m quite lucky.' 'It’s just a knack for recognising people, which in my line of work I suppose is pretty important. 'Now obviously word’s got around, which can only help keep the streets safer - it’s a good thing for everyone.' Brave: PCSO recognised a suspect burglar on the streets of Birmingham, chased him down and was threatened with a weapon - but has now been awarded for his efforts . His amazing skills are a result of hundreds of extra hours of hard work before a shift for the modest PCSO. He said: 'I suppose it’s part hard work and part a natural ability. I do try and work hard at the briefings and remember faces - it’s what everyone does, we’re all pretty dedicated. 'As part of any investigation, CCTV footage and stills are crucial. So the whole force work together to put a face to a name - I guess I’ve just been a bit lucky in recognising people. 'I think due to being on the Safer Travel Team and building up my offender knowledge, that’s where it all started. We cover the whole area as a team so it really helps to remember a face.' And if Mr Pope is humble about his own work, others are ready to recognise his achievements. He said: 'I was nominated for the Joyce Campbell award after helping with the arrest last August, I felt so honoured. 'But it’s not about the awards, if I can help people can travel in safety, then that’s enough for me.'","Andy Pope can store details of mugshots and CCTV images in his head .

"By . Misty White Sidell . Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have opened their first retail store for The Row - which includes a pool in its courtyard. The new outpost, which opened Tuesday in Los Angeles, is housed in a stark white mid-century building whose central, outdoor area comes equipped with a recessed pool for swimming. Not ones to hold their customers back, the sisters have placed a leather basket of plush towels beside it for those who wish to take a dip mid-shopping. Even the newly-engaged Mary-Kate is prone to get in on the action. ‘It’s really tempting’ she told Women’s Wear Daily of the store’s best amenity and visual focal point. Scroll down for video . Shopping bonus: The Row's new Los Angeles boutique - the label's first-ever store - comes equipped with a pool in its courtyard (pictured) The brains: The Row's designers Mary-Kate (left) and Ashley (right) Olsen say that retail has always been a part of their plan for the label, which they started in 2006 . Their store – a 3,800 square-foot space located on Melrose Place – has been converted from a hair salon that the sisters had both loyally visited since the age of ten, making their decision to open The Row there a personal one. Ashley said of the location, once a Sally Hershberger salon: ‘It was a toss-up between New York and LA, and when this space became available, we jumped on it. ‘It used to be a hair salon and my sister and I used to come here, so we were very aware of the space.’ The store is divided into three areas they have called ‘galleries’, which have been laid out to look like a home – with spaces representing a dining room, library, and living room. ‘Ultimately, for us, it was about setting it up like a home and just having the apparel be a part of the space,’ Ashley explained of how the store has been organized. In keeping with this theme, the sisters worked with vintage furniture dealers to outfit the store with prized design pieces by Prouvé, Fortuny, and Maul McCobb – all of which are also for sale. Racks of the label's elegant clothes - which are revered for their simplicity and craftsmanship - hang  among the valuable mid-century furniture, making the store feel like an incredibly well-designed closet. Comfy environs: The store has been organized to resemble a home, with its three 'galleries' designed to appear as a living room, dining room, and library . More than clothes: The sisters worked with antique furniture dealers to track down precious designs that are also for sale in the store . An assortment of the sisters’ favorite Manolo Blahnik styles is available for individual purchase as well, and are scattered throughout the boutique. The Olsens say that having their own store has always been a part of their big plan. In opening the boutique, they not only get to articulate the environment in which their clothes are sold – but they also have the opportunity to market pieces that have not been picked up by department stores. While The Row retails in 188 stores across 37 countries, Mary-Kate says that only 20per cent of their seasonal collections are purchased by wholesale vendors. The Row’s Los Angeles boutique, however, will sell their made-in-America collections in their entirety. But this singular store is only the start. While the sisters believe that opening their first location in New York was too ‘aggressive’ an option, they do hope to set up shop there sometime in the near future. They also plan to implement the lessons they learn with this store into a grander retail scheme for their lower-priced, more commercial line Elizabeth & James. Craftsmanship: The Row's made-in-America designs are revered for their simplicity and superb quality . According to the Olsens, The Row’s first store is just a tipping off point for what will follow in the near future. As Mary-Kate explained: ‘We will get into shoes in the next year. And hopefully men’s. To us it’s really about a lifestyle, and I think this store is a great starting-off point to express where we are going.’ The Row was established in 2006, initially as a line of knitwear, T-shirt, and denim basics. The label has since exponentially expanded to include fur and handbags and is carried at stores including Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York. As a luxury label, prices for the line range from $225 for a tank top up to $5,000 and beyond for coats. Items typically retail between $1,200 to $2,500. More on the way: Mary-Kate and Ashley say that this store is just the beginning and that they plan to open more in the future, as well as start their own line of shoes and perhaps branch out into menswear . In 2012, the label won the CFDA Award for Womenswear Designer of the Year – beating out fellow contenders Marc Jacobs and Proenza Schouler. Mary-Kate and Ashley also manage a contemporary label Elizabeth & James, and a lower-priced line called Olsenboye which sells at J.C. Penney.","The Row's first boutique opened in Los Angeles this week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bogus claims: Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 53, swindled thousands of pounds relating to four houses he owned or managed . A senior police officer was branded 'thoroughly dishonest' by a judge as he was jailed for making a string of bogus mortgage and insurance claims. Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 53, swindled thousands of pounds relating to four houses he owned or managed. Last month a jury at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court found him guilty of six counts of fraud, three counts of money laundering, and a charge of failing to disclose information. Judge Jeffrey Lewis said Razaq, who was based at GMP's Bolton division, showed 'brazen guile' when committing his crimes and immediate custody was the only option. Jailing the officer for 18 months, Judge Lewis added: 'It's a matter of bitter regret that I see before me a police officer whose honesty and integrity should be beyond reproach. Sadly that's not the case here. 'You've shown yourself to be a thoroughly dishonest man in many respects. It's always an unpleasant, painful and onerous duty for a judge to deal with a police officer who's broken the law, and in your case so blatantly and repeatedly.' The offences took place from 2008 until 2011, when he was arrested and his office was raided by GMP's counter corruption unit. The fraud charges related to a series of claims for damage and mortgage applications on four properties that he owned or managed. The houses were in Bradford Road, Great Lever, where he lived with his wife and three children, Bowker Street, Higher Broughton, and Duncan Street, Salford. Between May 2008 and March 2011, Razaq made three false insurance claims against his portfolio of properties. He profited £13,000 from two of the claims, but the third claim for more than £20,000 was rejected as being 'excessively exaggerated'. The fourth fraud conviction related to the withholding of claims information to secure more favourable terms on his property insurance. He was also convicted of two mortgage frauds. He denied the allegations but was found guilty after a six-week trial, and sentenced yesterday. The court heard how Razaq had health problems, and was also the main carer for his ill 83-year-old father. Prison: Razaq was jailed for 18 months at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court for the offences . David Nuttall, defending, told the court: 'He's going to suffer because of this conviction, because his standing as a man in the community, which he has worked so hard for, has been shattered and he's going to have to live with that.' Assistant Chief Con Dawn Copley said: 'There is no doubt that the actions of Inspector Razaq have brought discredit to Greater Manchester Police and reflect badly on our officers and police staff who are honest and work tirelessly for the people of Greater Manchester.' It us understood understood Razaq, who is still a serving officer on suspension, will face an internal hearing with GMP on Monday.","Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 53, found guilty of fraud, money laundering and failing to disclose information .

"By . Rosie Taylor . 'Sickening': CCTV shows Piara Purewal repeatedly stamping on the head of unconscious teenager Louis Mousset as the thug's friends Dale Walker and Lance Keating-Hutchinson pin him to the pavement . A thug who stamped on an unconscious teenager’s head ten times while his two friends pinned him face down to the pavement in a 'sickening' late-night attack has been jailed for seven years. Piara Purewal, 22, attacked Louis Mousset, who was 18 at the time, in the early hours of September 9 last year. The student, now 19, was walking with friends in Birmingham city centre when he was set upon by Purewal and his two accomplices, Dale Walker, 21, and Lance Keating-Hutchinson, 25. The trio had been fighting with a group of other men and turned their attentions to Mr Mousset as he walked past. Purewal punched him and knocked him out before Walker and Keating-Hutchinson held the unconscious teenager face down on the kerb, allowing Purewal to repeatedly stamp on his head. After the shocking attack, which was captured on CCTV, Mr Mousset spent three days in hospital being treated for bleeding on the brain. Surgeons feared he may lose sight in one eye but remarkably he went on to make a full recovery. Purewal, of Hockley, Birmingham, was jailed for seven years and four months at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday after he admitted wounding with intent and assault. Walker, also of Hockley, and Keating-Hutchinson, from Winson Green, Birmingham, were both jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm and affray. Walker also admitted two charges of assault and Keating-Hutchinson one. Caging the trio, Judge William Davis QC said: 'For no good reason they were set upon by the three of you. 'You were drunk. That no doubt had a good deal to do with it. 'One man could well have lost his life but it is purely good fortune that he didn’t.' Prosecutor Blondelle Thompson told the court Louis had been in the city centre and was heading towards Broad Street in the early hours when the three thugs launched an unprovoked attack. Louis was ahead of his two friends when he came across the trio fighting with another group of men, when they turned to attack him. Brutal: The victim was on his way to Broad Street (right) when he was attacked by Piara Purewal, 22 (left) Accomplices: Dale Walker, 21, (left) and Lance Keating-Hutchinson, 25, were both jailed for two-and-a-half years for their parts in the attack in September last year . Purewal, Walker and Keating-Hutchinson went into hiding following the violent assault but were arrested by detectives following a public appeal. Walker was arrested from a city centre address on October 25 and plain clothes officers arrested Purewal on December 12. Keating-Hutchinson eventually handed himself in to police in Birmingham on January 24 this year. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Sarah McDonnell, from West Midlands Police, branded the attack 'cowardly' and 'sickening'. She said: 'The ferocity of the attack, the repeated, furious stamping, meant we could have been looking at a murder enquiry. 'The lad suffered nasty facial injuries, lost several teeth and it was thought he could lose the sight in one eye. Party central: Broad Street in Birmingham is popular with clubbers . 'Thankfully he made a good physical recovery but understandably he was traumatised by what happened. 'The victim was a totally innocent party. He got caught up in an incident not of his making and was understandably unhappy at being shoved to the ground. 'He approached Purewal and was punched unconscious and repeatedly stamped upon. 'He was lying prone, face down on the floor, and unable to defend himself. 'It was the most cowardly, sickening attack I’ve ever seen and Purewal has rightly been handed a long jail term for his actions.'","Piara Purewal, 22, captured on camera repeatedly stamping on victim, 18 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . and Ian Drury . and Jack Doyle . UKIP were accused of scaremongering by a Home Office minister yesterday after the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain fell slightly. Those in jobs from the two countries dropped by 4,000 in the three months after employment restrictions were lifted on January 1 compared to the three months before. But despite the surprise dip the total number working here was up by 29,000 – nearly 26 per cent – in the first quarter of this year compared to the equivalent period in 2013. There were 140,000 Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain in January-March, down from  144,000 at the end of 2013 . The . Office for National Statistics said there were 140,000 people from the . two eastern European countries in jobs in the UK between January and . March this year. Ukip's Nigel Farage was roundly attacked today for stoking fears that Britain would be swamped by Romanians and Bulgarians. Figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year . That was . down from 144,000 in the three months to December, before Romanians and . Bulgarians gained the same rights to work in Britain as other EU . citizens. The figures do not include dependent family members of immigrant workers or the unemployed. Before . employment restrictions were lifted ministers repeatedly refused to . estimate how many Romanians and Bulgarians would arrive in the UK, . leading Ukip to raise concerns that a ‘massive influx’ would place extra . demands on public services and depress wages. Amid . growing worries the Government introduced measures to  prevent EU . migrants from claiming unemployment benefits for their  first three . months here, while those found begging or sleeping rough could be . deported. Yesterday, after . the figures were published, Tory Police Minister Damian Green hit out at . the rhetoric from Nigel Farage’s party. He said: ‘They started . scaremongering in the run-up to January 1. They have been proved wrong . and they have decided to carry on scaremongering.’ Tory . minister Anna Soubry said: ‘These figures just show that Ukip preys on . people’s fears, it preys on prejudices in many people. And they make . these wild, actually rather offensive claims, and hey, what happens? It . was all a load of nonsense.’ Employment minister Esther McVey said the predicted influx had not happened . Lib . Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable added: ‘This idea of waiting for . tens of thousands of people pouring off the planes from the Balkans was . just a scare story.’ Labour . MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, . said: ‘Those, including Ukip, who promised the end of the world on . January 1, now owe the public and those from Romania and Bulgaria a full . apology.’ But critics . pointed out that the number of workers from Romania and Bulgaria had . increased by 43,000 – or 44 per cent – since the first three months of . 2012. They also suggested that the December peak meant many arrived in the UK in time for the lifting of employment restrictions. Sir . Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘The latest annual . figures show an increase of 29,000, in a period when restrictions were . in place for nine months. We believe they are consistent with our . estimate of a 50,000 population increase from Romania and Bulgaria for . each of the next five years.’ Dr . Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at . the University of Oxford, said: ‘Until we have complete data for 2014 it . is impossible to achieve any definite conclusions about the impact of . the end of restrictions.’ Ukip . head of policy Tim Aker said: ‘We never said it would just be about . Romania and Bulgaria. We are looking at the massive influx from the EU.’ The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK is up by almost 26 per cent year-on-year, compared to 1.8 per cent for people born in the UK. There are a record 30.430million people in work, up by 283,000 on the end of last year . Unemployment has fallen by more than 300,000 over the past year, giving jobless rates of 7 per cent for men and 6.4 per cent for women. The number of people in a job rose 283,000 in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase in 43 years. The number of unemployed young people has been falling for the last eight months. Employment minister Esther McVey said: 'As the recovery takes hold, more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow. 'Each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make Britain a more prosperous and confident place to be. 'We will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future.' The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance last month fell by 25,100 to 1.12 million. Danny . Alexander, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Tresury, said: ‘This further . big rise in employment shows again that our jobs rich recovery is . becoming firmly established. 'It follows strengthening economic growth figures and positive news on inflation. The . very modest numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to work in . Britain this year is in stark contrast to the inflammatory rhetoric of . earlier this year. 'Overall . today's figures are good news for the people of Britain, and bad news . for those who would threaten our recovery by turning the clock back.' Mr Cameron yesterday insisted his promise to get immigration below 100,000 a year is still 'achievable'. But Mr Cameron insisted: 'The target remains. I think it is absolutely achievable'. Appearing before the House of Commons Liaison Committee, he declined to discuss the figures for Romanians and Bulgarians before their publication, but said that his administration had brought net migration down by one-fifth since coming to office. He also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the EU. There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland. Total pay is up by 1.7 per cent, while the CPI rate of inflation is at 1.6 per cent . Mr Cameron said he had not made 'anybody who thinks that is sensible' but admitted that under existing EU rules 'it seems impossible to change that'. He told BBC One's Marr Show: 'We are very clear about what we want to achieve. Let's end benefit tourism, let's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded. 'Let's make sure that Parliaments can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the European Commission. 'Let's make a series of changes to make Europe more flexible, more competitive. Those are the sorts of things I want to see.'","Anna Soubry says Ukip made 'wild, rather offensive' migrant predictions .

'It's time to whip the crown from Apple,' said Mr Bezos before showing off the new handset for the first time. Scroll down for Video . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Amazon Fire Phone. The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. The handset chooses the two best views, and can even work at night using infrared. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'. 'There is always more to see by changing your perspective,' Bezos said. 'What if there were a thousand artists standing by to redraw the picture every time you moved your head?' Apps using the new feature includes a Maps app that lets users see around buildings. Users can also tilt the phone to 'look around' an on screen map. The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets, and come with special tangle-free headphones. Apps available at launch include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus and ESPN. It also boasts a Gorilla Glass 3 screen with a rubber frame, and aluminum buttons. Users will also have unlimited photo storage via the Amazon Cloud, and syncing with the company's recently launched Fire TV set-top box so you can send media to your TV. The phone has its own menu system, and users can even navigate by tilting the handset. They can also see different app catergies through a special 'tray' that appears when they swip (right) 'Fire Phone puts everything you love about Amazon in the palm of your hand—instant access to Amazon’s vast content ecosystem and exclusive features like the Mayday button, ASAP, Second Screen, X-Ray, free unlimited photo storage, and more,' said Bezos. 'The Firefly button lets you identify printed web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products—and take action in seconds.' how they compare: The new fire is up against Apple's iPhone 5s and Samsung's Galaxy S5 . The MayDay 24-hour video help feature will also be available on Fire Phone, Amazon confirmed. Bezos said the most important thing the firm has done was to 'earn trust with customers'. The handset will initially be offered in the US only by AT&T in a deal that echoes the launch of the original iPhone. The deal has already riled AT&T's competitors, . Seattle based T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, tweeted, 'Really, @Amazon? What happened to home-town pride?' Amazon also announced that the Fire Phone will come with a new app called Firefly. This uses the camera and visual recognition to identify objects ranging from books to CDs as well as listen to music before looking for it on Amazon. The feature will also recognise phone numbers and web addresses, as well as TV shows. Amazon claims it can recognise 100 million items in less than one second. Once an item is recognised, it can automatically take users to the corresponding Amazon page so they can buy it. The app is triggered by holding the same button that serves as a shortcut to the Fire Phone's camera. Peter Woodd, CEO at phone accessory maker IDT Systems said 'The effect this will have on the Smartphone industry are substantial. 'Consumers are constantly looking for the newest and most innovative device and if Amazon’s Smartphone offers the suggested 3D viewing capabilities, the usual players may find their hold decreasing.' It is the first time the retailer has created a phone, and follows on from the success of the Kindle eReader and Kindle Fire tablet, with sales of eBooks overtaking those of physical copies in the UK in 2012. Although Amazon did not confirm a release date for the UK, experts predict it will be on sale this year outside the US. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos shows off the 3D features of his company's new Fire smartphone . Amazon had designed its own software for the phone. There, the app grid is showing - and users can even tilt the handset to navigate through it . The handset has been under development since 2009 at Lab126, Amazon’s secretive Silicon Valley hardware division. More than 1,600 people claim Lab126 as their employer on the professional networking site LinkedIn, according to Business Week. Web site BGR said the design looked like an iPhone. 'In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.' Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com said: 'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with. Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have a Trojan Horse on its hands.' Duncan Bell, operations editor at UK-based gadget magazine T3 said: 'The Amazon phone's solid hardware and verging-on-pointless software features are irrelevant here. Amazon sees this as a platform to flog its content, just as it did with ebooks on Kindles. Problem is, all its video and audio content is or will be available on every other device known to humanity, leaving no compelling reason to buy its own phone.' Ramzi Yakob, industry expert and strategist at digital agency TH-NK said: 'Alarm bells started ringing when I realised that Jeff Bezos had spent more than twice the amount of time explaining how Dynamic Perspective was developed than actually showing us what it can do to improve the user experience. It clearly isn't a game changer.' Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'Arriving so late to the over-crowded smartphone party requires tactical consideration, and Amazon has covered all bases with a handset which is both big on spectacle and packed with features. 'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with. 'Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have an Trojan Horse on its hands. 'Amazon’s killer blow lies in its deep connection to the Prime subscription service. The Fire Phone is rather a gateway into its millions of books, movies and music on-demand, making the device key to a very appealing package. The handset has as 13MP camera - and Bezos claims it can take better pictures that the iPhone 5s and Galaxy S5 . Previously images of the handset have leaked online. 'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site has previously BGR said. 'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.' The handset has been runoured for weeks-  which Bezos acknowledged with this slide . The Amazon handset has a beveled edge similar to apple's iPhone 5 . Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect . It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps. To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. Amazon's much rumoured holophone is set to be announced on June 18. The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the device. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone . Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.","4.7inch phone uses four front facing cameras to show 3D images that 'float like holograms'

And African federation president Issa Hayatou went a step further by confirming his organisation’s championing of Blatter in a letter to the FIFA overlord. No wonder former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, who launched his fanciful bid for the presidency in London this week, admits he has no chance if Blatter stands again. Blatter has said he will make up his mind before this summer’s World Cup. But as long as he remains in good health, only massive opposition from daughter Corinne or his new girlfriend Linda Barras is likely to deter him. ............................................................................

It's good to know the FA protocol committee busy themselves with some of the great football issues of the day. The latest minutes show that the blazers have been complaining about the sweet course in their VIP Wembley Suite meal being served at half-time rather than before the match because of time pressure before kick-off. These ridiculous councillors have even asked for visiting international delegations to be reminded about the collar-and-tie dress code for their fancy function.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Veteran skipper Rafael Marquez has warned Mexico they face their toughest challenge yet as they attempt to book their place in the second round of the World Cup finals. The 35-year-old former Barcelona defender's claim may raise eyebrows given that Los Aztecas, following a narrow victory over Cameroon, have already encountered hosts Brazil and emerged with a 0-0 draw which has left qualification firmly in their own hands. But as they prepare for their Group A showdown with Croatia in Recife on Monday, Marquez insists they can leave nothing to chance. VIDEO Scroll down for Ivan Perisic: Mexico are really great, it'll be a must-win game . Preparation: Rafael Marquez talk with Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera . Battler: Marquez challenging David Luiz in the air during their 0-0 with Brazil on Tuesday . Leader: The Mexico captain has skippered his side at four consecutive World Cups . He told www.fifa.com: 'This is our biggest game. We know we have to keep the momentum going. 'We worked so hard in our last two games and we don't want to throw it all away against Croatia. 'We have always known we were going to face tough opponents. Croatia have loads of very talented players. 'They have got very quick wingers who can get to the byline and put the ball in the box. They have also got a lethal striker and some of the best central midfielders around. 'They are a great team, so it won't be easy. We will have to give our best to get at least a point and move on to the next phase.' The equation is simple for the Mexicans: avoid defeat and they will progress to face either Holland or Chile in the next phase of the competition. However, defeat would see the Croatians leapfrog them and that, coupled with anything other than a heavy reverse for Brazil at the hands of pointless Cameroon, would send them home. Talent: Mexico will be facing off against the likes of Mario Mandzukic and Luka Modric . Style: Croatia boss Niko Kovac has promised that his side will take the game to the Mexicans . VIDEO Croatia and Mexico set for decider . Marquez, leading his country for the fourth time at the World Cup finals, said: 'If you take a look at the quality of the teams we have faced, it shows how difficult and tough a task we have had. 'And though we are not there yet, we are close to taking an important step. Keeping clean sheets has been key for us, and we are determined to keep that going.' Croatia boss Niko Kovac will head into the game knowing victory represents his side's only realistic chance of making it to the knockout stage with Brazil and Mexico both currently a point better off.However, he will not take immediate risks in his pursuit of a priceless win. Kovac told the Croatian Football Federation's official website, www.hns-cff.hr: 'I know what we need, but we have 90 minutes. 'From the first minute, we will try to impose our rhythm because we make it easier for the early goal. But we will be patient.

"By . James Chapman . Lord Mandelson, a former Business Secretary, suggests Mr Miliband needs to abandon his 'crowd-pleasing' promises on the cost of living . Labour grandee Lord Mandelson today warns Ed Miliband he needs to get his ‘act together’ if he wants to counter the rise of Ukip and hope to lead more than a ‘minority government’. The former Business Secretary, one of the founders of New Labour, suggests Mr Miliband needs to abandon his ‘crowd-pleasing’ promises on the cost of living and come up with ‘counter-intuitive policies’ instead. His intervention, in the Spectator magazine, reflects growing concern in Labour ranks about the party’s economic policy, which has been mocked as ‘the politics of pointing at things and saying how expensive they are’. Senior figures are also urging Mr Miliband to shift his position on issues such as immigration and an EU referendum – something he has so far refused to do. There is concern across the party at last week’s local and European election results, which do not suggest it is on course for a majority at next year’s general election. In town hall elections, Labour made progress in London and some other areas, but finished seven points behind what Neil Kinnock achieved before he lost the 1992 election. In the European Parliament elections, the party ended up only just over one point ahead of the Conservatives and was soundly beaten by Ukip – the first time for 30 years that an opposition has not come out on top. Peter Kellner, the head of pollster YouGov, yesterday told a conference organised by Blairite campaign group Progress: ‘On a Government versus opposition basis, I think these figures really are bad for Labour ... Labour should be terrified by these results. ‘I have been on the pessimists’ end of analysts of Labour’s standing and I have to say I thought the vote last week justified the pessimists and did nothing to justify the Labour optimists.’ In his article, Lord Mandelson said it was clear Ukip had had ‘a good week’. ‘The challenge for them is to build a genuine movement beyond a charismatic leader, a band of fruitcake candidates and a clutch of reactionary ideas,’ he added. ‘I doubt they will succeed. In my political career we’ve seen two similar ""breakthrough"" moments, both in the 1980s: the SDP’s rise and fall, then the Greens coming and going. ‘Those parties’ success was only due to Labour’s weakness. When Labour got its act together, their appeal faded. The same has to happen now, if Labour wants to become more than a minority administration in 2015. 'Douglas Alexander, the party’s election chief, said: ""Labour can win the general election if we take the right steps between now and a year’s time."" 'The “if” has to include fewer crowd-pleasing cost-of-living promises and more counter-intuitive policies.’ Lord Mandelson's intervention reflects growing concern in Labour ranks about the party's economic policy, which has been mocked as 'the politics of pointing at things and saying how expensive they are' Mr Miliband’s allies dismiss the suggestion that he has been complacent about the rise of Ukip in working class Labour areas – insisting Tony Blair and his ministers are to blame. One shadow cabinet ally told the left-wing New Statesman magazine: ‘The idea that, suddenly, because of the magic abilities of Farage, Ukip have come out of nowhere to do what they did in the Europeans and the locals is wrong; it’s absurd and incorrect. ‘We’re reaping what we sowed back in ’97 through to 2005, when we gave the impression to our working-class heartlands that they were communities that we took for granted.’ Mr Miliband’s allies dismiss the suggestion that he has been complacent about the rise of Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, left, in working class Labour areas – insisting Tony Blair, right, and his ministers are to blame . Senior Conservative ministers yesterday held a strategy meeting at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s country residence, to discuss last week’s election results and the Queen’s Speech and the Newark by-election, both due next week. Though its election results were better than expected, they suggested the party will also struggle to assemble a majority, raising the prospect of another coalition. The Tories are ‘throwing everything’ at fending off the Ukip threat in the Newark poll, which has been triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer. Mr Cameron has invested great personal capital in the contest, having already made two campaign visits to the constituency himself.","Intervention reflects growing concern over Labour's economic policy .

"By . Helen Collis . When times are hard it's good to know where you can live a full life without hardship, or enjoy a holiday on the cheap. Thanks to an assessment of American cities, it turns out that Omaha, Nebraska, is the best place to live if you want to scrimp on day to day items and still enjoy an active social life. A top 10 of 'cheapskate' cities has been compiled by the magazine Kiplinger, based on a review of a basket of criteria. Best for cheapskates: Omaha, Nebraska, came up top as the bets city for cheapskates to live in . Among them are the average cost of living, the number of libraries and museums in each city, and the frequency of free activities such as concerts, lectures and performances. The researchers also reviewed the number of Dollar General stores within a 10-mile radius of each city. Omaha's cost of living is 12.3 per cent below the national average and the median household income is $56,346 - $3,584 over the national average. The city has three times as many public libraries and museums than the average urban sprawl - 155 versus 56 - and it has an accessible 11 Dollar General stores. Wealthy: Ogden, Utah, has the highest median household income of all the top 'cheapskate' cities in the shortlist . St Louis, in Missouri, is perhaps the most consistently affordable place to live, since last year it topped the same list, and this year it was ranked ninth. It is the only U.S. city to feature on the magazine's top 10 cheapskate places to live for two consecutive years, although the publication pointing out that the criteria have varied. Des Moines, Iowa's capital, was ranked third, with both grocery and health care expenses are about 6 per cent cheaper than average . Time Magazine did its own assessment of 2013's best cities for cheapskates and drew the following conclusions. It noted that of all those in the list, none of them are positioned on the coast, the implication being that coastal cities are expensive to live in. Columbus, Ohio, ranked fourth, where a gallon of milk will cost you 18.6% less in Columbus than it would in most of the country . Raleigh, North Carolina, has 100 libraries and museums, double the average, including this contemporary art museum designed by Brooks and Scarpa . This is perhaps unsurprising, Time Magazine says, since property prices are higher the closer they are to the coast. It also noted that no big cities feature on the list; those that did had a population of around 100,000 to 500,000 people, with a few closer to 1million. The magazine also pointed out that this correlates with recent data which revealed that big U.S. cities such as New York and Chicago also had the lowest uptake in coupon use. Cincinnati, Ohio, was ranked sixth, where home values in Ohio's largest metro area stand 16 per cent below the national median, at $156,400 . College towns and cities generally appeared to be more affordable for cheapskates, the magazine said. And Iowa, Utah and Ohio were the most more affordable states to live in, each with two cities in the shortlist. Ogden, in Iowa was ranked the second best place for cheapskates to live where the median household income was more that $10,000 over the national average, and cost of living is 10 per cent below. Salt Lake City, Utah, set among the mountains, was ranked seventh for cheapskates. Here, every year, cheapskates can test out paddleboards at the Outdoor Retailers Summer Market . 1.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Martin Kaymer's friends may only have been joking when they labelled him a one-hit wonder, but the 29-year-old will take the perfect riposte back to Germany - the US Open trophy. Kaymer's first major title in the 2010 US PGA Championship came as a shock to the 25-year-old, who was equally unprepared to cope with becoming world number one six months later. A fourth consecutive missed cut at the Masters contributed to his spell as number one lasting just eight weeks, but also prompted changes to his swing to cope with the demands of Augusta National, where a draw is more useful than Kaymer's favoured fade. Pride: Martin Kaymer celebrates winning the US Open in North Carolina of Sunday . What followed was hardly a dramatic slump, with a first World Golf Championship event won with a closing 63 in Shanghai later that year, but Kaymer did not win a full-field event in 2012 or 2013. By the time of his heroics at Medinah in September 2012, Kaymer admitted he would not have picked himself for the Ryder Cup team, but having qualified he had little choice and played just once before his starring role in Sunday's decisive singles. And just five weeks before his stunning win at Pinehurst, Kaymer entered the Players Championship ranked 61st in the world, only to card a course record-equalling 63 in the first round on his way to a wire-to-wire victory. Belief: Kaymer believed his big moment would come after a difficult time on the course . 'It shouldn't sound cocky or arrogant, but I knew it would come,' Kaymer said. 'I knew that I would play good golf again. There was enough belief there. I just didn't think it would take me that much time to get back where I was, or actually not where I was, I think I play better golf now, I'm more of a complete player. 'It was just a matter of time so it's not a huge surprise to me that I played good golf, it's just a surprise that I won such big tournaments. That's a surprise. But I'll take it.' Kaymer has packed a lot into his career already, shooting a round of 59 on the EPD Tour in Germany, holing the putt to ensure Europe retained the Ryder Cup at Medinah and becoming European number one in 2010. And he has now joined Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Ernie Els and Seve Ballesteros as the only men to win two majors and reach world number one before the age of 30. 'It's very tough to compare yourself to those legends,' Kaymer added. 'When other people want to call me that it's fine, but to win one major is already very nice in your career, but to win two, it means a lot more. Jubilant: Kaymer (left) gets sprayed with water by LPGA women's professional golfer Sandra Gal . 'Some friends called me a one-hit wonder with the majors, obviously in a funny way, and now I can go back and show them this trophy. My next tournament (the BMW International Open) will be in Cologne, where I live, so I will make sure to take that trophy with me. 'It's quite a big proof to yourself that you cannot only win once, but you can win when it matters, you can win big tournaments. And I'm only 29 years old, so I hope I have another few years ahead of me.' With Phil Mickelson, Darren Clarke and Els all winning majors in their 40s recently that is certainly true, and Kaymer should be better equipped to handle the attention second time around. 'Four years ago I didn't know what's happening,' he added. 'I was surprised. I was not expecting myself to win a major at 25. I was surprised about my performance. I was surprised about a lot of things. Form: Kaymer hits from the fairway on the 14th hole during the third round of the US Open . 'I couldn't handle a lot of things that happened in Germany, all the attention that I could get. And then becoming number one in the world, that added another thing and it was too much. To be completely honest, it was very difficult to handle everything and to play good golf. 'The swing improvements was one thing. I knew that I would struggle a little bit for a while, that I won't be in contention every week. But getting so much attention and then all of a sudden, you don't win again. So why is that?

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The decomposing body of a man suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend has been found hanging beside a suicide note admitting to the murder. The remains of Boaz Johnson, 22, of Petersburg, Alaska, were discovered hanging from a tree in a remote forest in Kalapana, Hawaii on January 2, according to Big Island police. He was the only person suspected in the murder of his girlfriend, 25-year-old Brittany-Jane Royal from Tustin, California, and of dumping her body in the ocean last May. At a press conference on Tuesday, police revealed that they found a composition book near Johnson's body in which he confessed to murdering Royal after an argument. Scroll down for video . Killed: The body of Boaz Johnson, right, has been found hanging from a tree in Hawaii next to a note admitting that he killed his pregnant girlfriend, Brittany Royal, left, last May and dumped her body in the ocean . 'A composition book found near Boaz body contained three handwritten pages, Hawaii Police Department Assistant Chief Henry Tavares said, Big Island Video News reported. 'The writer ID'd himself as Boaz Johnson. He confessed to strangling Brittany while involved in a domestic dispute.' Johnson also admitted throwing her body into the sea and indicated he planned to commit suicide, Tavarez said. He added that Johnson used the same type of rope to kill Brittany and himself. Tavarez said that the note indicated Johnson killed himself just days after the murder, but the body was only found months later because it was hanging in a remote area surrounded by lava fields. It was less that two miles from where Brittany was killed. Brittany's father, Ted, and maternal grandfather, Jerry Spahn, spoke at a press conference in Hilo on Tuesday to thank authorities and to reveal how they are coping with the loss of their beloved child. 'I've been looking forward to this day for seven months,' her father began. 'The loss of Brittany is something that we are learning to live with, but throughout this time we've been blessed with support. Heartbroken: Brittany's father, Ted Royal, struggled to hold back tears as he spoke at a press conference about the discovery on Tuesday. 'I've been looking forward to this day for seven months,' he said . Sadness: Her grandfather, Jerry Spahn, said a grandparent never expects to see their grandchild leave this world before them before reading a heartfelt statement from Brittany's mother, Julie . 'One evil act will never outgrow the aloha spirit we’ve received and that Brittany so much loved.' Her . grandfather added: 'When we think back on when we raise our children, . we don't ever think we'll see the day your granddaughter precedes you in . leaving this world. But we have learned to endure that thought and she . still is with us in thought.' He . also read from a statement provided by Brittany's grieving mother, . Julie, who called the time since the murder, 'the most difficult seven . months of our lives'. 'Losing . Brittany to murder at the hands of another is life changing,' she said. 'Life will go on and it will just be different, somehow, less than . complete.' She thanked . people for their support, and said that due to a Facebook group set up . to appeal for information, 'We know that a 25-year-old free spirit . hippie girl could touch so many lives.' She . added: 'Brittany's life was about peace, love - we can all learn from . her. She was searching for the perfect place to call home and to raise a . child. She is now in that ultimate paradise. She is playing her guitar, . singing sweet songs of meoldies, pure and true.' Missed: Brittany's mother Julie, pictured with . her daughter left and as a baby, said Brittany's life 'was about peace, . love, we can all learn from her' in the statement delivered by Mr Spahn . Tragedy: Brittany was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed . A private forensic laboratory confirmed the body found in January was Johnson's through DNA and dental records. Dead: DNA and dental records confirmed a decomposing body as belonging to Bo Johnson . According to an autopsy, Johnson's cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging and the manner of death was ruled a suicide. A forensic document examiner also determined that the writing in the composition book matched Johnson's handwriting. Tavares said that Johnson didn't express remorse for the murder in his note. But 'he was very specific in what he did and in his intention to take his life,' he said. Brittany's . body was discovered by a fisherman on May 28 2013 in waters off . Kalapana and an autopsy revealed she had died from strangulation. She had moved to the island from . California in January 2013 and met Johnson. Just months later they . returned to her family home to break the news: they were expecting a . baby. They also announced their plans for the . future; Brittany said she would work as a yoga instructor while Bo . wanted to give lava tours.'She seemed finally ready to settle down,' her mother Julie Royal told People magazine last year. But . less than three weeks later, Bo failed to turn up to a meeting with a . real estate agent and Brittany didn't call her mother to wish her a . happy birthday. Fight: Johnson wrote in his suicide note that he had strangled Brittany after they got into an argument . Ambitions: She told her family that she was hoping to teach yoga, while Johnson would conduct tours . Days later, a fisherman found her body in waters off the island. It . was determined that Royal, who was 10 weeks pregnant, was strangled . with rope, dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean. Relatives protested Johnson's innocence, insisting he had no money to escape or motive to kill . her. Police said he may have stayed in a local hostel two weeks . after Brittany's death using a pseudonym. According to ABC News, . the manager of the hostel said she recognized his face from pictures but . said he checked-in as Jeffrey Allen. Johnson also allegedly told a friend in a . telephone conversation that he and Royal were in good health after the . woman's body had already been recovered. The phone call, in addition to DNA and other evidence found at the crime scene, made Johnson an early suspect in Royal's murder. Unanswered questions: Brittany's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday, and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent . Bizarre: Last year, signs started appearing around the town saying that Bo was murdered on the lava fields amid racial tensions - strange discoveries that complicated the murder investigation . Authorities . said the evidence showing Johnson was the killer was presented to a . grand jury on December 18, and he was indicted for second-degree murder. But . because the indictment was sealed - to give authorities a chance to . find him - it had not previously been reported. They were unaware at . that point that Johnson was already dead. In December, the families of Royal and the then-missing Johnson said they feared he too may have been murdered. 'We're . definitely concerned that he was also murdered alongside Brittany. It's . very possible her body showed up and his didn't,' Johnson's sister . Sarah Johnson said before Christmas. 'It . just seems all too easy to blame someone who isn't even here, may not . even be alive to defend himself... He has a good heart. We were taught . right from wrong.' To further complicate the case, a news site received the anonymous . letter claiming that Bo had been killed following racial tensions. The note listed specifics about the alleged murder. Scene: Her body was found off the coast of Kalpana, Hawaii near to where the couple had been camping . The writer explained that Bo had . intended to buy land at Kalapana and conduct lava tours without paying . locals a cut of $1,000 a week. 'Haole . had to be killed befor (sic) he buy land... said this message 2 haole, . stay out of Puna - Puna is for the pono,' the note said. In Hawaii, 'haole' is a term used for Caucasians and 'pono' is a Hawaiian word for righteousness. Posters also began to emerge around the town, reading: 'You killed the baby! They killed Bo on the lava flow! Confess!' 'If . he isn't the murderer, that means he's dead,' his sister said last . year. 'So what do we have to look forward to. I keep praying that the . police get their job done and they find this killer.'","The remains of Boaz Johnson, 22, from Petersburg, Alaska, were found hanging in Kalapana on January 2, according to Big Island police .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The aviation industry is under pressure to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide its aeroplanes emit. And now a team of scientists has found that aircraft can become more environmentally friendly by choosing flight paths that reduce the formation of their distinctive condensation trails. Researchers have shown that planes contribute less to global warming by avoiding the places where the thinly shaped clouds, called contrails, are produced - even if that means flying further and emitting more carbon dioxide. Researchers have shown that aircraft contribute less to global warming by avoiding the places where the thinly shaped clouds, called contrails (pictured) are produced - even if that means flying further and emitting more carbon dioxide . Aviation carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 6 per cent of UK total greenhouse gas emissions in 2011. Global Carbon dioxide emissions from aviation were estimated at 630 million tonnes of CO2 for 2005. This is 2.1 per cent of the global emissions of carbon dioxide in that year. Previous research by scientists at the university has shown that, on average, 7 per cent of the total distance flown by aircraft is in cold, moist air where long-lasting contrails can form. Aircraft engines emit a number of other gases and particles that can alter climate - such as oxides of nitrogen and sulphur gases - and their effects might also depend on the route taken. Contrails only form in regions of the sky . where the air is very cold and moist, which is often in the ascending . air around high pressure systems, experts from the University of Reading . explained. They can sometimes stay in the air for many hours, eventually spreading out to resemble natural, wispy clouds. The findings suggest that policymakers need to consider more than carbon emissions in discussions about how to make aviation less environmentally damaging. Recent research has shown that the amount of global warming caused by contrails could be as large, or even larger, that the contribution from aviation CO2 emissions. ‘If we can predict the regions where contrails will form, it may be possible to mitigate their effect by routing aircraft to avoid them,’ Emma Irvine, of the university’s Department of Meteorology explained.

Recent research has shown that the amount of global warming caused by contrails could be as large, or even larger, that the contribution from aviation CO2 emissions. Just like natural clouds, contrails reflect some of the sun’s incoming energy, resulting in a cooling effect, but also trap some of the infrared energy that radiates from Earth into space, to have a warming effect. Detailed calculations indicate that generally the warming effect wins over the cooling effect. ‘Our work shows that for a rounded assessment of the environmental impact of aviation, more needs to be considered than just the carbon emissions of aircraft.’ Just like natural clouds, contrails reflect some of the sun’s incoming energy, resulting in a cooling effect, but also trap some of the infrared energy that radiates from Earth into space, to have a warming effect. Detailed calculations indicate that generally the warming effect wins over the cooling effect. In the study, which is published in IOP Publishing’s journal Environment Research Letters, the researchers estimate that smaller aircraft can fly much further to avoid forming contrails than larger aircraft. For example, for a small aircraft that is predicted to form a contrail 20 miles (32km) long, if an alternative route adds less than 200 miles (322km) onto the route - 10 times the length of contrail that would have been produced - then the alternative route would have a smaller climate impact. For larger aircraft, which emit more . carbon dioxide than smaller aircraft for each mile flown, the . alternative route could still be preferable, but only if it added less . than 60 miles (97km) which equates to three times the contrail length. Just like natural clouds, contrails (pictured) reflect some of the sun's incoming energy, resulting in a cooling effect, but also trap some of the infrared energy that radiates from Earth into space, to have a warming effect . Dr Irvine said: ‘Comparing the relative climate impacts of carbon dioxide and contrails is not trivial. One complicating factor is their vastly differing lifetimes. ‘Contrails may last for several hours, while carbon dioxide can last for decades. In terms of mitigating these impacts, air traffic control agencies would need to consider whether such flight-by-flight re-routing is feasible and safe and weather forecasters would need to establish if they can reliably predict when and where contrails are likely to form. ‘The mitigation targets currently adopted by governments all around the world do not yet address the important non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, such as contrails, which may cause a climate impact as large, or even larger, than the climate impact of aviation carbon dioxide emissions. ‘We believe it is important for scientists to assess the overall impact of aviation and the robustness of any proposed mitigation measures in order to inform policy decisions. Our work is one step along this road.’","Researchers from Reading University have shown that aircraft contribute less to global warming by avoiding places where contrails are made .

"By . Tara Brady . Mother-of-one Jurate Grigelyte, 53, trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of work and accommodation . A woman who exploited vulnerable immigrants to work door-to-door collecting for charity has been jailed for three years. Mother-of-one Jurate Grigelyte, 53, trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of work and accommodation. Many of the workers spoke little or no English and were forced to live in cramped and squalid conditions at various addresses in inner city Bristol. They went to work illegally for Grigelyte’s business collecting donations from members of the public across the south west of England for the Dreams Comes True charity - being paid as little as £25 for a day’s work. The charity, which helps terminally ill children, had outsourced the distribution and collection of bags to subcontractors who then used Grigelyte. Prosecutor Rupert Lowe told Bristol Crown Court: 'Between August 2009 and November 2013 Grigelyte made a profitable business out of coaxing vulnerable Lithuanian adults over to the UK with an offer of work in the charity bag business. 'The offer to work included a certain rate of pay which seems quite reasonable by local Lithuanian standards but was well below the national minimum wage in the UK. 'She told them she would provide accommodation and would pay the cost of their travel from Lithuania. Some victims were told these costs would later be deducted from their wages while others were not told until they arrived.' Mr Lowe said the 11 victims - two women and nine men - felt 'totally dependent' on Grigelyte for accommodation, work and food. 'They had no idea how to interact with the UK authorities and this put them in a position where she could exploit them quite ruthlessly,' he said. The court heard that Grigelyte charged them £50 a week rent for a shared room in a house she also lived in, with people working six or seven days a week. She would also not give them keys to their accommodation and often locked them in, so if they wanted to leave they had to climb through a window. Some of the workers were alcoholics and were fined if Grigelyte caught them drinking. 'The defendant took it upon herself to impose what she called ""fines"" on the exploited workers of a further £50 - two full days’ earnings - if for any reason they did not work on a particular day,' Mr Lowe said. 'After the deductions for travel costs, rent and fines the workers were still theoretically owed money but Grigelyte rarely paid them, save for usually inadequate amounts said to be for food. 'Many of them were reduced to attending soup kitchens for meals. Promises to pay tomorrow or next week were not kept. 'If they demanded the money owed to them they were often threatened with eviction or indeed evicted - without the money having been paid.' Workers were forced to hand out and collect 1,000 clothing bags for the charity Dreams Come True . One victim, Vitalijus Kazilionis, told police he was owed £3,000 by Grigelyte for work he had done for her. 'Vitalijus spoke no English and so felt totally dependent on the defendant,' Mr Lowe said.'She was the boss, controlling the house, the money and the work. On one occasion she threatened to run him over for disobeying her, adding that she didn’t care about anything as she had been to prison before.'Nicholas Clough, defending, said that Grigelyte had herself been trafficked into the UK from Lithuania to work collecting charity bags for £30 a day in Cambridgeshire before moving to Bristol. 'She accepts entirely that she had a central role and that she was responsible for those under her control,' he said. 'If there was loads of money to be made, she didn’t see it and there were others above her in the chain. 'She is remorseful. An aggravating feature is that it was purely for financial gain.' Passing sentence, Judge Martin Picton told her: 'The evidence reveals a depressing picture of vulnerable people coming from Lithuania in the hope of a better life and getting nothing like it. The charity helps terminally ill children and had outsourced the distribution of bags to subcontractors . 'Once here, they were trapped, certainly economically trapped, and within the context of the belief they had when they came here. 'They were in a position where it was difficult for them to move on and that made them easy to control, and made it easy for you to profit from their labours. 'They weren’t prisoners, as sometimes features in cases of this kind, but they were certainly isolated in our society and working and living in a way that civilised people should not be required to do.' Grigelyte, who will be subjected to the Proceeds of Crime Act, was also issued with a Serious Crime Prevention Order indefinitely preventing her from running an unlawful charity bag business. Other victims included mother-of-one Ausra Aleksandravuciene, 29, Vitalijus Kirjanovas, and 32-year-old Olesa Jasinskiene. At an earlier hearing, Grigelyte, of Easton, Bristol, admitted 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of trafficking around the UK and one count of forced labour. Peter Newman, chief executive of the Dreams Come True charity, told The Guardian: 'We are appalled by the crimes for which Ms Grigelyte has been convicted, which we were made aware of a few weeks ago. 'Ms Grigelyte was for a time a subcontractor of our contractor, Byronswell Ltd, to whom we outsource our bag collections.'","Mother-of-one Jurate Grigelyte, 53, trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK .

"By . Misty White Sidell . Most women prefer swimsuits to be as miniscule as possible – providing optimal opportunity to tan – but a new trend seemingly tries to achieve the opposite result. Long-sleeve swimsuits, in which modesty takes precedence over a golden glow, have emerged as summer’s newest beach silhouette. While some boast sun-protecting benefits, not all are as resolute in their functionality. The stylish wetsuit-like one-pieces are popping up everywhere from Urban Outfitters and ASOS to Neiman Marcus; and for beach-goers who want to show off slightly more skin, cropped, long-sleeve rash guards are proving to be the new ‘bikini’ of the season. Scroll down for video . Hot item: Long sleeve swimsuits, like these designed by Dallas-based brand Cover, are part of a growing trend for more full-coverage suits (pictured, left, Cover's collaboration with photographer Grey Malin, $325, and a more typical one-piece $190) The long-sleeve swim styles run the aesthetic gamut from refined, understated elegance to loud, youth-inspired prints. While some promote their styles as a stylish antidote to the sun, with fabric that helps block a full-spectrum of UV rays, others have adapted to the trend with a full focus on fashion. Many of the more tasteful, functional interpretations come from the trend's pioneer - a Dallas-based sun protectant clothing label named Cover. The brand, which first introduced its long-sleeve one-pieces in 2012, is now hawking the styles at Neiman Marcus, as well as a luxury shopping site operated by Harper’s Bazaar. It is the brainchild of Lisa Moore, who was inspired to create the label in 2007 after her little sister developed melanoma at the age of 23. In an attempt to find her sister a chic suit that offered sun protection, Ms Moore quickly realized how few options there were. She set out make sun protection a personal pursuit by educating women how being smart about the sun does not mean skimping on style. After the success of her rash guards and bikini bottoms grew, Ms Moore decided to launch a long-sleeve all-in-one style in five years later – a roll-out that doubled her company’s volume. Striped sensation: Parasol's $176 one-piece claims that it has as much sun protection as an SPF 50 . The designs are produced of a tightly-woven spandex that she says physically blocks sunrays from burning the skin underneath. They have consistently sold out each season – forcing her to reorder multiple production rounds from her manufacturers. While many of Ms Moore's designs are offered in solids, with a contrast-colored waistband, she has also collaborated with contemporary artist Richard Phillips and photographer Gray Malin on a few styles that have been screenprinted with vivid pieces of their work. In promotional shots the suits offer a somewhat nostalgic appearance, that on models, provides a refined silhouette reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn's gamine conservatism. But according to Ms Moore, the suits’ full-coverage sensibility is intended for women of all ages and body types, even extending beyond those with whittled waists. She told MailOnline: ‘It’s actually very flattering…one of the nice things about it for larger size women is you can actually wear your best fitting bikini top underneath and keep it covered up – it provides the support you want and when you have larger arms you can feel more comfortable with this coverage.’ With fit fears abated, Ms Moore’s designs still draw misconceptions about their ability to regulate one’s body temperature. Conventional wisdom would lead one to believe that sitting in the sun wearing full sleeves would provide a sweating experience akin to an outdoor sauna. Funner fare: Seea's $143 one-piece, and Yes Master's cut-out style (now on sale for $19.99 at Urban Outfitters) are reminiscent of designs popular beside the mainstage at this year's Coachella festival . But Ms Moore contests that her suit’s . microfiber fabric adjusts according to the surrounding climate. ‘If you are in a cooler beach climate like northern . California you remain dry and they protect you from the wind. If you are . in a hot climate and it’s slightly damp it keeps you cool,’ she said. Similar suits by American label Parasol, whose all-in-one styles are horizontally striped like a Petit Bateau bodysuit, claim to offer protection that equivocates to an SPF 50. But for all of these designs' built-in functionalities, there are countless more long-sleeve styles that simply appear to be bikini recreations of outfits seen at this year’s Coachella festival. Many retailers are describing their long-sleeve bikini designs as cropped rash guard sets, in reference to the surfboard-burn protecting shirts: lending an edge of athleticism to what is otherwise a pairing of a spandex crop top and underwear. A cropped rash guard being sold at PacSun for $29 is formatted as a cropped baseball tee with a pineapple decal covering each breast. A $175 blue paisley style by Milly may have arms that extend down to the wrists, but its midsection abruptly ends just under the bust line. While they may be appropriate, depending on your taste, for a DJ set poolside in Miami or at one of Thailand’s many beachfront raves, these suits’ classification as ‘rash guards’ are at odds with their actual performance - let alone their ability to block out the sun. Fashion, not function: Many new swim tops, including Milly's $175 creation (left) and LA Heart's $29 design (right), are touting themselves as 'cropped rash guards,' and in doing so abandon the true principle of rash guards to begin with . Flower power: ASOS's $33 bikini top could easily be worn with a mini skirt for a night out . Dr Lisa Airan, a New York-based dermatologist who often makes appearances on Vogue’s weekly best-dressed lists, explained to MailOnline: ‘People wear rash guards on a surfboard because there can be a lot of friction between the board and your skin – you can actually get superficial burns with the paddling if you are out there for hours.’ An avid surfer herself who often ventures to Maui for its massive waves, Dr Airan says that consumers seeking sun-protection need to be cognizant of the sun’s strength in their surrounding environment. ‘I have actually gotten sunburnt through fabric – I still wear a full layer of sunblock underneath the wetsuit,’ she says of her surfing procedures. ‘The sun can be so strong, if you want to wear [these suits] because you are hanging out on the beach and want to look cool, that’s one thing, but if you are surging and out there for hours you can get burned.’","Long sleeve suits are being offered by retailers from Urban Outfitters to Neiman Marcus .

"By . Tara Brady . A man who punched and kicked a 10-month-old puppy which left it with a broken skull has been jailed. Bella suffered a broken front leg, broken back leg, fractured ribs as well as fractures to her skull and spinal vertebrae between July and October 2013. Joseph Eames, 20, of Mexborough, South Yorkshire, was jailed for three months after inflicting a catalogue of injuries on the black crossbreed terrier. Injured: Bella suffered a broken front leg and a fractured skull when she was left in the care of Joseph Eames . Speaking after the case at Barnsley Magistrates' Court, RSPCA Inspector Jennie Ronksley said it was the worst case of cruelty she has dealt with in her career. She said: 'The poor young dog sustained a number of deliberate and horrific injuries over a period of months and was in a great amount of pain suffered at the hands of Mr Eames over a long period of time. 'The RSPCA always applies for a disqualification in such cases and in this case I am happy that the sentence reflects Mr Eames’ crimes. 'Bella is now in a loving new home where she has forgotten about everything that has happened.' The abuse emerged when a PDSA vet raised the alarm after treating Bella over a number of months and recognising the injuries were not accidental. Delicate: Joseph Eames was jailed for three months after breaking two of Bell's legs and fracturing her skull . Eames, previously of Poplar Avenue, Goldthorpe, near Barnsley, admitted inflicting multiple blunt force trauma and physical abuse on the animal. James Gray, defending, said Eames had no previous involvement with the criminal justice system, he suffered from epilepsy and had pleaded guilty at an early stage. He asked for any jail term to be suspended. However, District Judge John Foster said despite the guilty plea he felt the matter was so serious only an immediate custodial sentence could be imposed. He also banned Eames from owning an animal for life. According to the RSPCA Bella has now made a full recovery at her new home.","Beaten Bella suffered broken legs, fractured ribs and fractures to her skull .

Meanwhile, those watching at home spotted hundreds of empty seats during the Spain Netherlands match on Friday and England versus Italy on Saturday. With just hours to go before the Argentina and Bosnia Herzegovina kick-off on Sunday night at the Maracana stadium, tickets were still available online priced at £80. Tickets to see Bosnia Herzegovina play Iran in Salvador next week which cost £110 remain largely unsold.

Those watching at home spotted hundreds of empty seats during the Spain v Netherlands match on Friday . A Fifa spokesman told The Independent that a total of 2.9 million tournament tickets had been allocated with only 9,327 remaining. However, large numbers of tickets distributed to Football Associations around the world often go unsold. England is believed to have sold all 2,500 of its official allocation of tickets for the Saturday game while Italy were only reported to have sold 200 of theirs and so returned the rest. Last week it emerged that more than 1,000 fans were forced to switch seats after stadium building delays and changes to signage compelled a reconfigurement of some seating plans. Emails were sent to 1,376 fans telling them to exchange their tickets for others of the same category but in a different section of several of the 12 tournament stadiums. A FIFA media spokesman said that officials had contacted ticketholders in advance to prevent confusion or delays on match days and that the changes affected only a tiny proportion of the tickets sold. Protesters have been staging demonstrations against Brazil spending £7billion of public money on the tournament.","Switzerland played Ecuador on Sunday in the Arena Brasilia .

'I'd like to say Jack sent it, just . because I look at it as he's gone, but he's still trying to connect with . me,' he said. 'Trying to tell me to move along, to feel better.'

Mr McGraw says he had broken his ankle a week before he received the email on the night of November 21 . The source of the emails remains a mystery for Mr Froese's family and friends who say they have 'accepted them as a gift'. Mr Hart says: 'If somebody's joking around, I don't care because I take it whatever way I want.' Mr Hart replied to the email but has not received a reply. The friends say they do not plan to investigate the source of the emails too closely, as they prefer to see the messages as blessings from Mr Froese than as part of some sort of prank. Mr Froese's mother Patty told the BBC: 'I thought they were fantastic, they were great. 'They made some people happy, they upset some people - but to me, that's keeping people talking about him.' There are services which promise to send emails to one's friends and relatives in the event of one's death, which could explain the strange phenomenon. However, the apparent specificity of the message received by Mr McGraw may rule out this explanation. Watch the video .","Jack Froese died of heart arrhythmia aged 32 .

"By . Kate Lyons . Women who are sick of buying clothes online only to find they don't suit or don't fit when they are delivered might have a new favourite website. Sizeable aims to revolutionise online shopping by featuring models of different body shapes, who model all the items of clothing, so that shoppers can get a sense of what will look good on their shape. The website, which launched last week, was started by Melbourne fashion writer Larissa Thorne, 25,  and the models on the site are all friends of Ms Thorne's who were game enough to have their photographs and their measurements, posted to the site. From left: Lucy, Jess, Andrea, Rosie, Sherena and Susan are the six models featuredon Sizeable, which aims to help women with online shopping . Ms Thorne started the website after she became frustrated trying to explain to her boyfriend how to buy clothes online for her birthday. She said that for most women, buying clothes online was like 'shopping in the dark' and that 'every woman has had a few major online shopping fails' in their history. The six models show what each of the outfits on Sizeable look like when worn by women of different sizes . 'When shopping online I could be anything from a size eight to a size 12. You look at a model [on a clothes website] who is a size eight and you have no idea if that's going to fit you or look good on you. Then you buy it and it'll be gaping at the top, tight on your bust, and it's just money down the drain,' she said. Larissa Thorne started Sizeable after becoming frustrated by the process of online shopping . When shoppers arrive on the Sizeable homepage they are greeted by photographs and measurements of six models who have very different body shapes and wear clothes ranging from size six to size 14. The shopper can then see Sizeable's clothing range modelled by the model who most resembles their body shape, so they can see if the outfit would suit them. 'Generally when shopping online it can be difficult to imagine what clothes would look like on your body,' explains Sizeable's website. 'Comparing your own measurements to those of the models helps you to tailor the shopping experience to your body shape, ensuring you find clothes that flatter your figure.' Ms Thorne thinks also sends a positive message about body image, who are presented with a narrow ideal of beauty. The new website was started by a Melbourne fashion writer who got sick of 'shopping in the dark' online . 'I find shopping online can be really demoralising sometimes. It's left me feeling really down on my body and we want to encourage women to embrace how they look,' she said. 'It's a bit of a no-brainer, we all know there are millions of beautiful women out there who don't look like a Victoria's Secret model.' The website currently features clothing from Limedrop, Ruby Sees All, AD by Haryono Setiadi and Leonard Street and is set to expand in coming months to include items form Keepsake and Black by Geng. Ms Thorne says that the site will soon add three more models – one who is a size 14/16, one with more defined curves, and another who is a size four to six – and next year will look to add men's clothing to the website. The website will soon add three more models to its cast - one with more defined curves, one who is a size 14/16 and one who is a size 4/6 .","Sizeable is a new website started by a Melbourne fashion writer .

"By . Misty White Sidell . At last evening’s ceremony Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dedicated their CFDA win for Accessory Designer of the Year to their former employee and deceased fashion designer Jay Ott. During the twins’ acceptance speech Ashley addressed the audience, which included Anna Wintour and Rihanna saying: 'We would like to dedicate this award to a dear friend of ours and a great fashion designer that we lost this year. His name was James Ott and he was a dear friend of ours and a very big fan of all of you.’ Following a six-week search, Ott’s body was found on May 9 in the East River, close to Pier 4 in Bushwick, Brooklyn – the neighborhood in which he had resided. He was 31 years old. Dedication: During their acceptance speech for the CFDA Accessories Designer of the Year award, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dedicated their honor to their deceased friend and former colleague Jay Ott . Today, following the Olsens’ CFDA speech, several of Ott’s former co-workers and friends posted a YouTube video of the address to Facebook, calling it ‘beautiful.’ The designer’s initial autopsy report released by the New York City Medical Examiner on May 11 was deemed ‘inconclusive.’ Further investigations into the cause of his death are currently underway. Ott had originally been reported as missing on March 24. Soonafter, friends and family banded together to plaster missing person fliers across the city on streetlamp poles and in subway stations. Less than a week after his disappearance, the NYPD uncovered surveillance footage that showed the designer leaving his apartment in Bushwick’s McKibbin Lofts for the last time on March 23 at 4.35am. Successful designer: Ott (pictured) had worked for The Row as well as J.Mendel and fashion holding company The Dock Group . Long search: The designer was originally reported missing on March 24, and following a six-week search his body was discovered in the East River on May 9 . A few hours later, at 5.02am, another video feed shows him about to walk over the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan. They are the last known images of the designer. At the time of his disappearance, Ott was a design director for holding company The Dock Group, where he was helping conceive Rosetta Getty’s debut fashion collection, slated to launch this fall. He had worked for The Row in designer and senior designer capacities from 2008 through 2012. In 2013 he held a brief stint as a senior designer for J.Mendel. A native of Toledo, Ohio, Ott was a graduate of the University of Cincinatti’s College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning.","The Olsens collected the CFDA for Accessories Designer of the Year at last night's awards .

"By . Laura Cox . For a drama about the English aristocracy, it has gathered a surprising cult following in the US. Which explains the fury of American Downton Abbey fans when they discovered they will continue to receive the period drama four months after us. Despite pressure to show the hit show simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic, the Public Broadcasting Service said it would keep the current delay in place. Outrage: More devoted US viewers could turn to piracy to catch Downton four months early, critics warn . Some argued the wait will lead to increased levels of piracy, with fans streaming episodes illegally on the internet as soon as it has aired in the UK to avoid reading spoilers online. In the past, programme makers have been powerless to stop key plotlines from leaking onto the internet before American audiences have had a chance to see them. Even First Lady Michelle Obama has reportedly sought to get her hands on advance copies, asking ITV for season three on DVD ahead of its official release date because she was such a big fan of the show. Fan: Michelle Obama is said to have sought advance copies of the series from ITV to avoid the delay . One frustrated US fan wrote on Twitter: ‘I hate the UK for making Downton Abbey premiere later in America, but I also love the UK for making the show.’ Another said: ‘I don’t understand the advantage to PBS of the delay, do you? Why not air in US and UK at the same time’ The fourth series of Downton, which had its UK premiere in September, only began in the US on January 5. While viewers in this country already know how Lady Mary has coped in the aftermath of her husband’s tragic death, more than 10million US fans are currently tuning in every week to find out . However, PBS president Paula Kerger said he had no plans to screen Downton Abbey’s fifth season any earlier, saying it had found its home in the post-Christmas slot. She said: ‘It would be very hard for me to imagine putting it anywhere else than where it has seemed to have found a very strong audience.’ PBS is experimenting with a shorter delay for BBC hit Sherlock. The latest series aired on the network shortly after it was screened in the UK on New Year’s Day. But the crime drama’s co-creator Steven Moffat said any delay is too long, adding: ‘We can’t expect a show to go out in one country and expect people in another country to wait more than a day. 'The world has changed utterly. Experiment: US viewers will get an early screening of Sherlock as the PBS trials a new shift pattern this year . 'We’re going to be downloading all our television very, very soon, so the idea you have to wait is nonsense.’ PBS has also confirmed the date for the premiere of British sitcom Vicious, starring Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi as a bickering gay couple. It was announced last year that the US broadcaster would show the sitcom, and now PBS says it will air in June.","Critics claim the delay will lead to increased levels of piracy .

"By . Kieran Gill . Follow @@kie1410 . A Spain team spearheaded by Diego Costa recorded the worst defence of a World Cup title in history, and the impending Chelsea striker did little to replicate his La Liga form on the world stage. The 25-year-old, on the verge of a £32million deal to join Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, failed to register a single shot on target, as Vicente Del Bosque's team self-destructed and were dumped out after two Group B defeats. The forward isn't alone, though, as Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o haven't hit the target either, which begs the question - will the Chelsea curse hang over Costa's head, too? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa score a screamer in training for Spain . Form: Diego Costa has failed to replicate his La Liga in the World Cup, as Spain crashed out on Wednesday . Tika-taka: Costa (centre) played 126 minutes for Spain, having two shots, but none were on target . Fernando Torres, Spain (age 30) PLAYED: 68 mins (two games) SHOTS: 0 (SHOTS ON TARGET: 0) SCORED: 0 goals .

Samuel Eto'o, Cameroon (age 33) PLAYED: 90 mins (one game) SHOTS: 1 (SHOTS ON TARGET: 0) SCORED: 0 goals . Statistics from Sportsmail's Matchzone . Costa, an out-and-out striker, is hardly a disciple of tiki-taka football and never matched the Spain way. Indeed, he has been carrying a niggle and was gambled by Del Bosque. And yes, it's ludicrous to condemn a player, who only last season led Atletico to their first La Liga title in 18 years with 27 goals, to failure after less than two World Cup games. But it is hardly the vote of confidence that long-suffering Chelsea fans need. They have, after all, been through it with Torres - a player who has become renowned as a £50m flop since moving from Liverpool four years ago. But in Costa, they look to have found the solution to a problem, should he keep his La Liga form instead of that at the World Cup so far. In 126 minutes for Spain, Costa had two shots - neither on target - and scored none. It is a similar story for Torres. In 68 minutes, the striker had zero shots, zero goals, zero points for the dead rubbers. The same goes for Belgium's Lukaku in 58 minutes, whose form during his Everton loan spell wasn't present at the Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday. In fact, the forward didn't even touch the ball in Algeria's box before being substituted at 1-0 down. Chase: Costa played as an out-and-out striker for Spain but their tiki-taka ways were lost on the forward . Overhead: Costa will look to break the trend of misfiring strikers that Chelsea seem to attract . Switch: Costa is substituted as Fernando Torres comes on, but the Chelsea striker couldn't hit the target .

'And even though you see it on television and you know it's happening when you come here, it's really staggering.' Denise Webb expressed similar sentiments to the station. 'Every room that we lived in, every room that we shared, we just watched it go up in smoke,' she said. 'It's just terrible.'

"By . Misty White Sidell . Two of the U.S.’s biggest denim brands are claiming that yoga pants are encroaching on their territory – and affecting their sales as a result. GAP’s CEO Glenn Murphy and Levi’s President and CEO Chip Bergh have both made comments about how the leggings’ popularization as an everyday item has lessened consumers’ demand for jeans. ‘We’re actually losing consumption to yoga pants,’ Mr Bergh told Yahoo! last week, adding: ‘What used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable to be a yoga pants occasion, and shame on us as a category leaders for letting that happen.’ Taking over: CEOs for both Levi's and Gap have commented that they are losing sales to yoga pants, and the style's affiliated lifestyle continues to gain popularity . The brand’s numbers tell that exact story. Levi’s has experienced a near $3billion fall in revenues since 1995, which have now stalled at $4.6billion. Mr Bergh’s comments were echoed in those made by Mr Murphy during GAP's fourth quarter earnings call in February, reports the Business of Fashion. “As more and more trends start to push women, in particular, towards street attire, we start looking at the balance between the athletic part of our business and the going-out part of the business and… [activewear] is the new denim,’ Mr Murphy said on the call of how GAP plans to integrate a stronger athletic focus into its business. ‘What used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable as a yoga pants occasion’ Specifically, the company (which also operates Old Navy and Banana Republic) is rolling out a massive expansion of Athleta, its activewear brand which has grown from one store in 2011 to 65 stores in 2013. According to Business of Fashion, GAP plans to open 100 more Athleta locations by the end of this year. The brand’s merchandise echoes the polished, slightly upscale feel that one might find at Lululemon, with $50 sports bras and $100 microfiber leggings. The popularity of Athleta, as well as Lululemon and smaller activewear companies like Sweaty Betty make it clear that when working out, a tattered T-shirt and shorts will no longer suffice. Left behind: Levi's (whose factory is shown here) has lost nearly $3billion in profits in the last decade - partially due to the rise of yoga pants . New focus: Levi's CEO says that the company is now focusing on innovation as a way to draw back consumers, and offers its best-selling 'commuter pant' (pictured) which boasts odor and water resistant fabric, as proof that these efforts are working . Adding to the fire are how brands like . Juicy Couture and Urban Outfitters have just rolled out their own . athletic offerings – both indicative of their labels’ mantras with neon . florals for the former and batik prints for the latter. Cumulatively, these brands show how the modern gym experience somewhat replicates today’s ongoing health food boom; which has taken the earthy-crunchy vibe out of nutrition and reproduced its principles with a slick package of $12 juices and $20 kale salads at Jean Georges restaurants and the like. Bottom line: It is now cool to be healthy, and those who gladly shill out on health foods are begging for a wardrobe to match. It represents a new aspirational lifestyle full of $200 private yoga sessions, $100 leggings, and $75-dollar-a-day cleanses, leaving little time or budget for jeans. The denim industry may have initially responded to the trend early-on with the rise of the jegging in 2009, but those styles have since fallen out of favorability following multiple spoofs by everyone from College Humor to American Eagle Outfitters. Permanent fixture: Many occasions in which women once preferred to wear jeans are now solely dedicated to yoga pants, with many wearing the leggings outside the gym . The demand for yoga pants during the work day has become so intensified that in January, Betabrand released a stretchy dress pant that could be worn at a desk or on the floor of an asana room. But what does this all of this mean for denim? According to Mr Bergh, innovation is the way to return to the forefront of consumers’ minds – and cut through the yoga pant clutter. ‘It’s our job to get them back,’ he said of shoppers. The CEO is so insistent on technological advancement, that he has taken a page from Google’s book by opening an innovation lab within Levi’s San Francisco headquarters. Offering proof of its accomplishments, Mr Bergh says one of Levi’s current best-sellers is its ‘commuter’ pants, which were designed for urban cyclists and boast water-repellent, odor-preventing fabric, as well as reflective tape. The brand is about to flood its stores with a new design that utilizes super-soft stretchy jeans as well. Will they make a steadfast appearance at Sunday brunches nationwide? That is yet to be seen.","Levi’s President and CEO Chip Bergh admits ‘we’re losing consumption to yoga pants’

"By . Kieran Corcoran . If you have trouble deciding what to have for dinner, help could soon be at hand – with your food texting to tell you it needs eating. Scientists have developed a computer chip that can be inserted into food packaging and is able to assess when the contents are nearing their use-by date. Computer chips which can assess when food is getting past its sell-by date could soon be inserted into some food packaging, an EU committee of peers has heard. Write caption here . The chips could also potentially alert the owner by sending them a text message telling them they need to eat the food. The new technology could be far more effective than traditional sell-by dates which do not account for the conditions it is being stored in. It could also radically reduce the amount of food which is thrown away. Food waste group WRAP said UK households throw away seven million tonnes of food every year, of which just over four million tonnes is avoidable, costing £12billion. Committee chair Baroness Scott of Needham Market told environment minister Dan Rogerson that one witness giving evidence to the committee in the Netherlands said: ‘We’re quite close to commercial production of a small chip which would go into packaging which would measure the actual deterioration of the rate of food.’ She said that the current convention of the best before date ‘assumes that everything’s equal; it just assumes that you all keep your food at the same temperature whereas this would actually respond to what the real conditions are’, whereas the computer chip could even ‘send you a text to tell you that it needed eating’. Mr Rogerson said: ‘I should be intrigued to know the range and amount of resource that would have to go into producing it.’ Lady Scott added: ‘I’m having enough trouble with my text messages without the fridge texting me. ‘Realistic or not, it’s interesting to see where innovation can lead.’ Fights waste: The development could help combat the 7million tonnes of food wasted annually in the UK . Food waste has been examined closely in recent months. Towards the end of last year, supermarket giant Tesco revealed it generated around 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013. The majority of the waste was made up of fruit, vegetables and bakery items. It found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes. A lot of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were wasted because they were left on display too long. The same EU committee was also told that £2.5billion of food is thrown away by British restaurants, pubs and the wider hospitality sector every year. The waste - totalling 920,000 tonnes a year, enough for 1.3billion meals - costs each individual outlet an average £10,000 annually. Giles Whitely, CEO of SWR waste management, said restaurants should promote the use of doggy bags to reduce waste volumes.","Computer chip can assess when food is getting past its sell-by date .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . In the weeks to come, it would be something special if it was Germany's turn to drool over Roy Hodgson's audacious decision to take the kids to a World Cup. Back in 2010, when Germany humbled England 4-1 in the second round, it felt like a young man's tournament. Three of Joachim Low's forwards - Sami Khedira (23), Mesut Ozil (21) and Thomas Muller (20) - danced around Matthew Upson and John Terry at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. Aged 20, Toni Kroos, now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the game, was on the substitutes' bench. Manuel Neuer (24), Philipp Lahm (26), Jerome Boateng (21), Per Mertesacker (25) taught England a lesson in possession. Lesson in love: Thomas Muller celebrates with Mesut Ozil (left) and Miroslav Klose consoles Wayne Rooney following Germany's 4-1 victory over England in the second round of the 2010 World Cup . On the ball: Bastian Schweinsteiger competes for the ball with Ashley Cole during Germany's resounding 4-0 win . It was shock and awe. They played without fear of reprisal, shredding Matthew Upson to pieces during an extraordinary afternoon for English football. Muller, who was later named the best young player at the tournament, scored twice. Roy Hodgson will not be quite as cavalier, but it would be special if Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Daniel Sturridge, Luke Shaw and, hopefully, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain returned to similar acclaim. We know they have the talent, particularly after outstanding seasons with their clubs. Now they have to make it happen and turn it to their advantage at the world's biggest football tournament. Many England fans are scarred by the performance under Fabio Capello four years ago and it is easy to forget what happened next to Low's breathtaking team. A few days later Germany played even better when they destroyed Argentina 4-0 in the quarter-final with one of the most devastating performances in the history of the World Cup. In the semi-final, those young legs ran out of steam against the eventual champions, Spain. In the build up to this year's World Cup, they have been talking with some conviction about winning it for a fourth time. Low and his players really believe they can emulate the achievements of Sepp Herberger (1954), Helmut Schon (1974) and Franz Beckenbauer (1990). They have a rich history at the World Cup, winning three and losing four finals. They seem certain they will reach another. A few days ago Low, Germany's charismatic coach, was pictured counting four fingers in recognition of the target. It was a bold thing to agree to do and not something you would expect to see from England's head coach Hodgson. Stats of the show: Germany put Argentina to the sword in their thumping 4-0 victory back in 2010 . On song: Germany's brilliant victory was one of the most devastating in the history of the World Cup . Last week Andre Schurrle spoke of the expectancy in Germany and the demand to win another World Cup. It feels like their time is coming. With Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sven Bender, Lars Bender, Khedira and Kroos competing for a place in their midfield, they are a formidable team. Germany have improved. A World Cup in Brazil is a true test for a team's life cycle, particularly for any European team. Let's not forget that Spain, the reigning world and European champions, were beaten 3-0 by Brazil in last summer's Confederations Cup final in the Maracana. But Germany have an outstanding group of players and have had time to mature since 2010. They had another semi-final at Euro 2012, before they were beaten by Italy. The current crop already have course and distance. Hodgson has dipped his toe in the water with his squad, reaching out for some younger players as part of a plan to protect the future of the England team. The head coach hasn't been quite as cavalier, but it is to be hoped that the younger players can still cause something of a stir against Italy on Saturday. Star man: Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling has impressed for England in training ahead of the World Cup . Waiting in the wings: Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge could enhance their reputations . Hodgson is realistic enough to know that the Manaus heat - it was 35 degrees celsius on Tuesday without taking into the account the humidity - will be a huge factor. He cannot realistically expect Steven Gerrard, at 34, to make those lung-busting runs up and down the field in the opening game. Instead the captain will be patrolling in front of the back four and asked to conserve energy and use his experience to bring some of the younger members of the squad in to play. Hodgson's plan is to win the ball back and then make sure that Gerrard and Henderson give it to fresh young legs who can make an impact in the final third. It is sensible planning. They are in a tough pool of teams, but Germany lost one of their group games back in 2010 and it didn't hurt them. England's warm-up matches are no great indicators and it is far too early to start talking about the revolution of English football. For once, though, it would be nice to talk about a revelation.","Germany played without fear during an extraordinary afternoon in 2010 .

Traffic police in Luoyang city in Henan Province did a double-take when they saw six men sharing an electric bike on the road. A picture of the packed bike shows that three of the men were standing on the back, two were seated and one was clinging precariously to the front of the vehicle. Heavy load: Six men balance on a bike in Luoyang city in Henan Province, China. Traffic police did a double-take when they saw the men on the road. They were allegedly en-route to a card game when they were pulled over . Local police spokesman Shaiming Chao said: 'The officers couldn't believe it. In China people transport many items on bikes - boxes, suitcases, cartons, even goats and sheep - but we've never witnessed so many adult males on one machine.' The men were allegedly on their way to a card game when they were pulled over. Officer Chao went on: 'They all thought that it was no big deal - but they had at least ten more kilometres to go when they were stopped. 'Officers issued a citation for dangerous operation of a transport vehicle and made four men get off and walk while the driver and one passenger were allowed to continue on their way.' Lo Meng, one of the passengers forced to walk into town after the incident said: 'We have done this loads of times and police never batted an eyelid before. 'I saw one guy ride down the road only the other day with a fridge-freezer strapped to his back. 'If we got into an accident at least we could look after ourselves and avoid others.  I think the fridge-freezer would be far more deadly than us.'","Traffic police stopped the overcrowded bike in Henan Province, China .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Jupiter’s Great Red Spot - an enormous tempest raging on the side of the planet - was expected to dissipate rapidly, but hundreds of years on, it is still one of the solar system’s most recognisable and mysterious features. Scientists were unsure why the giant spot has prevailed, but now a team of U.S. researchers believe they have solved the mystery, using computer models. They think the vertical motion of the gases holds the key to the Great Red Spot’s persistence by restoring part of its lost energy. The giant storm on the surface of Jupiter (pictured) should have disappeared centuries ago, based on scientists' understanding of fluid dynamics. The turbulence and waves in the Red Spot sap the energy of its winds and it loses more energy by radiating heat . The giant storm on the surface of the gaseous planet should have disappeared centuries ago, based on scientists’ understanding of fluid dynamics. Pedram Hassanzadeh, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, said a number of processes combine to dissipate vortices like the Red Spot. The turbulence and waves in the violent storm sap the energy of its winds and it loses more energy by radiating heat, which should have caused the spot to fade away, Science Daily reported. The spot sits between two strong jet streams that flow in opposite directions and slow down the spot’s spinning, he explained. The duo believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the Red Spot still exists. They said that as the vortex loses energy, the vertical flow draws in hot gases from above and cold gases from below to its centre, which replenishes part of its lost energy. This image was taken by Nasa's Cassini probe . Dr Hassanzadeh said: ‘Based on current theories, the Great Red Spot should have disappeared after several decades. Instead, it has been there for hundreds of years.’ Together with Philip Marcus, a professor of fluid dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, he built a computer model to examine forces that previous models ruled out, such as vertical flows and vortices. Unlike previous models, their model was also three dimensional and in high resolution. ‘In the past, researchers either ignored the vertical flow because they thought it was not important, or they used simpler equations because it was so difficult to model,’ he said. However, they believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the Red Spot still exists. They said that as the vortex loses energy, the vertical flow draws in hot gases from above and cold gases from below to its centre, which replenishes part of its lost energy. Some scientists have previously claimed . the Great Red Spot gets its energy by absorbing smaller vortices, but some . computer models have shown that this does not happen enough to explain . the Red Spot’s endurance. Dr Hassanzadeh and professor Marcus think their research could also explain oceanic vortices (pictured) on Earth, which can last for years, as well as those that contribute to star and planet formation. This waterspout was photographed above the Wadden Sea in the northern Netherlands, in 2007 . Dr Hassanzadeh and Professor Marcus said that while their model does not completely explain the mystery of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, they assume that the absorption of occasional smaller vortices also plays a role in its endurance. They think their research could also explain oceanic vortices on Earth, which can last for years, as well as those that contribute to star and planet formation. They will present their findings at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics on November 25.","Scientists from the universities of Harvard and Berkeley believe vertical motion is critical to explaining why the Red Spot still exists .

Three towns in the county - Blackburn, Blackpool and Oldham - have the lowest house prices in the country. A new study revealed that a deposit of just £14,470 will secure a home in Blackburn, compared to more than £70,000 in London. The cheapest area in Britain: House-hunters only need A £14,470 deposit to buy a property in Blackburn . Britain's most expensive area: Aspiring home owners need an average of £70,000 in savings to buy in London . Homebuyers in Blackpool need a deposit of just £15,707 and while those in Oldham need £16,386. Northern towns and cities dominate a list of areas where property deposits are lowest, including Bolton, Hartlepool, Bradford and Darlington. Analysis of 30 cities and regions in England and Wales shows the average deposit needed to put down is 20 per cent of the purchase price of a property - equating to an average of £26,468. But homebuyers in London need an average of £72,760 in savings or equity to secure a 20 per cent deposit. This is almost double the second most expensive area to buy, Reading, where buyers on average need deposits of around £39,789. Costly: Researchers surveyed 30 cities and regions in England and Wales to find the average deposit needed to buy a property in Britain - currently £26,468 . The research was commissioned by mortgage provider Castle Trust. Sean Oldfield, chief executive officer, said: 'Parents and grandparents are being called on more and more to help children with their first deposit and the proportion of the population owning their own home without family help is likely to continue to fall. 'Aspiring homeowners need alternatives to borrowing from family which is why the Government has launched a range of initiatives including NewBuy and FirstBuy.

But this gadget - which doesn’t have hands or digital numbers - claims to give an ‘enlightening’ sense of your days passing by vibrating every five minutes. Instead of a traditional clock face, the Durr watch gives timely notifications to alert a wearer that they may be spending more - or less -  time than necessary on daily tasks. Scroll down for video... The Durr watch, created by Oslo-based designers, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, gives the wearer timely notifications by vibrating every five minutes . Oslo-based designers, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, created Durr as an experiment, according to Aaron Souppouris at The Verge. After a conversation about how quickly a day at the office had gone, they wondered if there was a simple way they could keep track of time. They created a prototype of Durr in just half an hour and were excited enough by the design to develop an initial run the next morning for sale. The Norwegian duo, who work together under the name Skrekkøgle, said that after wearing the watch for six months, it added a certain rhythm to each day . To their surprise, the first batch of 50 £75 watches sold out in a just over six weeks. The designeres wanted Durr to draw attention to the difference between time as it passes and how we perceive it passing. The design features a colourful fabric circle with a simple brown leather strap and a small button to turn vibration on and off. The Norwegian duo, who work together under the name Skrekkøgle, said that after wearing the watch for six months, it added a certain ‘rhythm’ to each day. Others, however, have criticised it for being nothing more than an expensive ‘egg timer on a strap’. Mr Tveterås said the feedback from other people was it acts a like a countdown to their death ‘which wasn’t the intention at all’. ‘But the memento mori aspect is very fascinating too.’ The original units were constructed on a small scale, pieced together and dyed by hand, but the designers are now planning a much larger production run.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Japanese scientists have launched a sperm bank for endangered animals in the hope of one day recreating animal populations on other planets. Using freeze-drying technology, the researchers have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates and a type of giraffe. The long-term aim of the breakthrough is to take genetic information into space and spread animal populations among future colonies. Japanese scientists have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates (perhaps like the mountain gorillas pictured) and a type of giraffe. The long-term aim of the research is to take genetic information into space and spread animal populations among future colonies . The team at Kyoto University's Institute of Laboratory Animals Graduate School of Medicine, mixed the sperm of the endangered creatures with special preservation liquid. They then freeze-dried it in a way that allows them to store it at just 4 degrees Celsius, according to associate professor Takehito Kaneko, who led the experiment. The temperature is much higher and less energy intensive than conventional ways of storing sperm. Professor Kaneko and his researchers have previously successfully freeze-dried sperm from rats and mice without the use of bulky liquid nitrogen equipment and were able to prove the viability of the spermatozoa up to five years later. The team at Kyoto University mixed the sperm of the endangered creatures with special preservation liquid then freeze-dried it in a way that allows them to store it at just 4 degrees Celsius. The temperature is much higher and less energy intensive than conventional ways of storing sperm (pictured) 'In this way, scientists will be able to obtain genetic information more easily, which means we could help to preserve endangered animal species, he said. Professor Kaneko is quick to point out that there is presently no human application for the technology, but adds it is an avenue that may be explored in the future. 'This may sound like a dream, but we could in future take genetic information into space,' he said, adding it may allow for the transfer of material to help establish animal populations on future colonies. Professor Kaneko and his researchers have previously successfully freeze-dried sperm from rats and mice. The picture shows a rat which delivered oocytes, or eggs, fertilized with freeze-dried sperm stored for five years in ampules (pictured right) More immediately, the technology makes it possible to store sperm at room temperature for short periods, meaning it would be safe in the event of power failures caused by a natural disaster, for example. The challenge now, said Professor Kaneko, is to develop a way to apply the method to the other side of the procreative equation. 'Now we have to use fresh eggs or those frozen conventionally [and] we are studying methods to freeze-dry eggs as well.'","Japanese scientists have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates and a type of giraffe .

Viewers are to get a close-up look at Prince William at work in his role as a rescue helicopter pilot. He features in the four-part BBC reality series which starts next month. Helicopter Rescue follows several search and rescue crews, including those based at RAF Valley on Anglesey where Flight Lieutenant Wales – as the prince is known – is based. In the first episode, William, 30, will be seen captaining his Sea King helicopter to help save a boy who has fallen into an old slate quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog. The unnamed youngster has fallen from an old railway bridge onto an outcrop of jagged rocks below . when the prince is dispatched to lead the rescue. Williams, who is part of a four-man crew, is featured speaking on camera describing his role once the call comes in. He says: 'As captain you’re trying to play out the entire rescue... in your mind and pick up any problems you can foresee, and try and fix them on the ground before you get airborne.' William adds: 'There’s no greater feeling than when you’ve actually done some good and saved someone’s life. I don’t think there’s any greater calling in life... to be able to see a son or daughter’s face when you bring their mother or father back from the edge of death – it’s quite powerful.'

"By . Mark Prigg . For five years, Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has circled the moon, sending back thousands of images of the lunar surface. Nasa has now revealed the most stunning five images of the lunar surface - and has asked the public to pick their favourite. The space agency is planning to create a special site called 'The Moon as Art' - with the winning image as the cover photo. Scroll down for video . Linné (2.2 km diameter) is a very young and beautifully preserved impact crater on the lunar surface.. LROC stereo images provide scientists with the third dimension - information critical for unraveling the physics involved in impact events. LRO entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution. The robotic mission set out to map the moon's surface and, after a year of exploration, was extended with a unique set of science objectives. LRO observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries, creating a new picture of the moon as a dynamic and complex body. These developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system. ''The Moon as Art' collection gives the public the opportunity to see the moon as others have seen it for centuries – as an inspirational muse – but this time from the perspective of being in orbit with a series of 'eyes' that see in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,' said Brooke Hsu, science education specialist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute/Universities Space Research Association in Greenbelt, Maryland. LRO launched from Florida on June 18, 2009. After a four-day journey, the orbiter successfully entered lunar orbit June 23. The winning cover image will be announced June 18 with the release of the full Moon as Art collection of 24 images. Voting is already underway here and will close June 6. In the five years since, LRO has brought the world astounding views of the lunar surface and a plethora of exciting science data. 'LRO has been a remarkable mission with discoveries that have given us insight into solar system history and the inner workings of the moon,' said John Keller, LRO project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 'After five years, LRO continues to make ground breaking discoveries.' The craft will celebrate five years in orbit June 18. LRO entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution. On 10 June 2011 the LRO spacecraft slewed 65° to the west, allowing the LROC NACs to capture this dramatic sunrise view of Tycho crater.  Tycho's features are so steep and sharp because the crater is young by lunar standards, only about 110 million years old. The interior wall of the Clerke crater has many distinct flows of granular material which narrow as they reach towards the floor of the crater. The crater is 7 km in diameter located at 21.7°N, 29.8°E near the Taurus Littrow Valley where Apollo 17 landed on 11 December 1972 and is named after Agnes Mary Clerke. This image features night time temperatures at the Moon's north pole as measured by the Diviner instrument. Areas in blue and purple represent colder temperatures, while areas in orange and red represent warmer temperatures. At any given point in the Moon's orbit, half of the Moon is in daylight, while half of the Moon is in darkness. The Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) sends laser pulses down to the surface of the Moon from the orbiting spacecraft. These pulses bounce off of the Moon and return to LRO, providing scientists with measurements of the distance from the spacecraft to the lunar surface. As LRO orbits the Moon, LOLA measures the shape of the lunar surface, which includes information about the Moon's surface elevations and slopes.","Images released to celebrate fifth anniversary of Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)

"By . Associated Press . Pastor Terry Jones was arrested on Wednesday as he drove a pickup truck towing a large barbecue-style grill filled with kerosene-soaked Korans to a park, where the pastor had said he was planning to burn 2,998 of the Muslim holy books - one for every victim of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Sheriff's deputies in Polk County, Florida, arrested Pastor Terry Jones, 61, and his associate pastor, Marvin Sapp Jr, 44, each on a felony charge of unlawful conveyance of fuel. Jones had said he was heading to a nearby park in Mulberry to burn the Korans on Wednesday, the 12th anniversary of the attacks. Sheriff's officials said that Jones was also charged with unlawful open-carry of a firearm, a misdemeanor, and that Sapp faces a charge of having no valid registration for the trailer. Scroll down for video . Polk County Sheriff's deputies escort Terry Jones (C) to a waiting patrol car in Lakeland, Florida, USA on Wednesday . Both were being booked on Wednesday night into the Polk County jail, according to Sheriff Grady Judd. Mulberry's mayor, along with area elected officials, a sheriff's deputy and several Polk County residents have talked about the need to express love and tolerance for all faiths on September 11. Jones is the pastor of a small evangelical Christian church. He first gained attention in 2010 when he planned to burn a Koran on the anniversary of 9/11, although he eventually called it off. His congregation did burn the Muslim holy book in March 2011 and last year he promoted an anti-Muslim film. All three incidents sparked violence in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The most violent protest happened after the 2011 Koran burning as hundreds of protesters stormed a United Nations compound in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, killing seven foreigners, including four Nepalese guards. Terry Jones sits in the courtroom of the 19th District Dearborn Court for a hearing in front of Judge Mark Somers about Jones' right to protest in Dearborn, Michigan in this April 21, 2011 . Jones has repeatedly ignored pleas from the U.S. military asking him not to stage his protests. Military officials say his actions put American and Western troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere in danger. Mulberry is a town of about 3,000 between Orlando and Tampa and has no connection to Jones' church, which recently moved out of its Gainesville building. An Egyptian court convicted Jones, along with seven Egyptian Coptic Christians, in absentia, sentencing them to death on charges linked to the film. The ruling was seen as largely symbolic because Jones and the other defendants live outside of Egypt. Pastor Terry Jones, (R), talks to a member of the Polk County Sheriff's Department as he sits in his vehicle prior to his arrest after being pulled over while travelling on State Road 37 in Mulberry, Florida on Wednesday. Pastor Terry Jones (L) is handcuffed by Polk County Sheriff's Deputies as he is arrested after being pulled over while travelling on State Road 37 in Mulberry, Florida on Wednesday. Just last week, a federal judge in Michigan issued a summary judgment in favor of Jones and his organization, Stand Up America Now, against the city of Dearborn for requiring Jones and his organization to sign a city-issued agreement in order to speak on public property in front of a Dearborn mosque in 2012. Earlier on Wednesday, about 75 people gathered In Mulberry for an interfaith prayer service to counter Jones' actions. Mike Ghouse, who has organized a 9/11 prayer service in his home state of Texas for nine years, brought his event to Mulberry because of Jones' planned Koran burning. He initially had planned to hold the service in Texas but teamed with a group of Mulberry residents who had organized an anti-Jones Facebook page. 'Everyone has a right to believe what . they believe,' said Ghouse, adding that it was Jones' right as an . American to express himself. Others said that while Jones was free to . say or do whatever he wanted, the people of Mulberry didn't want the . world to think that the residents condone or agree with Jones' views. Said Polk County resident Butch Rahman: 'We don't buy what Jones is selling.'

Hammers striker Carroll endured a frustrating year in the Premier League last season, managing 15 appearances and scoring just twice due to persistent injury problems, potentially costing him a place in the England squad to Brazil. He signed permanently for the East London club last summer in a £15million deal following a season-long loan from Liverpool. The Merseysiders signed Carroll from hometown club Newcastle United in January 2011 for a then record fee for a British player of £35m.","Carroll is holidaying with Mucklow in the US after visiting Dubai recently .

Exchanging heels for a metal-cast claw and toes for an embossed leather beak, a collection of stilettos inspired by birds, called Bird-Witched, will soon be on display as part of a Brooklyn exhibit celebrating innovative high-heels. Japanese shoe designer Masaya Kushino, known for his (creative designs is too vague, say something like ‘known for his wild sense of style), will lend his creations to the Brooklyn Museum's Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe, opening on September 10. The museum-worthy creations boast claw heels and feathered tails, but according to translated reports, Mr Kushino designed them with the complete intention for them to be worn on the street. Meant for walking: Celebrated Japanese shoe designer Masaya Kushino created these designs in collaboration with the Kyoto Costume Institute for its exhibition Future Beauty . Historical appeal: Mr Kushino worked with textile mill Hosoo - which has created luxury kimono fabrics since the 17th century - on the brocade for the shoes . He constructed the shoes' uppers out of feathers, as well as Nishijin brocade – a textile traditionally used for kimono. The brocade was created in collaboration with Hosoo, a Kyoto-based textile mill that has been a luxury supplier of kimono fabrics since the 17th century. Mr Kushino was originally commissioned for the collection by the renowned Kyoto Costume Institute to be included in its travelling exhibit called Future Beauty. The designs were inspired by the work of Edo-period painter, Ito Jakuchu, who died in 1800 and is known for his rooster tableaus. World-traveller: The mini-collection has traveled the globe to spots like London and Munich, and will soon make landfall in Brooklyn . Speaking to the Japan Times about his . creations, Mr Kushino said: ‘Inspired by the rooster in Ito Jakuchu’s . painting, I would like my shoes to resonate with the obsessive creative . energy of that great master of the Edo Period. By collaborating with . HOSOO, which has superb craftsmanship and a tenacious attitude to . achieve the best, I discovered the power of tradition.’ Bird-Witched has already made stops in London, Munich, and Salem, Massachusetts as part of its inclusion in the Future Beauty tour, which began in 2010. In the details: The toe of the collection's most elaborate design was created to resemble a bird's face . Tail feather: The same shoe features a beautifully crafted mane of soft feathers that plume from the heel . Akiko Fukai, the Kyoto Costume . Institute’s chief curator, told the Japan Times of the exhibit, which . celebrates modern Japanese fashion: ‘What has allowed designers to . realize their ideas in the field of materials is the extremely high . level of Japanese dyeing and weaving techniques exemplified by the . master-craftsmanship and the pure spirit of inquiry of Kyoto artisans.’","The creations, made by Japanese shoe designer Masaya Kushino, will go on display at the Brooklyn Museum's Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe, opening on September 10 ."
"By . Mark Prigg . Last tied for the fourth hottest year on record around the globe, it has been revealed. The average world temperature was 58.12 degrees (14.52 Celsius) tying with 2003 for the fourth warmest since 1880, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. At the same time, NASA, which calculates records in a different manner, ranked last year as the seventh warmest on record, with an average temperature of 58.3 degrees (14.6 Celsius). Scroll down for video . The NOAA also revealed the weather events of 2013 . The difference is related to how the two agencies calculate temperatures in the Arctic and other remote places. It is based on differences that are in the hundredths of a degree, scientists said. However, both agencies agreed nine of the 10th warmest years on record have happened in the 21st century. The difference is related to how the two agencies calculate temperatures in the Arctic and other remote places and is based on differences that are in the hundredths of a degree, scientists said. Both agencies said nine of the 10th warmest years on record have happened in the 21st century. The hottest year was 2010, according to NOAA. The reports were released as a big snowstorm was hitting the U.S. East Coast. 'There are times such as today when we can have snow even in a globally warmed world,' said Gavin Schmidt, deputy director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York. 'But the long term trends are not going to disappear ... Quite frankly people have a very short memory when it comes to climate and weather.' Those longer trends show the world has seen ""fairly dramatic warming"" since the 1960s with ""a smaller rate of warming over the last decade or so,"" said Thomas Karl, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. In the past 50 years, the world annual temperature has increased by nearly 1.4 degrees (0.8 degrees Celsius), according to NOAA data. Unlike 2012, much of the worst heat and biggest climate disasters last year were outside the U.S. Parts of central Asia, central Africa and Australia were record warm. A record breaking 2013: Warm areas are shown in red in this NOAA graph showing January¿December 2013 Blended Land and Sea Surface . Temperature Anomalies in degrees Celsius . Only a few places, including the central U.S., were cooler than normal last year. Temperatures that were only the 37th warmest for the nation last year. That followed the warmest year on record for the U.S. Last year, the world had 41 billion-dollar weather disasters, the second highest number behind only 2010, according to insurance firm Aon Benfield, which tracks global disasters. Since 2000, the world has averaged 28 such billion dollar disasters, which are adjusted for inflation. NASA, which calculates records in a different manner, ranked last year as the seventh warmest on record, with an average temperature of 58.3 degrees (14.6 Celsius). Nearly half of last year's biggest weather disasters were in Asia and the Pacific region, including Typhoon Haiyan, which killed at least 6,100 people and caused $13 billion in damage to the Philippines and Vietnam. Other costly weather disasters included $22 billion from central European flooding in June, $10 billion in damage from Typhoon Fitow in China and Japan, and a $10 billion drought in much of China, according to the insurance firm. Usually the weather event called El Nino, a warming of the central Pacific, is responsible for boosting already warm years into the world's hottest years. But in 2013, there was no El Nino. The fact that a year with no El Nino 'was so hot tells me that the climate really is shifting,' said Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist, who was not part of either the NOAA or NASA teams. For many people, global warming first hit the headlines in 1988 when NASA climate scientist James Hansen testified before Congress on a hot summer day. That year ended up the warmest on record at the time. But today, it was knocked out of the 20 top hottest years by 2013.","Average world temperature was 58.12 degrees (14.52 Celsius)

"By . Graeme Yorke . Manchester City have publicly wished Sergio Aguero a happy birthday following the furore caused by Yaya Toure about his importance to the club. Toure's agent claimed that the Premier League champions' failure to celebrate his birthday showed that a lack of respect and claimed the midfielder was very upset. Now, City have sent Aguero a message from their official Twitter account which reads: 'Feliz cumpleaños Sergio! Happy birthday, Sergio! Join us in wishing @aguerosergiokun a very happy 26th today!' Happy Birthday: Manchester City wished Sergio Aguero many happy returns on their Twitter account . Manchester City presented Yaya Toure with a club cake to celebrate his birthday . Toure's future at City was thrown into doubt when he backed claims from his agent Dimitri Seluk that he was upset by City's treatment of him. Seluk said: 'There is a big possibility Yaya will leave this summer. He is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don't care about him. It was proof. 'They can say whatever they want, ""Oh we like him but we forgot"". Forgot? About Yaya? The player who helped you to be two-time Premier League champions? The guy who helped you win the FA Cup and League Cup? 'In a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good wishes. But when you win the title and two days later you have a big party to celebrate the title and nobody comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want? 'If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool.' It later emerged that City had celebrated Toure's birthday by presenting him with a cake on a flight to Abu Dhabi at the end of the season. Toure, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, was later linked to Paris Saint-Germain but has played down speculation about a transfer.

"By . Paul Collins . Niko Kovac will give his Croatia players all the downtime they need to prepare for a World Cup showdown with Mexico after overseeing a four-goal dismantling of Cameroon. Croatia responded in the best possible way to their opening-night defeat to tournament hosts Brazil by putting Cameroon to the sword in Manaus - Mario Mandzukic scored twice in a comprehensive 4-0 win for Kovac's side. While the Africans are eliminated from the finals before meeting Brazil in the last round of Group A games, Croatia are tasked with plotting Mexico's downfall. Double salvo: Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic scored twice for Croatia . The Vatreni must beat Miguel Herrera's side in Recife on Monday to reach the last 16, and Kovac is all too aware of the size of the task after watching Mexico hold Brazil to a goalless draw earlier this week. 'The match against Mexico will be like a final,' he told Croatian television station HTV. 'We have to get some rest, because a serious opponent awaits. 'Mexico are strong, but so are we. 'The Mexico players are very patriotic, just like us, and they have a great team spirit. 'They play some aggressive football with a lot of pressing. They are strong going forward, but also have some weaknesses in defence, like Brazil showed us.' Brothers in arms: Croatia manager Niko Kovac (right) alongside assistant and brother Robert (centre) Ivica Olic opened the scoring against sorry Cameroon shortly before half-time at the Arena Amazonia, with Ivan Perisic and Mandzukic putting the result well beyond doubt following the interval. Kovac was naturally satisfied with the overall performance and final score but admitted to having harboured early concerns over his team's slow start in the rainforest. The 42-year-old added: 'We weren't on top of our game in the opening five to 10 minutes and Cameroon created some chances. 'But then we found our rhythm. Olic scored and that opened up the game for us. We could have scored even more goals. 'I can only congratulate the players, though. They won in very difficult conditions. It was hard to sit or stand, let alone run around on the pitch.' Vital: Kovac felt the game swung Croatia's way after veteran Ivica Olic scored (above) Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic was suspended and unable to lead the line during Croatia's 3-1 defeat to Brazil last week and revealed he had used the enforced time on the sidelines wisely. 'I had trained hard for this one so that I could put in a strong performance,' he told FIFA.com. 'I should stress that this was a team victory, though; goals are the reward you get for great teamwork. 'I don't think we should get too obsessive about goals - the overall objective is winning the game, after all. 'There's still some room for improvement for this team.'

Yet well-travelled German tactician Finke played down the impact of the dismissal, saying: 'It's a tough result to take. 'It's always difficult to play with 10 men, but that's still no excuse for tonight's performance.

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Chris Brooke . These days, it’s known as the quintessential Irish drink and is a firm favourite in British pubs. But Guinness almost faced a very different fate – as the tipple of choice for Nazi Germany. These draft posters, found by former brewer David Hughes and dating back to 1936, reveal the firm’s planned advertising campaign for the Third Reich. Drawn by John Gilroy, who produced most of the company's classic advertising, the collection was produced in 1936, the same year as the Berlin Olympics.

The images, which are now thought to be worth £1.2million, feature in a new book, Gilroy Was Good For Guinness, written by former Guinness brewer David Hughes. In the book is a memo from executives at the drink maker to SH Benson, their longtime advertising partner, which shows that the Irish and London offices did not agree on the campaign.

He said: 'In 1936, people were a bit naïve about Nazi symbolism and what it came to mean. 'People were starting to believe the Germans were dangerous.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The cry of an elephant is iconic, as it raises its long trunk and lets out a loud, instantly recognisable screech. But the mammals also produce a much lower-frequency rumble, beyond the reach of human hearing, that is believed to be a language. Now, a team from New York is analysing more than 300,000 hours of audio of this secret communication to decipher what the various grumbles mean. Researchers from The Elephant Listening Project in New York are analysing more than 300,000 hours of low-frequency rumbles made by elephants, recorded using infrasonic microphones placed in the rainforests of Central Africa. They're hoping to decipher the mammal's secret language . Elephant vocalisations, or calls, range from 90 to 117 decibels - the equivalent to heavy truck traffic or a construction site. Low-frequency sounds travel well over long distances and this means an elephants’ infrasonic call means they can stay in contact as they move separately over large areas of savannah or forest. Playback experiments found that free-ranging savannah elephants respond to one another’s calls over up to 2.5 miles (4km) during daylight hours. Elephants produce sounds in much . the same way as humans do, by using their vocal folds to generate frequency and then modifying the sound’s structure by . ‘filtering’ it with the shape of their mouth cavity and the nasal . passages. However, the nasal passage of an elephant is very different to a human's and gives an extra six feet of ‘filter’ to use . if they want to. The recordings were taken by researchers from The Elephant Listening Project with the Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York. Set up in 1999, the project has placed highly-sensitive infrasonic microphones within the rainforests of Central Africa. Lead researcher Katy Payne said she was inspired when she first ‘felt’ the low-frequency rumbling communication of two Asian elephants – a male and a female – in Portland Zoo in 1984. The sounds the creatures make are usually below the range of human hearing and carry over large distances. Early research focused on communication between savannah elephants, but this has been shifted to the forest elephants of Africa. The prominence of very low frequencies is a defining characteristic of all three species of elephants, according to the project. Sounds are generally considered to be infrasonic if their frequency is less than 20Hz -the lower limit of human hearing. 'As we consider the size of elephants’ sensory world, the timing as well as the frequency and power of their vocalisations turns out to be important,’ said the project’s website. This video records the moment when elephants Kate and Tess were reunited after being separated for months. They use a variety of high- and low-frequency rumbles to express their feelings about seeing each other again and project is looking to identify the different types of communication . This spectrogram reveals the readings of rumble vocalisations made by forest elephants, recorded by the project's microphones. The frequency, or tone, scale runs from 0 to 420Hz. The blue line near the bottom is the lower limit of human hearing sensitivity . ‘On a typical dry season evening in the savannah a temperature inversion forms, potentially increasing the listening area of elephants as much as ten-fold. ‘In light of this fact it is interesting that savannah elephants make most of their loud low-frequency calls during the hours of best sound propagation. 'We do not know whether this is an innate or opportunistic response to fluctuations in the size of their communication area, but in either case it is clear that as the area shrinks and expands, so does the network of potential associates and mates.’ The project's research has also discovered that elephants speak with two voices. They either talk through their mouths, or from the end of their trunks, and the rumbles produced by the two regions are different. As a result, the project now wants to discover if they are used for different types of communication . This finding offers a solution to mysteries about elephant societies, in particular how males find females for breeding. It also gives an insight into the ability of separated family groups to coordinate their movements for weeks at a time without losing communication or eating the same scarce resources.

If clothes could talk, this particular array would exhale a cloud of cigar smoke, adopt an arrogant smirk, and declare: ‘Greed is Good!’ Wearing colourful braces, silk patterned ties, bright socks, expensive loafers, and gelled-back hair, groups of boisterous office workers stride through central London. The men chain smoke, or carry brick-sized mobile telephones last seen in the possession of Gordon Gekko, the rapacious financier at the centre of the film Wall Street. Scroll down for video .

The women opt for fur coats, garish scarves, and striped ties chosen in apparent homage to Jules Van Patten, the money-obsessed, cocaine-snorting female banker played by Demi Moore in cult Eighties movie St Elmo’s Fire. This very public celebration of City bonus culture took place shortly after 4pm on Monday outside the offices of Spencer Ogden, a recruitment and headhunting firm which specialises in the oil and gas sectors. The company is among a wave of London businesses — including banks, law firms, stockbrokers, and hedge funds — organising fancy-dress screenings of Martin Scorsese’s latest epic movie The Wolf Of Wall Street. Roughly 150 employees were asked to show up in ‘power suits and plenty of hair gel,’ according to Simon Taylor, Spencer Ogden’s development director, who described the dress code as ‘a bit of fun’. The men chain smoke, or carry brick-sized mobile telephones while the women opt for fur coats, garish scarves, and striped ties . Colleagues dress in their 'power suits' ahead of watching The Wolf on Wall Street . So boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in London have trebled private hire prices . They spent the next three hours watching Scorsese’s biopic of Jordan Belfort, a spectacularly corrupt American stockbroker whose appetite for sex, drugs, and money saw him dubbed: ‘The most debauched banker of them all.’ ‘Our business is all about sales, and essentially so was Belfort’s,’ said Taylor beforehand. ‘So when we watch this film, we’ll basically see someone doing what we do every day; aside from all the illegal stuff, of course. ‘The sales techniques he used are the same. The way he taught staff to close a deal. The timing of when he spoke or kept his mouth shut. That’s why we are fascinated by Jordan Belfort: he was a hell of a salesman.’ Wearing colourful braces and silk patterned ties workers left their office to watch the film . Belfort was also a prodigious crook. Nominated for five Oscars, the film tells how he made tens of millions of dollars from illegal stock sales in the Nineties, spending most of it on yachts, cocaine, prostitutes, sports cars, and wild parties. Given these famous excesses — of which more later — not to mention the fact that Belfort was eventually imprisoned for fraud and money laundering, most viewers regard The Wolf Of Wall Street as a cautionary tale. Yet, in shameless disregard of post credit-crunch public opinion, a very different attitude appears to prevail in the City of London. Here, as these pictures suggest, the spectacularly immoral Belfort, played in the film by Leonardo  DiCaprio, is well on his way to becoming a folk hero. So boundless is enthusiasm for his story that cinemas in London have trebled private hire prices for screenings of the film. ‘We’ve never previously seen anything like the level of interest that we’ve seen in this film,’ says Will Swannell, CEO of Hire Space, one of London’s leading venue hire firms. ‘There has been a flurry of bookings. The usual price for a movie screening is in the region of £1,500. For this film, the going rate has risen to £4,500. It’s straightforward supply and demand.’ ‘It’s all a bit crazy,’ added an events manager at one City insurance broker. ‘The prices have sky-rocketed. I had to call a huge number of big cinemas before finding somewhere free.’ Highlighting the level of yuppie interest in The Wolf Of Wall Street was a viral email doing the rounds of City firms last week. It noted that the release of Wall Street (1987) and its sequel Money Never Sleeps (2010) coincided with major falls in stock indices. This week, by contrast, the FTSE has been on the verge of hitting an all-time-high. No doubt there were, therefore, happy faces in cinemas at The Barbican, Greenwich and Canary Wharf, as well as London’s West End, where finance houses held screenings of The Wolf Of Wall Street over the weekend. It seems there were also wide smiles in Stockholm, where the Scandinavian bank Nordea booked out a 140-seat cinema, according to a report carried by Reuters. Most City firms celebrating The Wolf Of Wall Street in London have been keeping a low profile, doubtless hoping to avoid negative PR.

However, those known to have held events include Sunrise Brokers, which invited clients to the upmarket Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, and FTI, a U.S. business consultancy which has hired out the Odeon in Covent Garden for 180 guests and 40 staff. ‘It’s a film about our industry, so of course everyone wants to see it,’ says one guest of Sunrise. ‘I’d estimate that 90 to 95 per cent of my colleagues have already been. It’s a hot ticket. ‘Despite everything that’s happened to the finance industry over the past five or six years, the City’s still a pretty brash place, and there’s huge nostalgia for the days of red braces and slicked-back hair.’ Many guests at private screenings of The Wolf Of Wall Street might have reflected on the ways that their working life imitates art. Lavish: Leonardo Di Caprio in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street . The film centres on the raucous offices of Belfort’s firm Stratton Oakmont, where male staff outnumbered females by roughly ten to one, and where debauchery wasn’t so much encouraged as mandatory. Scorsese shows, among other things, how Belfort spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff, who used cocaine, crack, marijuana, morphine, and the sleeping pill Quaaludes on an almost daily basis. Office pets included a nappy-wearing chimpanzee, a Macaw trained to say “f*** off!” and a goldfish which ended up being eaten by an executive. At the end of trading days, employees would hold dwarf-tossing contents. Scorsese shows how Belfort spent tens of thousands of dollars each month hiring prostitutes for his 1,000 staff . Most City firms celebrating The Wolf Of Wall Street in London have been keeping a low profile . At Spencer Ogden, illegal behaviour is of course never tolerated. However — much like at Stratton Oakmont — staff are encouraged to work hard and play hard, in a devotedly eccentric environment. Instead of a carpet, the firm’s main office is covered by astro-turf. Punch bags hang from the ceiling to help relieve stress, and employees who close deals are encouraged to take celebratory bike rides around the floor. Outrageous: Office pets included a nappy-wearing chimpanzee and a Macaw trained to say 'f*** off!' Staff who hit sales targets for three straight months are meanwhile allowed to spend a week working from an office the firm keeps in Ibiza (‘and no, we don’t expect them to do very much work,’ says Taylor). ‘We are a professional environment. We’d frown on people coming in on Friday morning with cocaine all over their face. They’d be sacked,’ he adds. ‘So you can’t say that Jordan Belfort is a hero to us. But he is, perhaps, an anti-hero.’ The headquarters of Goldman Sachs in lower Manhattan, just a four minute walk from the movie theatre where bankers were treated to a free screening of The Wolf of Wall Street in December . Bankers in New York City were treated to a free screening of ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ last month, with similar results to the scenes in London. The advanced free screening of Martin Scorsese’s movie was held at the Regal Battery Park theatre, a four minute walk from Goldman Sachs’ headquarters at 200 West Street in Manhattan. The building is so close in fact that you can see Goldman’s trading room floor from the cinema’s escalator. Steven Perlberg of the Business Insider, described the experience of watching the film amongst a finance-heavy audience as ‘disturbing’, who cheered every cocaine-addled move of Leonardo DiCaprio’s character Jordan Belfort. ‘There’s a lot of talk about how Wall Street has “changed” since the financial crisis,’ he wrote.‘But you wouldn’t necessarily know that from what these guys were cheering at. ‘When Belfort – a drug addict who later attempts to remain sober – rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers.’ He added that the worst part of watching the film was when Belfort is enlisted by the authorities to implicate others at his firm but attempts to save his deputy by writing on a piece of paper that he is wearing a wire. ‘And the crowd goes wild. Don’t rat! Stand by your firm!’","Public celebration of City bonus culture took place outside Spencer Ogden .

"By . Derek Lawrenson At Pinehurst . Martin Kaymer added his name to a decidedly illustrious league of gentlemen when he completed his domination of the 114th United States Open by wrapping up an overwhelming eight stroke victory on Sunday. The absence of any hysteria on the course meant a prized addendum to the history books off it as he became just the fourth European golfer in the last 100 years to win two majors by the age of 30. The other three were Seve Ballesteros, Tony Jacklin and Rory McIlroy. The 29 year old from Dusseldorf is also just the third golfer in the last 30 years to lead a major from start to finish, with the others being McIlroy and Tiger Woods. Anyway you look at it, therefore, this was right up there with the great performances and continues the recent domination of America’s national championship by the cream of European golf.

Asked what advice he had for Fitzpatrick, Oosthuizen started laughing and said: ’He hits it so well he should be advising me!’ You could see what it meant to Fitzpatrick to be linked with Jones’s . record. ‘I was told just before I went out to play and it really is an . honour,’ he said. For his . parents Russell and Susan it’s back to real jobs in the real world . tomorrow. Asked whether Matt still lived with them, Susan replied: ’Of . course he does.

"By . Damien Gayle . Sequenced: The first full Neanderthal genome has been sequenced and made available free-of-charge by the Max Planck Institute . The first complete Neanderthal genome sequence has been completed and made available free-of-charge to researchers across the world. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, have made the data available as a free download from their website. The group will present a paper describing the genome later this year. 'But we make the genome sequence freely available now to allow other scientists to profit from it even before it is published' said Dr Svante Pääbo, who led the project. Dr Pääbo and his colleagues in 2010 presented the first draft of the Neanderthal genome from data collected from three bones found in a cave in Croatia. They have now used a toe bone excavated in 2010 in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia to generate a high-quality genome from a single Neandertal individual. The Leipzig team used sensitive techniques developed there over the past two years to sequence every position in the genome about 50 times over, using DNA extracted from 0.038 grams of the bone. The analysis of the genome together with partial genome sequences from other Neanderthals, and the genome from a small finger bone discovered in the same cave, shows that the individual is closely related to other Neanderthals in Europe and western Russia. Remarkably, Neanderthals and their relatives, Denisovans, were both present in this unique cave in the Altai Mountains on the border between Russia, China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. In the 2010 draft version of the Neanderthal genome, each position was determined, on average, once. In the now-completed version of the genome every position was determined on average 50 times over. This allows even the small differences between the copies of genes that this individual inherited from its mother and father to be distinguished. This family tree relates this genome (top) to the genomes of Neanderthals from Croatia, Germany and the Caucasus as well as the Denisovan genome recovered from a finger bone also excavated at Deniosva Cave . The Neanderthal genome was sequenced thanks to the discovery of just a toe bone, and it was an even tinier fragment of finger that allowed the same researchers to map out the entire genetic code of Denisovan man. Evidence suggests that the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans who lived in Siberia around 50,000 years ago, had dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes. The existence of the Denisovans was only confirmed in 2010, but previous research has already suggested they co-existed with Neanderthals and interbred with our own species, Homo sapiens. Scientists made the discovery after studying DNA from a piece of finger bone and two molars found at same Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia as the Neanderthal toe bone. Because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone, Svante Pääbo and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the DNA so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing. This method allowed the team to generate an extremely thorough genome sequence (30X), similar in quality to what researchers can obtain for the modern human genome. The scientists found that the Denisovans were most genetically similar to Australian aborigines and island populations from south-east Asia. The Leipzig group has made the entire genome sequence freely available for the scientific community over the internet. 'The genome is of very high quality', . said Dr Kay Prüfer, who coordinated the analyses. 'It matches the . quality of the Denisovan genome, presented last year, and is as good as . or even better than the multiple present-day human genomes available to . date.' Dr Pääbo added: 'We are in the process of comparing this Neanderthal genome to the Denisovan genome as well as to the draft genomes of other Neanderthals.' 'We will gain insights into many aspects of the history of both Neanderthals and Denisovans and refine our knowledge about the genetic changes that occurred in the genomes of modern humans after they parted ways with the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.' The project, part of 30 years' worth of efforts by Dr. Pääbo's group to study ancient DNA, was made possible by financing from the Max Planck Society. The bone used to sequence the genome was discovered by Professor Anatoly Derevianko and Professor Michael Shunkov from the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2010 during excavations at the Denisova Cave. The cave is a unique archaeological site which contains cultural layers indicating is has been occupied by humans and our ancestors from as early as 280,000 years ago.","Scientists from Germany's Max Planck Institute sequenced genome from toe bone found in southern Siberia .

"By . Wills Robinson . Overweight Brits are being given disabled parking permits – because they can only walk short distances. People with a disability have to undergo a series of medical assessments before they are considered eligible for a ‘blue badge’. But the guidelines mean people who are obese can apply for the passes if their weight limits their ability to walk. Passes: People applying for 'blue badges' have to go through stringent tests before they are approbved . The revelations come the same week a shock report estimated half of Britons will be obese by 2050.Critics have called for more stringent tests to be carried out to decide if an applicant’s weight issues are self-inflicted. Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘Councils have got to do some pretty good digging to make quite sure that they do not exclude fat people who are fat through no fault of their own. ‘I think there are a lot of scroungers who will want to have buggies, but there are a lot of people who have a genetic problem which has made them fat. Worrying: A report released last week suggested half of the British population would be obese by 2050 . ‘I think this is wasting money and its disastrous that you should be dealing these passes out to people who shouldn’t actually be receiving them. ‘They have got to decide the difference between one and the other. ‘I don’t think councils should be giving these passes out as the obesity problem gets worse. 'That is pandering to an individual who should be taking their own responsibility and getting themselves in shape. 'The ones who can be guaranteed these passes should be having a letter from their GP or some kind of medical practioner justifying that they should have one (a pass), because they have a condition which makes them the size they are. ‘I am afraid we have to be brutal about it and they get driven by someone who can actually ferry them around. ‘There are 2million people that are deserving of bariatric surgery. ‘Are you going to give 2million people free passes all over the country? ‘Local councils have to arrange for weight management courses and put these people on weight management courses, which are considerably cheaper. ‘No just for the local council, but to the local medical services. ‘It is opening the box for further abuse of systems which deserving people need. ‘The people who are very fat and need this kind of thing, by virtue of their disposition or other medical problems, cannot maintain easily a healthy weight. ‘ . The abilities of local councils to issue badges to those who are seriously overweight was obtained in a Freedom of Information request. Evaluation: Applicants have to go through stringent medical tests before they are given a parking permit . Walsall Council revealed they had given out passes to applicants who had listed obesity as a medical condition. Coventry . City Council also disclosed that applicants had put down obesity as one . of their reasons behind asking for a blue badge. The . Department for Transport guidelines state a person can apply for a . permit if they have a 'permanent and substantial disability that causes . inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking'. Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Councils need to be careful when giving out expensive permits ensuring they only go to those who really need the help. ‘Obesity costs taxpayers a fortune and the best cure is exercise and diet - a bit more walking might be the best prescription available. ‘When people are found abusing the scheme it’s vital this is not ignored in order to maintain faith in the badge system.’ More than a quarter of adults (26 per cent) are obese, up from just 8 per cent in 1980.In 2007, an alarming government review warned that by 2050, obesity would affect half of all adults and cost the economy £50billion a year. Cllr Chris Towe, portfolio holder for resources at Walsall Council Coalition said: 'All assessments are undertaken by an independent mobility assessor in line with Government legislation on 1 April 2012.

James, 23, lives with his mother near Southampton and spends his spare time scaling cranes and radio towers. A new documentary shows him teaming up with the thrillseeker, donning camera helmets and crawling fast up the side of the bridge, which carries several lanes of traffic over the Dnieper River in the Ukranian capital Kiev. They reach the apex of the bridge and Mustang Wanted rubs his hands together, preparing them for the big stunt. He and James then secure their grip - before Mustang dangles perilously over the side of the bridge, one slip from certain death. The film follows James near his Southampton home, climbing 500ft structures, and on an out-of-the-ordinary pilgrimage to the Ukraine - said to be the spiritual home of urban free climbing.

"By . Ian Drury . Remarkable: Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick, 38, has survived 17 bomb blasts, escaping with only cuts and bruises . He's known as ‘the Bomb Magnet’ after surviving 17 explosions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Remarkably, Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick Hyde is virtually unscathed, having suffered just a few cuts and bruises. And no matter how close the call, the 38-year-old has written off every roadside bomb and rocket as an ‘occupational hazard’. Yesterday the unflappable Warrant Officer Class 1 received a gallantry medal for saving his colleagues’ lives while he lay wounded after his 17th brush with death. The soldier, who serves with the 4th Battalion The Rifles, was presented with his Military Cross by the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. He received the award for helping to co-ordinate the evacuation of troops injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) that had knocked him to the ground in Helmand on July 19 last year. Speaking after receiving his medal, WO1 Hyde said: ‘There are no lucky charms. When you operate in Sangin, as I have done, it becomes a bit of an occupational hazard up there. I’m just fortunate enough that I’ve survived. ‘We’re trained to do what we do and it becomes second nature. You work together as a team and regardless of the threat there’s a job to be done at the end of it.’ All but one of the 17 explosions took place in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand where more than 100 service personnel perished. The father of two, from Cheltenham, was recognised for his bravery when he was among 100 British troops deployed to Sangin to help Afghan forces repel a major Taliban offensive. After coming under fire, the Afghan general leading the operation and Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bewick, the British officer advising him, sought refuge in a mud-walled compound. When WO1 Hyde reached the scene, he suspected it was a trap. ‘It had significant battle damage on it and I know the tell-tale signs of where IEDs are planted by insurgents,’ he said. ‘I wanted [Lt Col Bewick] out of there, and the only way was to go and get him.’ As he waited for Lt Col Bewick in a narrow alleyway, an Afghan soldier walked past him and triggered a concealed bomb just a few feet away. WO1 Hyde said: ‘The Afghan soldier lost a leg and I got some fragmentation to my hand, neck and stomach – superficial stuff, but I was lucky. Unflappable: The Warrant Officer Class 1 received a gallantry medal from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace yesterday for saving his colleagues while he lay wounded . ‘It bloody hurt. I thought I had lost my leg, but fortunately it was still there once the dust had settled.’ Despite lying wounded on the ground, he arranged for troops to be removed by helicopter and avoided any more casualties. His citation said he had shown ‘personal gallantry’ and an ‘immense sense of responsibility’. WO1 Hyde had already survived 11 IEDs in vehicles, and two on foot patrol. His Mastiff armoured troop carrier was twice hit by rockets, and he was also hit by an IED while serving in Iraq. The soldier, who has a son Henry and daughter Evie, said: ‘My family don’t want me to go back.’ Proud: The father of two, from Cheltenham, pictured holding his military cross,  was recognised for his bravery when he was among 100 troops deployed to Sangin to help Afghan forces repel a major Taliban offensive .","Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick Hyde escaped blasts with minor injuries .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Children who witness domestic violence often bear emotional scars, but now a study has found that seeing family members being hurt can also scar a child’s DNA. Young people in homes affected by domestic violence or suicide have significantly shorter telomeres - or 'caps' on their genes - than those in stable households. Such genetic damage could also increase the child’s risk of heart disease, obesity and other problems as they grow up. Scientists from Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans discovered that children affected by domestic violence (stock image picutred) have significantly shorter telomeres, which are the caps at the end of chromosomes that keep them from shrinking when cells replicate . Telomeres are the caps at the end of chromosomes that keep them from shrinking when cells replicate. Their role is to protect the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes. Over time, due to the division of cells, the telomere ends become shorter, but they are replenished by an enzyme. Shorter telomeres are a cellular marker of ageing. Shorter telomeres are also linked to higher risks for heart disease, obesity, cognitive decline, diabetes and mental illness. Scientists from Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana, found that the more fractured families are by domestic violence or trauma, the more likely that children will bear the scars down to their DNA. Telomeres are the caps at the end of chromosomes that keep them from shrinking when cells replicate. Shorter telomeres are linked to higher risks for heart disease, obesity, cognitive decline, diabetes and mental illness. For . the study, researchers took genetic samples from 80 children aged . between five and 15 in New Orleans and interviewed parents about their . home environments as well as their childrens' exposure to traumatic . situations. Shorter telomeres (pictured in orange) are linked to higher risks for heart disease, obesity, cognitive decline, diabetes and mental illness. The changes were seen in children from homes affected by domestic violence, suicide or the incarceration of a family member . ‘Family-level stressors, such as witnessing a family member get hurt, created an environment that affected the DNA within the cells of the children,’ said lead author Dr Stacy Drury, director of the Behavioural and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Laboratory at the university. ‘The . greater the number of exposures these kids had in life, the shorter . their telomeres were - and this was after controlling for many other . factors, including socioeconomic status, maternal education, parental . age and the child’s age.’ The . study, which is published in the journal Pediatrics, found that . traumatic family events had a more damaging effect on young girls – who . were more likely to have shortened telomeres – than boys. The research suggests that intervening in a child’s poor home life is important in reducing the biological impacts of adversity.","Scientists found the more fractured families are, the more likely it is the children will be altered genetically .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . In 1940, a naturalized American citizen of German birth set out in a patriotic exploit to work as the FBI's first double agent and bring to justice a varied cast of traitors who were stealing technological secrets to give German bombers an upper hand in their invasion of Europe. Peter Duffy's new book 'Double Agent: The First Hero of World War II and how the FBI Outwitted and Destroyed a Nazi Spy Ring', details the work of William Sebold, an intensely patriotic man who worked with the FBI to infiltrate the Duquesne Spy Ring, a spy ring operating in New York City and one of the biggest in American history. Duffy's book details the Nazi's attempt to recruit Sebold as their own spy in 1939, while Sebold was in the country to visit his mother. The Nazis accosted him, overly impressed with a low-level position Sebold once held in New York City, and placed him as a spy in New York City under the threat of death. The cover of Peter Duffy's new book 'Double Agent,' which details the work of William Sebold and the FBI in putting an end to German spy rings operating in America . Double agent William Sebold (pictured right) talking with Nazi spy Fritz Duquesne, who was totally unaware that the FBI had installed a two-way mirror into Sebold's Times Square office . Col. Nikolaus Ritter, head of the Wehrmacht's head of military espionage, needed a man to pass information from their spies in the field to German hands, and conscripted Sebold into the position. However, instead of bending to the threats of the Wehrmacht, Sebold covertly contacted the U.S. Consulate in Cologne, Germany, informing them of what he had been forced into. Sebold was brought back to the United States, where he met with FBI officials who devise a new plan for him. Sebold told the FBI of spies already operating in America, and began to work with the FBI (who, at the time, had no counterespionage program in place) to set up shop in New York City, to build a case against the Americans working for the Nazis. As he moved up the ranks of the German spy community in the United States, Sebold set up a dummy office in Times Square for German spies to hand over information to him. Among the spies that were complicit in the conspiracy were Frederick Duquesne, the leader, a war veteran, Nazi sympathizer, and overall eccentric character who wore a monocle and operated an office in Wall Street. Duquesne was the master coordinator of the Nazi spy ring in the United States. He would reportedly call companies like Grumman Aircraft Engineering, and requesting photos and plans of their developing technology for made-up 'lectures' he was giving. Before working as a Nazi spy, Duquesne had a career as a journalist with the New York Herald. The companies often complied, and when he received the materials he would pass them to the Nazis. Frederick 'Fritz' Duquesne, pictured left in his younger years, lead one of the largest espionage rings in American history. He was assisted by Lilly Stein (pictured right) who would often sleep with men in order to extract information from them . A photograph snapped by the FBI of Duquesne while he walked the streets of New York City . Duquesne walknig with Sebold, taken on May 29, 1940 . Sebold also came into contact with Lilly Stein, a 'femme fatale' that attempted to seduce him. Stein was a German spy who was described as a 'good-looking nymphomaniac' by one FBI agent, her specialty being luring men to bed, where they would pillow-talk about war developments or big deals taking place in industry or finance. According to Duffy's book, Stein was effective at her job, once attempting to communicate to Germany that the British army was building 1,000 planes per day, information that would have been useful to German intelligence. As Sebold's involvement with the Nazi spy ring got deeper, he was allowed to set up telegraph correspondence at a cottage in Long Island. The FBI was able to glean substantial evidence to build a case by monitoring the telegraph lines and the transmissions between Sebold and the Wehrmacht. On June 28, 1941, the FBI acted, arresting 33 Nazi spies. Of the 33 charged, 16 were convicted, including Stein, who attempted to proposition an agent to get out of being arrested. Duquesne received an 18-year sentence for his crimes. Stein received a 12-year sentence. The timely arrests served to deprive Adolf Hitler of the help of spies at the time he would need it the most, the convictions coming down on December 12, 1941, one day after war had been formally declared against Germany and Italy by the United States. A host of pictures taken by the FBI while Duquesne met with Sebold . After his service with the FBI, Sebold was placed in an early version of the Witness Protection Program by the FBI, and was relocated to California. There, his ill health plagued him, as well as his justifiable fear of reprisal by the remnants of the Nazis. In letters sent to him by his family, the Germans involved with the Wehrmacht still sought revenge against him. Eventually, he was committed to Napa State Hospital, in Napa, California, where he arrived broke and losing his mind. He was diagnosed as having manic depression, and died of a heart attack five years later. Duffy's book details the previously unsung tale of Sebold, and provides background on what J. Edgar Hoover called 'the most outstanding case in Bureau history.' 'Double Agent' is scheduled to hit bookshelves nationwide on July 22, 2014.","'Double Agent', written by Peter Duffy, explores the cooperation of the FBI with William Sebold in bringing down the Duquesne Spy Ring .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl who was freed from captivity has been provisionally cleared of helping the enemy while he was held prisoner by the Taliban. 'We have no reason to believe that he engaged in any misconduct' during his five years in captivity, a U.S. Army official told the Wall Street Journal. An investigation has been underway into whether Bergdahl deserted his post in June 2009 while he was stationed in a remote area of Afghanistan. A classified investigation by the Army in 2009 found that the sergeant had left his post voluntarily. The U.S. Army says Bergdahl has been released from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas and the former prisoner of war in Afghanistan is now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio . A probe was launched after Bergdahl was accused by members of his unit of desertion. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post . in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. Some former . members of his unit have said that he left of his own accord. Bergdahl . has not commented publicly on the circumstances of his disappearance. He was turned over to a U.S. military . team by members of the Taliban on May 31, in exchange for the release of . five Taliban leaders being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center. His former platoon mates have claimed that several soldiers were killed or injured during search missions for Bergdahl. Senior U.S. Army officials said  that . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has not yet been interviewed by the two-star general . appointed last week to investigate the matter. They said he has not been read his legal rights and has not asked for a lawyer. Officials have said the military . team helping him recover from his imprisonment has told him that he is . not immune from any subsequent charges, including anything linked to . information he gives them now. The Army officials said  that the investigation will examine whether Bergdahl went AWOL or if he deserted his post . One senior Army official said that any admission Bergdahl may blurt out during the debriefings could be used against him. So far, Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him. The tenuous legal line is that the reintegration team is focusing on the five years he spent in captivity, not how he got there. And Army officials said there is no suggestion that Bergdahl was guilty of any misconduct while he was held captive. Bergdahl was initially treated at the . Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, but is now receiving . outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Army . officials would not say Wednesday whether he has the ability to move . freely on and off the base or if his movements are being constrained. He is now in the final phase of his 'reintegration' at the center, where a staff psychologist will decide when he’s ready for release. The process includes helping Bergdahl deal with the effects of five years in captivity, and could be completed within two weeks. The official said Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him . He has not admitted any wrongdoing, asked for a lawyer or talked with his parents in the three weeks since his release, according to reports. He is also yet be questioned by the Army officials assigned to the investigation. Maj. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl, deputy commanding general of 1st Corps at Joint . Base Lewis McChord in Washington state, is conducting the investigation . with a deadline of mid-August. His . recommendations would be forwarded to the director of the Army staff, . who could approve or alter them, and then forward them to Bergdahl's . commander for any appropriate action. The . questions surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance also complicate his back . pay. His pay was initially going into his bank account after he . disappeared, but at a certain point the account became frozen due to . inactivity. If it is determined he went AWOL or deserted, he could be forced to repay money. The road to rehabilitation: After his recovery process is completed, the Army will interview Bergdahl and decide if he should face disciplinary proceedings. According to a U.S. official, Bergdahl . accumulated more than $300,000 in back pay since he disappeared in June . 2009, but it's not clear how much of that has been frozen. If . it is determined that he did not go AWOL or desert his post, he also . could receive roughly another $300,000 or more because he was a prisoner . of war. After his recovery process is completed, the Army will interview Bergdahl and decide if he should face disciplinary proceedings. If Bergdahl is charged with desertion, he could face court-martial, prison time and possibly even the death penalty.","Two-star general was appointed last week to investigate the matter .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The Fonz, played by Henry Winkler in Happy Days, pictured, is often considered cool . A panel of experts recently voted Apple the coolest brand in the UK – but what makes a company cool? Recent findings from Chicago researchers suggest that coolness goes hand-in-hand with autonomy; breaking the rules and going against the social norm. But they claim that rule breaking and being different is only tolerated by consumers, when it is done for positive or worthy reasons. 'The marketplace values cool brands,' said authors Caleb Warren from Texas A&M University, and Margaret Campbell from the University of Colorado. 'A cool image helped solidify Harley Davidson’s status as an iconic brand, rejuvenate sales of Pabst Blue Ribbon, and vault Apple into the ranking of ‘the best global brand’ of 2013. ‘Coolness excites consumers, adds symbolic currency to products, and drives consumer trends - everyone wants it, even if they can’t define what ‘cool’ actually is. Although researchers do not agree on a specific definition, previous studies have found four defining properties. The first, according to the recent study, is that coolness is socially constructed and is not an inherent feature of an object or person - meaning objects and people are cool only to the extent that others consider them to be.

They were asked to rate each one in terms of coolness, and then asked why they thought they were cool. The researchers found a direct link between the bottles that were described as ‘weird’ and ‘unique’, and high cool ratings. This proved autonomy was a factor when defining coolness. In a follow up study, they asked participants to rate an advert for a brand that promoted either breaking or following a dress code. Group A were told that the dress code existed as a way to honour war veterans, while group B were told it existed to honour a corrupt dictator. Results discovered that breaking the dress code made the brand seem cooler, but only when the dress code was for a necessary, positive and worthy reason. ‘Collectively, our studies find that coolness is a subjective, positive trait perceived in people, brands, products, and trends that are autonomous in an appropriate way,’ the researchers concluded in the Journal of Consumer Research.","Researchers from Chicago wanted to determine what makes a brand cool .

"A daredevil has beaten the record for the furthest unassisted flight in a 'birdman' competition. Ron Freeman soared 159.8metres in the Worthing International Birdman competition yesterday, passing his 141.5metre record set at the event last year, organisers said. Mr Freeman, the reigning champion, could now land the £10,000 top prize at the event which sees people throw themselves off the Sussex seaside town’s pier in machines and costumes. Ron Freeman breaking his own record in the annual Worthing International Birdman competition yesterday . A spokesman for the event confirmed Mr Freeman’s distance, adding that his adapted hang glider the Geordie Flyer had a large wingspan. He said: 'He overlapped the edge of the platform that the competitors jump off.' On its official Twitter, competition organisers said: 'Ron Freeman got an official score of 159.8m well done another new record for Worthing Birdman.' To win the prize, Mr Freeman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, needs another good run today. Competitors in his Condor Class for serious attempts have their final scores based on flights on both days of the event. Last year he missed out on the money after strong winds forced him to take a sideways rather than a forwards route off the pier. Mr Freeman was not the only flier today to pass the 100 metre mark that competitors have to pass to be eligible for the £10,000 prize. Tony Hughes sits in second after soaring 117.1 metres in X Plane VIII, down on the 132.5 metre best he posted last year. They were among 25 competitors taking part yesterday, ranging from the serious to the wacky, including one who jumped off dressed as a Minion from the cartoon film Despicable Me.","Daredevil sets record for furthest unassisted flight in 'Birdman' competition .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and John Stevens . A former political activist triggered a furious response yesterday by claiming Tory grandees attended rent boy parties in the 1980s. Anthony Gilberthorpe alleged he witnessed top Conservatives having sex with boys at cocaine-fuelled romps in private rooms at seaside conferences. He named four senior figures, all now deceased, among those he says were at the sordid parties. But his allegations were denounced as ‘improbable tittle-tattle’ by former minister David Mellor who accused Mr Gilberthorpe of smearing the dead. Allegations: Anthony Gilberthorpe (left) alleged that he witnessed top Conservative having sex with boys at cocaine-fuelled sessions and gave a dossier to Margaret Thatcher (right) in 1989 . The 52-year-old was an aspiring politician when he attended Tory party conferences, starting in 1978 when he was 17. He claimed he was ‘manipulated and groomed’ to procure underage rent boys for private sex parties on the orders of senior figures in Margaret Thatcher’s government. He alleged boys as young as 15 were plied with alcohol and cocaine before they had sex with powerful politicians. There was also supposedly one man involved who is a current serving MP – but the Sunday Mirror, which published the claims, chose not to identify him. Former Education Secretary Sir Keith Joseph and ex-local government minister Rhodes Boyson, who both served in Mrs Thatcher’s government, were at parties attended by rent boys, said Mr Gilberthorpe. Sir Michael Havers, the former Attorney General, and Dr Alistair Smith – who was the former Tory chairman in Scotland – were also involved, he said. If true, it would be the first time Lord Havers – whose sister Baroness Butler-Sloss is heading the government’s inquiry into abuse – has been accused of actually being present at such a gathering. Police have set up a national VIP sex crimes group with a 'superlist' of suspects (left) while Ministers have moved to defend the appointment of Baroness Butler-Sloss to oversee an inquiry into the allegations (right) Mr Gilberthorpe says he sent a 40-page dossier to Mrs Thatcher in 1989 detailing who took part in the sex parties, but says he was warned off by a senior civil servant. However, his claims were rejected by Mr Mellor. Speaking on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, he said of the story: ‘The only people who are named are dead ... 'And so what we are dealing with is here is a lot of tittle-tattle where the libel lawyers allow them to.’ Mr Mellor accused Mr Gilberthorpe of inventing his claims because he was bitter his own political career never took off, saying: ‘He’s come up with these names, improbable names. 'Rhodes Boyson – I don’t see Rhodes Boyson with little boys. Michael Havers: heaven’s above, an urbane fellow.’ Yesterday Mr Gilberthorpe was not available for comment, but the Sunday Mirror said he stood by his claims. Sir Rhodes’s family indicated they did not wish to comment, while Sir Keith’s son-in-law said the allegations were new to the family.","Anthony Gilberthorpe says he saw top Tories having sex with young boys .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Wisconsin boy boy who was accidentally shot in the head while playing with a friend in a wooded area behind a home earlier this month has been identified as 11-year-old Eric Gutierrez. Gutierrez was declared brain dead the day after he was shot in the forehead, and then taken off of life support the following day. Authorities are still trying to determine exactly what happened that led to the gun firing. As of Friday, police would only say that the unidentified, 13-year-old friend was a witness to the shooting. Tragic: Eric Gutierrez was fatally shot in the head last week in a field behind a home in Wisconsin . Accident: Gutierrez's family says they believe it was just a tragic accident, while police say the investigation is ongoing . 'All the evidence - we're going through it to try to figure out exactly what happened,' Walworth County Sheriff David Graves told Gazettextra.com. About 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, emergency crews were called to the wooded area behind a home on County Road K in response to a juvenile who'd been shot in the head. Paramedics transported Gutierrez to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brain dead the following day. Authorities found a handgun at the scene that appears to be the weapon used in the shooting. Other evidence was collected at the scene but law enforcement officials wouldn't reveal exactly what was found. Brain dead: Gutierrez was declared brain dead on Thursday, but his family kept him on life support as doctors found recipients for his organs . Authorities interviewed the 13-year-old friend who witnessed the shooting. They are yet to reveal who fired the gun, or how the boys came into possession of the weapon. The boy's mother, Rebecca Galarza, has been posting updates about her son's condition on Facebook, as well as pictures of the boy in the hospital. In one post, Galarza says she doesn't think her son was playing with the gun - she says her family believes that whatever happened was a tragic accident. When it became clear that her son would likely never recover, Galarza kept the boy on life support long enough for friends and family to come say goodbye, and for doctors to find transplant recipients for his organs. Organ donor: According to his family, Gutierrez's organs saved the lives of six people, ranging in age from 17 to 60 . Memorial: Gutierrez's family placed a cross and flowers at the site of the shooting following the boy's death . 'Friends and family it is with a heavy heart I give this update about my sweet angel Eric,' Galarza posted on Facebook on Friday. 'We have found recipients for all of Eric's organs. YEAH!! unfortunately that also means that it is time to say goodbye. so at noon today Eric will go down to the O.R and begin the process of harvesting his organs. I am feeling so much pain and sickness and hurt today. I am proud of my son and I love him so much. I am going to be so lost without him. Because of his gift he will be saving 6 people ranging from 17yrs old to late 50's.' According to a GoFundMe website setup to help his parents pay for funeral costs, Gutierrez leaves behind two sisters, two brothers, a mother and father. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.","Eric Gutierrez was declared brain dead shortly after the shooting .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The residents of a well-heeled town in Greater Manchester perform more internet searches for payday loans than those living anywhere else. Information released by Google shows that the most search requests came from the predominantly middle-class area of Altrincham. Local economics expert Pete Wild was not surprised by the results, however. Information released by Google shows that the most search requests came from the predominantly middle-class area of Altrincham, Greater Manchester (pictured) The senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University’s finance department said the urge to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ encouraged people to seek out payday loans. ‘People who have a nice lifestyle are less likely to want to give it up,’ he said, suggesting that residents who should be tightening their belts in tough financial times ‘are making bad credit decisions in order to keep having two holidays a year when really they should be having one.' 'People will move heaven and earth to keep their children in private schools when they cannot really afford it. 'When you go through Altrincham and Hale now you can see the number . of boarded-up shops. The area just doesn’t have the money to drive . consumerism at the moment.'

"Schools in some parts of the country are having to raid their own budgets to pay for Nick Clegg’s plan to give four to seven-year-old pupils free meals. Freedom of Information figures suggest nearly a third of councils cannot afford to provide free school lunches for infants from September. In some areas, schools themselves could have to pay towards the expensive kitchen and dining room upgrades needed to deliver the policy. Schools are having to raid their own budgets to pay for kitchen and dining room upgrades to provide free school meals for children after Nick Clegg made a pledge at last year's Liberal Democrat Conference . In Somerset, primaries with more than 150 pupils are being asked to contribute a total of £250,000 – 25 per cent of the cost of improving kitchens. And Lambeth council in London said schools will be funding £150,000 worth of upgrades. Overall, across 29 councils, there is a funding shortfall of at least £23million. The figures will add to controversy surrounding the policy, which was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister at last year’s Liberal Democrat party conference. Tory sources said the £600million plan was drawn up ‘on the back of a fag packet’ as part of a coalition deal, which saw the Lib Dems agree not to oppose similarly expensive tax breaks for married couples. But many primary school heads warned at the time that they did not have the space or kitchen facilities to provide for an extra 1.5million children. Sources claim that Mr Clegg failed to take into account the cost of improving school kitchens to meet the demand, forcing the Government to offer more money for upgrades. The Department for Education is refusing to release warning emails, understood to have been sent by the Treasury to officials and ministers, pointing out potential problems with the funding of the scheme. Mr Clegg has insisted that the plan is fully funded, but Freedom of Information requests have revealed a gap of £23million as Tory's accuse Clegg of drawing the idea up 'on the back of a fag packet' Mr Clegg insisted last month that the plan was ‘fully funded’. But Labour’s shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan said it was increasingly clear the policy was ‘a complete shambles’, adding: ‘David Cameron urgently needs to explain to parents why some schools will be forced to fund this commitment out of their own budgets, how this will affect standards at those schools and which children will be missing out in September.’ Responses to Freedom of Information requests by Mr Brennan reveal that almost a third of councils have not been given enough money by the Government to fund the programme from September. Of the 43 councils that said it was not enough, 29 provided details of their estimated shortfalls – a total of £23,036,824. Kent County Council has a shortfall of around £4.3million, while Enfield and Hampshire councils both have shortfalls of at least £3million. Initially, Mr Clegg promised that all free lunches would be a hot meal. But this was downgraded to an aspiration rather than a commitment once problems with kitchens were raised. Last week, it emerged that more than 3,000 schools will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep them warm or reheat them in mini-kitchens. Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils’ desks.","Clegg insists that £600million school meals pledge is fully funded .

"By . Louise Eccles . Complaints to energy companies over inaccurate bills are at record levels, with billing inaccuracies being the main issue . Complaints about energy companies are at record levels amid growing anger over inaccurate bills, figures reveal today. Pressure is growing on firms to improve customer service after complaints during the first half of the year more than doubled to 22,671 – up from 10,598 in the last six months of 2013. June was also a record for the highest number of complaints ever received in one month, with 4,124 unhappy consumers making their frustration known. Billing issues are the main problem, accounting for 84 per cent of the complaints made between January and June, according to the Energy Ombudsman. Many relate to late or inaccurate bills, as energy firms increasingly rely on estimates instead of door-to-door meter readings. Estimates that are too low can land families with surprise invoices later on, while setting direct debit payments too high leaves energy firms sitting on millions of pounds of their customers’ money. Difficulty changing supplier was the second biggest issue, accounting for 13 per cent of complaints. The figures emerge just weeks after energy watchdog Ofgem warned Npower to resolve its billing problems by the end of August or face halting all telephone sales to new customers. Complaints about both Npower and Scottish Power doubled in the first quarter of this year after new billing systems were introduced. Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland said complaints about Npower rose from 306 for every 100,000 customers in the last quarter of last year to 592 between January and March – or one complaint for every 169 customers. Meanwhile complaints about Scottish Power increased from 100.5 per 100,000 customers to 198. In September last year, Npower suffered a computer glitch when they transferred to their new billing system, causing problems on about 700,000 customer accounts. Despite the company’s pledge that they would fix the errors, customers continue to report billing issues and poor customer service. Some Npower customers have discovered they have paid too little for months – unwittingly building up large debts despite making regular payments, while others claim their bills or direct debits have jumped up unexpectedly. Others complained they were made to wait for more than an hour on the phone to speak to a customer service adviser, who was then rude and unhelpful. Chief ombudsman Lewis Shand Smith said: ‘The spike in complaints is in part a result of the rising cost of living, but also as a result of consumers becoming more aware of their rights. 'Addressing these concerns is crucial to restoring consumer confidence.’ Suzanne and Mike Walker had £25,000 taken from their account after a mix-up with their meter reading . A spokesman for the Department of Energy said the number of complaints was ‘unacceptable’. He added: ‘Energy companies need to realise that people will not tolerate poor service and are switching suppliers in unprecedented numbers, particularly to small suppliers.’ In June, it emerged that energy companies were making £101 profit a year from every family – a 1,000 per cent rise in five years. And despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices, energy profits have doubled from last year alone, when they were £48 per family. Ofgem has announced that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate the energy market to establish if major players are taking advantage of price movements to unfairly boost profits. The ‘big six’ companies – British Gas, Npower, SSE, EDF, E.On and Scottish Power – have been accused of not passing on the fall in wholesale prices to customers. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ‘A CMA investigation should ensure there are no barriers to stop effective competition bearing down on prices and delivering the benefits to consumers.’","Complaints to energy companies at record high with bills the main issue .

"By . Andrew Levy . It should have been the catch of a lifetime – but ended up being the one that got away. This huge bluefin tuna brought ashore by five university friends  is estimated to be worth close  to £1million. But strict EU laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in Japan for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them. The girls, Hannah Ford, Sarah Little, Shauna Creamer, Charlotte Chambers and Laura Pickervance found the 300lb bluefin tuna floating in waist-deep water near Kingsand in Cornwall while on a beach holiday . The girls managed to load the giant fish onto a kayak to bring it safely home where it was taken by officials . The giant fish was taken by the Marine Management Organisation who have sent it to University of Exeter where it will undergo a full post mortem including a toxicology examination to determine how it died . In other words Sarah Little, 22, Laura Pickervance and Shauna Creamer, both 23, and Charlotte Chambers and Hannah Ford, both 24, will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in Cornwall. The 7ft 1in specimen, which was perfectly edible, has been sitting in a fisherman’s freezer prior to being taken to the University of Exeter today where it will be dissected and studied by experts, rather than served up in a restaurant. The group, who all met at Oxford Brookes University and reunited for the break in Torquay, remained upbeat about missing out on the windfall yesterday. Miss Little, who works in PR and lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: ‘We’re not worried that we won’t see the money – you can’t mourn what you never had. It’s certainly made the holiday.’ The friends were heading out for a kayaking session in Kingsand on Saturday when they saw the fish floating in waist-deep water near the beach. ‘We’d only just got in the water and were messing around being silly when we saw this massive thing,’ Miss Little added. ‘I shouted “shark” but then we saw whatever it was was dead and we had a closer look and hauled it up across the kayaks. Bluefin tuna can live up to 30 years in the Atlantic . 1,482 The weight in pounds which an adult bluefin tuna can reach . 1.05 The amount in millions a tuna sold at auction in Japan in January . 43 The speed in miles per hour they can travel . 4000 The distance in miles a bluefin tuna will migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to Iceland . 3,500 The price per pound a fresh bluefin tuna in perfect condition can reach . 1000 The depth in metres a bluefin tuna can dive . 90 The percentage decline in bluefin tuna numbers in the Atlantic due to over-fishing . 21 The maximum length in feet of adult fish . 30 The maximum age of an adult fish . 8 The age at which they reach sexual maturity . 'We dragged it ashore and by this time a large crowd had gathered on the beach and saw what we had. We tried to flip it over but it was too heavy, so four men had a go and they couldn’t  lift it either. There was a lot of faffing about.’ The fish was at first believed to be a yellowfin tuna and a local fisherman was allowed to take it away to cut up and use as bait. But a local strandings officer made some checks and stopped him destroying it after discovering it was the much rarer type. A 4ft 6in bluefin tuna weighing 300lb valued at £500,000 was confiscated by government officials last year after it was caught off the South Devon coast. The tuna found in Cornwall was not weighed but may be worth double that sum as it was longer and likely to have had a wider girth. Strandings officer Claire Wallerstein, who works for Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘It was fascinating just to be able to study such a large and rare creature. ‘They do come in our waters but not often and are usually chasing mackerel. Nobody knows what happened to this one but it may have starved. ‘Somebody in the neighbouring village had reported seeing what they thought was a dolphin trying to beach itself the night before, which now seems possibly to have been this fish.’ Bluefin tuna are rarely seen in the sea around Britain and are more common in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. A Marine Conservation Society spokesman said: ‘This is a rare event as Atlantic bluefin are only sporadically seen and reported in the English Channel. ‘They are rare because they have been fished heavily in recent decades and the species is close to extinction.’ In January, a 489lb bluefin tuna was sold in auction in Japan for a world-record £1.05 million for a fish . Bluefin tuna migrate from the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, following the Gulf Stream to the cold waters between Iceland and Norway. Unusually for fish, bluefin tuna are warm blooded allowing to survive in the cold .","The giant tuna weighed 300lbs and was more than two metres long .

"By . Margaret Davis . Rules for buying working antique guns that are currently slacker than laws for dealing scrap metal are to be toughened up in a bid to stem criminals’ access to deadly weapons. Changes coming into force tomorrow will stop convicts being able to buy or possess old weapons, and by the end of the year dealers will have to keep computerised records for at least 20 years. Police have long expressed concern that criminal gangs are buying and using antique guns that are still capable of firing, and getting ammunition made to fit the firearms. A legal loophole allowing criminals to buy and sell antique guns such as these is now closed . These included the killers of soldier Lee Rigby - Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo - who had an unloaded rusty Dutch KNIL 9.4mm revolver that was 90 years old. Detective . Chief Superintendent Gordon Allison, who leads Scotland Yard’s Trident . Gang Crime Command, said violent criminals are exploiting existing . loopholes in the law. Crackdowns . on the importation of more modern weapons have caused criminals to . resort to buying old guns, and to try to use the antique laws to avoid . arrest. He . said: 'We welcome these additional new controls for an area of firearms . trade that until now has been unregulated. Previously the laws for . dealing scrap metal have been stricter than those for dealing antique . guns. 'We . are not talking about converted weapons here - these sought after, . collectable items are capable of firing live ammunition, and criminals, . in particular gang members have exploited the loopholes in the law. 'These . changes will enable police to ensure our resources are focused on those . people who do not have a genuine reason to possess these weapons and . those involved in gun-related criminality.' Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said he wanted the UK's strong gun laws to remain effective . Crime . prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'We are introducing a new offence . of possession of a prohibited weapon or ammunition for sale or . transfer, which will carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and . we are increasing the maximum sentence for the international trade of a . weapon or ammunition from 10 years to life imprisonment. 'We are also ensuring people prohibited from possessing a firearm are banned from owning an antique firearm. 'The . UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and I am determined . to keep it that way. The trade in illegal firearms and misuse of legal . firearms endangers lives, that is why we are taking extra steps to . improve public safety.' Director . of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has already issued new guidance . to prosecutors dealing with such cases and warned that criminals will no . longer be able to abuse the law. The . changes mean that anyone who has been given a suspended sentence of . three months or more will no longer be able to buy or possess an antique . gun or ammunition for five years. As well as the changes to antique gun laws, a new offence of possession for sale or transfer of a prohibited weapon or ammunition is being created, which will carry a maximum life term. The manufacture, sale or transfer of a prohibited weapon or ammunition will now carry a new maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as will the manufacture, sale or transfer of prohibited firearms and ammunition without authority, and their import or export.","Current laws governing the purchase of working antique weapons are slacker than those which regulate dealing of scrap metal .

"By . Nicky Campbell . Radio presenter Nicky Campbell said our terrible attitude towards littering makes many parks look like rubbish dumps . Not so long ago, I was taking a walk in South London with my dog Maxwell, when an expensive 4x4 swept towards me out of a garage forecourt. Inside was a woman, with her two children sitting in the back in impeccable school uniforms. As she pulled alongside me, to my astonishment she casually chucked two plastic shopping bags out the window. Before she could pull into the road, I asked her somewhat forcibly what kind of example she thought she was setting for her children. Without even deigning to look me in the eye, she pretended she hadn’t heard me. Then, eyes front and nose in the air, she drove her gas-guzzling monster away, leaving the plastic bags to dance in the air in her slipstream. Though I don’t supposed she cared in the least, it will take those bags centuries to rot away. That depressing incident hammered home the fact that litter louts can be found across the social spectrum, as you’ll discover whether you pay a visit to a greyhound racing track or the Glastonbury festival or even the Henley Royal Regatta: at the end of the day, the rubbish that’s chucked on the ground is appalling. We have a terrible attitude to dropping litter in this country — which is why some of our parks and commons look like rubbish dumps, with the occasional patch of green showing through. At this time of year especially when the sun is shining and people congregate outdoors, it’s shocking. Before you dismiss me as a boring old Victor Meldrew type, I’m the first to admit I’m not some paragon of civic rectitude by any means. Neither am I a caped crusader with a black bin bag on a personal mission to Keep Britain Tidy. In all honesty, I am actually a bit of an idiot. In fact, the one time I really lost my temper with a group of litter bugs, I came to regret it for a very long time. The flashpoint came about one day when I was out with Maxwell for a walk, this time on Clapham Common. While Maxwell pottered about as dogs do, my gaze settled on a group of about six youths ranging from around 12 to 14 years old, who were kicking around a couple of bags of rubbish someone had placed beside an overflowing bin. The contents were everywhere. It really was disgusting – their behaviour and the contents of the bags. ‘Guys,’ I said in what I hoped was a kind of paternal way. ‘Please don’t do that.’ What a ridiculous thing to say. Clapham Common in London, where the presenter was spat on and subjected to a barrage of abuse . Perhaps unsurprisingly, they were deaf to my lame protestations. Then it escalated. The first volley of abuse was verbal. Shall we call it ‘the language of the newsroom’ (and then some)? As f-words rained down on me, I felt the anger welling up inside me, and an overwhelming desire to stand up to these little yobs. Still clinging to the dog lead, I got down on my haunches and started picking the litter up, attempting to put it back in the bag. Then came the second — far more disgusting — fusillade. My first thought was: ‘Is it raining?’ It was, in fact, a monsoon of spittle accompanied by a soundtrack of guttural retching. I was covered in the stuff. I have to tell you, it was bloody awful. Down my neck, even on my face. Can you imagine anything more repulsive? As the lads decided to leg it, I turned for home and, though it pains me to admit it — I was actually crying. Isn’t that pathetic? When I got to my safe haven, which was about ten minutes away, I let Maxwell in and went straight upstairs and pulled my spittle-flecked clothes off. When I came out the shower, I called my wife Tina and told her what had happened. She was more than furious, just incandescent with anger. But not with the louts who’d done this to me. No, with her husband. She gave me the second sweary salvo I’d received that evening — albeit in a somewhat more genteel way — telling me that I was totally and utterly stupid to have intervened. ‘They could have had a knife. And then where would we all be?’ Littering stems from a lack of consideration for our fellow citizens, says radio presenter Nicky Campbell . It was a fair point, but in all honesty even after that horrible incident three years ago I would still confront yobs trashing the streets any day of the week. Littering may seem small beer to some, but it demonstrates a blinding lack of consideration for and awareness of your fellow citizens. We see it all the time, don’t we? We see people who can’t be bothered heaving their lazy frames just a few yards to a bin. We see it in people who tip out an ashtray from a car window, or toss a drink can out the window while they’re driving. What are they thinking? I, perhaps naively, just can’t comprehend the mindset. So what can we do as a nation to stem this tide of litter? The fast food outlets certainly need to do more to stop customers buying their food and drink and then just dumping the packaging wherever the hell they like. I’d love one day to take a pile of pizza boxes back to the restaurant that handed them out and dump them over the counter. Most of all, we need to make people realise and understand the consequences of their actions. We really are all in it together on this one. Perhaps the social problems and solutions are too deep rooted and intractable for us to change easily, but we do have laws already that could be used more often to combat such a national problem. It is a criminal offence for a person to drop, throw down, or otherwise deposit and then leave litter. The offence of littering is covered in Sections 87 and 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and results — if it is ever prosecuted — in an average fine of around £100. But beyond employing litter patrols — rather like the Saudi Arabian religious police — to roam around and arrest people, what do we do? It is not my place as an impartial BBC journalist to suggest legislation, but there are some who advocate a Draconian solution who would say we need laws like the ones they have they have in Singapore, for example. There, litter louts can be fined nearly £500 for the first conviction, and more than £2,000 for repeat offences. On top of that, you are also made to do community labour, and if you offend three times, you’ll have to wear a sign which states: ‘I am a litter lout.’ Many will undoubtedly say that is completely unreasonable, a waste of the courts’ time, and a wholly and ludicrously over the top response to a relatively minor infraction. But do we seriously want the kind of society which has people walking round with signs telling the world they are litter louts? Although ... is that such a rubbish idea?","Radio presenter talks of confronting a group of careless litter louts .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . English teenagers are the worst in Europe at speaking foreign languages with fewer than one in ten 15-year-olds competent in French. A new report out today exposes Britain’s poor record at learning languages despite growing demand from employers. A group of MPs and peers warns that the UK is missing out on almost £50billion-a-year in lost contracts because of poor language skills among the workforce. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'After years of decline, our reforms are driving a languages revival in schools. We are making it compulsory for children to learn a foreign language from age seven to 14' (File photo) The group’s report highlights European Commission research showing that English 15-year-olds came bottom of a table of 14 countries for competence in the main language taught in schools. Just 9 per cent of English pupils had a basic mastery of French – the most commonly-taught language – while the average across 14 nations was 42 per cent. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Modern Languages also warned that the study of languages was in ‘deep crisis’ at A-level and languishing at a ‘record low’ in universities. Forty-four universities had scrapped language degrees since 2000. 'The UK economy is already losing around £50billion a year in lost contracts because of lack of language skills in the workforce' (File photo) Language learning was increasingly ‘the preserve of an intellectual or affluent elite’ attending private schools, where more than two-thirds of teenagers studied the subject until the age of 16, compared with just 16 per cent in state schools. A manifesto published by the group called on the main political parties to value the study of languages as highly as maths and science. The UK needs a ‘national recovery programme’ to increase the numbers who can speak a language besides English. ‘English is an important world language but the latest cutting edge research shows that, in the 21st century, speaking only English is as much of a disadvantage as speaking no English,’ the report says.The manifesto calls for all children to have achieved a ‘high quality language qualification’ by the time they finish secondary education. There should also be a long-term commitment to ‘transforming the reputation of UK citizens as poor linguists, reluctant to value languages other than English’. ‘Languages are as important for our future as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths),’ the document says. ‘Leadership is needed to ensure they are given similar recognition.’ Baroness Coussins, chairman of the group, said: ‘The next government will need to take clear, urgent and coherent action to upgrade the UK’s foreign language skills. ‘Otherwise our young people will continue to fall behind their European and global peers in education and employability; our export growth will be stunted; our international reputation will suffer and our security, defence and diplomacy needs will be compromised. ‘The UK economy is already losing around £50billion a year in lost contracts because of lack of language skills in the workforce. And we aren’t just talking about high flyers: in 2011 over 27 per cent of admin and clerical jobs went unfilled because of the languages deficit. ‘We’re looking for an acknowledgement of this issue in all the parties’ manifestos for the next General Election, backed up by some specific policy commitments.‘ . Ian Bauckham, the president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ’It’s clear that young people are missing out on good jobs because of a lack of foreign language skills. While there has been an increase in the numbers of students taking languages at GCSE, there are still many who choose to drop the subject at A-level. ‘Schools cannot solve this problem alone. We are supporting this approach because it includes employers, political parties, and universities, all making a commitment to address the issue.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘After years of decline, our reforms are driving a languages revival in schools. ‘We are making it compulsory for children to learn a foreign language from age seven to 14, a move supported by 91 per cent of respondents to our consultation on languages in primary schools.’ The spokesman added that thousands more pupils were now studying languages at secondary school, with almost half of state-school pupils entered languages at GCSE last year – ‘the highest level for seven years’. ‘We are spending £350,000 over the next year so primary and secondary teachers improve their teaching of languages,’ he said.","UK is missing out on almost £50billion-a-year in lost contracts because of poor language skills among the workforce .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teen caught joyriding in his parents' vehicle was forced into a very public shaming last week, when his mother forced him to stand in front of a busy North Miami intersection with a sign referring to himself as a 'follower.' The teen, identified by the sign as a 15-year-old named Alejandro, was being punished after he and his cousin took his parents' Mercedes-Benz out of a spin last Wednesday, while his parents were not home. When one of Alejandro's parents returned, they found the car in their driveway, with the fan belt still running and footprints on both the drivers and passengers side. A teen identified as a 15-year-old named Alejandro carries a sign in front of a busy intersection in North Miami, Florida . The sign reads 'Because I am a follower, I allow my cousin to influence me to take my step dad's car without his permission to joy ride. My name is Alejandro, and I am 15 yrs old!!!' Alejandro soon fessed up, and was compelled by his mother to don the sign as punishment for following his cousin's lead. The sign read 'Because I am a follower. I allow my cousin to influence me to take my . stepdad's car without his permission to joyride. My name is Alejandro . and I am 15 years old.' People passing by stopped to talk to the teen while he stood. 'You can't be doing that now,' said one onlooker on camera by WVSN. 'You gotta act . right now. Cars kill people. You get killed out here every day driving a . car.' 'It takes a split second to kill somebody in a car, a split second, and . you know who they coming after? Not the fool you lend the car to; they . coming after your parents,' said another. Alejandro's mother declined to be interviewed by WVSN, but said that she made Alejandro stand outside with the sign near their house in hopes of it being a punishment he learns from.

No one was hurt during the drive, although the car did sustain some water damage. Alejandro's cousin did have a valid learner's permit when the two chose to take the car. According to Alejandro's mother, the cost to fix any damage to the car will be coming out of Alejandro's pocket, to be paid by him doing chores around the house.","15-year-old caught by parent riding with cousin in joyride around North Miami, Florida .

"By . Corey Charlton . A musician singer-songwriter has been jailed for giving his 17-year-old fiancée a lethal morphine overdose two years after he got her addicted to Class A drugs. Jack Alderton, 25, from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, got her addicted to Class A drugs when she was only 15, and finally killed her with the fatal dose in March last year, a jury heard. Georgina Boxall was found unconscious in a . drug dealer's bed and died in an air ambulance on the way to hospital. The jury heard how Miss Boxall, pictured right, was in thrall to her older boyfriend, pictured together left, and wrote a poem about him called 'Endless Love' which described their relationship as feeling 'like a dream' Alderton and his fiancee Georgina Boxall, pictured, were in the throes of addiction when he gave her the lethal dose . Alderton, aged 25 years, had been served . two child abduction notices by police to stay away from Ms Boxall in the . two years before her death, to no avail. A . judge blasted Alderton's 'calculated and destructive' actions in . supplying drugs to the blonde teenager, as she jailed him for eight . years at Reading Crown Court. The . jury had heard Alderton started abusing drugs at the age of 13 years, . and was 'obsessed' with getting high by the time his young fiancée died . on March 16. In . a text message shortly before her death, Miss Boxall told him: 'I just . want you to have a convo (sic) with me occasionally without it being . about drugs.' Alderton was jailed for eight years for giving his fiancee a fatal dose of morphine . The . jury heard Miss Boxall had been trying to ween herself off the drugs - . which she started heavily abusing when she met Alderton - but he would . not let her quit. Following . an overdose of illegally obtained morphine sulphate, she stopped . breathing as she slept in a child's bed at the house of one of . Alderton's suppliers, Damien Stone. Stone, . aged 44 years, of Crowthorne, Berkshire, admitted supplying class A . drugs and was jailed for three years following Alderton's trial. Dreadlocked . Alderton - whose mother forced him to shave his hair off for the court . case - had denied supplying the class A drug that killed Miss Boxall. However, in an extraordinary blog post on the eve of the trial, Alderton said he was 'lucky' not to have been charged with manslaughter. Alderton added: 'I have never been to jail before, but I'm thinking I will be ok. Might write a book about the whole thing...Been a pretty intense life so far.' The heavy drug user told how he met Miss Boxall while he was studying in Surrey, and said: 'I think I was the first person she ever trusted in her life. This was all great, however we were both full on drug addicts.' Alderton would use money from his disability benefits to buy substances from internet sites, as well as from street dealers, which he would give to Miss Boxall. He would also make money from dealing drugs himself, the trial heard. Alderton was a musician singer-songwriter who used disability benefit funds to purchase drugs online . Alderton uploaded an extraordinary blog post on the internet about himself and Miss Boxall on the eve of the trial . Miss Boxall's horrified parents, Leslie and Susan, had twice secured child abduction notices for Alderton to stay away from their daughter in the two years before her death. However, she was in thrall to her older boyfriend and the drugs - and got engaged to him, the jury heard. Miss Boxall, an aspiring poet and artist, wrote about her fiancé in one poem entitled 'Endless Love'. She wrote: 'The feel of your skin against mine, that content and euphoric experience - feels like a dream. Our passion will never end, even with the drugs. Those poisonous lines. The feel of your dreadlocks against my own, I know I can never be alone.' Drug dealer Damien Stone, 44, was also jailed after Miss Boxall was found dead in a child's bed at his house . The trial heard Miss Boxall had tried to give up taking drugs, but Alderton carried on supplying them to her. In her sentencing remarks, Judge Angela Morris said: 'The text messages suggest she was trying to rid herself of the addiction to drugs by going cold turkey. 'There was no guarantee she would have succeeded - however, you did nothing to help that. In fact, you put drugs in her way. 'Your actions were simply improper, calculated and destructive because you knew only too well the danger Georgina Boxall was in by agreeing to the morphine use.' Miss Boxall's devastated family sat in the public gallery quietly listening as Alderton was jailed at Reading Crown Court on Friday. The judge told the relatives they had listened to the evidence 'with great dignity', and that sadly no sentence she could impose would compensate them for her death. Alderton, of Harwood Road, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was found guilty of supplying the class A drug that killed Miss Boxall. He had already admitted five other drugs-related offences, including supplying class A drug ecstasy three days before Miss Boxall's death, two counts of supplying class B drugs diazepam and cannabis in June, 2013, and two counts of supplying Class C drugs subutex and tamazepam in November 2012 and January 2013.","Jack Alderton, 25, got his fiancee addicted to drugs when she was only 15 .
