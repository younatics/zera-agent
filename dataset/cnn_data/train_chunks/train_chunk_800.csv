"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Firefighters are planning fresh strikes over the May Bank Holiday weekend as part of a long-running dispute over pensions. Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) in England and Wales will walk out for five hours from noon on May 2, between 2pm and 2am on May 3, and then between 10am and 3pm on May 5. There will also be a ban on voluntary overtime across England and Wales from 3pm on May 4 until noon on May 9. In Scotland there will be a ban on voluntary overtime between noon on May 2 and noon on May 9. Striking firefighters: Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) in England and Wales will walk out for five hours from noon on May 2, between 2pm and 2am on May 3, and then between 10am and 3pm on May 5 . Firefighters staged a series of strikes last year in protest at plans for a later retirement age and other changes to pensions, which they said do not take into account the unique nature of their occupation. Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: 'After three years of negotiations and an intense four months presenting an indisputable, evidence-based case for the need to ensure a pension scheme that takes account the unique occupation of firefighting, the Government is still burying its head in the sand. 'Several members of Government were only too keen to praise firefighters during the winter floods, but their words amount to nothing when they simultaneously ignore issues that threaten the future of firefighters and their families. 'Nevertheless, we remain totally committed to resolving the dispute through negotiation, and are ready to meet to consider a workable proposal as soon as possible.' Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union General Secretary, said the government was ignoring issues which pose a threat to firefighters and their families . The last strike was on January 3, since when talks have been held in a bid to break the deadlock, while the union has met with the conciliation service Acas outlining its concerns and 'frustration' at the lack of progress. The union wrote to the Government earlier this month setting a deadline of today for an improved offer. The FBU executive unanimously decided to call more strikes. The union maintains that firefighters face the threat of being sacked 'merely for getting older', as well as having to pay increased pension contributions. Union members voted by four to one last year in favour of strikes. Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'By calling unnecessary strike action, the FBU has shown it is not serious about finding a resolution to this dispute for its members and stands only to further damage firefighters' standing with the public. 'The Government has met with the FBU on many occasions, most recently during April, and has remained in ongoing communication to find a solution. Only yesterday, I wrote to the FBU saying proposals are still under consideration and stressed the importance of maintaining an open dialogue on this and other matters. 'The deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector, and the proposals protect the earned rights of a higher proportion of members than any other public sector scheme. 'Nearly half will see no change and even firefighters who are not protected will see no change until 2015. 'Under the new scheme, a firefighter who earns £29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60, get a £19,000-a-year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.' Catch a fire: Members of the Fire Brigades Union approach the gates to Downing Street during their march and rally to Central Hall, Westminster ahead of their strike last October . London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'Today's announcement from the FBU for fresh strike action is regrettable. In London we will, of course, have contingency arrangements in place but just as before we will be asking people to take extra care to prevent fires from starting. 'We will be doing all we can to remind them to take care when cooking, to make sure cigarettes are disposed of properly and to check their smoke alarms are working, especially over the bank holiday period. 'During the strikes, 27 engines will be deployed at strategic locations across London and will be used to provide fire cover for the capital. 'The contingency fire service is provided by a contractor and is not intended to replicate the Brigade's normal operational cover arrangements. The contractor will provide basic firefighting and some rescue work.'","Members of the Fire Brigades Union will walk on May 2, May 3 and May 5 .

"By . Mark Duell . and Wills Robinson . Angry: Neil Dugdale (pictured wearing an Aston Villa FC shirt), of Felixstowe, threatened to 'slit the throat' of his friend, Ipswich Crown Court was told . A computer games fan threatened to ‘slit the throat’ of his friend because he stopped playing Grand Theft Auto with him, a court has heard. Neil Dugdale, 31, became angry after Adam French, 22, allegedly left a gaming session without telling him, so stormed over to his house in Felixstowe, Suffolk, clutching a knife and claw-hammer - and threatened to ‘slit his throat’. The pair used to regularly play multiplayer via the internet on the violent gangster game as they sat in their own homes a few doors apart. Last month Dugdale admitted two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, criminal damage, affray and resisting arrest. At his sentencing at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, Judge John Holt said he wanted a report on Dugdale’s psychiatric condition before he decided whether to jail him. The court heard how Dugdale had consumed four litres of cider, cannabis and anti-depressants when the incident occurred at 5.30pm on March 14. Charles Falk, prosecuting, said: ‘Grand Theft Auto is a game where you drive around taking cars, fighting and killing people.’ Computer game: Grand Theft Auto involves players earning points for carrying out a series of assaults, carjackings and murders including drive-by shootings. He said Mr French was at home when Dugdale arrived outside his address. Dugdale shouted: ‘I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f****** kill you.’ At the time Dugdale was holding a large red-handled kitchen knife and swinging a claw hammer around. He was stabbing the knife in the top of the garden fence while shouting at Mr French to come down. When Mr French’s sister came out, Dugdale smashed the front passenger window of her Renault Clio with the hammer. Claims: The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for murders in the US and Thailand . At an earlier hearing Mark Holt, defending, said Dugdale denied that he and Mr French had been playing Grand Theft Auto. 'I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f****** kill you' What Neil Dugdale shouted . Dugdale claimed he had become angry because he had twice confided in Mr French only for his confidences to have been betrayed.

"By . Richard Spillett . Sarah Ross admitted harassing her ex-boyfriend Christopher Wood and his wife Nicola, who won a lifetime restraining order against her . A postman and his wife have won a lifetime restraining order against his jealous ex-girlfriend who spent a month bombarding them with 800 menacing phone calls. Christopher Wood, 35, was subjected to a hate campaign by Sarah Ross, 25, after she discovered he had married another former pupil from her primary school. She sent text and Facebook messages repeatedly calling Mr Wood's bride Nicola a 'slag' and adding, 'I wish you would die'. When Mrs Wood, 33, suffered a miscarriage, Ross allegedly called them 'baby killers', a court heard. In January and February this year, mother-of-one Ross made repeated phone calls to the couple's home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where they live with children aged five and ten, which were either silent or contained threats. She was also suspected of putting a brick through the couple's front window. In a later message, she then bragged: 'You are not going to win. As for me smashing your window, nothing will happen to me.' When Ross was arrested and charged she claimed she had rekindled her relationship with Mr Wood - and even became pregnant by him but lost the baby. At Macclesfield Magistrates Court, the brunette, who gave her name as Sarah Martin, clutched a pink teddy bear as she was spared jail due to 'complex family issues'. She was handed a six-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and was banned from having any contact with the couple indefinitely. Hours after the case she posted a creepy smiling 'selfie' on Facebook. At his home yesterday, Mr Wood branded Ross a 'fantasist' and added: 'She had my wife frightened, she sent her death threats - she's a loose cannon. 'We lost our baby and she still didn't . stop. She breached her original bail and put our window through. I have . been off work two months with the stress. She should have gone to prison . for what she did.' Christopher Wood and his wife Nicola were bombarded with phone calls and messages after Ross found out they were married . The court . heard that Ross, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, had been in a brief . relationship with Mr Wood from August 2012 until February 2013, during . which time she relocated from her home town of Edinburgh to be closer to . him. In . the same time period, she became 'best friends' with Nicola as their . children were in the same class at school, the court heard. But just . two months after splitting up with Mr Wood, Ross became aware he and . Nicola were in a relationship. The couple then married in June of last . year. Prosecutor . Simon Pover said of the Wood family: 'They are together as a family . with two young school-age children and also expected a child of their . own. Sadly she lost that baby on Christmas Eve and that appears to have . been something referred to in the harassment. 'Following the loss of their child the . defendant continued with the abuse which caused them and the two . children some distress and alarm. Ross posted a pictured of herself grinning on Facebook just hours after she avoided jail for the campaign of abuse . 'There were a significant number of silent phone calls - up to 800. There were also text messages sent and Mr Wood had concerns at work. There were approaches made to employees but this was dealt with sympathetically.' On January . 22 Ross was served with a harassment notice to try and halt her . behaviour, but just five days later her campaign began again. Mr . Pover said: 'There were a number of messages on Facebook which said, . 'hate you slag, wish you would die slag. Nice try slag but you are not . going to win. As for me smashing your window, nothing will happen to . me.' 'Once . proceedings began there have been instances of her bail being breached. She now accepts that she pursued a course of harassment of Christopher . and Nicola Wood. 'She accepts making approximately 800 telephone calls to the complainants, the majority of which were silent. Ross made silent and threatening phone calls to Mr and Mrs Wood and sent them abusive messages on Facebook . 'She denies instances when she is alleged to have called the complainants baby killers but she accepts sending various Facebook messages calling Mrs Wood a slag.' Ross admitted harassment was sentenced on the basis the words 'baby killers' were not used. She said she had stopped taking medication for bi-polar disorder. The court heard her five-year-old daughter was born with a number of conditions including Asperger's and poor sight and hearing. Her lawyer Anthony Derbyshire said: 'She accepts making nuisance calls and accepts the numbers of calls. She accepts her behaviour was unnacceptable but she denies calling them baby killers.' Sentencing Ross, magistrate Denise Rankin said: 'The courts take harassment very seriously indeed. It is not anything the courts condone nor should anybody do this in the community to effect anybody else. 'It is aggravated by the number of telephone calls and texts and it was over a short period of time. It was intentional and there was harm and distress caused to the complainants and their wider family. 'I acknowledge the complex family issues but do not condone this type of action.'","Sarah Ross repeatedly made silent phone calls to ex Christopher Wood .

"By . Sara Malm . One of France’s most successful rap stars has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a war of words with a rival got physical. Rohff, real name Housni Mkouboi, has admitted to being part of a a group of people who entered a Paris clothing shop, owned by another big-name rapper, Booba, and beat up a teenage shop assistant. The two rappers, or ‘rappeurs’ as they are known in France, have been embroiled in an online feud in recent months, a rivalry which has been going on for years, according to local media. In custody: Rohff, 36, real name Housni Mkouboi, has admitted to being part of a gang that entered a Paris clothing shop, owned by rival rapper Booba, and beat up a 19-year-old shop assistant . Rohff, 36, is said to have handed himself in after he was caught on CCTV in an Unkut shop – the clothing line owned by fellow hip hip star Booba, 37, real name Elie Yaffa. The group entered the shop in Halles, central Paris, on Monday afternoon, and after arguing with the teenage shop assistant, they assaulted the young man. ‘They asked to speak to an employee of the shop and a fight broke out,’ a source close to the police investigation said. The 19-year-old male employee was ‘kicked and punched’ and was rushed unconscious to the Beaujon Hospital in north Paris where he is in a life-threatening condition, French daily Le Figaro reported. Rohff entered a police station alongside his lawyer in the early hours of Tuesday and was placed into custody, appearing before a magistrate yesterday. Rivals: Rappers Rohff, left, and Booba, 37, real name Elie Yaffa, have been involved in a feud for two years, however until now it has been played out in their lyrics and on social media . The attack on the shop assistant supposedly followed a challenge by Booba, pictured, who, using Instagram, called Rohff a 'dirty queer' and told him to 'come and look for me in Paris' Rohff’s lawyer, Francis Terquem, said that his client admitted that he had ‘taken part in a brawl’ in the shop after being insulted by the assistant. ‘My client is pleased to know that the victim is recovering,' Mr Terquem told the Independent. ‘He says that what happened can be explained by a regrettable and passing fit of annoyance… It is to be hoped that this incident will bring a little calm to the rap world.’ The attack is the culmination of a two-year-long fight between Booba and Rohff, who both have millions in record sales, which has seen the pair exchange insults in their lyrics and on social media. It allegedly followed a challenge by Booba on Instagram after Rohff had made fun of him on Facebook. Booba posted: 'Trouve moi à Paname. Sale Pédale' which translates into 'come and look for me in Paris. Dirty queer'. Although mainly confined to words and threats, their fight has been compared to the infamous rivalry betweenTupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. in the mid 1990s.","French rapper Rohff handed himself in to police on Tuesday .

A man has been arrested over the murder of a teenage girl who disappeared more than 20 years ago. Johanna Young was 14 when she went missing from her family home in Watton, Norfolk, on December 23 1992. Her partially clothed body was found, covered in scratches and lying face down in water, on Boxing Day. Today, Norfolk Police said a man in his 40s from the Watton area had been arrested. A spokesman added: 'The man remains in custody and police inquiries continue.' Johanna's father Robert Young told Mail Online: 'We are hopeful now there has been an arrest and that this might be able to bring closure.' Mr Young, and his wife Carol recently made a fresh appeal for information on the 21st anniversary of her disappearance. Mrs Young, 58, said: 'We do celebrate Christmas but itâ€™s never quite the same. 'We tried to carry on for the sake of our other children, and as a family we just continue the best we can, but Johanna is in our thoughts all the time.' Mr Young, 60, described Johanna as 'full of fun and always up to tricks'. On the night she went missing, the family presumed Johanna had stayed at her boyfriendâ€™s parentsâ€™ home because it was a foggy night. Her alarm clock went off at 6am on Christmas Eve because she was due to go on her paper round. Her family realised she was gone and called the police. Officers searched the town and surrounding countryside in the hope of finding her alive. After her body was recovered, investigations targeted local men and although three people were arrested and questioned, no charges were brought. Norfolk Constabulary has kept the file open on Johanna Young's murder despite the passage of time .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Young One Direction fans have been left 'inconsolable' after buying standing tickets for the band's hotly anticipated arena tour only to discover that under-12s must be seated. Parents have been treating their children to tickets for the group's concerts, but some have failed to read the small print which includes restrictions for the youngest fans. One of those is Lynsay Short who bought her eight-year-old daughter Ruby Lynn a Â£50 ticket to see the band at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland next month. 'Inconsolable': Eight-year-old Ruby Lynn is devastated after being bought standing tickets to see her idols One Direction on their arena tour only to learn that under-12s must be seated at their gigs . Ruby, who has a shrine to 1D in her room, was all set to see her idols on May 28 with her mother, aunt Sharon, 42, and cousin Abbiegail, 11, who is also banned from the standing area. But last week Mrs Short, of Grangetown, near Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, saw an article in their local paper about how under-12s would not be allowed into the standing stalls. Mrs Short, 36, said she hadn't read the small print on the website when she paid for the tickets. She said: 'Ruby is inconsolable and she hasn't stopped crying. It is so cruel to raise a little girl's hopes like this only to dash them. 'When I saw it in the paper I contacted the stadium to double check it was correct. I can see absolutely no reason why kids aren't allowed in the standing area. Glum Direction: Ruby had been all set to see her idols on May 28 with her mother Lynsay Short (left), aunt Sharon, 42, and cousin Abbiegail, 11, who is also banned from the standing area . Shrine: Ruby has been a One Direction fan since they were on the X-Factor four years ago . 'It is absolutely ridiculous, they say it is for health and safety reasons, but that is just stupid. 'I would have been right beside Ruby the whole time, and if there had been any trouble I could have just picked her up. 'We have been in the standing area of concerts before and it is absolutely fine. 'I am not sure if One Direction are involved, but the stadium have said it is not their policy, it has come from One Direction. 'I don't think this will stop Ruby from liking One Direction, but I am certainly not happy with them.' Mrs Short says is now desperately trying to sell her tickets online and says she cannot bear to attend the concert without her daughter. Rules: Age restrictions have been put in place at every gig by One Direction (above) for safety reasons . Venue: One of the gigs is being held at Sunderland football club's Stadium of Light ground (above) She believes that the terms and conditions should have been made a lot more clearer on purchase. Ruby has been a One Direction fan since they were on the X-Factor and her favourite is Louis. She was also left devastated last year when her mother failed to get her a ticket because they had all sold out. One Direction's management, Modest Management, were approached for a comment but did not respond. A spokesperson for the Stadium of Light said: 'The age restrictions apply to every One Direction show at every UK venue, they are not specific to the Stadium of Light and have been put in place centrally to ensure the safety and comfort of everyone attending the concerts. 'The terms and conditions of sale of the tickets, along with FAQ's on the various ticketing websites, clearly state the age restrictions at point of purchase.'","Parents blast 'ridiculous' health and safety rules hidden in small print .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Guilty: Ian Wilson 'opened fire' on two women using a child's water pistol, filled with his own urine . A middle-aged businessman used a child's water pistol to open fire at two strangers - with his own urine. Ian Wilson, 56, has been ordered to pay £50 to each of the two women after squirting them with his plastic toy while they were out shopping. Wilson, who runs an internet marketing business from his home in Blackburn, Lancashire, was said to have crept up behind his victims in broad daylight. He then pulled on the plastric trigger and 'shot' them in the back with his loaded gun. At Blackburn Magistrates' Court, Wilson pleaded guilty to two charges of common assault. The court heard that, when the incident . took place, his relationship with his Dutch wife had broken down and he was . suffering from a mental breakdown. But Wilson also told officers he could offer 'no explanation' for his bizarre behaviour. The incident took place at around 2pm on October 25 last year while Wilson was walking through Blackburn town centre. Wilson walked up behind both victims and sprayed their clothing, the court was told. Officers from Lancashire Police arrested Wilson when the two distressed women reported being sprayed with an 'unknown substance'. One of the victims was aged 28. The other woman's age is unknown. Officers arrested Wilson nearby and carried out forensic tests to establish what was in the plastic pistol. Police believed the motivation behind Wilson's odd assault might have been sexual, but said his mobile phone and computer showed no abnormal behaviour, the court was told. Wilson also claimed he could offer 'no explanation' for his bizarre conduct. Wilson, a middle-aged businessman, pictured here on his own website, has been ordered to pay £50 compensation to each of his victims after the squirting spree . On his . website Wilson boasts: 'I design and build all (or most) of my own . websites and make my own graphics, when I first started back in 2007 I . thought a HTML document was something you filled out at the social . security office and that PHP was something you rubbed on a wound LOL. 'If . you have any questions please feel free to contact me via the page . provided and I'll do my best to answer them for you. Most . important...Have A Great Day.' Today, visitors who downloaded material from Wilson's website were greeted . with the message: 'WaaaaHaaaahahahaha! I bet you feel a right **** now . don't you. 'That's what you get when you try stealing images from this site. BTW Have a great day :).' In court, Wilson was given a conditional discharge for three months. He was ordered by magistrates to pay £50 compensation to each of his victims. The court also ordered his water pistol to be confiscated. The court . heard Wilson - who said he played in a band - had worked for six years . in Germany and then for 20 years in Holland where he met his wife. He began his internet marketing business in 2007, advising firms on use the internet to improve their business. But he suffered a number of family bereavements and, when his long-term marriage had broken down, he had returned to Britain. Two days after his arrest, Wilson was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was treated for three weeks. In mitigation, his lawyer Imran Hussain said: 'He had suffered from depression and had sought help with that in both Holland and the UK. 'He is deeply ashamed of what he did on that day. It was quite bizarre behaviour, with no motivation. 'He is finding it hard to believe he could be capable of this kind of thing. 'He has been having intensive involvement with the mental health services and there have been no further problems.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Crime in England and Wales fell by 15 per cent last year to a new record low since records began. There were 7.5million offences in 2013 according to the British Crime Survey, down from almost 9million in 2012. David Cameron sent congratulations to the police, with the figures showing a 22 per cent fall in both violent crime and bike thefts. The crime survey for England and Wales showed a 15 per cent drop in crime in 2013 to 7.5million . The Crime Survey for England and Wales tracks all crimes committed by interviewing victims, and as a result includes offences not reported to the police. It showed that there had been a 15 per cent overall drop in crime compared with 2012, and suggests crime has fallen by a fifth since before the coalition was formed. It suggests the crime has more than halved from a peak of 19,109 offences recorded by the survey in 1995. Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Congratulations to the police - helping overall crime to fall 15 per cent in 2013 in England & Wales. Crime is falling.’ There was a 22 per cent fall in household theft, a 15 per cent fall in vandalism and a 4 per cent drop in burglary. However, fraud rose by 25 per cent and shoplifting was up 6 per cent. Lib Dem crime minister Norman Baker said: ‘We can have confidence that England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades, with crime at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981.’ The number of reports of sex offences was up 17 per cent, which has been linked in part to the ongoing publicity of abuse cases including that of shamed DJ Jimmy Savile. Theft and violent crime saw falls of up to 22 per cent, the latest figures showed . The Prime Minister used Twitter to congratulate the police on falling crime figures . Official figures recorded by the police showed a 2 per cent fall in total crime, but this smaller drop has been linked to ongoing concerns about the quality of officers’ data. Police figures have been stripped of their official ‘gold standard’ status by the statistics watchdog. The drop in violent crime comes after a poll published yesterday, which suggested that an increase in alcohol prices is partly responsible for a reduction in binge-drinking and serious violence for the fifth consecutive year. The number of people injured in serious violence dropped by 12 per cent in 2013 compared with 2012, with more than 32,000 fewer people treated for injuries relating to violence in England and Wales, a Cardiff University report found. Crime minister Norman Baker said the streets were safer than they have been for decades . Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, said: ‘While we welcome this significant fall in crime, it is important to remember that for many of the victims of 7.5 million crimes committed last year the impact will have been severe and long-lasting. ‘We are concerned to see a rise in fraud and shoplifting, crimes which can be wrongly perceived to have little effect on victims but are often very harmful to individuals, businesses and, in some cases, communities.’ MPs have raised concerns about the way police recorded crime, including categorising offences to present an unclear picture. Whistleblower Pc James Patrick claimed massaging data to meet targets was ‘ingrained’ at Scotland Yard. Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, who leads on crime statistics for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘The statistics issued today are heartening but unsurprising. ‘They confirm to us that crime is continuing to fall and that the effect of prominent operations, such as Yewtree and the launch of Action Fraud, are resulting in more reporting of sexual offences and fraudulent activity. ‘Increased reporting allows us to get the fullest picture of these crime areas and make sure our work to combat them is properly resourced, as well as ensuring that we can maintain public confidence in the policing response. ‘The police service is committed to further cutting crime and using our resources as efficiently as possible so as to keep the country as safe as possible.’ Jack Dromey, Labour's shadow policing minister, said: 'The continued long term fall in overall crime is welcome, building on the reductions seen over the last decade and more. 'However, the Government should not be complacent.  Seven police force areas show increases or no reduction in crime, some kinds of crime have seen big increases and these figures also don't capture the full picture, as retail crime isn't included in the crime survey.'","7.5million offences reported in crime survey in 2013, down 15% on 2012 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A young mother today demanded an apology from retail giant Sports Direct after she was ordered to leave one of their stores because she was breastfeeding. Wioletta Komar claims she was left in tears outside the shop in Nottingham city centre while trying to feed her three-month-old son in the rain. The 25-year-old had been sitting on a bench inside the store waiting for her father Edward Morawiec, 63, who was trying on a T-shirts. But she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. 'Very upset': Wioletta Komar with her children - two-year-old Wictor (left) and five-month-old Daniel, whom she was trying to breastfeed in a Sports Direct store when she was ordered to leave by a member of staff . Demanding . an apology: Mrs Komar says she was sitting on a bench inside the store . feeding Daniel (pictured) when an employee told her to leave because it . was 'against company policy' The sales assistant then told her that . the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to . McDonald's which had a baby and mother room. Other . customers then took pity on the mother-of-two and helped her to push . her buggy outside so she could continue feeding Daniel. Mrs . Komar said she had contacted the company five times since the incident . on January 25 but had received no response to her complaint. She said: 'My son started crying, so I wanted to feed him. I sat on the bench near the shoe rack. 'The . store assistant approached me and said, ""I'm sorry but you will have to . go out. You can't feed here. That is our company policy"". 'I would like the staff to be trained better and I would like them to say why it happened. I would like them to apologise. 'Made to feel like a criminal': The 25-year-old was told the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to nearby McDonald's which had a baby and mother room . 'It made me feel very upset - I was . shaking and I didn't know what to do. I knew that I was allowed to be . there, but what could I do? 'It's very shocking. Of course it's knocked my confidence. You don't expect it, never.' The . Polish-born mother lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, with her husband . Zbigniew, 33, and their sons Wictor, two, and Daniel, who is now . five-months-old. She had . travelled to Nottingham for a weekend shopping with Daniel and her . father Edward as a Christmas present from her husband. She added: 'I was meant to be enjoying a weekend shopping and we were staying in the Hilton. 'But I obviously didn't enjoy myself and it was ruined. 'I have phoned them (Sports Direct) myself three times to chase the progress of it and was told that it is in process. In my opinion they don't treat it seriously. Scene: Mrs Komar claims she was left in tears outside the Sports Direct shop in Nottingham city centre (above) while trying to feed her son in the rain . 'Midwives and doctors say that it (breastfeeding) is best for the child but I feel so upset and frustrated about what has happened. 'I can't understand why a baby has to be punished for being hungry and why I need to feel like a criminal when I just want to feed my baby son.' Mrs Komar has also received support from other mothers including Laura Whatton - who was ejected from the John Carroll Leisure Centre in Nottingham in 2009. Mrs Whatton, who received an apology, said: 'I'm not surprised really. 'Everyone is prudish toward it, even though it's the most natural thing in the world.' Patti Rundall, policy director for Baby Milk Action, added: 'All mothers have a legally-protected right to breastfeed in public. 'It is important, it's their right and we will do what we can to support them.' The Equality Act 2010 states that it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. The act protects women who want to do so in shops or other public places. Sports Direct declined to comment. Wioletta Komar's experience is the latest in a number of incidents where mothers have been told to stop breastfeeding in public. In March, Heather Vaughan, 29, told how she was reduced to tears when staff at a naval museum ordered her to stop feeding her baby in its creche, telling her 'we donâ€™t do that here'. The mother-of-two said she felt victimised and humiliated at the museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Bosses apologised, saying it had simply been an 'error of judgment'. 'Error of judgment': Heather Vaughan was told to stop breastfeeding in the creche of a naval museum . Last October, a midwife spoke out after she was told to stop breastfeeding in a public swimming pool because the lifeguard thought it was 'offensive'. Sophie Howes was sat on the steps of the learner pool with her eight-month-old daughter Connie at a leisure centre in Ashford, Kent, when she was ordered to move. The manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in the pool. Sophie Howes (pictured, left, with her daughter Connie) and Michelle Garner (right, with baby Lois) were reprimanded in a swimming pool and a Morrisons supermarket respectively for breastfeeding . But the mother said: 'It is irrelevant whether I was in the water or not because that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with. 'She didn't mention health and safety issues, she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding.' Also in that month, supermarket giant Morrisons was forced to apologise to a mother after asking her to breastfeed her baby in the disabled toilets, which she described as 'grubby and dirty'. Michelle Garner, 31, was stunned when staff at her local store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., told her she should feed her six-week-old daughter Lois in the supermarket washroom. 'Just meeting baby's needs': Emily Slough was horrified when a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter Matilda on the steps of a restaurant (right) and uploaded it to Facebook calling her a 'tramp' In another case, a mother was forced to hit back at her critics after a picture of her breastfeeding in public was posted online calling her a 'tramp'. Emily Slough, 27, was horrified when a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter Matilda on the steps of a restaurant and uploaded it to Facebook. Her story caused a storm online and she was even branded a 'peasant' by an 'etiquette expert' on a local radio show. She hit back at critics, saying: 'I was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - I wasn't sitting there with my breast out. 'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs.'","Wioletta Komar, 25, claims she was forced to breastfeed baby in the rain .

"By . Ian Drury . The true cost of Britain’s military operations since the Cold War could be as high as £72billion. Most of it has been squandered on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seen as ‘strategic failures’, claims a respected defence think-tank. Toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein helped radicalise young Muslims in the UK, said the Royal United Services Institute. Taken down: Toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein helped radicalise young Muslims in the UK, said the Royal United Services Institute. A statue of him is pulled down (above) in Baghdad in an iconic image from April 2003 . Far from reducing international terrorism, the Iraq war ‘had the effect of promoting it’. It had left Britain open to homegrown attacks such as the July 7 London bombings in 2005. The authoritative study, Wars In Peace, was published as Tony Blair provoked criticism by urging the West to do more to tackle Islamic extremism. Critics said the cost of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and sending thousands of troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2006 - around £30billion and 627 lives lost - was simply not worth the results. Last night John Miller, 63, the father of Royal Military policeman Corporal Simon Miller, who was murdered by a mob in Iraq in 2003, said: ‘It is disgusting. ‘What have we actually achieved by spending that kind of money and losing that many troops’ lives in those conflicts? Nothing. Both places are worse off and thousands of people are still being killed.’ Attack: Far from reducing international terrorism, the Iraq war 'had the effect of promoting it', the RUSI. It had left Britain open to homegrown attacks such as the July 7 London bombings in 2005 (pictured) The study calculated the cost of UK . military interventions after the collapse of Communism, from the first . Gulf War in 1990-91 to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and EU . training missions last year, from Ministry of Defence freedom of . information responses. The bill for military action in the past . 24 years was £34.7billion. The sum is enough to pay nearly 5,000 nurses . or police officers for their entire career, or fund free university . tuition for all higher education students for a decade. Death: The father of Royal Military policeman Cpl Simon Miller (pictured), who was murdered by a mob in Iraq in 2003, branded the losses 'disgusting' This included £20.6billion in Afghanistan and £9.6billion during the Iraq war - 84 per cent of the total. Another £1.5billion was spent in Bosnia and £1.1billion in Kosovo on peacekeeping missions and £238million on the war in Libya. The figures do not include what the Armed Forces would have been spending on usual running costs such as training exercises, fuel, accommodation and pay. The study also estimates another £30billion may have to be spent on long-term care for war veterans and compensation payments for deaths and injuries could add another £7billion - bringing the total cost to £71.7billion. In the study, military analysts said the UK had succeeded in six out of ten major military operations - but failed in four. Interventions in the first Gulf War, Sierra Leone in 2000 and the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001 which drove out Al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership were among those praised. But the UK failed in Bosnia in the early 1990s, the 2003 invasion in Iraq, the deployment of troops to the insurgents’ stronghold of Helmand and the air strikes in Libya which helped oust Colonel Gaddafi but fuelled a brutal civil war. RUSI’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the Iraq deployment. It said: ‘Far from reducing international terrorism... the invasion had the effect of promoting it. ‘The rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was a reaction to this invasion, and to the consequent marginalisation of Iraq’s Sunni population. Claim: The RISI said the true cost of Britain's military operations since the Cold War could be as high as £72billion, and most of it has been squandered on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seen as 'strategic failures' ‘Today, AQAP and other radical jihadist groups stretching across the Iraqi-Syrian border, pose new terrorist threats to the UK and its allies that might not have existed, at least in this form, had Saddam remained in power.’ 'Far from reducing international terrorism... the invasion had the effect of promoting it' Royal United Services Institute . Sir David Omand, former senior security and intelligence adviser to Mr Blair, said that the term ‘War on Terror’ may have ‘helped to create the sense of an inevitable conflict between the west and the world of Islam’. However, he said Britain was now a safer place than at the time of the September 11 attacks on the US. The study said military action in Iraq and Afghanistan had dented the reputation of the Armed Forces and reduced the appetite for further overseas interventions. The failure of Parliament to vote for operations against Syria last year took place ‘in the shadow of Iraq’, said RUSI.","Most of it squandered on 'strategic failure' wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

"By . James Salmon . Barclays was yesterday mocked by furious shareholders for dishing out ‘Manchester United’-style bonuses for ‘Colchester United’ performance. In a bruising showdown at its annual general meeting, investors protested against the lavish pay and perks awarded by the High Street giant despite a 32 per cent slump in profits. More than a third of votes rejected or failed to back the bank’s remuneration report, which sanctioned a 10 per cent increase in bonuses to £2.38billion. Accused: Activists wearing masks of CEO Anthony Jenkins yesterday claimed Barclays promotes tax havens . And outside the meeting, held at London’s Royal Festival Hall, activists condemned the bank for helping large companies in Africa use tax havens to funnel money out of the country – allegations that Barclays denies. Investors, who received £859million in dividends last year, yesterday lined up to criticise the board for rewarding failure after repeatedly promising to curb the bank’s high-rolling pay culture. Shareholder Phil Clarke compared Barclays’ performance with that of Colchester United, which is fighting to avoid relegation from League One. He said: ‘I’m not a banker basher, I’m no anti-capitalist. But I do believe in paying for a good outcome. We’re paying for Manchester United but we’re getting Colchester United.’ Last year, 481 Barclays staff were paid £1million or more, up from 428 in 2012, while investment bankers received average bonuses of £60,100. Investor Edward O’Toole complained that Barclays’ culture has ‘transformed from one of prudence to management greed’. Shareholder Phil Clarke compared Barclays' performance to that of Colchester United fighting relegation . Last year, 481 staff were paid at least £1million, up from 428 in 2012. Bonuses averaged at £60,100 . The pay protest was led by insurer Standard Life, which owns almost 2 per cent of Barclays. Director Alison Kennedy told the Barclays board: ‘We are unconvinced the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders.’ She added that the pay row has had ‘negative repercussions on the bank’s reputation’. Sir John Sunderland, chairman of Barclays’ remuneration committee, was heckled by the meeting  after asking Miss Kennedy not to complain publicly. The protest is an embarrassing blow for . the bosses at Barclays who promised to end the high-pay  culture and . clean up its act after a raft of scandals, including a £290million fine . for rigging the Libor interest rate which influences the cost of loans . and mortgages. Controversy: The setback will come as an embarrassment for chief executive Anthony Jenkins . Last night Barclays also received a sharp rebuke from the Institute of Directors over the request to Miss Kennedy. Dr Roger Barker, of the IoD, said: ‘Shareholders own the company and it is right they have their say on how it is governed. ‘Shareholder engagement at public meetings should be encouraged, not criticised.’ Addressing the AGM, Sir John claimed the bank had taken the ‘difficult option’ by increasing payouts for staff. He said: ‘Do you think I and the board seek the level of invective that has come upon us? The easy option would have been to make a non-controversial decision around the bonus pool. But we would have seen a significant further exodus from the investment bank.’ Barclays chairman Sir David Walker also defended the pay rise, arguing it was necessary to stop investment bankers being poached by rivals. He even added that the bank had ‘cut them [bonuses] too far’ over the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012, which had contributed to double the usual number of investment bankers leaving last year. He said the bonus pool was ‘distorted’ because it docked £816million from payouts in 2012 to penalise staff for its £290million fine for rigging Libor interest rates. Without these penalties, he said, the bonus pool would have fallen by 18 per cent in 2013. But shareholder Michael Mason said: ‘Not a single banker has gone to jail. In Barclays you fixed the Libor rate – which affects millions of people. But you still get huge bonuses. How many people were paid bonuses for committing criminal and illegal acts?’","More than a third of votes rejected bank's plan for 10% bonus boost .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Labour party is preparing to pull the plug is looking to end its 90-year-old tie with the troubled Cooperative Bank. Ed Miliband’s officials are looking to move the party’s current account and a £1.2million loan to the trade union-controlled Unity Trust Bank. It would mark the end of a financial link dating back to the 1920s, but the Tories said the move would hand even greater power to the unions. The Labour party is preparing to move its business away from the Co-Op bank after more than 90 years . More than 30 Labour MPs are sponsored by the Co-operative Party, but relations have been strained by the crisis engulfing the group. The move by Labour to take its banking business elsewhere comes after a tumultuous period for the bank, which has seen big losses and the resignation of chairman Paul Flowers, who is now facing drug possession charges. Last week the Co-op Group revealed catastrophic losses of £2.5billion for 2013, leading acting chief executive Richard Pennycook to warn: 'This is a wake-up call that the Co-op does not have a God-given right to exist.' Euan Sutherland quit as chief executive of the vast group in March calling it a 'ungovernable'. Labour leader Ed Miliband is said to be considering putting the party's finances in the hands of the union-controlled Unity Trust Bank . The bulk of the losses relate to the Co-op's banking arm after a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances. It followed its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches. The Cooperative Movement and Labour joined as parties in the 1920s and the link-up with the banking arm is believed to have started then. Labour stressed that the change of tack was for ‘commercial reasons’, but the controversy over the past year is thought to have strained relations. The BBC reported that the bank - now 70 per cent-owned by American investors - was also keen to become ‘apolitical’. A party spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party is constantly reviewing its financial arrangements. All decisions are taken for commercial reasons.’ However the mooted switch to the Unity Trust Bank, which is 75 per cent owned by trade unions, was criticised by the Tories. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These proposals would hand the trade unions even more control over Ed Miliband and the Labour Party. ‘The unions already pick the candidates, buy the policies and choose the leader. Now Ed Miliband wants them to hold the purse strings as well. ‘If Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to the trade union barons then he is too weak to stand up for hardworking people.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby insisted the nation's values were based on the Christian faith . Britain is a Christian country, the Archbishop of Canterbury insisted today in boost for David Cameron in his row with atheists about his Easter message. Justin Welby said he agreed with the Prime Minister that the country's values had been ‘shaped and founded on’ the religion. But he admitted that proof of the importance of Christianity to the UK could not be found in attendance numbers at church, which have continued to fall over several years. Mr Cameron was criticised for saying . ‘we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country’ and ‘more evangelical’ about faith. The . Prime Minister also warned that people who ‘advocate some sort of . secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality, or . the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code’. The . article provoked a response from more than 50 leading public figures, . organised by the British Humanist Association, warning Mr Cameron risked . sowing ‘alienation and division’ in society. But . Arshbishop Welby said the response to the PM’s comments had been ‘all . quite baffling and at the same time quite encouraging’. He said the Christian faith is much more vulnerable to ‘comfortable indifference than to hatred and opposition’. Writing . on his blog, he added: ‘It is a historical fact (perhaps unwelcome to . some, but true) that our main systems of ethics, the way we do law and . justice, the values of our society, how we decide what is fair, the . protection of the poor, and most of the way we look at society... all . have been shaped by and founded on Christianity.’ He added: ‘It is clear that, in the general sense of being founded in Christian faith, this is a Christian country. ‘It . is certainly not in terms of regular churchgoing, although altogether, . across different denominations, some millions attend church services . each week. ‘Others of different backgrounds have also positively shaped our common heritage. ‘But . the language of what we are, what we care for and how we act is earthed . in Christianity, and would remain so for many years even if the number . of believers dropped out of sight (which they won't, in my opinion).’ David Cameron, pictured at an Easter event in Downing Street this month, sparked controversy with his claim that Britain is a Christan country . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also gave his support to Mr Cameron – despite being an atheist. Mr . Clegg said Britain's history and heritage was ‘infused by Christianity’ but people of ‘all faiths and none’ were able to share values of ‘fair . play and tolerance’. But he also called for the separation of the Church from the state. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for the separation of the Church and the state . On . his LBC 97.3 phone-in show Mr Clegg said: ‘I'm not a man of faith but I . don't find it particularly controversial to say, if you look at our . history, heritage, our architecture, our values, of course it is infused . by Christianity. ‘I'm slightly nonplussed by people getting very worked up about it. ‘I'm . not a practising man of faith but I don't find it an issue to say we . have an important Christian identity in terms of our history and . heritage and so on. ‘That is . not to say that somehow we are exclusively Christian, where everybody . is a Christian or indeed that we have got one Christian denomination - . there are almost as many Catholics as Anglicans in this country. ‘Of . course we should remember that one of the greatest Christian values - . if you want to put it that way - of tolerance, is that we are open to . people of other denominations, other faiths, of all faiths and none. ‘It's the senses of fair play and tolerance that makes our country very special.’ Mr . Clegg added: ‘Recognising our history and our heritage and who we are . and have been over several centuries doesn't mean that you have to say . you are a Christian to believe in tolerance and diversity, I'm just . saying that actually they are not incompatible with each other, that's . all.’ He said . disestablishing the Church of England, separating it from the state, . would be ‘better for Anglicans’ but accepted such a change would not . happen overnight.","Justin Welby says country's values are 'shaped and founded' on religion .

"By . James Chapman . Attack: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as bread-winners . Nick Clegg will today launch an extraordinary attack on ‘old-fashioned’ bosses who ‘raise an eyebrow’ when men ask for time off work to look after their children. The Deputy Prime Minister will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers. And he will claim more needs to be done to encourage men into caring professions such as childcare and nursing. Mr Clegg will hail the Government’s changes to parental leave rules, which are being torn up next year to smash what he calls an ‘Edwardian’ attitude that women rather than men should stay at home to look young children. It comes as a study found one in three fathers who work in the City of London took either no paternity leave or cut short their two-week entitlement. The research, carried out by Cityfathers, a new support group for working fathers in the City, also found that one in five men feared it would be 'career death' to ask for time off to look after their children. Speaking at the launch of the group today, Mr Clegg will say will say he has ‘fought to drag the clapped-out rules into the 21st century’. He will highlight new childcare . subsidies worth up to £2,000 year per child designed to encourage women . to return to work, insisting Britain ‘could boost its GDP by up to . £23billion if we use the skills of our female workforce more . effectively’. Mr Clegg will argue there is also a need . for a culture change across British industry to tackle ‘clapped-out’ attitudes to flexible, family-friendly working practices. He will say: ‘We need to challenge the ways in which many fathers are still pushed to see themselves as a breadwinner first and carer second – whether it’s by a manager’s raised eyebrow when you ask for some family time off, or your friends’ surprise when you say you’d like to be a stay-at-home parent if you could.’ Despite efforts to introduce flexible parental leave that can be shared between men and women and extend free childcare, there are still ‘hidden prejudices’ which limit women’s career ambitions and men’s ability to spend time with their families. The coalition’s reforms, he will say, are ‘only the start’. Reforms to parental leave, which come into effect next year, have been the subject of a fierce coalition argument and have split the business community. But the new study has raised fears that many fathers won't take advantage of the new rules, with one in three high-earners saying they won't be sharing their partner's maternity leave. Cityfathers founder Louisa Symington-Mills said: 'Employers need to give greater support to their employees who are working hard, juggling office and home life, otherwise the prospects look dim both for morale in organisations and for the government's plans for more flexible working.' The Institute of Directors has condemned the reforms as a ‘nightmare for small businesses’, but the Confederation of British Industry said it was pleased the Government had listened to concerns about how the system will operate. The reforms mean that from April next year, parents will be able to share 52 weeks of parental leave. New mothers will have to use the first two weeks, deemed important for recovery and bonding with a baby. But then, they will be able to transfer the rest of their time off to their partner – meaning  a father can tell his employer he wants as much as 50 weeks off. Alternatively, parents could each take 25 weeks to run concurrently. Nick Clegg’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife. Mr Clegg earns £134,565 a year as an MP and Deputy Prime Minister, while Miriam Clegg – a Spanish-born lawyer for international legal firm Dechert – earns £500,000. Three sons: Mr Clegg and his wife Miriam, who brings in a £500,000 salary from her legal work . The Cleggs live in a £1.6million townhouse in Putney, South-West London. They married in 2000 and have three sons – Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. Mrs Clegg has said previously that the pair split the childcare and her husband often tried to do the school run. She admitted they had a ‘fantastic nanny’ to help look after the children.","Men should not have to be the breadwinner, Deputy Prime Minister will say .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain has suffered the biggest squeeze on wages of any of the richest G7 countries, new research revealed today. While other major economies have seen pay levels return to pre-crash highs, wages in the UK were 6.1 per cent lower in real terms in 2012 than in 2007. To add to the misery, people in Germany and France who have seen growth in the salaries actually work fewer hours than Brits. Between 2007 and 2012, wages in the UK fell by 6.1 per cent in real terms, the biggest drop of any of the G& richest countries . Brits work longer hours than Germans and the French, who have seen a big increase in their wages . The UK has not seen the surge in unemployment which has blighted the economies of many European countries. At the end of last year 7.2 per cent of people were out of work in Britain, half the level seen in Portugal and a quarter of the figure seen in Spain (25.8 per cent) and Greece (28 per cent). Latest figures last week showed that the unemployment rate in the UK had fallen even further to just 6.9 per cent. However, a new analysis comparing the UK to other countries suggests pay has been squeezed at the expense of keeping jobless numbers down. It suggests employers have avoided laying off staff by cutting or freezing pay in the wake of the 2007 financial crash. The average unemployment rate varies from 28 per cent in Greece to just 3.7 per cent in Japan. Figures come from 2013 . George Osborne has set a target for full employment in the UK, but remains behind Germany, Canada and Japan for jobs figures . There have been stark increases in youth unemployment in many countries hit by the Eurozone crisis . The Office for National Statistics said that wages have been falling ‘markedly’ since 2007, and by 2012 were 6.1 per cent lower in real terms five years earlier. At the same time, wages were 4 per cent higher in Canada, 2.8 per cent higher in France and 3.1 per cent higher in Germany. Wages in the US were down only 0.2 per cent over the same period. The ONS said: ‘These trends point to differing economic conditions across the G7 countries. The notable fall in real wages for the UK compared with the US suggests that the labour market adjustment following the downturn has perhaps taken place more on the wages side for the UK – with nominal wage growth being less than the rate of inflation – and on the employment side for the US, with a notable increase in the unemployment rate. The European statistics body Eurostat has also compiled data on average earnings across the continent. It shows that annual earnings dropped off in the UK from 2008 – 2009 before recovering again in 2010 but not returning to 2008 levels by 2011. At the same time Sweden and Germany both saw a fall in earnings after 2008 but wage levels have risen consistently in subsequent years. Canad and France have seen real terms increases in pay in every year since 2009 . The Danes enjoy some of the highest wages in Europe, with Bulgarians receiving the lowest . By dividing the total national income among the number living in the country, researchers can compare the wealth of individuals in different parts of the world . Pay has fallen for people in the UK, despite them working longer hours. Brits worked 1,625 hours in 2012, well ahead of France (1,482 hours) and Germany (1,406 hours). Amongst the G7 leading economies, Americans worked the longest hours - 1,787 hours - in 2012, overtaking Italy on 1,772 hours. Chancellor George Osborne has set an ambition for ‘full unemployment’. At the end of 2013, 71 per cent of people in the UK were in work, up from 69 per cent in early 2010. But the UK remains behind Germany, Canada and Japan among the G7 – the world's leading developed economies. Almost 9 in 10 new jobs created last year in the UK went to Brits. Between October to December 2012 and October to December 2013 the total number of people in work employment in the UK increased by 425,000 to reach 30.24million. Of those, 367,000 UK nationals found work compared to 54,000 non-UK nationals. There have been stark increases in youth unemployment in many countries hit by the Eurozone crisis. In . early 2008, 22.5 per cent of young people were out of work in Greece . but the figure had rocketed to 58 per cent by the third quarter of 2013. Over . the same period the figure rose from 20.7 per cent to 56.7 per cent in . Spain and from 20.7 per cent to 49.7 per cent in Italy. In the UK the . figure increased from 13.8 per cent in 2008 to 20.7 per cent last year.","Between 2007 and 2012 wages in UK fell by 6.1% in real terms .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Ryan Giggs tried to steer David Moyes away from the rocks even as the Manchester United manager’s doomed reign entered its final throes. Giggs, United's interim boss following Moyes's sacking on Tuesday, became an increasingly peripheral figure in the Scot's backroom team and felt that his promotion to player-coach last summer was little more than a PR exercise to please supporters. But it did not stop the Old Trafford veteran making a personal plea to his former manager to show leniency to Ashley Young, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley after they were photographed partying into the early hours in Manchester following United’s Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich. Parted company: Ryan Giggs (left) with the now sacked David Moyes during their time together at United . Punished: Danny Welbeck (centre) was one of three players pictured out on the town at 3.20am . Moyes punished his three England internationals with a fine and ordered them to do extra training at Carrington last week. Giggs agreed that his team-mates were unwise to be out on the town so soon after high-profile defeat, but argued that they had not broken any specific rules. He also suggested that Moyes would not have taken such a hardline stance with some of the more senior members of his squad. Giggs knew . that the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the United . players, not just the three who were punished, and tried to convince . Moyes that it was the wrong thing to do. His plea went unheeded although . it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now he has been put in . temporary charge. The . issue was indicative of the way in which Moyes lost the support of his . squad over time. It was significant that the Scot did not mention them . in a statement on Wednesday, and there has been a notable silence from . the players on social media since he left the club.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A CPS clerk gagged an elderly widow and beat her to death on the morning she was due to go on a luxury cruise - before trying to kill himself, a court heard today. Old Bailey case worker Thomas Blazquez, 51, who knew 77-year-old Rosemary Shearman through his mother's bridge club, killed the pensioner as she waited for a taxi to take her to Dover. Mrs Shearman, from Platford Green, Hornchurch, east London was due to go on a ten-day voyage around the Norwegian fjords. Rosemary Shearman, 77, who was killed by Thomas Blazquez, 51, who she knew from his mother's bridge club . Blazquez, of Onslow Gardens, South Woodford, east London, who has worked on hundreds of infamous murder cases, met Mrs Shearman through his mother’s bridge club. It is alleged he angrily attacked the pensioner after she had just returned home from the hairdressers. Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said there was no clear motive for why the alleged murder took place. He said: ‘Having confronted Rosemary Shearman in her living room, frustration turned to anger and then to violence, with matters getting wholly out of hand.' Southwark Crown Court heard he bound the victim and forced a handkerchief into her mouth before he murdered her. Mrs Shearman was due to go on a cruise the morning she was killed. It is alleged she was beaten to death and tied up by Blazquez, who then allegedly tried to kill himself. The defendant denies murder . After the killing, Blazquez tried to commit suicide, jurors heard. Mr Dennis said: 'It is apparent that, having realised the enormity of what he had done, the defendant had finally resolved to end his own life, no doubt fearing the awful revelation of his dreadful acts of violence that morning.' Mrs Shearman’s body was found by neighbours on the first floor landing of her £500,000 detached home on September 3 last year. The court heard she had been beaten to her head and body, bound with tape and rope. Mr Dennis said: ‘The neighbours immediately assumed that she had been confronted by a burglar who had attacked her before fleeing the scene.' ‘However, while awaiting the arrival of the emergency services, they realised to their shock that her assailant was still in the house, apparently hiding in a first floor bathroom. ‘When the police arrived and forced open the bathroom door, they found the defendant, knife in hand, having cut himself to his neck and wrist in an apparent bid to commit suicide’. Blazquez worked for CPS London as a caseworker between January 1988 and November 2012. He was a familiar face at the Old Bailey, Snaresbrook Crown Court and Stratford Magistrates' Court. Mrs Shearman had lived in the house since 1979 and was a popular figure in the community. Her husband, Albert, a company director, passed away six years ago. Blazquez admits manslaughter but denies her murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A robber who stole £650 from a betting shop was caught by police - after they recognised his giant chin on CCTV. Ricky Loft, from Greenhithe, Kent, stormed into a William Hill bookies armed with an 'imitation gun', which was wrapped in a black bin liner. The 32-year-old thug pointed the weapon at staff and ordered a worker to fill a bag with cash. 'Prominent chin': Ricky Loft, 32, who raided a William Hill betting shop, was caught on CCTV camera after police recognised his prominent chin from a previous police mugshot . Loft, who was wearing a hood covering the top half of his face, then escaped from the shop on Whitstable high street. Staff from the betting shop reported the raid, which took place on November 21 last year, but could only describe the bottom half of the robber's face. But the breakthrough came when police examined CCTV footage from the betting shop - and spotted the raider had a 'prominent chin'. A mugshot of Loft, who was known to police before that incident, was already on police file. When police compared the mugshot to the CCTV stills, they noticed both men had a jutting chin - and that it must be the same man. A police . insider said: 'The key piece of evidence which nailed him was his prominent chin. Loft, who was wearing a blue hooded anorak which covered the top half of his face, threatened staff with an 'imitation gun' which was wrapped in a black bin liner, before escaping with £650 cash .

At Maidstone Crown Court, Loft was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to the robbery and possession of an imitation firearm. It is not known exactly what sort of imitation firearm Loft was carrying. A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed that local officers 'instantly recognised' Loft from the CCTV footage. He said: 'Through the use of CCTV footage detectives soon realised Loft was responsible for the armed robbery and he was arrested in London on 27 November.' Detective Sergeant Matt Scott, of the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said: 'On the evening of 21 November 2013, Ricky Loft was intent on making some money by whatever means he could think of.

"By . Emma Innes . A Parkinson's disease sufferer has ‘cured’ her symptoms by dancing to Mud's ‘Tiger Feet’. Christine Reeve has suffered from the disease for eight years but has only recently found she can walk and talk normally while listening to certain types of music. The 73-year-old from Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, has always loved dancing - but thought she'd never be able to hit the dance floor again when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Christine Reeve (pictured with her physiotherapist, Fiona Lindop) has discovered that listening to music helps her to cope with the symptoms of her Parkinson's disease . But doctors were stunned when she realised her body responded to music with a 'marching' beat - and she could walk around normally when listening to certain tunes. Mrs Reeve discovered the bizarre quirk when she told her physiotherapist she longed to 'have a little jig' - and he found her an iPod with some tunes. She said: ‘Without the music, I'm just somebody who has Parkinson's - with it, it's like an instant fix. It's like I'm back in control of myself again. ‘I started with “Tiger Feet” by Mud, and then some marching music - and I found, with the right beat, I suddenly had control over what I did. ‘I could march backwards and forwards, I could jig on the spot and I could dance. ‘It only worked while the music was on and with certain songs but, with things like “Tiger Feet”, I could kick about and I just had this confidence I didn't have before.’ Mrs Reeve says one of the songs she finds most help is Mud's 'Tiger Feet'. Image shows the band Mud . Mrs Reeve was told she had Parkinson's disease eight years ago, after she found she was dragging her foot and noticed problems with her right hand. The disease often leaves her feeling unwell and struggling to move about the house. After her diagnosis, she was referred to the hospital for support on how to manage her condition. 1) Marches for the Connoisseur - the Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards . 2) Tiger Feet - Mud . 3) Bad Moon Rising - Creedence Clearwater Revival . 4) Scarlet and Gold Fanfare - the Band of the Grenadier Guards . 5) McNamara's Band - Bing Crosby . This included a six-week course about the condition, medication, physiotherapy and advice from a dietician. But, some days, Mrs Reeve said Parkinson's left her feeling ‘off-colour’ and ‘fragile’, with walking and even talking difficult. The pensioner said: ‘To begin with, I was devastated and I was really worried about what having the condition would mean for me. ‘On top of that, I didn't like the idea of going to hospital regularly because of it. I really struggled with that and was plucking up the courage to go.’ As a result of the disease Mrs Reeve finds it extremely difficult to multi-task, and struggles with walking and talking at the same time. Her husband Peter, 72, said: ‘There's a lot of things you can't do when you have Parkinson's which I guess we would all take for granted. ‘So, for example, Christine can't . multi-task very well. If we walk into the village and I talk to her, she . has to stop before she can speak back. Mrs Reeve was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago and without music she struggled to walk, and even to talk. She says the music gives her a break from the symptoms . ‘If we go for a walk somewhere she has to constantly look down and pick her feet up over tree roots. Things are an effort.’ But when Mrs Reeve puts on headphones and hears certain songs - in particular marching band music - her body responds and she has even able to dance. Mr Reeve said: ‘Christine is always of good cheer but Parkinson's can sometimes, understandably, leave her feeling low. ‘But her eyes just seem to light up when the music plays. ‘When we . go on a walk, it's usually me leading the way and Christine dragging . across the fields behind me but, with her headphones on, she walks like . normal. Mrs Reeve says music helps her temporarily regain control of her body . ‘We can't explain it but it just has such an all-round positive effect on her.’ Mrs Reeve added: ‘I like music with a deep, resounding beat but it's got to be the right beat. ‘That's why I like the marches so much. A strong beat and a good bass - those are the things which work best. Parkinson's disease is a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively more and more damaged over many years. It causes involuntary shaking and tremors, muscle stiffness and a slowing down of the physical movements. It can also result in depression, daytime sleepiness and swallowing difficulties. Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. This leads to a reduction in the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain. This chemical plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. It . is not known exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells but a . combination of genetics and environmental factors are thought to be . responsible. About one in every 500 people develop Parkinson's disease and most people start to develop symptoms around the age of 60. One in 20 cases develop in people under the age of 50. There is no cure for Parkinson's disease and it is not fatal so many patients have a near-normal life expectancy. However, it can cause severe disability in people who respond less well to treatment. Source: NHS Choices . ‘I'm not as bothered about the lyrics; it's all about the music. It's like the music lets me have a break.’ Fiona Lindop, from the Parkinson's team at Derby's London Road Community Hospital, said they are extremely impressed with her progress. Now they have applied for funding to carry out further research into the link between Parkinson's disease and music. Ms Lindop said: ‘It really was miraculous to see. All of Christine's anxiety seemed to disappear with the music. ‘It was almost like the music freed up Christine's mind and took the effort away she normally faces when walking or talking. The music seemed to take over.’ She added that she had not seen anything like it before but had started using music to help other patients. She said: ‘We know that using a metronome can sometimes help patients with Parkinson's. It's a technique called cueing and, like the music, it helps with walking because it sets the pace. ‘But I can't quite find anyone using music quite like this and, when I showed videos of Christine's progress at a congress in Montreal, they were fascinated. ‘I've tried it since with four others, with different results. One gentleman didn't respond to marching music but did to “I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)” by the Proclaimers. ‘And another gentleman did get on well with the marching music and said it reminded him of his past.’ Ms Lindop and her team have now applied to Parkinson's UK for £35,000 and the Dunhill Medical Trust, a charity which offers grants, for £36,000 to carry out research. The pilot study would aim to show music was more effective than a metronome in helping people with Parkinson's walk as well as looking at effects other symptoms, such as insomnia, difficulty swallowing, dementia and cognitive impairment. Parkinson's disease is an incurable neurological condition and symptoms include tremors, rigidity and slowness of movement. It can also cause tiredness, pain and depression.","Christine Reeve was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . No sooner had one regime slunk out of the back gates at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground than another was driving in through the front. Before 9am on Wednesday, Paul Scholes was back at his spiritual football home. The story of Scholes and United this season serves, in many ways, as a window into the uncertain, unhappy world of David Moyes. Moyes, sacked by United on Tuesday morning, thought he had offered Scholes a role last autumn and briefly the former Old Trafford midfielder worked with Nicky Butt and the Under 19s. Class of '92: (R-L) Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes are on United's coaching staff . Old times: All coaches along with Gary Neville and David Beckham were in the 1992 FA Youth Cup Final team . Reunion: Four of the six from The Class of '92 will be in the United dugout . Soon, though, the relationship was in . pieces, with Scholes heading back home to Oldham under the impression . Moyes didn’t want him. On Wednesday morning, United’s interim manager Ryan Giggs had repaired the damage . with a single phone call and his former team-mate was back amongst it at . first-team training. United’s . technical area will begin to resemble a screen grab from the Class of . ’92 movie when Norwich arrive in the Barclays Premier League on . Saturday. Giggs, for his . part, knows that his role as United manager will be a cameo. He will not . be considered for the post at this stage and is aware the incoming . manager — set to be foreign — may not want him either. Between now and . the end of the season, though, he will attempt to turn back time and it . is hard to blame him. Before . telling the United squad on Tuesday afternoon that he was bringing in . Scholes and indeed Butt, Giggs sat the players down and delivered a . simple message. ‘Ryan was . very straightforward, as always,’ revealed an informed source. ‘He told the  players it was time to go back to playing like Manchester . United. Wide smile: Giggs arriving at Carrington as he plans for United's Premier League game against Norwich . Interim manager: Giggs will take temporary charge at United after the dismissal of David Moyes . Ginger ninja: Scholes has returned to the club after getting the impression that he was not wanted by Moyes . Support act: Giggs and Phil Neville join Moyes in the dugout during a game against West Ham at Upton Park . David Moyes was mocked by United’s players for reading a self-help book called Good to Great, and it is no wonder when you look at some of the bizarre advice it offers: . ● Keep it simple — be a hedgehog, not a fox.● Achieve BHAGs — big hairy audacious goals.● Create alignment by results, not hoopla.● Avoid the Doom Loop.● 1) Get the right people on the bus. 2) Get the right people in the right seats. 3) Get the wrong people off the bus. ‘He said it was . time to get on the front foot, to press and to start dictating games. Like everyone else in the room, he is fed up worrying about the . opposition all the time. ‘He wants this team to be ruthless, brave and unforgiving, just as it used to be.’ Giggs . — for all his understandable denials — is known to have disagreed with . Moyes’s tactics. On more than one occasion, he tried to persuade Sir . Alex Ferguson’s successor to change his outlook. The . style the 40-year-old will attempt to impose on Saturday at Old . Trafford will owe much more to Ferguson — and indeed his first youth . coach Eric Harrison — than it will the man who drove out through . Carrington’s rear entrance after his dismissal. Not so great Scot: Moyes failed to live up expectations, losing 11 league games during his tenure . Back to the future: Giggs has told players they will return to playing 'the Manchester United' way . In the frame: Giggs realises that Louis van Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti are favourites to take the job permanently . Giggs . has told central midfielders including Tom Cleverley that they are not . to sit alongside holding player Michael Carrick any more but to move . into advanced positions and hurt the opposition when United have the . ball. Cleverley, who has . struggled more than most this season, is expected to start against . Norwich, as is another academy product, Danny Welbeck, and Adnan . Januzaj. Not surprisingly, Giggs will jettison Marouane Fellaini and, . more controversially, is giving thought to leaving out Juan Mata. If . United start without almost £60m of Moyes signings then it will . represent a staggering indictment of the mistakes of the past eight . months. Fellaini has been so poor that Moyes himself had started to drop . him while Mata’s form has been lamentable since United signed him in . January. Respected figures . in the game have been critical of Mata’s inability to influence games . going against United since he moved from Chelsea and there is no way . Giggs will select players he believes don’t have the courage to receive . possession in difficult areas. Mentor: Giggs will try and implement a style of play learned under his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson . Mutiny? Reports of unrest among seniors players in the United dressing room persist . On . Saturday, Old Trafford will witness a highly motivated United team. It . could well be that Norwich suffer. United, with nothing of worth left to . play for, will attack the game unshackled, motivated by a desire to . show they are better off without Moyes. There . remains a key group of senior players who believe Moyes has tried to . turn public opinion against them. That is a dubious assertion. Nevertheless, motivated footballers can do remarkable things and it . would be no surprise if United finish their miserable season with a . flourish that will remind people of their true worth. The . United board — with the Glazers in attendance — will look on with . interest. As they continue their efforts to turn the heads of Louis van . Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti towards Manchester these coming days, they are . aware that a few Giggs victories will start a bandwagon of public . opinion in favour of the Welshman’s appointment. Whatever . happens, he will not get the job this time. It could, however, be fun . watching him try and that particular commodity has been rather thin on . the ground in Stretford this season. On the attack: Tom Cleverley will be encouraged to take up more forward positions in United's midfield . Collateral damage: New signings Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini could lose their places under Giggs .

It was a penalty, there is no conspiracy theory and Jose Mourinho is finally being seen for what he is; an excellent coach who is a graceless and immature man who needs to learn how to lose. In football there are some things which are indisputable, some fouls which stand out as obvious and red cards which nobody can deny – Ramires' assault on Sebastian Larsson in this game being a case in point. However there are a lot of incidents which fall into the ‘grey area’ category and no matter how much they are debated agreement cannot be found. Sunderland’s penalty was just such an incident. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Jose Mourinho . Down: Cesar Azpilicueta fouls Jozy Altidore to give away a penalty during Sunderland's win against Chelsea . Tough call: Jozy Altidore and Cesar Azpilicueta collided in the area with referee Mike Dean pointing to the spot . Cesar Azpilicueta slid in to challenge Jozy Altidore and made no contact with the ball. The striker’s foot came down on Azpilicueta’s outstretched leg which caused him to lose balance and go to ground. In such circumstances and with the game close to ending I used to try and err on the side of caution and only award stone-wall penalty kicks. However if an assistant flags and indicates a penalty then you support him. Mike Dean followed that protocol after his assistant, Stuart Burt, did exactly that. Slap: Chelsea midfielder Ramires could face disciplinary action after slapping Sebastian Larsson in the face . Unpunished: Mike Dean was just a few feet away but his attention appeared to be elsewhere . Making a case: Larsson speaks to referee Mike Dean about the incident . The more times I look at the replay the harder I find it to state unequivocally what the correct decision should be. At the end of the game Mourinho thought he was being ‘clever’ by complimenting Dean and then his boss, Mike Riley. All listening knew what he meant by the comments but the FA will struggle to charge on ‘interpretation’ of words and rising above such puerile antics is the best way to deal with them. Mourinho must now contemplate the rest of the domestic season without the rash Ramires as it is clear from replays that despite his position Dean was looking away as the Brazilian struck his opponent. As for Rui Faria the FA MUST act very strongly and show that such disgraceful behaviour is completely unacceptable.

"By . Bianca London . A woman dumped in a box as a baby outside a stranger's house on a freezing night just hours after being born is hoping to finally trace her birth parents. Sarah Keating, now aged 34, said she has 'no hard feelings' towards them but just wants to find out what happened and why. Initially named Elaine after the WPC who dropped the 7lb 1oz baby at a hospital, she is hoping Facebook can finally lead her to her parents. On the hunt: Sarah Keating, now aged 34, was dumped in a box as a baby outside a stranger's house just hours after being born in 1980 - and now she is determined to track down her birth parents . Extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital and her foster mother by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth. In a heartbreaking appeal, mother-of-two Sarah said: 'I would love to know who my parents are, not necessarily to have a relationship but I just want to know what happened. 'I would just love to know what my mother looks like. We had a gathering at Christmas with my husband Daniel's family and my two sons have always resembled them. 'I have never looked like anyone.' The fateful night: Initially named Baby Elaine after the WPC who dropped the 7lb 1oz baby at a hospital, she is hoping Facebook can finally lead her to her parents after she was abandoned on a freezing cold night 34 years ago . Appealing directly to her birth parents, she said: 'I would like to know what happened so please contact me. 'There are no hard feelings. I have had a great life and I could not wish for a better mum and dad but I am just intrigued to find out what happened and why.' Sarah was left outside Joan Sheldon-Williams' front door in Headington, Oxford, on the night of January 18, 1980. All the retired librarian heard was a loud bang and the sound of someone running away. When she saw the box, Miss Sheldon-Williams thought it was old clothes dropped off by a friend, and it was only when she took it indoors she discovered the new-born girl, naked apart from a towel. Search: Extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth (pictured here back in hospital after being left on a librarian's doorstep) She immediately called the police and the infant was whisked to the nearby John Radcliffe Hospital, where the only harm seemed to be bruising consistent with what was called 'an unassisted birth'. Sarah said: 'I think I was born in the hospital grounds. A man was seen at the hospital carrying a box around and I was on a doorstep that was very close to the hospital. As she is today: Sarah, who lived in an Oxfordshire village until she was aged six years and now lives in Hull and is a married mother of two . 'My mum and my dad and I have always thought she (her birth mum) was very young and scared because back then having a baby at that age was frowned upon. 'We just won't know until more information comes to light but that is my theory.' As part of the new appeal, she posted photographs of herself as a baby and the box she was discovered in and the Facebook page has now been shared around the world, with the pictures viewed tens of thousands of times. Her adoptive parents told her the story at an early age but it was only as a teenager and then when she became a mother of two sons, now aged nine and five years, that she became increasingly keen to trace her mother. Sarah, who lived in an Oxfordshire village until she was aged six years and now lives in Hull, has had files from the police that have given her a lot of information, 'but not quite enough', and asked social services if anyone ever came forward but has never made the crucial breakthrough. It was only after she read about another abandoned baby on Facebook that she thought the social media site could help in her search. 'I never thought I would get anywhere,' said Sarah, who runs her own cleaning company. 'I thought I would try Facebook and I just cannot believe the response. 'People have been putting messages on and I never expected it. It's just overwhelming.' Sarah was placed in the foster care of Margaret Kyrie in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, as police chased up leads in Oxford, Coventry, Rugby and Nuneaton, where the chocolate mousse box that carried her was originally from. Evidence: Sarah, who was left in this chocolate mousse box, had files from the police that have given her a lot of information, 'but not quite enough' and now she seeks more . Baby Elaine: At 11 weeks 'Elaine' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in East Riding, Yorkshire when she was aged six years. She now goes by the name of Sarah . There were six telephone calls from a distressed woman claiming to be the mother to the hospital and others later to Mrs Kyrie after a nationwide appeal for help. At 11 weeks 'Elaine' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in East Riding, Yorkshire when she was six years old. Rather prophetically, in a fresh appeal for information six months after Sarah was abandoned, Detective Inspector Alan Bowmaker said: 'The file will never close but it may be years and years before we ever hear anything on this again.' Sarah is hoping that time may have come.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Carol Payne, 32, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, pictured outside Birmingham Crown Court, abused her position to swindle the cash . A treasurer who stole almost £43,000 from a church collection and a school minibus fund and used the cash to pay her child’s tuition fees has been jailed for two and a half years. Carol Payne, 32, abused her position as a member of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School in Birmingham to swindle £11,552, which had been allocated to buy a bus for the benefit of pupils. She also took £31,300 from a Methodist church’s collection fund, which was supposed to be used for the benefit of the congregation - among whom were members of her own family. The fraudster even tricked her own mother-in-law into counter signing cheques from Saltley Methodist Church in order to pay the money into her own account. Payne, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, used the cash - stolen mostly through numerous cheque payments - to pay the private school fees of her seven-year-old daughter, who attended Highclare, and to fund the rent on her family’s four-bedroom house. The mother - who was chosen for the treasury role because she had a background in accountancy – pleaded guilty to stealing from Highclare School, as well as further offences of fraud and false accounting in relation to the church at an earlier court hearing. At a sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court today, Recorder Mark Warby QC told Payne: ‘There’s nothing wrong with aiming high, but you used other people’s money to fund your aspirations.’ He added: ‘It did not take long after you were appointed treasurer at the school, you were dipping the funds being raised for the minibus of children. So it was the children and the parents who were your victims. ‘I accept you took on the role of treasurer at the church with sound motivations, but then still you took £31,300. ‘These are very serious matters - you were given a high degree of trust.

It has caused a huge split in the family. ‘She’s also lost her house and her child’s education.’ A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is set to take place this year in a bid to recover some of the stolen cash.","Carol Payne abused her position to steal £11,552 from Birmingham school .

"By . Misty White Sidell . One ambitious young artist has transplanted a chocolate-making factory line from his native Colombia to New York City to create 7,000 candies per day – all of which will be free to the public. By showcasing Colombia’s popular Chocmelo marshmallow candy as art, Oscar Murillo, 28, hopes to create a narrative about globalization, immigration, and community inside the renowned David Zwirner gallery. The exhibit, titled ‘A Mercantile Novel’, which opens today, brings a piece of Mr Murillo’s hometown of La Paila, Colombia to the U.S. – including 13 factory workers who have never before left their native country. Transplanted: Artist Oscar Murillo has brought Colombia's Colombina chocolate factory to New York City's David Zwirner gallery . In-house operation: The factory will produce 7,000 of Colombina's Chocmelo candies each day, which will be free to the public . Outward view: David Zwirner's 19th Street outpost is located in New York's West Chelsea neighborhood, home to the city's most famous art galleries . Mr Murillo did not choose to feature the Chocmelo on a whim. Rather, he feels a strong connection to candy’s owner, Colombina – his hometown’s largest employer – as generations of his family have worked in the company’s factories, including his own parents. His latest exhibit, housed in Mr Zwirner’s 19th Street location, hopes to offer both strong in-person and social media experiences for gallery-goers. As Mr Murillo explained in a press conference yesterday afternoon, the show is a ‘social endeavor.’ Upon entering A Mercantile Novel, guests are greeted by an acute sugar smell, which materializes all around in crates and trays full of Chocmelos that are free for the taking. Its lobby . is filled with TVs displaying a live feed of the factory line that has . been set up within the gallery – an area which has been cut off from . guests for sanitary purposes. The streaming footage can also be viewed . online throughout the show’s run. It . depicts Colombina employees, dressed in stark white uniforms and . goggles, creating a pillowy confection that is one of Colombina’s . best-sellers throughout Latin America, with nearly 5million pieces . clearing store shelves each year. Bright young thing: Mr Murillo (center, black shirt) is only 28, but has already shown at LACMA and the Saatchi Gallery, since signing with David Zwirner in September 2013 (pictured, Mr Murillo poses with members of the Colombina staff inside his new exhibit) Special design: Mr Murillo has custom created the smiley face wrappers for his exhibition, as a way to merge a NYC icon with that of Colombina . Gallery-goers will receive the . chocolate-covered marshmallows in a wrapper that Mr Murillo has . custom-designed to provide subliminal commentary on the exhibit’s deeper . meaning. The silver . envelopes come branded with Colombina’s signature red, white, and blue . logo, as well as the bright yellow smiley face that adorns many of New . York’s plastic shopping bags. In . merging the two icons, the London-based artist somewhat simplistically . represents the A Mercantile Novel’s personal message – which touches . upon his own experiences with Colombina as well as trans-Atlantic . immigration. It's a touching sentiment that carries throughout his entire body of art which most often takes the form of large-scale paintings. A young success by art's standards, Mr Murillo has already exhibited in esteemed locations including the Saatchi Gallery and LACMA since first joining the David Zwirner gallery in September 2013. Restricted area: While press were able to navigate the factory facilities yesterday, gallery goers will see the candy process on live stream footage, screened on TVs in the gallery lobby . Ever the millennial, Mr Murillo's shiny, Instagram-friendly wrappers also accomplish another of the exhibit’s main objectives – for gallery-goers to share their Chocmelo experience on social media. Because there is no limit to how many Chocmelos guest may take, Mr Murillo hopes that patrons will offer the candies to their friends, families, even strangers, while documenting this shared enjoyment with photos tagged #MercantileNovel. But the . show is much more than just a load of free candy, or even using candy as . a decorative medium, as artists like Will Cotton have so successfully . accomplished in the past. It has afforded 13 Colombians the opportunity to leave their country for the very first time. The . candy technicians have arrived to the U.S. on special artists’ visas, . and will work the gallery’s regular hours of 10am to 6pm from Tuesday . through Saturday. Deeper meaning: Mr Murillo's family, including his mother (pictured) have worked at the Colombina factory, which is his hometown's single largest employer . Throughout A Mercantile Novel’s nearly three-week-long run, they will reside in a community of apartments in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. César Caicedo, Colombina’s CEO, told MailOnline that the experience ‘has been incredible – we were afraid that so many parts in the process would get stuck, but it ended up working perfectly. It’s almost too good to be true.’ From Colombina’s perspective, A Mercantile Novel is an interesting way to introduce its products to the American audience. Mr . Caicedo said that ‘From a commercial point of view it’s nice to show . Americans that there is a company down in South America that has good . vibes, that is making delicious candy…and wants to give prosperity to . people who work for the company.’ Millennial concept: Guests are encouraged to share these packages with friends, families, and even strangers, while documenting the entire experience on Instagram . Last evening at dinner held in the project’s honor at Mr Zwirner’s Manhattan townhouse, the entire Colombina fleet broke out into a celebratory salsa dance. Mr Caicedo says that ’One of the girls told me when we were dancing: “I never dreamt I would be dancing salsa in a beautiful home in New York” It’s a short phrase that describes a lot.’","Oscar Murillo's A Mercantile Novel will produce 7,000 candies each day at the David Zwirner gallery in New York .

"By . Deni Kirkova . It's an art that divides opinion but no-one can deny the fantastical taxidermy produced by the Victorians pushed creative boundaries. One of the best was British taxidermist, Walter Potter, whose eccentric creations included rabbit schoolchildren and cigar-smoking squirrels. Now his unusual oeuvre is the subject of a new book that includes a carefully curated selection of photos of his finest works. In Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy, photographs of some of his most famous taxidermy projects are featured . Potter, who died in 1918, specialised in anthropomorphic tableaux that became some of the most famous examples of the Victorian penchant for all things whimsical. Like his contemporary, Beatrix Potter (no relation), Potter's work focused on the cuter members of the animal kingdom, with squirrels, rabbits and kittens among his favourite subjects. Despite the cutesy scenes for which he is famous, Potter was also a fan of other taxidermist's work, eventually amassing more than 10,000 pieces. Most went into a tiny museum in that he owned in Bramber, Sussex, and included a multi-legged kitten, a two-headed lamb, and a bewildering assortment of other curios. Potter's inspired and beguiling creations of squirrels playing cards, kittens enjoying an afternoon of croquet, rabbits diligently at their schoolwork, and more have found fans in the contemporary art world and beyond . British taxidermist Walter Potter has a new book that includes a carefully curated selection of photos of his finest works, like rabbits at school, pictured here . In spite of his enthusiasm for collecting, it was his beguiling tableaux featuring squirrels playing cards, kittens enjoying an afternoon of croquet, rabbits diligently at their schoolwork, that gained him legions of fans in the art world and beyond. And it is these striking creations that are the focus of the new book on his work, which features pieces chosen taxidermy expert Dr. Pat Morris and new photographs by Joanna Ebenstein. Darkly witty and affecting, Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy makes a charming, whimsical (and yes, slightly morbid) gift. Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy, Â£20, is published by Constable and is available from Amazon . Potter, who died in 1918, specialised in anthropomorphic tableaux. His work focused on the cuter members of the animal kingdom, with squirrels, rabbits and kittens among his favourite subjects . Wlater Potter's tiny museum in Bramber, Sussex, included a multi-legged kitten, a two-headed lamb, and a bewildering assortment of other curios. During the Victorian era, taxidermy - or the art of stuffing and preserving dead animals - was enormously popular. Many, like Potter who made his first attempt at taxidermy as a teenager when his pet canary died, were amateur enthusiasts, although others went on to create pieces as a professional. Whether amateur or pro, taxidermy involves skinning the subject before applying tanning or preserving chemicals to the skin. Next, the skin is mounted on a mannequin made from wood, wire or wool before eyes made from clay or glass are added. Although modern taxidermists generally use traditional means to preserve their animal subjects, some have embraced expensive freeze drying while others, particularly those who specialise in fish, create lifelike resin sculptures using the subject's measurements and let the real beast swim off.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The effects of zero gravity on our muscles, bones and joints have been extensively studied. But while living in space is known to weaken our immune system, no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long-term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment. Now a new ISS experiment will seek to answer that very question, and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts. An ISS experiment known as the Cellbox Mission will test how Phagocytes (pictured), cells that are important to our immune system, are impaired by being in a zero gravity environment . Known as the Cellbox Mission, the experiment was carried to the International Space Station (ISS) by SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which berthed with the station yesterday. It will be run by a team from the University of Zurich’s Institute of Anatomy, led by Professor Oliver Ullrich. The experiment contains a cargo of immune cells. In zero gravity, various immune system functions are known to be impaired. In particular phagocytes, cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies, are unable to work properly. The unmanned Dragon capsule from the private US firm SpaceX successfully reached the International Space Station yesterday. It is the third scheduled cargo mission for the capsule to the ISS, known as CRS-3, and its fourth visit in total. The capsule has delivered 2.2 tons of cargo including food and 150 experiments to the astronauts on board. It will spend several weeks attached to the station before returning to Earth with finished experiments and waste. They can't reliably protect astronauts from infections, which is why even minor contamination can be a problem. Professor Ullrich will be studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the ISS. Over three days, they will be studied to determine if zero gravity has any lasting effects on these important cells. The researchers want to know whether, when astronauts ultimately return to Earth, their immune systems are irrevocably damaged from the trip to space. Previous experiments with limited zero gravity, including parabolic aircraft flights and research rockets, have shown that cells respond to the absence of gravity within seconds. Key molecular functions for cell-to-cell communication and cell migration are immediately impaired. The mission was carried to the ISS by the Dragon spacecraft, pictured, which successfully berthed yesterday . ‘Conducting research on the ISS is as if – after studying many trees one by one – you climb a mountain to see the whole forest,’ Professor Ullrich explains in a release. The experiment is not only delving into modern human biology, however. The team will also be hoping to discover if certain conditions, such as having gravity, are crucial for the development of complex multicellular life. This could provide information on whether Earth is the ideal place for life evolve or if, even in space, cells can adapt to their environment. ‘Conducting research in space enables us to understand life on Earth better,’ explains Professor Ullrich. But, if nothing else, the Cellbox Mission will provide key data to gauge the risk to astronauts on future spaceflights.","An experiment known as the Cellbox Mission has been taken to the ISS .

"By . Emma Innes . These remarkable pictures show the ‘giraffe women’ of eastern Burma. These Kayan women, from Kayah state, wear brass coils around their necks to give the impression that their necks are stretched. Having a long neck is often seen as beautiful in Kayan culture. The Kayan women of eastern Burma wear brass rings around their necks to make them appear longer . They can start wearing the rings from the age of five and tend to add more rings as they get older . While the neck rings make the women’s necks appear long, in reality, the weight of the coils pushes down the muscles around the collarbone and compresses the rib cage - meaning their necks appear longer than they are. The women – who can start wearing the rings from the age of five - have a long piece of brass wound in a spiral around their necks. The metal is wound manually by the women and, as brass is tough, this process can take many hours. A full set of the neck rings can weigh as much as 10 kilos - but few of the women now wear a full set. Most women gradually increase the number of coils on their rings to steadily increase the apparent length of their necks. Despite the weight of the rings, the women wearing them experience little restriction to their movement. The rings do not actually stretch the women's necks - the weight pushes down their collarbones and compresses their rib cages making their necks appear longer . The women can remove the rings but they tend not to as it can be uncomfortable and the skin underneath tends to be discoloured . And, as the coiling and uncoiling process takes so long, the women rarely remove the rings – they usually only do so to replace them with a longer version. The coils can be safely removed even though the muscles underneath are weakened. However, many women prefer not to have them removed as their necks and collarbones are left bruised and discoloured underneath and they suffer discomfort when they are removed. Additionally, when they have been wearing the rings for a long time, many of the women say they feel they have become an integral part of their bodies and they feel 'naked' without them. The rings are made of long pieces of brass that are wrapped around the neck to form coils . Many of the women say that if they remove the rings they feel naked and vulnerable . It is not known why the women started wearing the rings but there are many theories . After a few days of not wearing the rings, the discomfort fades, but the discolouration tends to remain. It is not clear exactly how the tradition of wearing the neck rings came about. There are theories that women wore them to protect against tiger bites or that they were worn to make them look more like the dragons of local legends. Other people believe they started wearing them to make themselves less attractive to other tribes so they were less likely to be taken into slavery. Some people believe women originally wore the rings to protect themselves from tiger bites - other people think they were designed to make them unattractive so they were less likely to be taken into slavery . Now, most of the women wear the rings because they are seen as beautiful and to preserve the tradition . Some women wear the rings because they attract tourists and tourists bring vital revenue to the community . However, when asked, most of the women will now say they wear them to preserve their cultural identities. Kayan women are usually now given a choice as to whether or not they want to wear the neck rings. Most of those who still do, do so because they see them as beautiful or because they want to preserve the tradition. It is also likely that some wear them because they attract tourists who bring vital revenue to the community. The rings are wound around the women's necks and this can take several hours as the brass is very tough . Surprisingly, the rings do not significantly restrict the women's movement . A full set of the neck rings can weigh up to 10 kilos but few women wear these any longer .","The Kayan women wear coils around their necks to make them look longer .

She will then lose the ability to walk and look after herself and she is unlikely to survive into her teens. Scroll down for video . Eliza O'Neill, four, has a rare degenerative condition which will soon leave her unable to speak or walk unless a cure can be found in the next six month . However, she is currently healthy and a hospital has a potential cure for her illness. But, there is no money to pay for the treatment to be produced and trialled. As a result, Eliza's parents, Glenn, 41, and Cara, 39, are trying to raise the necessary $1 million before it is too late to save their daughter. On the fundraising video, which has gone viral, Mr O'Neill says: 'You know where it's heading - it's heading towards suffering, it's headed towards pain for her and as a father you want to be able to protect your children. 'This trial really is the only chance she has.' Eliza seemed completely health for the first two or three years of her life but then her parents and teachers began to notice her development was slightly delayed. Glenn and Cara O'Neill have raised more than half a million dollars in the past two weeks thanks to a viral video which helps explain their plight of their 4-year-old daughter Eliza. They are pictured with Eliza and her older brother, Beckham . Until Eliza was about three, she was thought to be perfectly health. She was only diagnosed after starting to show signs of developmental delay. Currently she is healthy but will soon start to deteriorate . They thought she might have autism or a mild learning disability. However, a geneticist friend of Mrs O'Neill suggested that it was worth having a genetic test done just in case. Sanfilippo Syndrome is a metabolism disorder which is passed down through families. It occurs when the enzymes that are needed to break down heparan sulfate sugar chains are missing or defective. This causes the toxic substance to build up in the body and brain. Sufferers are initially healthy but start to show signs of a decline in learning ability between the ages of two and six. They then slowly deteriorate and those with Type A - the most severe form - often do not survive into their teens. Children can only inherit the condition if both of their parents are carriers - in that situation, the child has a 25 per cent chance of being a sufferer. Mr and Mrs O'Neill were so unconcerned at . this stage that Mr O'Neill did not even attend the appointment when the . results were given. However, Mrs O'Neill, herself a paediatrician, was told the horrifying news that Eliza had Sanfilippo Syndrome. She said: 'This is really bad, this is really bad.' But she added: 'We don't just have hope, there is something very real that exists that with enough money will happen and will happen in time for our Eliza. 'It's not a question of if this can happen, this will happen.' She explained that Nationwide Children's Hospital, in Ohio, has developed a treatment that is thought to be able to cure the illness. The hospital is ready to go ahead with a clinical trial - which Eliza could be part of - but needs $1 million to fund it. Children with Sanfilipo Syndrome have a mutation of a gene which allows for the production of an enzyme essential for normal cellular function. Because the children lack this enzyme, over time a toxic material called heparan sulfate builds up in their brains and bodies leading to severe disability and death before they even reach their teens. If Mr and Mrs O'Neill can raise enough money, Eliza could take part in the clinical trial which could mean a one-off treatment prevents her ever developing symptoms . The response to the Eliza video has surpassed her family's wildest expectations as news of their daughter's plight has spread around the globe . However, the hospital has developed a treatment which involves the child being given just one intravenous treatment. They are given a substance that diffuses throughout the brain clearing the build up of heparan sulfate and preventing the development of symptoms. The treatment also prevents further build up of the toxic substance meaning one treatment could be enough to prevent the child ever developing symptoms. On learning about the treatment, Mr and Mrs O'Neill launched a fundraising campaign. A Canadian photographer and filmmaker called Benjamin Von Wong heard about their plight and offered to help them by making a video about Eliza. The video was released on YouTube on April 2 and has helped the family raise nearly $400,000 to date. 'We don't want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table,' said Glenn O¿Neill about the plight of their young daughter . The money being raised is going towards trials to be run at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio . It has been viewed 140,000 times on YouTube since being posted. Mr O'Neill told MailOnline: 'The comments we are getting from around the world are just amazing. The outpouring is just incredible. ‘It's unbelievable – we are completely overwhelmed with emotion. We could say thank you a million times over and it wouldn’t be enough. There are no words.’ He added: 'I was absolutely moved by the video but had no idea people are willing to help. 'It’s just people are good – they want to help. 'We are going to know by the end of the year whether this will work – it’s a miracle story in the making. If we can stop it, and stop it soon – wow.’ To donate, visit www.gofundme.com/ElizaONeill .","Eliza O'Neill, four, suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Brainstorming meetings are usually considered a great way to come up with ideas. But a new paper says they're actually a less-effective way of generating quality suggestions than a more-focussed alternative, known as creative design reasoning . The study found that generating a lot of ideas in the hope that ‘quantity breeds quality’ doesn’t actually work. Does brainstorming really work? Researchers have found that generating lots of ideas in the hope that some turn out good doesn't really work . The paper, ‘Brainstorming versus creative design reasoning,’ is being presented at the Design Computing and Cognition conference in London next month. In it design theorist Dr Akin Kazakci of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris and three other French researchers studied groups in brainstorming sessions. ‘The major result presented in the current work is the invalidity of QBQ [Quality Breeds Quantity] hypothesis of brainstorming,’ they write. In the study Dr Kazakci split 30 designers up into ten groups of three. Scientists from Texas A&M University carried out experiments into the value of brainstorming. Individual students and groups were asked to come up with as . many ideas as they could on how to improve the university. This . showed that four individual students generated up to 44 per cent more . ideas and covered a wider range of topics than a four in a group . together. This showed that groups were worse as people fixated on the same ideas. They concluded that it might be more productive to work individually. ‘The 30 participants were all either engineering designers or industrial designerswith an average of 12 years of professional experience in R&D and innovation,’ according to the researchers. Each team was then tasked to devise ‘a breakthrough museumconcept that gives the visitor an immersive experience in an Antarctica-likeworld’, a task that was purposefully ambiguous. There were a number of additional requirements, such as the museum having to be mobile and eco-friendly. Each team had 90 minutes to come up with their museum idea, summarised in the end on a piece of A3 paper, before presenting their idea to the researchers. During the ‘brainstorming’ sessions to the conversations of each group were recorded and the researchers counted the number of ‘known’ ideas, such as ‘a museum has an entrance,’ and ‘unknown ideas,’ like imagining ‘a museum that is a zeppelin.’ In the study the ten teams were asked to design museums that focused on Antarctica, with a few requirements including the museum being mobile, but otherwise they were left to their own devices . A panel of 14 professionals, a mixture of museum experts and project managers, who were unaware of the nature of the research were then asked to rate the ten final designs according to novelty, feasibility and value. They found that, generally, the teams that created the most ideas then suffered in their final design. Those that generated less had more designs that were more well received by the professionals. On average each team generated 82 ideas, but the best performing team generated just 60. ‘Thus, we reject QBQ,’ the researchers conclude.","Ten teams of three designers were asked to brainstorm ideas .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Climate science has been transformed by huge computer simulations that can predict changes in lands, oceans and atmospheres. Now researchers are hoping they can do the same for ecology by creating an ambitious model that simulates entire ecosystems, anywhere in the world. Researchers at Microsoft and the UN are hoping the model could provide a better understanding of how the planet's fragile ecosystems fit together. Scroll down for videos... This graphic shows the number of creatures in a certain area, with a higher number shown in red. It reveals that the oceans hold more creatures than on land, and their numbers are affected by the changing seasons . Dubbed the Madingley model, the simulation captures the growth, migration and lives of creatures as their food chain. Ecologists have spent the past two years developing the simulation which uses real data on changes in, for instance, animal migration. They hope it will eventually lead to something known as ‘General Ecosystem Models’, or Gems, to capture the entire structure and function of any ecosystem in the world. This graph from the simulation shows how human hunting can lead to a sudden collapse in carnivore numbers . The Madingley model captures the broad structure and function of ecosystems around the world. It does this by simulating processes - including feeding, reproduction and death - that drive the distribution of creatures. Ecologists and biologists have spent the . past two years developing the open source simulation, which uses real . data on carbon flows as a starting point. From the relationship between the mass of individual organisms and how long they live, to the distribution of biomass across Earth, the model's outputs are broadly consistent with current understanding of ecosystems. The Madingley model could radically improve understanding of the biosphere and help inform policy decisions about biodiversity and conservation. Applied to African savannas, for instance, Gems could be used to model the total biomass of all plants, the grazing animals that feed on them and the carnivores that feed on the grazers. This would map the flows of energy and nutrients within the food chain over time. Using the model, ecologists could explore how these measures of health might change in response, for example, to climate change or poaching. ‘As recently as five years ago people were saying it would be impossible to build a global ecosystem model because there were too many complexities and uncertainties,’ Stephen Emmott, head of the Cambridge lab told the Financial Times. ‘But now we have done it, and we are about to publish scientific papers giving our results.’ Modelling every organism within an ecosystem is impossible as it would require too much computing power. But the researchers say they can obtain valid results by applying rules about the way creatures behave in groups. ‘The Madingley Model could help address key environmental issues, in particular, the effects of human pressures such as habitat loss,’ the researchers write on their website. The current version is a prototype designed to encourage other scientists to become involved in the project. ‘We are releasing the model as open source code, allowing anyone to inspect the current version of the model or develop it further,’ said the researchers. The model, however, has so far proved controversial. Some ecologists believe that nature is simply too complex to model in this way. Others argues that the outputs from the models are too uncertain to be the basis of important decisions, such as where to place protected areas or how best to run fisheries. But the creators of the Madingley Model believe that ecologists must at least try to model ecosystems, if we are to understand and ultimately save them. ‘The model is likely to throw up new scientific questions that were not evident before it was built,’ they said. Applied to African savannas, the simulation could be used to model the total biomass of all plants, the grazing animals that feed on them and the carnivores that feed on the grazers .","Madingley model captures the growth, .

During the ongoing, high-profile court battle between the two tech giants, the Korean firm claimed Apple's FaceTime feature infringes one of its own patents. The Galaxy smartphone maker is demanding $6 million (£3.6 million) as a result of the alleged infringement and is mounting its own case for damages to counter Apple’s numerous accusations. Samsung claims Apple's FaceTime, pictured, which lets users make video calls over an web connection, infringes a Samsung patent regarding the compression of video before transmission over a mobile network, awarded in 1994. Apple's lawyers claim the technology described in the patent is now obsolete . The $2 billion court case began on . March 31. Apple is accusing rival Samsung of infringing a number of . software patents on the iPhone. It is the latest battle between the two firms dating back to 2010. Apple began by suing Samsung, but the Korean firm counter-sued just . days later. Apple then secured an injunction to restrict sales of . Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe. In .

A retrial began in November last year and Apple won, but Samsung appealed. The trial between the two technology giants is now into its fourth week, and began with Apple seeking $2 billion (£1.1 billion) from Samsung over claims it infringed a number of Apple-filed patents in its range of products. After three weeks of defence, Samsung claimed Apple's FaceTime app - which lets users make video calls via a web connection - infringes a Samsung patent regarding the compression of video before transmission over a mobile network.

The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media. Spreading like wildfire: The top trending word of the year so far is emoji ¿ small digital images (pictured) used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are used by millions of people in emails and on social media . The top trending word of the year so far is emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like wildfire online. They are popularly used on social media sites and in emails and there have even been complaints that the current character set is not diverse enough.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Exposing nuclear reactors to the elements might not seem like the best idea. But a team of engineers have revealed how their design to place nuclear reactors in water could save lives. These plants would use the surrounding water to safeguard themselves in the event of a natural disaster that could cause a meltdown. Scroll down for video . This illustration shows a possible configuration of a floating offshore nuclear plant, based on design work by Jacopo Buongiorno and others at MIT's Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering . When an earthquake or tsunami hits a nuclear plant, that event in itself is not the biggest threat. The greatest danger is actually the after-effects – failing to cool down a reactor core can be deadly. With . that in mind, a team of engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of . Technology (MIT) have unveiled their designs to place nuclear reactors . at sea, where there is an abundance of cooling water for such . situations. The idea is due to be presented at a symposium held by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers this week. MIT professors Jacopo Buongiorno, Michael Golay, Neil Todreas and others will present the proposal. They argue that placing nuclear reactors at sea makes sense, and could save lives. ‘The biggest selling point is the enhanced safety,’ Buongiorno says in a release from MIT. ‘It’s very close to the ocean, which is essentially an infinite heat sink, so it’s possible to do cooling passively, with no intervention,’ he says. In the design, a floating platform containing the nuclear plant would be located several miles offshore. It would be moored in about 330 feet (100 metres) of water. This would make it unaffected by tsunamis, and earthquakes would also have no direct effect. One . of the issues that faced nuclear plants in emergency conditions, such . as at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, was overheating during . meltdown. This would be almost impossible at sea, according to Buongiorno. ‘The reactor containment itself is essentially underwater. The concept of a floating nuclear plant is not in itself unique, as Russia is building one now barged off shore. This would be the first, however, far enough away to be able to ride out a tsunami. Another advantage is that building nuclear plants on land can be expensive. They need to be located near water, which can make construction costly and difficult. As Buogiorno points out, however, ‘the ocean is inexpensive real estate.’ Decommissioning would also be easier – at the end of it’s lifetime the plant could be towed to a central facility, much like modern Navy ships carrying reactors are. A cutaway view of the proposed plant shows that the reactor is located deep underwater, with its containment vessel surrounded by a compartment flooded with seawater, allowing for cooling even in an accident . The concept is flexible, so the reactors could range from small to big; 50-megawatt plants to 1,000-megawatt plants. These sea-faring plants would probably find their greatest marked in Asia, where regions have high tsunami risks in addition to increasing power demands. ‘I think this is technically very feasible,’ says Toru Obara, a professor at the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. ‘Of course, further study is needed to realise the concept, but the authors have the answers to each question and the answers are realistic.’ When exactly we could see floating nuclear reactors like this is not known, but it could be a very attractive design proposal in years to come.","A team of engineers has revealed their plans for ocean-based reactors .

On the move: United striker Danny Welbeck could move to Everton if the Toffees fail to land Romelu Lukaku . Admirer: Roberto Martinez insists the criticism of Cleverley has been unfair . Martinez, who had the Manchester . United man on loan at Wigan Athletic, sees Cleverley as a replacement . for Leon Osman, with £8million the likely price for the 24-year-old. The . Spaniard is an admirer of the England midfielder, whose contract runs . out next summer, and insists the criticism he has received is . unfortunate. 'What has happened is not Tom’s fault, I think he is as good a talent as we have in the English game, and he is still growing,' said Martinez. 'There are only a few players in this country who have had the sort of education where they look as if they could have been brought up in Holland, Spain or France. 'You wouldn’t get this in other countries, and I find it disappointing that he is being judged so aggressively when he has not even reached 200 games. 'Such a young player does not need that sort of scrutiny or pressure, but I am sure he will come through it and be even more motivated.' Martinez claims Cleverley wasn't suited to the English game, and instead would have fitted in well in the Eredivisie or in La Liga. Previously: Cleverley played under Roberto Martinez while on loan at Wigan . Tom Cleverley enjoyed a fruitful season in the Premier League with Wigan in 2010-11, playing 25 times and scoring four goals . If Cleverley does move to Goodison Park, he could fit in to the style of Everton's play, which has brought success this term. He said: 'I always said that, technically and tactically, Tom wasn’t a normal player in this country – he could have easily fitted into the Dutch way of playing and also had the ability of the Spanish side. 'He is a real example of someone who has the talent but just needs the platform and environment and direction to be allowed to express himself.' Like for like: Cleverley could be used as a long-term replacement for Leon Osman (right) Last month, after an online campaign was started to keep Cleverley out of the England squad, Martinez said: ‘I don’t understand it. Tom is part of this new generation of outstanding English talent. ‘There are only a few players who look as if they could have been brought up in Holland or Spain or France because of their understanding of the game, their tactical awareness and their technical quality. Tom has got that. ‘Then as a boy, he has got the perfect temperament. He is a level-headed boy. I just don’t understand this campaign.'","Martinez sees Cleverley as a replacement for Leon Osman .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Sikh says he is being prevented from carrying out jury service because a California court has refused to allow him to carry a 6in dagger. Gursant Singh is due to appear for jury duty on April 29 but because Sutter County Court bans weapons he will not be allowed to bring his 'kirpan' - a small knife that Sikhs must carry at all times. The rule means Singh must choose between going against his religion or breaking the law, which could lead to him being fined or imprisoned. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Gursant Singh, pictured above during a protest over a GAP advert, is calling on California courts to change their weapons policy to accommodate Sikh beliefs . In previous cases when Sikhs have attended the court house, they have left their kirpan with security guards, but Singh said he would rather be arrested than compromise his beliefs. Sikhs must carry five articles of faith with them at all times as a reminder of their beliefs: . Kesh Hair must never be cut, and it is kept wrapped in a turban. Kanga A comb is used to brush the hair twice a day and to help keep the turban neat. Kara The bracelet is worn on the right wrist and symbolizes restraint from evil deeds. Kirpan The small dagger is a symbol of courage and must never be used to attack, although it can be used for protection if other methods of defense have failed. Kachehra The undershorts remind Sikhs of their devotion to a faithful life. The kirpan is one of five articles of faith that Sikhs carry with them at all times. It symbolizes courage and self-sacrifice, and must never be used to attack anyone. 'I feel very strongly that as a citizen of the United States that I should be able to serve as a juror,' Singh told CBC Sacramento. '[But] they’ve put me in a position. Either I violate my code of conduct with my religion, or I break the law.' Singh, who converted from Christianity to the Sikh religion when he was in his 20s, is campaigning to make the courthouse change its rules. He uploaded a video to YouTube to raise awareness about the conflict between the rules on weapons and the Sikh religion. Singh, who has followed the religion for more than 30 years, said there were more Sikhs living in Yuba City and Sutter County than in any other place in the U.S, and called on the court to be more open to their beliefs. He said: 'It's obvious the court does not know Sikhs are required to wear a small dagger, or kirpan as we call it, everywhere we go. 'We need to change this policy and make the courts in California more aware of the Sikh code of conduct.' Singh added: 'I want to serve as a jury, it's my right and responsibility ... [but they've] left me with an unworkable situation. Symbolic: Singh carries a 6in dagger, which is part of the five articles of faith all Sikhs must keep on them . Dilemma: Sutter County courts ban jurors from carrying weapons but Singh says being asked to remove his kirpan violates his beliefs . 'They won't excuse me and they won't allow me to appear.' The Sikh Coalition has said that other agencies have made exceptions for followers to carry their kirpan, and they expected the court to do the same. On its website, the coalition adds that in certain situations when weapons are prohibited, compromises are made. For instance, when Sikhs fly they place their kirpan in their checked luggage. Sutter County Jury Commissioner Mary Beth Todd said she was trying to find a solution for Singh, saying: 'It's important that we provide a safe environment for people's issues to be heard.' She added: 'It’s extremely important that we be . sensitive to this ... and we’re . trying to find a solution that will work for both sides.'","Gursant Singh, who converted to Sikh religion 30 years ago, is campaigning to change court rules .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A Crossrail worker holds one of 20 new Roman skulls discovered beneath London's Liverpool Street Station . Construction workers in London have made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' during work on the city's billion pound Crossrail project. Around 20 Roman skulls have been unearthed by tunnellers working beneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. Working under the direction of Crossrail's archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls and Roman pottery. They were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The cross-London scheme has already led . to a number of exciting discoveries, including around 4,000 skeletons . found buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August and will be carefully removed . during major archaeological excavations next year. The latest discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. This led to speculation the skulls found were heads decapitated by Queen Boudicca's army during the rebellion against Roman occupation in the 1st century AD. The latest discovery of the skulls, pictured, and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century . Archaeologists believe the skulls, pictured, may have washed downstream along the River Walbrook. They were found six metres under the ground below what is thought to have been a 16th century burial ground for patients of the Bedlam hospital . The hospital was originally called Bethlem – or . Bethlehem - Hospital  was founded in 1247 by Simon FitzMary, . a wealthy former Sheriff of London. Its graveyard was built on the hspital’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the . city started to overflow. Bethlem's name quickly became . pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners. By 1403, the majority of its patients were lunatics. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia. Archaeology later suggested the River Walbrook may have eroded a Roman cemetery under Eldon Street, and the skulls and other bones had been washed downstream. Because the latest skulls were located in clusters, the archaeologists believe this indicates they were caught in a bend in the river and were washed out of the burial ground during Roman times. Lead archaeologist Jay Carver said: 'This is an unexpected and fascinating discovery that reveals another piece in the jigsaw of London's history. 'This isn't the first time skulls . have been found in the bed of the River Walbrook and many early . historians suggested these people were killed during the Boudicca . rebellion against the Romans.' He . went on: 'The skulls are possibly from a known Roman burial ground . about 50 metres up river from our Liverpool Street station work site. 'Their location in the Roman layer indicates they were possibly washed down river during the Roman period.' The Museum of London Archaeology will analyse the finds and hope to find out more about the age, sex and diet of the people associated with the Roman skulls. However, it will be difficult to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead because mental illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons . One of the Crossrail tunnels at Liverpool Street Station where the skulls and skeletons were discovered. Some archaeologists thought the skulls may have been decapitated in the first century, while others claim the skulls come from an eroded Roman cemetery . The latest skulls were located in clusters indicating they had been caught in a bend in the river. The skulls and skeleton will be removed during archaeological excavations next year . The tunnellers have also discovered wooden medieval structures believed to have been part of the walls of the Bedlam burial ground. It is thought headstones from the Bedlam cemetery were used as foundations for modern-day buildings. The hospital was originally called Bethlem – or . Bethlehem – and was founded in 1247 by Simon FitzMary, . a wealthy former Sheriff of London, as a priory dedicated to St Mary of . Bethlem. Its graveyard was built on the hospital's vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the . city started to overflow. As well as patients, it was used to bury London’s poor and religious . non-conformists. Bethlem's name quickly became . pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners. By 1403, the majority of its patients were lunatics. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia. The Museum of London Archaeology will analyse the finds over the coming months and hope to find out more about the age, sex and diet of the people associated with the Roman skulls. However, it will be difficult to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead because mental . illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons. Investigation: 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere . In most cases, identification will be impossible, because although some were buried in . coffins, any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read. The . dig’s manager, Nick Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology, is . part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of . the 40 sites being dug up for Crossrail. The 73-mile rail line that . will link the City, Canary Wharf, the West End and Heathrow to commuter . areas east and west of London. The River Walbrook formed from tributaries coming from Shoreditch, Barbican and merging in the Finsbury Circus area of Central London. It flows through the middle of the City of London beneath the Bank of England and joins the Thames between Southwark and Cannon Street Bridges. It is believed to be named after a brook that ran through the London Wall, built by the Romans around London to protect the city. Romans built the Temple of Mithras, which worshipped the ancient religion of Mithraism, on the banks of the Walbrook in the 3rd century AD.This temple was found during construction work in the 1950's. Following the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons in the 6th century, Britons were forced to live on the east bank of the Walbrook, while the Saxons lived on the west. The Walbrook began being covered by buildings in 1440 and it now runs entirely underground, running parallel to a street called Walbrook.

"By . Stuart Woledge . It took three years to build, cost more than $77m and 28 workmen lost their lives during its construction, but when it was finally completed in 1936, three years after work first began, Oakland Bay Bridge was the largest in the world, spanning some . 7,180metres making it nearly 4.5 miles long. And these spectacular pictures charting the dramatic rise of the monolithic construction have gone on display for what is believed to be the first time since they were taken all those years ago. The images were were captured by a plucky young wannabe photographer who went by the name of Peter Stackpole. Nervous: Stackpole was just 21 when he took the ferry to San Francisco, where workmen gathered before being taken across the bay for their day's work . Professional: Peter Stackpole (left) in 1971. Right, wo workers take a breather to check the bridge's progress . Nerves of steel: In 1934 Peter Stackpole made climbed to the top of Bay Bridge.

In 1934 Stackpole, 21, took the ferry . from his Oakland home across to the San Francisco side where workers . were gathering before heading out to work on the Bridge. A man with a hammer in his hand decided to test the nerve of the young man who had a camera in his hand. He goaded Stackpole, saying: 'Hey kid, why don't you come out with us?

"By . Julian Robinson . A restaurant manager died of Deep Vein Thrombosis just hours after flying home from a holiday in the Canary Islands, an inquest heard. Liz Cooper first started to feel ill while she was staying in a hotel complex in Tenerife with her life-long friend Jennifer Robinson. The 32-year-old had started to feel better on the flight back to Manchester Airport after the week's holiday in September last year. But within three hours of landing she was dead after her condition dramatically deteriorated once she arrived home at her house in Wray Crescent, Kendal, Cumbria. Liz Cooper, 32, died just three hours after landing at Manchester Airport having been on holiday in Tenerife with her life-long friend . The inquest heard how she called her friend in the early hours of the morning complaining of feeling ill having landed at 2am.Family members and medics rushed to her aid, but she died under an hour later. Alan Sharp, assistant coroner for South and East Cumbria, said the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower leg.But Miss Cooper had also been suffering from a genetic condition known as Factor V Leiden, which also affected her family and may have added to the risk of her suffering DVT. DVT is when a blood clot forms in a deep vein in the body - usually a leg vein which runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. This is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. Each year, one in every 1,000 people in the UK is affected by DVT. Anyone can develop DVT but it becomes more common with age along with other risk factors. These include a family history of the condition, other medical conditions such as cancer and heart failure, obesity and inactivity. Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines or being prescribed compression stockings to wear every day. Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is a genetically inherited disorder of blood clotting. It is a Factor V Leiden is a variant of human factor V that causes an increase in blood clotting or hypercoagulability. Up to 30 per cent of patients who suffer deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have the condition. The risk of developing a clot in a blood vessel increases by fourfold to eightfold if a patient is suffering from the condition. It is a particular gene that is passed on from parents to children. It can increases your risk of blood clots and many are not aware they suffer from the disorder. Although it is much less common in non-Europeans the condition is said to affect around one in 20 in the UK. The condition is said to affect one in 20 people in Britain. Mrs Robinson said her friend had been fine for the first three days of the holiday, taking part in aqua-aerobics and walking on the beach. But she became ill, breathless, hot and listless and was prescribed antibiotics by a doctor on the island. 'She seemed fine on the way back. We landed at 2am and were picked up by her dad who took us back to Kendal where he dropped us off at our respective homes,' Mrs Robinson told the inquest. 'About 20 minutes later she rang up to say she was having trouble breathing and could hardly speak. I alerted the family and the ambulance and got dressed to go round. But tragically she had died.' The inquest heard how 'lively and bubbly' Miss Cooper had previously been diagnosed with DVT in 2011 and had been advised not to fly at this point. Liz Cooper was on holiday on the island of Tenerife in September 2013 when she started to feel unwell. But despite feeling better on the flight home, she died three hours after landing back in Britain. File pic . But in 2013 she sought medical advice about flying to Tenerife and she and her GP, Dr John Wood, discussed the need for using the drug Clexane, an anticoagulant. The inquest heard that the GP told her that the Factor V Leiden condition she suffered from made her four to eight times more likely to suffer DVT. The evidence about its benefits and risks seemed uncertain, the doctor said in a statement to the inquest at Kendal County Hall, and he said it was Miss Cooper who decided not to use it. He advised her to use in-flight stockings, take aspirin either side of the flight, take lots of liquid and maintain mobility during the flight. A flight to Tenerife passed without incident in April, the inquest heard, but prior to her second trip of the year she had suffered from migraines and vomiting. In his summing up Mr Sharp said this may have been the pulmonary embolism may have been in its early stages, and the DVT may even have been spontaneous. He had originally been concerned whether not taking Clexane had contributed to Lizâ€™s death but after seeking medical advice found that the benefits of taking it to prevent DVT were not clearly defined. Mr Sharp is to write to the National Institute for Health and Care Efficiency (NICE) and the General Medical Council urging them to produce a leaflet outlining the risks and symptoms of the condition, which is a genetic predisposition to blood-clotting. He said it should be given to all members of a suffererâ€™s family.","Liz Cooper started to feel ill while on holiday at a Tenerife hotel complex .

"By . Tara Brady . A growing number of families are being forced to live in motels in the theme park playground of central Florida because they cannot afford to buy their own homes. On any given day, tourists pay nearly $100 per person to get into Orlando's theme parks. There, they may be waited on by homeless parents. From their hotels, they jog past bus stops where homeless children wait to head to school. Scroll down for video . Theresa Muller hands a box to her son Timothy, seven, with her daughter Mikenzie, four, as she moves out of her motel room she shares with her boyfriend, father and three children in Kissimmee, Florida . They buy coffee at Starbucks next to the motels that have become families' homes. Starting minimum pay at Walt Disney World - the area's largest employer, just a few miles from the motels - is $8.03 an hour, though that could increase to $10 under a contract being negotiated with the resort's largest union group. 'Tourists that come here ... I don't think they have a clue,' said James Ortiz, 31, a fast-food worker who recently moved out of a motel room and into an RV park with his parents and five-year-old son. Homeless advocates blame the housing problem on the low-paying wages of the service economy and the rents in Osceola County, with 300,000 people. Theresa Muller prepares to move out of her motel room she shares with her boyfriend, father and three children in Kissimmee, Florida . While inexpensive compared with larger cities, Osceola rents often exceed what a worker earning near minimum wage can afford, said Catherine Jackson, a consultant who recently wrote a report for the county about the homeless. Median earnings for workers in Osceola County are $24,128 a year, according to U.S. Census figures, and median rent is $800 a month. Motel rooms can go for just $39 a night. 'The fact that we're the happiest place on Earth and No. 1 travel destination is good news, but this service-based economy is actually creating a dynamic of homelessness,' Jackson said. Many of the county's homeless moved here to find jobs in the tourism industry, so they lack the social networks of family or churches, Jackson said. Anthony Johnson, left, his wife Candice with their children Zayden, one and Anthony Jr., four, wait at the Community Hope Centre to see if they qualify for aid to find an apartment of their own . Community Hope Centre caseworker Mia Brennon, left, helps in finding Anthony and Candice Johnson housing . 'Paying weekly is all we can do to survive,' Ortiz, 31, said. 'I can't find a house that is suitable in a decent neighborhood for me and my child to be able to pay rent, pay the utilities, pay car insurance, pay gas and buy food.' Anthony and Candice Johnson moved to central Florida four years ago from Georgia and found work at a barbecue restaurant and a 7-Eleven. Their combined salaries fell short of what they needed to rent an apartment, so the couple and their two children have instead been hopping among cheap motel rooms along U.S. 192. 'What's hard for us isn't paying the bills,' Candice Johnson, 24, said. 'It's just trying to get our feet in the door' with the combined expense of application fees, security deposits and first month's rent needed for a place of their own. Hotel owner Dianna Chane at her extended stay hotel in Kissimmee, Florida, can't evict tenants . Dianna Chane says Muller's family is violating the hotel's policy of only four people per room . The Johnsons are among a growing number of families living in hotels in this Florida tourist corridor because they can't afford anything else and because their county has no shelters for the estimated 1,216 homeless households with children. For two years, Theresa Muller has lived in motel room after motel room with her three young children, her father and her boyfriend. The owner of HomeSuiteHome has wanted her out for months. Dianna Chane says Muller's family is violating the hotel's policy of only four people per room, and clothes, furniture, toys, garbage and boxes are piled chest-high. Chane is among those suing Osceola County Sheriff Bob Hansell to force his deputies to evict such guests. Under Florida's lodging law, it's a second-degree misdemeanor to stay in a room after being asked to leave. Yet each time Chane has asked the sheriff's office to intervene, she says deputies have refused even though they follow the law for brand-name hotels. Catherine Jackson, left, a consultant who recently wrote a report on the homeless in Osceola County and Mary Downey, executive director of the Community Hope Centre in Kissimmee, Florida . Chane says the office calls the issue a landlord-tenant dispute that should be handled in civil court. 'I can't afford it,' said Chane, who figures she has swallowed more than $200,000 in unpaid rooms since 2012. A sheriff's spokeswoman and an attorney for the sheriff said they wouldn't comment on pending litigation. In court papers, an attorney for the sheriff said there is a presumption that occupants are not transient if they say the hotel room is their sole residence.

'Hotel owners simply cannot engage long-term guests... then turn on a dime when they stop paying and pretend they are tourists,' the sheriff's attorney said in a court filing. Muller said she's unemployed but hopeful about to get a dollar-store retail job. Until then, her father's disability payments help the family try to get by. She said she found a house she can afford in a neighboring county and was in the process of moving out of Chane's motel.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Children with controlling parents are more likely to be depressed or anxious, a study suggests. Researchers warn that the overbearing parenting style, known as 'helicopter parenting' - where parents hover over their children and become too involved in their lives - affects a child's ability to get on with others. While some parental involvement helps children develop, too much can make them more likely to be depressed and less satisfied with their lives, they say. An overbearing parenting style - where parents hover over their children - affects a child's ability to get on with others, say researchers . The findings also suggested that children of over controlling parents feel less competent and less able to manage life and its stressors while some parents wrongly consider 'helicopter parenting' to be supportive, rather than detrimental. The research, from the University of Mary Washington in the U.S., involved 297 American graduate students aged 18 to 23. In an online survey, participants were asked to describe their mothers' parenting behaviours and rate their own perceptions of their autonomy, competence, and how well they get along with other people. Children who felt they had little autonomy from their parents were also more likely to be depressed . They were also asked to rate their overall satisfaction with life, their level of anxiety, and whether or not they suffered depressive symptoms. The results showed inappropriate level of parental control was linked to negative well-being outcomes for students. Helicopter parenting behaviours were linked to higher levels of depression, decreased satisfaction with life and lower levels of perceived autonomy, competence, and ability to get along with people. Those who perceived they had less autonomy and competence were also more likely to be depressed, the study found. Because children's need for autonomy increases over time as they strive to become independent young adults, researchers said they were concerned that some parents do not adjust their level of involvement and control as their child grows up. The authors conclude that parents should be wary of helicopter parenting, which they labelled a highly involved, intensive, and hands-on method of parenting which undermines their children. 'Parents should keep in mind how developmentally appropriate their involvement is and learn to adjust their parenting style when their children feel that they are hovering too closely,' lead researcher Holly Schiffrin said. The study was published online in the Journal of Child and Family Studies.","The overbearing parenting style - where parents hover children - affects their ability to get on .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Should Manchester United drop Nemanja Vidic? After that performance on Sunday, it is time for Manchester United to stop considering Nemanja Vidic their first-choice centre-back. They need to look to the future, assuming everybody is fit. He was at fault for Fulham’s late equaliser when he should have headed the ball away and it must be better to play the younger players now. Once you know you are leaving a club, it is normal for your level to drop. I’ve played with people who knew they were leaving a club and it was clear that they had one eye on the future. Turn your back? It's time United stopped considering Nemanja Vidic as their first-choice centre-back . You see that in Vidic’s performances — is he giving his all or worried about getting injured? He is certainly making too many mistakes and Phil Jones and Chris Smalling deserve a chance to prove themselves. I’m not convinced they or Jonny Evans are a long-term solution for United but they must be given the opportunity. Sir Alex . Ferguson said Jones could be a United great but we need to find out now whether that is true. Potential: Phil Jones or Chris Smalling (above) may be best suited to replacing Vidic in the long-term . No Suarez goal a great sign . I can’t remember a better all-round performance from Liverpool in recent years. Early goals give teams confidence and Liverpool pressed and harried Arsenal brilliantly. They didn’t give Arsene Wenger’s side a second on the ball. But what will be most pleasing for Brendan Rodgers was that his side won without Luis Suarez scoring. Things can get even better: With Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling getting in on the act, Liverpool can improve further . In fact, it was the first time since March 2013 that they have won in the Barclays Premier League when Suarez played, but didn’t score. With Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling taking some of that burden off the Uruguayan, Liverpool can only get better. Turn up: Saturday was the first time Liverpool won where Luis Suarez played but didn't score since March 2013 . Time to banish muddy pitches . I think I speak on behalf of every parent by saying it is time to introduce more artificial pitches in this country. For the past few weeks, kids playing football and rugby have had their games cancelled because grass pitches cannot handle the rain. I remember going to Russia v England a few years back and criticising the artificial pitch, but the technology has come on in leaps and bounds. The 3G and 4G pitches on offer are excellent and we need more. It’s what they have in Germany and Spain and we need the same facilities if we want to develop our young players. Time for change: Russia's artificial pitch was criticised in 2007, but it's time to bring them into the game more . Hazard v Suarez for Player of the Year . Picking a Player of the Year this season is going to be very hard. Aaron Ramsey was the star in the opening few games, then Luis Suarez stole all the headlines and now Eden Hazard looks unstoppable. His hat-trick performance against Newcastle was sensational — he is thriving in a more central role this season. Jose Mourinho is amazed that the Belgian hasn’t won any monthly awards . . . maybe he will end the season with a bigger accolade than that. Suarez has his nose in front right now but we’ve not reached the business end of the season yet. It’s all to play for. Triple threat: Eden Hazard scored his first hat-trick for Chelsea to send the club top of the Premier League . Candidate: Aaron Ramsey was the star in the opening months of the season and was tipped for the award . Quit the mind games, Manuel . Manuel Pellegrini looked like a ghost on his Match of the Day interview on Saturday night. Jose Mourinho is winning the mind games with the Manchester City manager. Pellegrini is rising to every Mourinho comment, sniping back at the Chelsea manager’s claims that the London side are a ‘little horse’. Everyone knows that Mourinho is talking nonsense, claiming that his side aren’t in the title race, but Pellegrini doesn’t need to respond to that — let everyone else pick him up on it. Don't let him catch you out: City boss Manuel Pellegrini needs to stop rising to Jose Mourinho's comments . Mourinho must find it hilarious. The Chilean’s reaction reminds me of the way Rafael Benitez got wound up by Sir Alex Ferguson when the Spaniard was at Liverpool. There is only one winner. Pellegrini should be more concerned with his own team right now and the fact they haven’t scored in the past two games. Of course they miss Sergio Aguero, but the absence of Samir Nasri is just as telling. Playing against David Silva is one thing, facing Silva and Nasri is another and Pellegrini will be desperate to see the return of the Frenchman. The mastermind: Mourinho is winning the mind games with the City boss hands down . All over: Long's touch map shows his influence for Hull against Sunderland . Shane one Hull of a signing . West Brom selling Shane Long to Hull was the transfer that surprised me most in January. He is a good forward who works hard and scores goals. His two goals in two games for Steve Bruce’s men will have not gone unnoticed at the Hawthorns. Hull were looking a bit shaky, but the  win at Sunderland should give them confidence again. Long and Jelavic will score goals and Bruce playing three at the back means they can, crucially, still play three in midfield. Tom Huddlestone is having a  fantastic season but is not at his best in a midfield two and Bruce knows that. Swansea safe with Monk . I've rarely seen a young manager look as cool, calm and collected as Garry Monk. You saw from the way that Ashley Williams ran into his arms during the 3-0 win over Cardiff that Swansea’s players want to play for him. Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers have shown that Swansea is a great learning ground for young managers and Monk has the chance to be just as successful. Learning: Garry Monk was the hero in south Wales on Saturday after Swansea's 3-0 win over bitter rivals Cardiff . The only place Monk’s inexperience showed was when I spoke to him after the game on our Saturday Night Football show. He said he replaced Marvin Emnes with Pablo Hernandez because Emnes was injured. Next time, just let everyone carry on thinking it was a tactical masterstroke! Jamie's Premier League Number Crunching . 14 - Eden Hazard became the 14th player to score a hat-trick for Chelsea in the Premier League after: Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Salomon Kalou, Tore Andre Flo, Gavin Peacock, Gianluca Vialli, Mark Hughes, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Gianfranco Zola, Nicolas Anelka, Samuel Eto’o and Fernando Torres. 36 - West Brom's debutant Thievy was on the pitch just 36 seconds before scoring. But that is only the second fastest goal by a substitute this season; Everton’s Steven Pienaar scored 27 seconds after coming on against Hull. Clinical: West Ham scored with their only two shots on target at Villa Park, both through Kevin Nolan . 2 - West Ham scored with their only two shots on target in the 2-0 victory against Aston Villa. Their opponents also managed only one shot on target in the whole match. 1995 - Swansea's 3-0 drubbing of rivals Cardiff on Saturday was their biggest derby win in the league since March 1995, when they won 4-1 in the third tier. 4 - Rickie Lambert netted his fourth Premier League goal direct from a free-kick — since Southampton were promoted in 2012 only Luis Suarez, with five, has scored more. Finishing touch: Emmanuel Adebayor has been in clinical form this season, scoring 60 per cent of his shots on target . 60 per cent - Six of Emmanuel Adebayor’s 10 shots on target have found the back of the net in the Barclays Premier League this season. 4 - Andre Villas-Boas left, Tottenham have won all four league games in which Adebayor has scored. 3 - Only three teams have scored four goals quicker than Liverpool’s  20-minute mauling of Arsenal. In 1998 Leicester hit four past Derby in 15 minutes, in 2003 Arsenal struck four in 19 minutes against Manchester City and that was matched by Manchester United against Fulham in 2006.","It's time United stopped considering Vidic as their first-choice centre-back .
Saturday was the first time Liverpool have won in the Premier League when Luis Suarez played without scoring since March 2013 .
Hazard, Suarez or Ramsey? This term's Player of the Year is a tough choice .

Swansea is a great learning ground for managers, and Garry Monk has showed potential already ."
"By . Thomas Durante . A newly-released surveillance video taken from inside an Oklahoma prison shows a former crime boss and key federal witness lured to his death by fellow inmates. Six inmates have been charged with murder in what looks like a pre-planned attack in which they worked together, and even celebrated afterwards. Anthony Mollman, a former motorcycle gang member and admitted drug trafficker, was found in a cell at the Grady County Jail on May 17, 2012. Scroll down for video . Pre-planned: As the video begins, one of the inmates can be seen signaling to someone in a cell . Led to his death: Mollman, bald and dressed in his full prison jumpsuit, seen at right, enters the shot with two others . Marked for death: Mollman ascends the stairs with one of his attackers, unaware that he's walking into a trap . His death came just more than a year after his arrest in 2011. He had pleaded guilty to various drug charges and was a key witness for the government in an ongoing drug investigation. The six inmates charged in Mollman's murder have been identified as Cody Sitlington, Grant Curry, Matthew Jackson, Joseph Hill, Jerry Gonzales and Steven Nidey. Sitlington, whom Grady County Assistant District Attorney Leah Edwards calls one of the primary attackers, is the first inmate to appear before a judge. His next court date is next month. She told News 9: 'Although much of what went on is obscured by the shutting of doors we still have a clearer picture of how the incident occurred and who the major players were.' Coordinated kill: Six inmates have been charged with murder in what looks like a pre-planned attack where they worked together, and even celebrated afterwards . Defense: At one point, Mollman emerges from the cell, appearing to fight off his attackers . Death: After the inmates come out of the cell again, Mollman staggers before collapsing . The video begins with two inmates standing around a common area, appearing to watch TV. Two more convicts then enters the frame, with one of them checking out doors and looking around the room. He then jumps on a table, signaling another inmate inside a cell on the second level. Brutality: The inmates can than be seen hoisting Mollman's body and dragging him into an adjacent cell .

They lead Mollman up the stairs and into one of the cells. While little can be seen on the video, it's clear that Mollman and the other inmates are involved in some type of scuffle. At one point, Mollman emerges with his fists up, fighting back against his attackers in a desperate attempt. When they come out again, Mollman staggers and collapses on the ground. The inmates then drag his lifeless body into one of the cells. With his feet sticking out of the cell door, the inmates appear to cover up the murder, with one of them wiping blood off the floor with a towel. Jail officers responded minutes later and found Mollman dead in the cell with cuts on his body and apparently beaten to death. While they examined Mollman's body, two of the inmates appear to fist bump right outside the cell.

"By . Peter Campbell, City Correspondent . Barclays could close a quarter of its high street branches, it emerged last night. The bank was reported to be drawing up plans to shut 400 of its 1,600 branches. The move would be a blow for millions of its customers, many of whom are elderly and rely on their local branches to cash cheques and deposit savings. Barclays bank was reported to be drawing up plans to shut 400 of its 1,600 branches . It comes just months after the group axed 1,700 front-line staff,  claiming its customers used mobile phones for banking rather than going into branches. It is thought Barclays could replace some of its lost branches with smaller sites in Asda supermarkets, a model it is currently testing. But its current network of 1,600 branches, many of which are in rural villages and towns across Britain, would be significantly slimmed down under the plans. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins is expected to set out a series of five-year targets for the scandal-stricken lender at the bank’s results next month. His announcement is also expected to include measures to improve trust in the bank, as well as axing hundreds of staff from its ‘casino’ investment banking arm. Although Barclays refused to confirm the figure last night, the Financial Times reported that Mr Jenkins is planning to announce that 400 branches will be closed. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are both expected to follow suit with widespread closures as the sector moves away from high street outlets and towards internet banking. Lloyds has committed to maintaining its 2,200-strong national network until the end of the year, but may consider closures after that. Co-op Bank is looking to close a sixth of its high street stores, shedding about 50 branches as it struggles to raise more money to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances. Plan: It is thought Barclays could replace some of its lost branches with smaller sites in Asda supermarkets, a model it is currently testing . Mr Jenkins is trying to make Barclays a ‘good corporate citizen’. Its previous chief executive Bob Diamond was forced to resign last year over the Libor scandal in which Barclays traders rigged the £3trillion-a-day rate. The group was also fined £280million last year for rigging energy prices in the United States. The bank was also criticised for releasing the details of multi-million pound bonuses for its top bankers on the day of the Chancellor’s Budget to try to minimise publicity. News of the threatened Barclays closures came as Lloyds was accused  of betraying small firms after sacking hundreds of business advisers and leaving employers to get lending advice by phone. The taxpayer-backed bank will axe half of its 1,000 travelling small business relationship managers, hitting up to 120,000 firms. From May, they will be left relying on phone banking or the internet to get in touch with the lender. Lloyds, which is in the process of shedding 15,000 staff overall over several years, is already one of the worst culprits for choking off lending to small firms, despite taking part in a Government scheme designed to boost loans. Critics said the latest move was further evidence that the lender had turned its back on the country’s smallest enterprises. Lloyds defended the move, saying that smaller companies had ‘less complex needs’ than larger firms.","The bank is reportedly drawing up plans to shut 400 of its 1,600 branches .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the incredible moment a pilot tried to land a passenger jet while being hammered by the effects of a super typhoon. The first EVA Air jet manages to land safely at the Taiwanese airport as the nation was gripped by the typhoon Usagi over the weekend. Despite a few bumps the pilot manouvres the jet safely and it taxis its no doubt shaken passengers to the gate. Battling the winds: The plane visibly sways back and forth as the pilot battles to stay in control . Bumpy ride: The plane bounces along the run way about 10 metres off the ground but the pilot seems unable to lower it any further . Terrifying: Eventually the pilot runs out of runway and is forced to pull the nose of the plane upwards to avoid a crash . But just a few minutes later a second plane attempts to come into land with much less success. Even from a distance the plane can clearly be seen to sway and tilt from side to side in the air. As it nears the end of the runway the nose of the plane tips downwards at an alarmingly sharp angle ans stays like that for an alarming couple of seconds before it levels out. The plane nears the ground and bounces along 10 metres or so above the ground as the pilot battles to remain in control. Abort: The plane is forced to take off again at a steep incline and circle to repeat the efforts to land safely . Devastation: A man rides a bike past a collapsed construction site in Shanwei City, south Chinas Guangdong Province . Flooding in the Phillipines: The enormous weather system brought heavy rains which left much of the country submerged . The plane travels all the way along the runway just metres above the ground before the pilot finally surrenders and pulls the aircraft upwards to circle away and try again. Usagi was the most powerful typhoon of the year swept past the Philippines and Taiwan over the weekend but saved the worst of its wrath for their unfortunate neighbours in Hong Kong and China. Typhoon Usagi had gusts exceeding 163 mph leaving on authorities across the region on tenter hooks trying to guess where exactly it would strike land. As the storm passed 342 miles south of Taiwanese capital Taipei, the country's Central Weather Bureau said it was veering west, mostly likely sparing the country's south from the most destructive winds near its eye. But gusts of nearly 150mph were recorded on the Taiwanese island of Lanyu, and the bureau warned that dangerous winds were buffeting the holiday resort of Kending on the Hengchun peninsula. Wreckage: At least 25 people died on Monday after the typhoon south China's Guangdong Province where more than 3.56 million people in the province have been affected by Usagi, and 226,000 people were relocated .

Running for cover: This photo shows a man running away from a huge wave pushed up by Typhoon Usagi on a wharf in Shantou, south China's Guangdong province . In the Philippines, the storm triggered landslides and power outages in parts of the north of the country, including the Batanes island group, where it made landfall early this morning.The Filipino weather bureau warned that storm surges and heavy waves could cause damage in the Batanes and other islands in the Luzon Strait before Usagi blows past the country by tonight . In Taiwan, nearly 2,500 people were evacuated from flood-prone areas and remote mountainous regions as the government deployed military personnel into potential disaster zones.The storm system has dumped more than 8in of rain along the eastern and southern coasts in a 13-hour period, with officials warning that a total rainfall of 39in could drop before the storm leaves tomorrow. Local officials closed mountain highways blocked by landslides and suspended train services connecting the east and west coasts as power outages affected thousands of homes. Usagi has a massive diameter of 680 miles, with its outer rain bands extending across Luzon and all of Taiwan across to the Chinese coast.","Footage shows nerve-wracking moments two pilots of Taiwanese jets attempt to make a daring landing in the middle of a typhoon .

"By . Rachel Quigley . The billionaire husband of Elle Macpherson is being sued for $50million in relation to a fatal helicopter crash last year which claimed the life of his best friend. The lawsuit is being brought against hotel heir Jeff Soffer, 44, by the family of Lance Valdez, who died in the Bahamas crash last Thanksgiving. The 48-year-old father-of-three was traveling to the up-scale Baker's Bay Golf and Ocean Club on Great Guana Cay on November 22 when a gust of wind hit their chopper as it was landing and sent it plunging to the ground. Married: Jeff Soffer, left with Elle Macpherson and right, rekindled his romance with the former supermodel soon after the horrific crash . Father-of-three: Lance Valdez, pictured with his wife Dasha, perished in the helicopter crash last year and now his family are filing a lawsuit against his friend Jeff Soffer . The rotor blades hit the ground and threw three of the passengers out - Lance and Soffer's employees Dan and Paula Riordan. The couple survived the accident along with the pilot. They all suffered serious injuries. Sources told the New York Post's Page Six the suit will contain 'bombshell claims' including allegations the billionaire was at the controls when the chopper crashed. It is not known if he has a helicopter license. 'Lance’s family and friends believe some details of the crash have been covered up. They want answers,' the source said. An investigation was launched by the Bahamian authorities, but no conclusive report appears to have been filed. Steven C. Marks, an attorney who specializes in aviation disasters and represented Soffer and the other victims after the crash, told the New York Post: 'Mr Soffer was a passenger, just like Mr Valdez. The pilot signed a statement saying he was in command at the time of the crash. Mr. Soffer is a victim, and was not responsible for the crash. 'A large settlement was paid to Mr Valdez’s family after all the statements were taken, so I don’t understand why they would take this position and challenge the facts now.' Soffer is a hotel heir and head of the Miami-based Turnberry Associates, one of the country's leading property firms, owners of the famed but financially troubled Fontainebleau resort in Miami Beach as well as condominiums in Las Vegas, the Bahamas and Washington D.C. Soffer rekindled his relationship with Elle Macpherson soon after and the couple got married earlier this year. He was recently linked to Gwyneth Platrow after she was accused of cheating on her husband of ten years Chris Martin with him.","Father-of-three Lance Valdez was the only person who died in the crash .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 15:02 EST, 6 October 2011 . Almost half of the U.S. population now lives in a household where at least one member receives government benefits, new Census data has revealed. Analysis during the first quarter of 2010 found that a worrying 48.5 per cent of people lived in households that were dependent on state handouts. The figure is considerably higher than in the third quarter of 2008, at the height of the recession, when it stood at 44.4 per cent. President Barack Obama seen here at his White House press conference on Thursday morning, again urged Congress to pass his jobs bill, which would extend benefits . The rise has been blamed on high . unemployment, poor recovery from the recession, and an increase in the . number of government programmes. Rise of the benefits: Nearly half of Americans receive some form of support - a record high . Part of Obama's jobs plan, which he again pushed on Thursday in an hour-long press conference, would further extend jobless benefits. Obama said Congress needs to pass his $447billion bill quickly to 'guard against another downturn' in the economy. 'There is no doubt the economy is weaker now than it was at the beginning of the year,' Obama said as he called his plan an 'insurance policy against a double-dip recession.' Meanwhile laid-off workers and aging baby . boomers are believed to be flooding Social Security's disability program with benefit . claims, pushing the financially strapped system toward the brink of . insolvency. The Census found that 14.5 per cent of people in the U.S. shared a home with a person on Medicare, and 16 per cent lived with someone on Social Security. But it was means-tested programmes that accounted for the most highly utilised, with 34.2 per cent of the population receiving support from food stamps, subsidised housing and healthcare support from Medicaid. A graph from the Census Bureau shows the recent, explosive growth of people living on government benefits . Compare that with 15.1 per cent of Americans who were below the federal poverty line - $22,000 a year for a family of four. Applications for means-tested programs are up . nearly 50 percent over a decade ago as people with disabilities lose . their jobs and can't find new ones in an economy that has shed nearly 7 . million jobs. Meanwhile, 71 per cent of people say the biggest problem with the welfare system is that too many people receive benefits, according to a poll released in August. The stampede for . benefits is adding to a growing backlog of applicants many wait two . years or more before their cases are resolved. But a trend that will further worry the government, is that as the number of people receiving benefits is rising, so is the number of people exempt from paying tax. Family affair: 46.4 per cent of American households will pay no federal income support this year . And almost half of all households - . 46.4 per cent - will pay no federal income tax this year, according to . the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In 2007, the year the recession began, that figure was 39.9 per cent. GOP presidential candidates have used this detail to canvass that too . many Americans are not paying their fair share. Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann made the point in July, while former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry have called for the number of people paying income tax to be higher as well. Reflection of the times? William H. Macy stars with Allison Janney and Emmy Rossum on the U.S. version of the British show Shameless. Macy plays an alcoholic family patriarch living on disability benefits . Most of the people not paying income tax will be affected by payroll tax, though. Just 18.1 per cent of households, predominantly the nationâ€™s elderly and poorest families, pay neither payroll nor federal income taxes. Earlier this year President Obama had considered changes to social security and Medicare in an attempt to raise the debt ceiling. Those ideas were tabled.","46.4% of households pay no federal income tax .

"By . Matt Lawton . According to Roberto Martinez, Wayne Rooney is the one forward in the Barclays Premier League who is impossible to prepare for. It’s his movement, Everton’s manager will tell you. He’s so clever and so full of running, there is very little you can tell a defender ahead of an encounter with the Manchester United striker. The energy levels certainly are astonishing, as Rooney once again demonstrated here at Old Trafford. VIDEO: Scroll down to see David Moyes' post-match press conference . Stamina: Wayne Rooney's energy levels were impressive once again in the Old Trafford draw with Fulham . High praise: Everton manager Roberto Martinez claimed Rooney was the most difficult player to prepare for . When Kieran Richardson accelerated past Nemanja Vidic shortly before half-time, it was Rooney who tracked back to make the vital interception when his colleagues in midfield had already decided that they would leave it to a defence in serious danger of conceding a second goal. When they were eventually beaten for a second time, in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time, it was Rooney who burst down the right wing to deliver what proved the last of United’s 81 crosses. Rooney who mustered one last effort from the depths of his astonishing reserves. He gave everything against Fulham, as he always does. But you have to question why he was making that run from the central midfield position he had been asked to occupy for the final 30 minutes of the game. Losing battle? Rooney gave everything against Fulham... but why was he played in central midfield late on? Worry: David Moyes needs to work out the best formation for his side . Wayne Rooney's heat map shows him dropping off to find possession, see more stats at our fabulous match zone service . Just as you have to ask why, when he is such a potent force, is it Rooney who so often pays the price for his versatility. Part of the problem, it would seem, is accommodating Juan Mata and Rooney in the same side when they like to drift into much the same territory on a football pitch. David Moyes tried to solve the problem by deploying Mata on the right flank and leaving Rooney to partner Robin van Persie in attack. But United’s new £37million signing was soon moving inside and the more this match progressed the more the thinking behind how to use these two players looked confused. Mata is a good signing for Moyes, arriving at a time when a lack of creativity in the final third of the pitch has been a problem. But, after a decent debut against Cardiff, the Spaniard has endured two rather less impressive performances and that has to be a concern. The fact that Rooney  was absent from United’s starting line-up for the first of Mata’s three games — and has been on the pitch for the two games since then — is sure to puzzle Moyes. As is the fact that, of those 81 crosses, only 18 reached a United player. Same position: Juan Mata cuts in from the right, giving Rooney less space to express himself in the middle . Shambles: Are the defensive frailties that let Darren Bent score more of a worry for Moyes? In fairness, Fulham defended so deep any side would have found it difficult to break through. Particularly when players like Maarten Stekelenburg and Dan Burn were as impressive as they were in protecting Fulham’s goal. But on an afternoon when United enjoyed 75 per cent of the ball, it should have been an awful lot more comfortable than it was. Moyes might argue that there were greater concerns. The ‘diabolical’ defending that enabled Darren Bent to score Fulham’s equaliser, for instance. As a contest, however, it should have been settled long before then and Moyes might have to recognise that Rooney is not the player who should be sacrificed when the team actually need to be built around him. No good: Rooney has to be United's next captain... the departing Nemanja Vidic looks lost . Making him United’s captain would come with certain risks, not least because controversy has so often been his companion. In Sunday's newspapers Moyes seemed to be hinting at such fears. But if United’s beleaguered manager wants a captain who leads by example, who plays with an appetite that we used to see here in Roy Keane, then Rooney is every inch the man. Nemanja Vidic, wonderful servant though he has been, has revealed his intention to move on and his role in Fulham’s equaliser suggested a significant part of him has left already. There is much Moyes needs to resolve and fast given the predicament his stuttering side are now in. But recognising the full extent of what Rooney offers would be a start. As well as playing him in the right position, he might want to consider handing him the captain’s armband, too. It could be just the catalyst Moyes needs.","Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata are fighting for the same area of the pitch .

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Mad Dog would be happy to see a return to standing terraces, says Arsenal look too lightweight for a serious title challenge, while West Ham remain in fine hands with Sam Allardyce but Swansea's dismissal of Michael Laudrup prove football is still bonkers. I would love standing terraces to return. When I was a little boy, many a Saturday afternoon and Wednesday night was spent stood on the South Bank at Reading's Elm Park. A return: Standing terraces could be re-introduced in English football . The atmosphere, the banter, the singing, the humour, team spirit and camaraderie; people standing in the same position come rain or shine, proud and passionate to support their club. Of course, first and foremost, in-depth research and studies must ensure there are adequate safety measures and lessons must be learned from tragedies in the past. After the Football League clubs backed calls for safe-standing at Championship stadiums last week it moved a step closer to happening. Atmosphere: Many believe a return to standing would improve the matchday experience . In Germany, all Bundesliga grounds have terraced sections and the atmosphere in the singing section is second-to-none. There's no reason why it can't work over here. Arsene Wenger will be concerned at how his Arsenal team folded at Liverpool. When you compare Wenger's side now to the The Invincibles of 2003-04, they played similar fantastic football, but their two centre-backs of Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure and two centre midfield players of Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva were men made of steel. Folded: Arsenal lack the mental strength and winning mentality to seriously challenge for the title . Collapse: Arsenal have crumbled when facing the best teams in the Premier League . They had a winning mentality and in the face of the fiercest storms they could go toe-to-toe and trade blows with the toughest opponents out there. At the moment Arsenal are lightweight in that area and I doubt they can challenge for the top spot. With their flair and quality technical players it will be another Champions League spot, which will be the 16th consecutive year for Wenger. Silver lining? Arsenal still have more than enough talent to finish in the top four . Sack Big Sam? Only a few weeks ago, people were clambering on the band wagon and all the critics, sat comfortably in their armchairs, were saying he should be sacked. In good hands: West Ham will not be relegated as long as Sam Allardyce is in charge . Crucial: Andy Caroll's absence has weakened West Ham . The fact of the matter is, he didn't have his best players available. He was missing a whole back four and an outstanding centre forward. People tend to forget this is only West Ham's second season back in the Premier League and this campaign they have kept 12 clean sheets – the most in the league. There will be ups and there will be downs, but Mr Sullivan and Mr Gold should be commended for going against the grain and standing by their man. Double: Kevin Nolan scored both goals in West Ham's 2-0 win at Aston Villa . In the last three games they have drawn away to Chelsea, beaten Swansea and on Saturday put another two past Aston Villa to move up to 15th. It looks like they made the right decision. Not even Swansea sacking Michael Laudrup after he won the club their first major silverware and led them into the Europa League. If you look at the trends, teams that qualify for the Europa League often struggle to cope. Surprise: Swansea sacking Michael Laudrup after he won the Carling Cup and lead the team into the Europa League was a surprise . In Germany the two teams who qualified for the Europa League are at the wrong end of the Bundesliga table. Eintracht Frankfurt are 12th and Freiburg are 15th, just one place above relegation. In Spain Real Betis qualified for the competition and are bottom of La Liga. Last season Alan Pardew's Newcastle had a torrid time coping with the extra games and the travelling. It led to injuries, fatigue, defeats, a negative feeling and the prospect of relegation. Same treatment: Alan Pardew's Newcastle struggled last season because of European commitments but have been much better this season . After winning manager of the year in the previous season, people were calling for Alan's head. Now they are out of that competition and their key players have been available, he's shown what a good manager at Premier League level he is. At Swansea, Laudrup lost an outstanding player in Michu through injury. He makes a difference and can change games. Key man: Michu is a game change and his injury has affected Swansea . Stand in: Wilfried Bony has scored important goals but has not matched Michu's success last season . Although Swansea have excellent stats in retaining possession it was Michu's performances that would turn that possession into wins and points on the board. Michu does not have a position to play in. He doesn't play centre forward, he doesn't play in the hole, but he drifts into areas where it's very difficult for him to be marked and opposition defences get pulled out of position allowing other players to break into space and cause problems. He has blistering pace and quality technical finishing. Losing this talent has clearly taken its toll on the manager. Debut: Garry Monk won in his first match in charge at the Liberty Stadium . People have said he should not have gone to Paris for a two-day break after the West Ham defeat. But all managers are under huge pressure and in my mind, to get away from it all, have the chance to clear his mind and freshen his body up, should not be criticised. Looking at Laudrup from afar, it looked like the pressure had taken its toll and his own welfare is more important. There's no doubt he will bounce back. On Tuesday night I continued my search, watching non-League players and clubs, by going to Maidenhead United versus Weston-super-Mare. It absolutely lashed it down at Maidenhead's York Road stadium, but the passion and commitment of all the players and the managers – who probably worked at their real jobs all day – and the supporters from both clubs made it a great occasion for me. The players were all sliding into tackles, playing good football and I just love how humble and focused they were. It annoys me when people forget where they come from. These types of clubs deserve more help from the Football Association and a share of the huge sums of money in the Premier League. As the teams were about to come out after the half-time break, a song from Les Miserables was played at full blast in the dressing room of Weston-super-Mare. Soaked to the skin, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I heard the inspirational piece of music. Somebody had obviously given that a lot of thought and the players responded well by going on to win the game 3-0. I've also been reading closely what's happened with Kevin Pietersen and the England cricket team. The thing that strikes me is this: I have no idea, after the betrayal of his team-mates, his captain and the country, by sending text messages to the opposition's captain when they played South Africa, how Pietersen was ever allowed to wear the England shirt again. To do what he did, behind Andrew Strauss' back, showed the real character and personality of an undeniably talented man. There is a fine line between genius and madness. There's no doubt that Pietersen is a genius with a cricket bat, but this is a team game, not a one man, stand-up show.","A return to standing terraces will bring atmosphere back to football .
This Arsenal team lack the winning mentality for a title fight .
West Ham will be fine with Sam Allardyce in charge .

"By . Lydia Warren . The wife of Slipknot bassist Paul Gray has detailed his dark descent into drug addiction - that ultimately led to his death - during her testimony in the manslaughter trial of his doctor. Speaking in court in Polk County, Iowa on Tuesday, Brenna Gray said after her husband became hooked back on drugs in 2008, she would regularly find him passed out in their home or discover used needles stashed away. He suffered a fatal overdose in a motel room in 2010, aged 38. She gave the gripping testimony during the trial of Dr Daniel Baldi, who faces nine counts of involuntary . manslaughter stemming from the deaths of Gray and eight others. Prosecutors claim the deaths followed Baldi's careless prescription habits - but he denies this, while his lawyer has pointed out that Gray did not overdose on any drugs prescribed by Baldi. Scroll down for video . Testimony: Brenna Gray, in court on Tuesday, testified in the manslaughter trial of her husband's doctor, who is accused of carelessly prescribing addictive drugs. Gray's husband was the bassist of Slipknot . Emotional: When the doctor's attorney pointed out that her husband died of drugs that his client had not prescribed, Mrs Gray became emotional and admitted her husband was to blame . But Mrs Gray said that Baldi continued to prescribe Xanax to her husband even after she told the doctors of her concerns about the drug, which Gray had a history of abusing. 'I just knew it was his drug of choice, . that he'd struggled with it. So I just wasn't really sure why he was on . it, why he needed it along with the medication he was taking for . addiction,' she said. She said that as he descended further into addiction, she desperately appealed for help from his bandmates and Dr Baldi - but no one helped. She claimed that she took photos of her husband slumped over and showed them to Dr Baldi, and told him about the needles she found in their home, but the doctor continued to prescribe Xanax. In court: Dr Daniel Baldi faces nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, including Gray's death . Baldi's attorney, Gus Cook, noted that there was no note of her sharing these with the doctor in her husband's medical records. 'A lot of things weren't noted in there,' she said, adding that other details were kept from her. 'I also was told that he had passed his drugs test, and I didn't find out it was positive until Paul had passed away,' she told the court. 'And that he had been testing positive for quite a few times and still leaving with a prescription of Xanax.' After she and other relatives staged an intervention to confront Gray about his drug abuse, her husband fled to the TownePlace Suites hotel, she said. Mrs Gray said she didn't call police in case they found drugs she and her husband had in the house, and she also feared social services would take away her unborn child. Their daughter, October, was born after he passed away. Loss: Paul Gray, who died in 2010, founded and played the bass for heavy-metal band Slipknot . On stage: Gray, pictured in his mask in 2004, died in a motel after his family and friends staged an intervention . And when she called her husband's bandmates, none would help, she said. 'Nobody else cared, nobody was involved,' she said. 'They told me it was my problem.' But two days later, he was found dead from painkillers fentanyl and morphine. Baldi's attorney Guy Cook asked Mrs Gray if she was aware that the doctor had not prescribed these drugs to her husband. She also conceded that Baldo had seemed genuinely interested in helping her husband get off drugs and had 'finally' reduced his Xanax doses months before he died. 'You understand, do you not, ma'am, that if Paul got the morphine and the fentanyl on the street somewhere, that it's nobody's fault except Mr Gray or the person he got it from?' Cook asked. Accused: Dr. Daniel J. Baldi prescribed Gray's addictive 'drug of choice' - Xanax - to him . Scene: Gray was 38 and about to welcome his first child when he died in an Iowa motel in 2010 . Mrs Gray became emotional as she responded: 'I don't know where he got them... It's a hypothetical question. It's not fair.' But as her questioning finished, she admitted that she had said in her deposition: 'It's nobody's fault, but Mr, Gray's. That's correct, that's what I said.' If convicted, Baldi could face up to 18 years in prison. Gray, a founding member of the heavy-metal band Slipknot, died of a drug overdose in May 2010. He was found after Gray's mother called the hotel earlier that day, concerned no one could reach him.Staff broke open the door and found him dead inside. His bandmates Corey Taylor and Shawn Crahan are listed as potential witnesses in the trial.

"By . Lawrence Conway . Archaeologists have discovered a rare woolly mammoth field containing the remains of at least five of the giant animals. The experts believe the huge animals, which are related to modern Elephants, lived in the region of Serbia tens of thousands of years ago. The discovery was made last week at the Kostolac coal mine, east of the country's capital of Belgrade, and was the first of its kind in the region. Find: Archaeology students study the remains of a mammoth discovered at an open pit coal mine east of Belgrade in Serbia where archaeologists say they have discovered a at least five of the giant animals . Miomir Korac from Serbia's Archaeology Institute said the find could offer important insight about the Balkans during the ice age. He said: 'There are millions of mammoth fragments in the world, but they are rarely so accessible for exploration. 'A mammoth field can offer incredible information and shed light on what life looked like in these areas during the ice age.' Painstaking: Miomir Korac, left, the director of the Viminacium archaeological park, and fellow archaeologists, working yesterday on a mammoth tusk at the open pit coal mine in Serbia . Mammoth graveyard: Miomir Korac, left, climbing up part of the site where remains of at least five of the giant beasts that lived tens of thousands of years ago have been found . Rich find: Graves from the the Roman era have also been unearthed close to a spot where the remains of the woolly mammoths were found in Serbia . The remains were found during digging for coal in an open pit that sinks to around 20 metres below ground level. Korac said the mammoth field stretched over more than 20 acres of sandy terrain. In 2009, a well-preserved skeleton of a much older mammoth was found at the same site. Vika, as the female skeleton was named, is up to one million years old and belonged to a furless breed called the southern mammoth. Sanja Alaburic, a mammoth expert from Serbia's Museum of Natural History, said the bones discovered last month belong to woolly mammoths, which disappeared around 10,000 years ago. Care: The archaeologists are also putting lots of care into uncovering the Roman era graves they have uncovered while working on their excavations of the mammoths who died thousands of years earlier . Huge job: Serbian archaeologists have called on their colleagues in France and Germany are set to help uncover the bones in a dig which is expected to last at least six months . Alaburic said: 'This discovery is interesting because, unusually, there are many bones in one place, probably brought there by torrential waters.' Korac said Serbian archaeologists already have contacted colleagues in France and Germany for consultation. He said at least six months of work will be needed before all the bones are unearthed. Another mammoth skeleton was discovered in northern Serbia in 1996. It belonged to a female mammoth that lived about 500,000 years ago and is now on display in the town of Kikinda, near the Hungarian border. Past: The TV programme Woolly Mammoth: Secrets from the Ice Age showed how the huge beasts would have looked before they largely became extinct around 10,000 years ago .","It will take more than six months to unearth all the woolly mammoth bones .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated Press Reporter . Capt. Gregory McWherter, a former commanding officer of the Blue Angels, is accused of 'tolerating an inappropriate work environment' in two spells as leader between 2008 and 2012 . A former commanding officer of the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, has been removed from his current post after accusations that he ‘tolerated an inappropriate work environment.’ Capt. Gregory McWherter allowed, and in some cases encouraged, sexually explicit humor and inappropriate comments among members of the famed precision flying team, the U.S. Navy contended on Wednesday. McWherter was relieved of duty as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado on Friday after a complaint was filed with the Navy's inspector general about an ‘inappropriate command climate’ at the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron based at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. During his . two stints as Blue Angels leader between 2008 and 2012, McWherter . ‘tolerated an inappropriate work environment within the squadron which . may have violated the Navy's sexual harassment, hazing and equal . opportunity policies,’ a Navy statement said. ‘The complaint alleges that lewd speech, inappropriate comments, and sexually explicit humor were allowed in the workplace and in some case encouraged by the commanding officer,’ and that ‘pornographic images were displayed in the workplace and shared in electronic communications,’ the statement said. McWherter is a graduate of the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun, and won the 2003 Commander Naval Air Forces Leadership Award . ‘All Navy leaders, whether assigned to a highly visible unit like the “Blues,” or to our installations, squadrons, ships and submarines, are held to the highest standards,’ Vice Admiral David Buss, commander of the Naval Air Forces, said in the statement. ‘The Navy expects everyone, from those officers in command positions to sailors on the waterfront, to provide principled and highly ethical leadership, stressing discipline, accountability, and the importance of treating shipmates with dignity and respect.’ The Blue Angels are continuing their training and there have been no changes to their performance schedule, the Navy added. McWherter has been temporarily reassigned to Naval Air Forces in San Diego. He hasn't commented publicly about the charges, but former subordinates - including woman - have spoken out in support of him. The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946, making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world . 'At one . point there was a command survey and one came back that men didn't treat . women fairly,' Melinda Cary, who served under McWherter during 2006 to . 2008, told The News Journal. 'The . first thing he did was bring us to talk about who was telling jokes. And he went out, and, I guess, set them straight. He followed up and . made sure we weren't still having trouble.' McWherter served as commanding officer of the Blue Angels from November 2008 to November 2010, and then from May 2011 to November 2012. During his second tour with the Blue Angels, McWherter received an award for his 'leadership and contributions' to the North American air show industry. An Atlanta native and graduate of The Citadel, McWherter is an F/A-18 pilot with multiple tours in combat squadrons, including three deployments aboard the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, according to U-T San Diego. He is a graduate of the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun, and won the 2003 Commander Naval Air Forces Leadership Award. He was also VFA-131's Pilot of the Year in 1996. The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946, making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French Patrouille de France formed in 1931.","Capt.

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 10:35 EST, 20 January 2012 . Windows Phone will become the number two smartphone operating system in the world by 2015, predict analysts iSuppli. The analysts say that Android will remain the top operating system - as it is now - but Windows Phone will steadily rise until it overtakes iOS, the operating system used in Apple's iPhones and iPads. The key to the revival will be Nokia - and in particular its U.S.-focused Lumia 900 handset, which launched at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Nokia's Lumia 900: A leaked video shows off hi-tech new features coming to Windows Phones, including the ability to share apps with Windows . So far, Windows Phone has remained niche, despite fan and reviewer enthusiasm for the operating system. Last year, Windows Phone accounted for just two per cent of the smartphone market. By 2015, that figure will be 16.7 per cent, says iSuppli. The analysts say that Nokia's recent adoption of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system will be key to the operating system's dominance. Analyst Wayne Lam says that the new Lumia 900 phone, a high-end smartphone recently unveiled by Nokia, will be the start of Windows Phone's revival - and will help Nokia regain the market share it has lost to Android devices and iPhones. IHS iSuppli's projection shows Android remaining in the lead, but Windows Phone rising to a narrow lead over iOS by 2015 . The update to Windows Phone will add compatibility for a range of new screen sizes, plus a 'digital wallet' function that will let users tap phones against shop counters to pay for shopping . 'One of the hottest new products . unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show was the Lumia 900, a Windows . Phone-based smartphone sporting a flashy set of features that makes it . competitive with the best alternatives offered by the Android camp,' said Wayne Lam, senior analyst for wireless communications at IHS. 'This . hot product represents Nokia’s first step to reclaim its market share. Combined with Nokia’s efforts to drive the development of the Windows . Phone ecosystem, the Lumia 900 and its successors will help Microsoft to . reclaim its No. 2 ranking in smartphone operating system market share . in 2015.' Nokia's focus on the American market will be key to its revival, says IHS. 'The introduction of the Lumia 900 shows that Nokia believes the road back to smartphone dominance runs through North America,' said Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst for consumer and communications at IHS. The Lumia 900 was developed with North American market dynamics and smartphone users in mind, with the product having been designed in and launched first in the region - a departure for the Finnish company.","Revival driven by Nokia's Lumia handsets .

"By . Amanda Williams . Two men have today been jailed for drugging and raping vulnerable underage girls they found walking the streets. Shazad Rehman, 30, was jailed for 18-and-half years and his nephew Bilal Hussain, 23, was jailed for 17-and-a-half years at Bradford Crown Court. Judge Jonathan Rose said the men 'engaged in a course of conduct which has become increasingly and depressingly familiar in this country'. The pair denied abusing the girls, who were picked up as they cruised the streets of Keighley and Halifax, West Yorkshire. Shazad Rehman, 30, (left)  was jailed for 18-and-half years and his nephew Bilal Hussain, 23, (right) was jailed for 17-and-a-half years at Bradford Crown Court . A jury of eight men and two women found them guilty of a series of sex and drugs offences after two days of deliberation. The court heard how Rehman and Hussain - known as 'Yaz and Naz' - plied the girls with alcohol and cannabis and took them to hotels for sex. One 14-year-old girl said she felt ashamed, dirty and worthless after she was drugged and raped. Miss Colborne QC said Rehman boasted his victims were ‘fresh meat’. She said: 'They acted together, . travelling from their various home addresses in Leeds and Halifax to . Keighley town centre where they specifically targeted vulnerable girls, . all underage. 'She said some of the girls, none of . whom can be identified, had difficult backgrounds or were emotionally . fragile and may have been seeking attention. 'They were out of their depth,' the jury was told. 'They were supplied with strong alcohol and cannabis, enticed to believe they would have fun, that they were special. 'In truth what was on offer was beyond their control.' The trial heard that one of the girls, who was 14 when the attacks happened in 2010 and 2011, was repeatedly raped. Prosecutors told the jury that the . men acted together and deliberately went out to target vulnerable . victims, who had problems and were looking for attention. The men, who mainly targeted the Keighley area, used the Alder House Hotel in Batley and the Campanile Hotel in Bradford. Judge Rose told Rehman and Hussain: 'It is conduct which is pernicious, wicked and determined. 'It involved the deliberate targeting of young girls - girls who were already damaged, girls who were already very vulnerable, girls who were immature and seeking, perhaps, adventure, companionship, affection and even love. Bradford Crown Court heard how Rehman and Hussain - known as 'Yaz and Naz' - plied the girls with alcohol and cannabis and took them to hotels for sex . 'You . two appeared in your fancy cars, with money to spend, compliments to . pay and with alcohol and drugs to entice these girls into those cars and . to take them somewhere private and hidden, there to sexually violate, . abuse and degrade those girls until, bored, you sought what you, Shazad . Rehman, described as ‘fresh meat, untouched and with no reputation’. Judge Jonathan Rose told Rehman and Hussain: 'It is conduct which is pernicious, wicked and determined' 'I have no shadow of doubt that you have caused incalculable psychological harm to your victims.' He went on: 'Neither of you lived in Keighley but you identified that town as a place where you would easily find children who, unhappy at home and at school, would be easily persuaded to come with you for what they believed would be a fun and good time but was in fact nothing more than sordid sexual abuse.' Rehman, of no fixed address, was found guilty of raping two girls, sexual activity with one of the same girls and sexually assaulting two different girls. Hussain, of Leeds, was found guilty of raping two girls and also of assaulting one of his victims. Both men were also convicted of a series of drugs offences and a charge of conspiring to intimidate a witness. Neither opted to give evidence during the trial, which lasted a number of weeks.","Shazad Rehman, 30, and nephew Bilal Hussain, 23, jailed today in Bradford .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Senator Ted Cruz sparked fury among animal lovers on Wednesday night after posting a picture of him standing next to the skin of an endangered tiger. The Republican Senator posted a photo on his office's official Twitter and Facebook accounts of Utah Senator Mike Lee and himself kneeling next to a real-looking tiger skin. 'Did a little shopping for the office with @SenMikeLee in Houston today,' Cruz said in a tweet accompanying the photo. Texas Senator Ted Cruz (right) shared a photo on Wednesday night of himself and Utah Senator Mike Lee (left) kneeling next to a real-looking tiger skin rug. The photo caption insinuates that Cruz bought the rug for his government office . At the time of writing this article, the tweet . had more than 300 favorites and 300 retweets. The Facebook post had . more than 2,000 shares and 14,300 likes. Tigers are on the World Wildlife Fund's list of endangered species. The conservation organization estimates that as few as 3,200 tigers are living in the wild today. Cruz's Senate office now says the tweet was meant to be a joke, and the Senator did not purchase the rug. 'The senator ran across the rug in someone's office in Houston and wanted a picture with it,' Cruz's Press Secretary Catherine Fraizer said in an email. Frazier said the office did not know if the tiger skin was genuine. 'If the rug is real, Ted Cruz's use of it reduces a majestic once-living being to a doormat,' People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals President Ingrid Newkirk told MailOnline via email. 'Gunning down wildlife in order to make umbrella stands, rugs, and ornaments is frowned upon in the 21st century, as most people have come to learn from and be awe-inspired by the lives, intelligence, and social make-up of other living beings.' Cruz's tiger skin photo sparked outrage from animal lovers on twitter . Cruz's Senate office now says the tweet was meant to be a joke, and the Senator did not purchase the rug for his office . Cruz's detractors on twitter predictably criticized the 'purchase,' as well. 'ah! An awesome (endangered) animal skin! You rock Senator Cruz! You continue to infuriate anyone with common sense!' Indiana University student Dillion Kirk said in response to the photo. 'I like when people just tell you they're repulsive,' Kevin Koehler of Los Angeles said in a comment accompanying a retweet of the photo. Cruz and Lee are criss-crossing the country this week, speaking at events for like-minded candidates. Today they are in in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they are headlining a rally with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for Oklahoma Senate candidate T.W. Shannon. Tomorrow the trio heads to Nebraska for an event with Nebraska Senate candidate Ben Sasse. Later that evening, Cruz and Lee will travel to Lee's home state for an event with the Utah Republican Party. Cruz's office did not say why the Senators were in Houston, Texas, together yesterday. The Senators will return to D.C. next week when Congress resumes its legislative session. Both the House and the Senate are currently on a two-week break.","Texas Senator Ted Cruz shared a photo on Wednesday night of himself and Utah Senator Mike Lee kneeling next to a real-looking tiger skin rug .

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent In Wellington . Prince George will carry out his debut public engagement tomorrow at a parent and baby group – meeting everyone from a single mother to a gay couple. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will take their eight-month-old son to a playgroup at Government House, the home of the Governor-General in Wellington, organised by the parent support organisation Plunket. All of the babies who will meet Prince George were born within a few weeks of his birthday on July 22 last year. Scroll down for video . Prince George began his tour of Australia and New Zealand with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Monday . It will be the first time that the third in line to the throne has undertaken a public duty – of sorts. But it clearly won’t be the last, in a lifetime of royal service. The lucky ten families who have been chosen to meet the Cambridges spoke of their excitement today and said they were looking forward to swapping anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of being first-time parents. Kate Bainbridge, 29, a tax accountant whose daughter Sophie was born on July 11, said: 'I’ve had a few jealous looks from other parents when they found out we were meeting the Duke and Duchess. 'Even though we come from a very different background we have got a lot in common with the Duke and Duchess because we’ve been through the sleepless nights and we can talk to them about our experiences. 'We are all first-time parents, like them, so it should be quite easy to chat to them.' Ten families have been chosen to meet Kate, Will and baby George at the Government house in NZ after the royal family arrived in Wellington on Monday . Prince William receives a traditional Maori welcome at the Government house in New Zealand Wellington as Catherine looks on . Philip Gray, 40, who will meet the couple with his wife Alana, 31, and daughter Lily, born on July 16, said: 'The good thing about kids is they’re unpredictable so I’m sure there will be a lot of laughter. Babies are a great ice-breaker.' Also meeting the royal visitors will be gay fathers Jared and Ryan Mullen and their daughter Isabella. Jared, from Oregon, US, and Ryan, from Australia, were chosen to represent the growing numbers of same-sex couples in New Zealand who use Plunket’s parental support services. Tristine Clark, New Zealand president of Plunket, said: 'The parents are a spread of all the communities in New Zealand, including Maoris, Samoans, people of Chinese descent and gay couples. 'This is a very multi-cultural country and we wanted the Duke and Duchess to meet people from all backgrounds.' Mrs Clark said the Duke and Duchess did not specifically ask to meet a gay couple, leaving the choice of parents entirely down to Plunket. Tina Syme, Plunket’s area manager for Wellington, was the woman tasked with choosing the ten sets of parents. She said she started by looking for local couples whose children were born around the same time as Prince George, looked for parents from diverse backgrounds and tried to get an even split of girls and boys. 'The first 10 people who I called and who picked up the phone are the ones who will be attending,” she said. 'There are some couples who I called and who have missed out because they didn’t answer.' Prince William, Catherine and Prince George received a Ceremonial Welcome when they arrived in Wellington, where they are preparing to meet ten families with babies of George's age . Mr Gray said he will be the third generation of his family to meet a royal visitor. His grandfather Bob Graham met the Queen when he was serving in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and his father Robert Gray met the Prince of Wales. 'Now I’m meeting the next two generations down, and maybe our daughter will met Prince George’s children one day,' said Mr Gray, an accountant. His wife Alana, who works in marketing, said: 'We followed the Duchess’s pregnancy and birth because it was happening at the same that I was pregnant. 'It’s a nice link to the UK.' The Royal New Zealand Plunket Society, known to all as Plunket, was founded in 1907 by paediatrician Sir Frederic Truby King. He wanted to help babies and mothers dying of malnutrition and disease, and in 1908 the influential Victoria Plunket, wife of the then Governor-General, became its patron, giving the organisation her name. Today Plunket, a non-profit organisation, helps more than 90 per cent of all babies born in New Zealand, with free childcare advice, home visits and other services including child car seat rental. Earlier this week it caused controversy by fitting a forward-facing car seat for eight-month-old Prince George in the Cambridges’ official car, despite telling parents all children under the age of two should be in rear-facing seats. The Duke and Duchess are currently enjoying a day of rest and recuperation with George after their 30-hour flight from London.","Kate, William and George will partake in a government house playgroup .

"By . Emma Innes . A team of Chinese medics have given a teenage girl a new face after growing it on her breast. Xu Jianmei, 17, was left horrifically disfigured by a fire when she was just five-years-old. This week she had surgery in the city of Fuzhou, in Fujian province, in the southeast of the country. Scroll down for video . Xu Jianmei (pictured after her face transplant), 17, was left horrifically disfigured by a fire when she was just five-years-old . Xu (pictured before surgery) had surgery to replace the damaged skin on her face with skin from her chest . She woke up after the operation to find that she once again had a chin, eyelids and an ear. But she said the best thing is that she can now smile properly for the first time in 12 years. Ms Xu’s parents were unable to afford to pay for her to have plastic surgery but she was given hope when doctors offered to carry out the pioneering operation for free. It meant the girl from a small fishing village could receive the face transplant which was carried out using tissue from her chest. The transplant team implanted a blood vessel from her leg into her chest and then used a water-filled balloon to expand her skin to create enough to make her new face. Video footage from the eight-hour surgery shows Ms Xu lying in a hospital bed, barely conscious and severely swollen, but with smooth flesh now replacing the ridged scars of her old face. The surgeons used a water-filled balloon to stretch the skin over Xu's breast to create enough extra skin to make her new face out of . She woke up after the operation to find that she once again had a chin, eyelids and an ear . ‘With her new face she will be able to express herself in a more precise way. She will even be able to blush when her emotions change, but it will take a long time,’ her surgeon, Jiang Chenhong, claimed. ‘First, we took a piece of blood vessel fascia from her thigh and implanted it in her chest. ‘Then we inserted a skin expander beneath the part of skin where the blood vessel fascia was planted, so that the part could expand and produce enough skin for her new face,’ he added. Xu (pictured after her surgery) said the best thing is she can now smile properly for the first time in 12 years . Ms Xu's parents were unable to afford to pay for her to have plastic surgery but she was given hope when doctors offered to carry out the pioneering operation for free . Chinese teams are said to have performed several similar transplant surgeries in recent months, including creating a new nose on a car accident survivor's forehead. China's first donor face transplant recipient, farmer Li Guoxing, received his new face in 2006 - less than a year after the world's first successful face transplant recipient, Isabelle Dinoir, was presented to media in France. However, Mr Li died less than two years later, after stopping his anti-rejection medication. Since then 10 surgeries of this kind have been performed in China. Video courtesy of China View.

"By . Emma Lowe . and Tamara Abraham . Sensitive: Cara Delevingne's psoriasis, circled, on the Milan catwalk earlier this year . She has made a lucrative career out of appearing flawless on the catwalk. But Cara Delevingne has hinted she may quit the fashion industry because she suffers from psoriasis. The 21-year-old told how Kate Moss encouraged her to seek medical advice after spotting her condition at Paris Fashion Week in March. The stress-induced skin condition, which causes unsightly red sores, had flared up while they were working together. Miss Delevingne said: ‘It only . happened during the Fashion Weeks, which are, of course, the worst time . of year for me to be covered in scabs. Psoriasis is an auto-immune . disease, and I’m sensitive. ‘Kate Moss saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3am when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs. ‘She said, “This is horrible! Why is this happening? I need to help you”. She got me a doctor that afternoon.’ Onlookers had already noticed the . sores at a Versace show at Milan Fashion Week in February, but assumed . they were bruises. After the show, Miss Delevingne tweeted: ‘Be gone . psoriasis, you’re no fun.’ The model now has career plans that . will be kinder to her skin. She said: ‘I want to make music, I want to . act and I want to sing. I want to do something that doesn’t make my skin . erupt.’ She already has some experience as an . actress, appearing as a minor character in last year’s adaptation of . Anna Karenina, and is rumoured to have auditioned for a role in the . forthcoming film of the erotic best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey. An interview with W magazine also saw Miss Delevingne . discuss her early flair for performing: at 17 she submitted an audition . tape for Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Breakouts: Cara Delevingne, pictured on the cover of the September issue of W Magazine, has revealed that she suffers from psoriasis, an autoimmune skin condition triggered by stress . Model example: Miss Delevingne told how Kate Moss offered sound advice on handling her psoriasis and even helped get her a doctor's appointment . Supportive: Kate Moss saw Miss Delevingne having her legs painted by make-up artists before the Louis Vuitton show in March (pictured), and decided she had to help . She . admits her interpretation was 'a little crazy' and 'overplayed', and in . any case, she lost out on the lead role to Mia Wasikowska - but it . seems she still made an impression. Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. It can start at any age but develops most often between the ages of 11 and 45. There is no cure and the cause of the autoimmune disorder is unknown. Dr Ellie Cannon says the condition flares up periodically - often triggered by stress - though frequency and severity varies according to the patient. 'Psoriasis can be itchy but less so than eczema,' she wrote in the Mail On Sunday. 'Some people have psoriasis that affects only the scalp or the nails. . . 'We don't know what causes it but a third of sufferers have a close relative with it, implying a genetic cause.' Treatment is typically a combination of steroid creams, vitamin D-based moisturisers and coal-tar preparations. Sunshine and light therapy are also used to treat the condition. Not long afterwards, she recalls, she was approached by Lili Zanuck, the wife of the film's producer, at a wedding. 'She . told me that they all loved my tape!' Miss Delevingne said. 'And I went to . Tim Burton’s house and met with him. I didn’t get the part, but that . experience lit a fire in me.' The supermodel is not the first high-profile figure to have struggled with psoriasis. In 2011, Kim Kardashian was diagnosed with the skin condition, which she inherited from her mother. The reality star was devastated as she learned the news on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 'My career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots,' the 32-year-old cried. 'People don't understand the pressure on me to look perfect. 'When I gain a pound, it's in the headlines. Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots?' Britney Spears is also thought to suffer . from psoriasis, after she was spotted with the telltale flaky patches of . skin on her leg last year. It certainly does not help Miss Delevingne that the condition is triggered by stress. She is a self-confessed workaholic who . claims she can't cope with downtime, and struggles to relax - even when . she takes a break from work. Fellow sufferers: Kim Kardashian (left) also gets psoriasis breakouts, and Britney Spears (right) is also believed to be affected by the autoimmune disorder . She admitted that a recent three-day break in Greece with her sister left her stir-crazy and lonely. 'In Greece it was a lot of couples, and I felt alone, which made me sad,' she admitted to W. 'I called Rihanna. She said, ""It's easy to drown yourself . in work. That's a form of escapism. So, if you're alone and you want to . cry, cry."" And I did.'","Kate Moss encouraged Cara Delevingne to seek medical advice .

"By . Larisa Brown . An Army recruit has been  prosecuted by the RSPCA for swallowing his pet goldfish as part of the NekNomination drinking game. Gavin Hope, 22, filmed himself drinking a pint glass of beer, spirits, a raw egg and some fish food, before downing a glass of water containing the unfortunate fish. The video was uploaded to his Facebook page along with the comment: ‘Not a proper man unless you drink fish.’ Scroll down for video . Swallowed: Gavin Hope and the goldfish Neknomination which lead to him to being brought before Gateshead magistrates court . The footage was seen by the RSPCA and Hope was charged with animal cruelty in the first prosecution related to the drinking game. He was ordered to pay a £300 fine after admitting the offence. The prosecution told Gateshead Magistrates' Court that the goldfish suffocated and died as a result of the stunt. Hope’s defence, Rachel Mangenie, said the creature, which did not have a name, had ‘deserved to be treated  with respect’. She added: ‘No one is trying to minimise the effect on the goldfish, but he hasn’t made that goldfish suffer for a long period.’ Hope, a father of one, videoed himself carrying out the bizarre act at his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in January. In the video, Mr Hope is seen filling up his pint glass with a concoction that included Stella, chilli powder, Jaeger, one egg and some fish food . The 22-year-old gulped down the drink on camera, and footage was later seen by the RSPCA . It was part of a NekNomination stunt – . the drinking game in which people post videos of themselves drinking . dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol, then dare their friends to . outdo them. The video shows Hope, who is due to join the Armed Forces as a Royal  Engineer in September, thanking a friend for nominating him. He then downs a concoction in a pint glass, comprising of a bottle of Stella, chilli powder, the spirit Jägermeister, a raw egg and some fish food. He says: ‘There’s a reason the fish food is going in and I’m about to show you why.’ Holding up a glass containing the fish, he adds: ‘That’s why’ – before swallowing the fish. Gavin Hope at Gateshead Magistrates Court today where he was fined £300 . Prosecuting for the RSCPA, Judith Curry, said: ‘The fish was in a totally unsuitable environment which in time would have led to its death.’ In an interview, Hope said he had owned the goldfish for a couple of months. He thought it was ill because it kept swimming into the sides of its tank and he was going to flush it down the toilet before deciding to drink it as part of his Neknomination challenge. Miss Mangenie, for Hope, told the court: ‘Clearly this was a very foolish thing for Gavin Hope to do.  He is a young man aged 22 who has never appeared inside the courts before. ‘It is something that has taken a toll on him and he is extremely ashamed of himself. He is genuinely remorseful and apologetic. He accepts this type of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.’ She described it as an ‘impulsive act’ and said the procedures had given Hope a ‘short,  sharp, shock’. Miss Mangenie added: ‘This was an act of stupidity. He has a young son who he is trying to get regular contact with. He wants to put this behind him.’ Magistrate David Randall said: ‘We consider this to be a thoughtless, stupid incident.’ He ordered Hope to pay a £300 fine, £30 victim surcharge and £431.17 in court costs. In a statement, RSPCA chief inspector Michelle Charlton said: ‘A vet report advised that the stomach would be a completely unsuitable place for a goldfish. ‘Eating a live animal and posting a video of it online for entertainment is not some light-hearted joke – it is unacceptable.’ A fish swallowed alive will survive no more than four minutes in a human stomach, experts said last night. Marine biologist Alasdair Lindop, said: ‘Generally a stomach would be pretty inhospitable to a goldfish, largely due to the high acid content.’","Army recruit Gavin Hope downed the fish while it was in glass of water .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A ‘quantum leap’ has been made in encryption technology that could help securely transfer sensitive data. The technology - known as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light. Data could include encrypted personal information, such as patient health records between hospitals, or payments between credit card providers and online retailers. The end of cyber snooping? Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)  delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light. It could be used to transmit encrypted payments between credit card providers and online retailers to prevent people's private information falling into the hands of cyber criminals (illustrated) 'Quantum' is defined as the minimum amount of a physical . entity. A photon is a quantum, for example, as it is the smallest . divisible unit of light: a single light particle. Quantum mechanics, also known as quantum physics, describes . the behaviour of small particles, including photons, as well as atoms, ions and . electrons. The behaviour of these particles can seem counter-intuitive . and often goes against the rules of classical physical systems. One of the fundamental principles of quantum systems is that . they can behave like both particles and waves. Light is commonly referred to . as, and treated like, a wave, but it consists of particles: photons. This type of behaviour, known as wave-particle duality, . gives rise to the strange properties that make the prospect of future quantum . technologies exciting in areas such as communication, timing, navigation and . information security and storage. In theory, quantum . computing could allow for huge amounts of data to be processed, which is even . beyond today's supercomputers, as well as entirely new types of computation. ‘Encrypted data is very secure,’ Alastair . Sinclair from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) told MailOnline. ‘Its main vulnerability comes from people working out or intercepting . the key which allows it to be unencrypted.’ ‘QKD ensures that the key is transmitted securely. First the key is created and then data scientists can encrypt the data to send it from one party to the other.’ QKD shares a key between two users that is made completely secure using quantum mechanics. It provides an additional layer of security over and above standard methods used by banks and credit card companies to send data encryption ‘keys’ across a network. It works because binary data is encoded into the particles of light. The 'phase' – a property of photons – is altered to represent binary data: a 0 or 1. ‘The . transmitter can encode these photons in two different ways – known as . bases - creating four possible combinations,’ said Mr Sinclair. The photons are randomly encoded, creating a random key and sent at precise time intervals to the receiver. Secure: QKD shares a key (illustrated) between two users that is made completely secure using quantum mechanics. It provides an additional layer of security over and above standard methods used by banks and credit card companies to send data encryption 'keys' across a network . The receiver detects the photons as 0s and 1s but not which base. So it randomly chooses which base it will detect and records the values and bases. Once all the information has been received, the receiver tells the transmitter which bases it detected and the transmitter reveals which were right and wrong. The receiver rejects all wrong detection events – leaving just the correct ones. Armed with this information, it can create the key to first encrypt and subsequently decrypt and unlock the data. The technology works because binary data (illustrated) is encoded into the particles of light. The phase - a property of photons - is altered to represent binary data: a 0 or 1. The transmitter encodes these photons in two different ways - known as bases - creating four possible combinations . ‘The system is secure because it enables eavesdroppers on the line to be detected,’ said Mr Sinclair. ‘Any attempt to monitor the data will interfere with the photons, affecting the encoding. If there is interference, the receiver will terminate the process before the key is produced.’ A consortium of companies, including BT, Toshiba and NPL, recently completed the first successful trial of QKD over a live fibre network. The field trial shows quantum encryption of 40 Gb/s of data on a live optical fibre.  Although these are just tests, the data could include phone calls, personal email, bank details and health records. The trial, which is supported by the UK’s innovation agency, the Technology Strategy Board, is the first to use a single ‘lit’ fibre – which is fibre to transmit data and the quantum key itself. The use of a single fibre is significant, as both the quantum ‘key’ and the encrypted data can now use the same pathway for the first time. ‘The laws of Quantum Mechanics dictate that eavesdropper wouldn’t be able to detect the key without fundamentally changing it, so anything untoward can be easily detected,’ Andrew Lord, head of optical research at BT told MailOnline. Early days: Although the technology has only been tested so far, it could one day be used for phone calls, personal email, bank details and health records (illustrated) ‘But if they want somebody to un-encrypt that data at the other end, then obviously they have to send the key too.’ ‘That’s what makes QKD a potentially very secure way of transmitting keys.’ The technology can be used to protect any data being carried by an optical communications system. ‘Any organisation could use it to secure their telephony and video links, whilst businesses could use it to transmit commercially sensitive data,’ said Mr Lord . Researchers, however, are reluctant to put a time-scale on when the technology could be available for wider use. ‘This research is helping us to understand that, and it’s very promising,’ said Mr Lord. ‘We have begun to test an advanced prototype with this trial and we’ll be looking at the possibility of further trials in the future.’ A key is created so that data can be encrypted and sent from one party to the other. Then the key to unlock that data is transmitted securely using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). Binary data is encoded into tiny light particles called photons. The 'phase' – a property of photons – is altered to represent binary data: a 0 or 1. The transmitter can encode these photons in two different ways – known as bases - creating four possible combinations. The photons are randomly encoded to create a random key and sent at precise time intervals to the receiver. The receiver detects the photons. It can detect 0s and 1s but not which base, so it randomly chooses which base it will detect and records the values and bases. Once all the information has been received, the receiver tells the transmitter which bases it detected and the transmitter reveals which were right and wrong. The receiver rejects all wrong detection events – leaving just the correct ones. Armed with this information, it can create the key to first encrypt and subsequently decrypt or unlock the data. The system is secure because it enables eavesdroppers on the line to be detected. Any attempt to monitor the data will interfere with the photons, affecting the encoding. If there is interference, the receiver will terminate the process before the key is produced. Any attempt to monitor or interfere with the transmitted key while it’s being sent will be detectable.","Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has been partly developed by the UK's National Physical Laboratory .

"About 2.4million of UK’s 12million children have been diagnosed with disease . By . Jenny Hope . Babies given antibiotics before they are a year old are more likely to develop eczema, say British researchers. After years of debate about a possible link, a huge study shows taking the drugs in the first year of life increases the chances of developing the skin disorder by 40 per cent. Each additional course of antibiotics further raises the risk of eczema – which affects one in five children in the UK – by 7 per cent. Babies given antibiotics before they are a year old are more likely to develop eczema, say British researchers . About 2.4million of the UK’s 12million children have been diagnosed with the disease, caused by an over-active immune system and resulting in dry and itchy skin. Researchers from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College London, the University of Nottingham and the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary reviewed data from 20 studies involving almost 293,000 babies and children. Senior researcher Dr Carsten Flohr, of King’s College and Guy’s, said some previous studies had implied a link, but this was the first systematic large-scale review. He said: ‘We found antibiotic exposure in early life may increase the risk of subsequent eczema by up to 40 per cent, with broad-spectrum antibiotics having a more pronounced effect. It’s a real effect. About 2.4million of the UK's 12million children have been diagnosed with the disease, caused by an over-active immune system and resulting in dry and itchy skin . ‘Having antibiotics in the second year of life is less likely to be important, but we don’t have the studies to examine it.’ Dr Flohr recommended that antibiotics should be prescribed ‘with caution’, especially to infants with a family history of eczema or allergic disease. But he stressed: ‘Doctors usually have good reason to prescribe antibiotics to infants. ‘The importance of this finding is to get a better understanding of the complex relationship between antibiotic use and allergic disease. ‘We need further research as determination of a true link between antibiotic use and eczema would have far-reaching clinical and public health implications.’ The latest research analysed 16 studies looking at a potential link between eczema and use of antibiotics in under ones and three more examining a possible link with exposure in the womb. One study looked at both, says a report in the British Journal of Dermatology. Researchers found a ‘trend’ with prenatal exposure but insufficient evidence to make a link. Eczema has no cure, but medical moisturisers called emollients can be used to keep the skin lubricated, backed up by steroid creams. The proportions of children with eczema has risen from 3 per cent in the 1950s to 20 per cent today.Rising allergy levels have several suspected triggers such as too-clean lifestyles, Caesarean births – which may affect immune systems – diet and the early use of antibiotics. Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ‘Eczema is our most common skin disease. ‘The evidence is not conclusive and the researchers are not suggesting that parents should withhold antibiotics from children when doctors feel such treatment is necessary. ‘But studies like this give an insight into possible avoidable causes and may help to guide medical practice.’","Each additional course of antibiotics further raises the risk of eczema by 7% .
About 2.4million of UK’s 12million children have been diagnosed with disease ."
"By . Tamara Cohen . Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has been tasked with finding significant cuts to the pension bill . Ministers are looking at privatising the state pension as part of a drive to cut costs, it emerged last night. Iain Duncan Smith’s department have been told they could save significant sums by contracting a private firm to issue the 4.5million pension statements every year in the UK and abroad. The plan is contained in a leaked copy of the Department of Work of Pensions’ Efficiency Review, which is marked ‘restricted’ which discusses how to meet a target to shave a third off its budget. The department is the biggest in Whitehall and issues nearly £100billion of public money to millions of pensioners every year. It faces an ‘unprecedented reform challenge’ the review states. Mr Duncan Smith will have his operational budget slashed by 34pc to £6.3bn by 2016 from £9bn in 2009-10. Almost £2bn of those savings will need to be made in the next two financial years. But the pensions expert Ros Altmann said she was seriously concerned by the idea that firms such as Capita, Serco or G4S could be brought in to administer public money to millions of pensioners. An 80-page review, seen by The Guardian states that opportunities to make major savings ‘are limited...as much of the low hanging fruit has already gone.’ It says the department has already made savings and ‘to deliver anything greater, they would need to ‘to look more fundamentally at how it delivers its business, and consider some more strategic shifts.’ Currently the government runs ten pension centres around the country including in Dundee, Newcastle, Swansea and Blackpool, which employ 7,000 staff. Labour's Dame Anne Begg, said 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model. File picture . Pensions expert Ros Altmann said she was seriously concerned by the idea that a firm like G4S, which bungled security for the 2012 Olympics, could be brought in. File picture . Miss Altman said a private firm would save money by reducing the pay and conditions of staff or the quality of the service, and charges could go up in the end. ‘We’re dealing with a vulnerable group and a massive number of people, so I would be seriously concerned about outsourcing a service like this, which is working well, with a view that it might make some short-term savings’, she said. The chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, Labour’s Dame Anne Begg, said she would not want to see the service tendered out to private companies and pointed out that 93 per cent of pensioners were satisfied or very satisfied with the current model. ‘The pension service is one of the success stories of the DWP. There is a very high satisfaction rate and very few complaints about it. [So] if it’s a success story and it ain’t broke I’m not sure why they would want to upset that. If you end up with a poorer service as a result then it’s not good value for the taxpayer’, she said.","Government must slash £2bn from pension bill in next two years .

'People have this false sense of security. I was shocked. Don't they see the road, see what I'm seeing?' David Hill, 27, said he wasn't surprised there was an accident. 'I . got on the turnpike and it was nothing but ice,' he said. 'I was very . surprised at the condition of it.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A San Francisco fetish porn company has been fined $78,000 for allowing performers to make films without wearing condoms. Kink.com parent Cybernet Entertainment was handed the fine recently by California officials charging the company's lax prophylactic policy contributes to dangerous work conditions. The website is known for niche films primarily depicting dominance and submission scenes, and was also linked last year to two HIV-infected performers. Condoms required: CALOSHA regulations require companies to limit exposure amongst employees to blood and other bodily fluids - an implicit condom requirement . ‘The fines are excessive and, we believe, politically motivated,’ Cybernet founder Peter Acworth said in a statement. ‘The complaints which prompted the inspection were not made by actual employees, but by outside groups with a long history of opposition to adult film,’ he continued, vowing to appeal the fine. California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CALOSHA) records revealed multiple citations issued in August against the porn producer, including a condom-optional policy that resulted in $75,000 in fines. CALOSHA spokesperson Peter Melton said the ‘significant’ fines resulted from multiple complaints against the company received last year. Fines were levied after an inspection triggered by an Aids Healthcare Foundation complaint against the website. The advocacy group was the main catalyst behind the law requiring all porn performers in Los Angeles County to wear condoms while being filmed. ‘We're all for sensible regulation that protects performers, website spokesman Mike Stabile said, ‘but this essentially amounts to a moral crusade. It's a solution in search of a problem.’ The performers who contracted HIV had done so off-set, but not requiring all professionals to wear condoms puts the entire roster at risk of infection. Not alone: Cybernet is the second California porn producer to face fines for charges related to not requiring condoms on the set, perhaps the reason as much as 95 per cent of the industry left the state for Las Vegas . The foundation dismissed the source of the infections, saying condoms should still be worn by all.‘That's neither here nor there,’ AHF spokesman Ged Kenslea, said, ‘because OSHA requires that condoms be used.’ State lawmakers voted down a law last year that would have required performers state-wide to wear condoms while on the job, but CALOSHA requirements designed to limit exposure to blood and other bodily fluids stipulate they be worn. Treasure Island Media, another Bay Area adult film producer, earlier this month lost an appeal of a similar citation resulting in a fine of almost $9,000. The passage of a formal law requiring condoms be used in Los Angeles has led the industry to flee to Las Vegas. Recent reports suggested as much as 95 per cent of the industry has already relocated to Sin City. Clark County, where the gambling mecca is located, has no law requiring condoms to be worn while filming.","Authorities say Kink.com parent Cybernet Entertainment was handed the fine after complaints triggered a workplace safety inspections .

"By . Helen Pow . George Clooney has confessed to calling Las Vegas gambling mogul Steve Wynn an 'a**hole' and storming off at a recent dinner because the casino-owner insulted President Barack Obama. The verbal assault occurred two weeks ago when the two-time Oscar winner was in Vegas promoting his Casamigos tequila, and was invited to dine with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant inside the 72-year-old's Encore hotel. But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, of which Wynn is a vocal opponent. That's when sparks began to fly. Falling out: George Clooney, pictured right in January with Steve Wynn and his wife Andrea, allegedly said the F-word at a recent dinner with the couple . Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.' He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar. Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots. 'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' the said. 'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late. 'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.'Wynn added Clooney's partners were 'mortified.' Fancy: The row took place two weeks ago at the posh Botero Restaurant, pictured, which is located inside Wynn's Encore Hotel . Stories: Wynn, left, said Clooney had been downing tequila shots and was 'drunk' but Clooney, right, claims Wynn insulted his 'longtime friend' President Obama . Partners: Casamigos Tequila founders George Clooney and Rande Gerber celebrated the launch of Casamigos at Andrea's at Encore Las Vegas on January 9, 2013 . However, . in a statement sent to the newspaper, Clooney said: 'There were nine . people at that table ... so you can ask them. ... Steve likes to go on . rants.

'...At that point I told Steve that HE was an asshole and I wasn't going to sit at his table while he was being such a jackass. 'And I walked out. There were obviously quite a few more adjectives and adverbs used by both of us. He added: 'It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with character.'

"By . Tim Shipman . Squandered: £1 in every £6 of taxpayers' money is wasted by ministers - totalling £120 billion last year alone, according to a new report . Ministers managed to waste £120billion of taxpayers’ money last year – enough to give every family in Britain a new kitchen or write off the whole of the country’s deficit, a hard-hitting report has claimed. In a study published today, the TaxPayers’ Alliance has revealed that one pound in every six spent by the Government last year ended up being ‘squandered’. The Bumper Book of Government Waste highlights £120billion of waste, the equivalent of £4,560 for every UK household – two and a half times the amount they found when they first conducted the exercise a decade ago. The campaign group has calculated that curbing waste would save enough money to send every taxpayer to the World Cup in Brazil, or pay for the equivalent of three years’ worth of average energy bills for every single British household. The report concludes: ‘£1 in every £6 of government spending in 2012-13 was wasted. The value of savings could pay for a new kitchen for every household or a trip to the World Cup in Rio for every taxpayer. ‘The amount of waste revealed is greater than the UK deficit and is bigger than the Gross Domestic Product of New Zealand.’ The report suggests bringing public sector workers’ pay packets, pensions and sick pay in line with those in the private sector. One of several examples of 'waste' given in the report the Welsh Assembly's alleged £33,000 spend on potted plants . It also claims the NHS spends too . much money on doctors’ wages and clinical negligence claims – and points . out the need to rein in the welfare system. It . even suggests scrapping the entire Department for Culture, Media and . Sport and transferring all its functions elsewhere, a move it believes . would save the taxpayer around £1billion. But the study also lists some smaller . but no less worrying examples of waste. For example the Forestry . Commission spent around £70 purchasing a bunny outfit and the Welsh . government allegedly splashed out £33,333 on potted plants. Chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, Jonathan Isaby, called for a 'war on waste' to secure a better deal for taxpayers . A Basildon council officer was paid £1,000 to investigate a picture of the mayor looking at her phone during an Armed Forces Day ceremony while another council forked out £32,000 to compensate a man who slipped on a berry in a churchyard. The Heart of England NHS Trust blew £2,340 on only six pictures of herbs, and the Foreign Office spent £342,000 on a TV series that has still not been completed – as its production company has been dissolved. Meanwhile Angus council spent £3,860 on a whisky tasting event for international golfers and the Ministry of Defence lost spare parts for an anti-aircraft missile system worth £527,000. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘We need a war on waste if taxpayers are to secure a better deal from the endless layers of government which are spending their hard-earned money. ‘Politicians and bureaucrats are still squandering our cash while families struggle with punishing levels of taxation. ‘Rooting out wasteful spending once and for all will mean that more money can be left in the pockets of taxpayers, who are by far the best judges of how their own money should be spent.’ But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady criticised the report, saying: ‘These made-up numbers are based on extreme views – that every nurse is overpaid and that people who have worked hard and paid into the system should not get benefits.’","Ministers managed to waste £120billion of taxpayers’ money last year .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Daniel Martin . Created: . 17:17 EST, 19 February 2012 . David Cameron is facing demands to suspend his 'back to work' tsar Emma Harrison after police launched a fraud inquiry. A senior MP will today table a parliamentary question asking if he will block the A4e company's contracts. Mrs Harrison, appointed to help problem families find jobs, caused uproar this month when it was revealed she had paid herself £8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash. On Friday, detectives visited her company A4e's offices amid claims that it took funding for putting some clients back to work for only a day. Whitehall sources say ministers are demanding urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' designed to rip off the taxpayer. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the influential Public Accounts Committee, went further. 'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets . Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to sack his 'back to work' tsar after a fraud probe was launched . She said she would be asking the . Department of Work and Pensions 'whether, given the allegations of . fraud, they will be suspending their contracts with A4e until this . matter is resolved'. She . added: 'I think the Government should certainly consider suspending . them. It is of great concern that any such investigation is necessary.' A4e . – formerly called Action For Employment – was set up to retrain . redundant Sheffield steelworkers and Mrs Harrison built it into an . operation spanning 11 countries. On Friday police visited the company's offices in Slough, Berkshire. They stayed for up to four hours and demanded staff hand over documents and computer files going back two years. A . source at the company claimed the police were investigating allegations . that the company had been given generous fees from taxpayers for . finding 'jobs' lasting no more than 24 hours. The . fraud investigation will make uncomfortable reading for Mr Cameron, who . has hailed Mrs Harrison as an inspiration in his campaign to help the . unemployed. He made her 'families tsar' in December 2010 to advise on getting 120,000 troubled households back to work. Her . boasts that she can find jobs for the long-term unemployed have won her . a string of lucrative Whitehall contracts worth millions over the past . 20 years. But there was . outrage when it was revealed that she had awarded herself an £8.6million . dividend from the company, which makes all its UK income from state . contracts. One Labour MP described the bonanza a 'reward for failure' amid complaints that A4e's record on job schemes is 'abysmal'. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended . Mrs Harrison, 48, is worth an . estimated £70million. She has appeared on several television programmes, . including the BBC1 reality series Famous, Rich And Jobless, and Channel . 4's The Secret Millionaire. She and her husband Jim married in India and she is known to wear a sari on formal occasions. The . couple and their four children live in a 16-bedroom mansion on a . 100-acre estate in Derbyshire, shared with other families in an . arrangement Mrs Harrison describes as a 'posh commune'. Callers yesterday were told she was not at home. The police investigation has prompted alarm in Whitehall. Ministers . yesterday asked for 'urgent reassurances' there was no 'systematic . fraud' of the public purse, according to a Department for Work and . Pensions source. Fiona Mactaggart, the Labour MP for Slough who also sits on Mrs Hodge's committee, said she was 'deeply concerned' about A4e. She added: 'My view is that this company has demonstrated that it is unfit to hold this kind of contract.' Employment Minister Chris Grayling said he believed the matter related to events under the Labour administration. 'The inquiry – and I only discovered about this last night – dates back two years to schemes run by the previous government. 'It . would not be possible for our work programme to have a fraud of this . kind because the providers aren't paid until somebody's been in work for . six months. 'The truth is . that some of the schemes put in place under the previous government were . contracted very badly and mismanaged. We've tried to learn the lessons . of their failure.' A4e is one of several contractors which earn payments for helping the out-of-work find a job. Half of its work is subcontracted to charities, generating millions in management fees. It paid Mrs Harrison the controversial £8.6million after posting a turnover of £234million, with pre-tax profits rising by £5.5million to £15million in the year to March 2011. The company defended her jackpot payout by saying she had risked millions of her own money during the 21 years she has been building the firm. MPs have questioned why A4e has continued to win government contracts – under Labour and the Conservatives – despite failing to hit its targets. The company even received a share of £63million in 'termination fees' when the DWP ended a previous back-to-work programme in which the firm was involved and replaced it with another one. Last night A4e claimed the alleged fraud . took place in 2010 and involved four employees, and that the company . itself had uncovered it. A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police visited our offices on Friday for a mutually agreed meeting in relation to an allegation of fraud that was identified by A4e's internal processes and was reported to the authorities by the company. 'The allegation concerns a very small number of former employees and dates back to 2010. As the investigation is ongoing, we cannot comment further.' It is not the first time A4e has been involved in a fraud investigation. In 2008, the Department for Work and Pensions launched an inquiry after discovering employees at its office in Hull were falsifying documents. Two recruiters had filled in forms meant to be written out by employers who agreed to hire an unemployed person – even forging signatures to pretend the jobless person had been found work, triggering a commission payment. The Department for Work and Pensions said yesterday: 'Clearly we are unable to comment on any investigation but understand these are not matters that relate to the work programme.'","Emma Harrison's firm A4e is accused of receiving fees from the taxpayer after finding people jobs lasting just 24 hours .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui: The 27-year-old, accused of killing a police officer and wounding another on Thursday, has died after being shot by police . A 27-year-old man accused of killing one deputy and wounding another in a violent shoot-out in Utah has died. Jose Angel Garcia Juaregui died in hospital yesterday after being shot by law enforcement officials on Thursday afternoon in Juab County, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. The Salt Lake County man was accused of opening fire on a two-lane highway, then clashing with officers during a 50-mile chase that ended with him wounded and arrested. The officer who was killed, Utah County Sheriff’s Sgt. Cory Wride, was shot while sitting behind the wheel of his police vehicle. He leaves behind a wife and five children. Wride had pulled up to a truck that appeared disabled near the town of Eagle Mountain, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. He spoke with the suspect and apparently was using his computer to do a background check when the truck’s back window slid open and the suspect opened fire, according to Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy. The gunman shot and injured a second Utah County deputy, 38-year-old Greg Sherwood, near Santaquin, more than 30 miles into the chase. Sherwood remains in a critical condition with a head wound, but he is expected to recover, the sheriff said. The gunman took off again, driving south on Interstate 15, but he crashed his car and hijacked another at gunpoint, Tracy said. The man shot at other motorists who unwittingly stopped to help him, but he didn’t hit any of them, the sheriff said. Tragic: Utah County Sheriff's Sgt.

The suspect was captured near Nephi after a 20-mile chase and a gunfight with Juab County deputies. Krista Black, manager of the Maverick convenience store and gas station on the rural highway where Wride was killed, said her husband slowed to check on a disabled car he believes was the suspect’s about 10 minutes before the shooting. Her husband didn’t get out of his car to help because no one appeared to be in the other car. He instead drove on. 'It makes you nervous about who is out there,' Black told The Associated Press. 'My husband always stops to help people.' The sheriff said Wride was a 19-year veteran of the Utah County Sheriff’s Office.

The deputy and his wife had built a house on a section of his grandfather’s farm in the community of Benjamin, and owned horses and a few cows. Cory Wride also was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 'He was a good man,' Tracy said, according to KSL-TV. 'He was a very helpful person.

Authorities had searched the suspect’s house in Salt Lake County with a warrant, and a prosecutor told the AP he would have faced multiple felony charges, with the possibility of the death penalty. The Salt Lake Tribune reported Garcia Jauregui had previously served 4.5 years in prison for attempted murder and also had a felony charge for assault by a prisoner dismissed. Tracy said the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole released Garcia Jauregui, but it had issued a warrant for his arrest just days before Wride's slaying. The paper said that court records revealed Garcia Jauregui stabbed a man 21 times with a Phillips screwdriver after running him over with his car in Springville in 2008. After the stabbing, he assaulted another man with a tire iron or crowbar, causing a fracture to the man’s face.","Jose Angel Garcia Juaregui, 27, accused of killing Sgt.

"By . Ashley Collman . Teacher arrested: Former Greer High School choir teacher Jessica Bollinger was arrested last week after admitting to having sex with a student 'at least five times' but insists the affair happened after he graduated . A 31-year-old former choir teacher at a high school in South Carolina was arrested this week after admitting to having sex with a student 'at least five times'. The principal of Greer High School confronted 31-year-old teacher Jessica Bollinger last November, following allegations that she had sex with a former student. Bollinger told the principal that she had sex with the student, now 18, 'at least five times' but that their relationship started after he graduated. Bollinger was officially put on suspension pending an investigation into the allegations on November 20, and she resigned two days later. Now law enforcement officials are charging Bollinger with sexual battery, saying she had sex with the student months before he graduated - when he was still 17. They say the relationship started on October 1, 2012 and lasted until the following June 5, 2013. Though 17 is the age of consent, in South Carolina it is still illegal for a teacher to have sex with a student. Bollinger had been a teacher at Greer High School since August 2004. Following Bollinger's arrest, the school made a statement which read: 'Ms Jessica Bollinger, former choral teacher at Greer High School, resigned Friday afternoon, Nov 22, during the course of the district's investigation of the allegations. Crossing the line: Police investigators believe that the affair started when the student was still 17 and in high school. In South Carolina, it's illegal for a teacher to have sex with a student .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wealthy foreigners bought four out of every ten properties sold for more than £1million in London last year, according to a survey. Russians, Indians and Italians were the biggest non-British buyers of the capital’s premium homes, spending a combined total of £5.1billion, according to analysis by aviation firm Beechcraft Corporation. The number of London properties sold for more than £1million reached 6,145 in 2013, up 20 per cent from 2012. Mixed opportunities: The current generation of 25 to 36-year-olds, the traditional age group for first-time buyers, is split into 'property haves' and 'property have-nots' who face very different prospects . The research claims 41 per cent of them went to non-British buyers, who spent a combined £5.1 billion on properties. 'London is one of the most desirable cities in the world, and it is no surprise its prime property market is attracting so many buyers from outside of Britain,' said Scott Plumb, Beechcraft’s vice president of sales for Europe, Middle East and Africa. The research, based on Land Registry figures, shows Russians spent more than £536million on 264 million-pound homes in London last year. Indian buyers were not far behind, spending £449million on 221 properties. Italian buyers were third on the list, spending £436 million on 215 properties. Recent Land Registry figures showed that house prices in London increased at more than double the rate of the rest of the UK over last year. London house prices leapt by 11.2 per cent over 2013 to reach £403,792 on average, while prices across England and Wales generally lifted by 4.4 per cent in the 12 months to December to reach £167,353. Warning: Experts have said that property prices in London have begun to resemble a bubble . Experts warned earlier this month that stronger curbs must be considered for the housing market amid fears that London is starting to show 'bubble-like conditions'. By 2018, the average house price in London is expected to reach nearly £600,000 - some 3.5 times the average price in Northern Ireland and more than 3.3 times the average in the North East, according to a report from economic forecasting group EY ITEM Club. The report said that while the rest of the UK is returning to normality, London’s housing market is showing signs of 'bubble-like conditions' and policy makers should be prepared to step in. It said the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), which oversees stability, may need to consider imposing a formal limit on income multiples in relation to the size of the mortgage that someone wants to borrow. The report came as a separate paper from think tank Civitas suggested that restrictions should be placed on overseas investment in London homes to help ease 'rampant house price inflation' and the problem of younger people and families being 'priced out' of the market.","Analysis by Beechcraft Corporation revealed big-spending nationalities .

"By . James  Nye . A Facebook campaign which claims alleged killer nanny Yoselyn Ortega was not responsible for the deaths of two children in her care has provoked outrage. The page 'Support Innocence of Nanny Yoselyn Ortega' - set up by an anonymous group - is pleading for any information 'that could help bring the real killer or killers to be arrested.' And since the page was launched on October 29th - four days after the brutal stabbings of Lucia Krim and brother Leo in their Manhattan home - it has sparked fury from people who believe that Ortega, 50,  should 'rot in hell', be 'put to death' to those who think it is plain 'disgusting'. Scroll down for video . The controversial Facebook page that has caused outrage online by asking people to support Manhattan Nanny Yoselyn Ortega . 'We believe she did not do this crime and she deserves to have her day in court to defend against the charges to prove her case in a not guilty verdict,' said the administrators to Radaronline.com - who are now facing calls for them to shut down the page. While the family nanny has admitted to harming the two children in her care on the Upper West Side, police sources have told the New York Daily News that she has not confessed to the double murder. And users of the social networking site have responded with fury to some of the more outrageous allegations made on the page that are aimed at providing evidence for Ortega's innocence. 'This is absolutely disgusting,' wrote one Facebook user. 'I hope you burn in hell along with Yoselyn you piece of cr*p. You need a psych evaluation because it's obvious you're attention seeking.' Claiming to represent the family of Yoselyn Ortega, the page has only received 16 'likes' since its launch almost two weeks ago and asks readers to pray for her freedom. Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, pictured . with Lulu Krim, right, and Nessie, left (who was not in the apartment . during the attack) 'The only reason I would ever pray for her recovery is so she can be released from the hospital and thrown in a jail cell where she will most likely be beaten by other inmates,' posted a furious Facebook user. Indeed, a rival page has launched expressing outrage at one Facebook user in particular who has signed up to the page which protests Ortega's innocence. At the beginning of the week Ortega is alleged to have denied the murders of the two children she was caring for and instead told the police 'Marina knows what happened.'

Tragedy: Six-year-old Lulu, top, and her baby . brother Leo, right, were found dead in the bathtub after they had been . stabbed by their nanny.

Marina Krim returned to her New York home on October 25 with her youngest daughter to find her children Lucia, six, and Leo, two, dead in a pool of blood before walking in on nanny Yoselyn Ortega stabbing herself in the throat. When Ortega came out of a medically-induced coma on last Saturday, detectives immediately questioned her about the brutal slayings, before charging her with first-degree murder. Ortega revealed from her hospital bed that she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework. She also said she was involved in a vicious argument with the children's mother one day before the brutal homicides. Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, 'Marina knows what happened', a source told the New York Times. RadarOnline reported yesterday that Ortega 'told NYPD detectives that she was involved in an epic argument with Marina Krim the day before the children were tragically murdered.' 'Yoselyn also said that when she left at the end of the day before the murders, Marina ignored her when she said good-bye and this made her very, very angry,' Radar's source continued. Happier times: Marina and Kevin Krim, pictured at a 2009 event at Tavern on the Green in Central Park . Yoselyn became extremely animated when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were being cared for. Marina didn't think Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk food when she was out of sight. Ortega told police when she woke up from her coma that she was angry because the family wanted her to clean as well as look after the children. A Dominican Republic native, Ortega was questioned by police after allegedly butchered six-year-old Lucia and two-year-old Leo while they were under her care at an Upper West Side, Manhattan, apartment almost two weeks ago. Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that Mr and Mrs Krim asked their financially-strapped nanny to do simple housework as a way to earn money, thinking they were doing her a good turn. All this did was enrage her. 'She said something like, ""I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do housework"",' a law-enforcement source said of Yoselyn Ortega’s statements to police after she woke up from a medically-induced coma on Sunday. 'There was friction between her and the family.' Scene: Crime scene unit officials enter the luxury apartment building where the stabbings took place . Scene: The murders occurred at La Rochelle, a luxury prewar building on Manhattan's Upper West Side . Paying respects: A woman leaves flowers in front of the building . It was also revealed at the beginning of the week that Marina and Kevin Krim were worried about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the October 25 slaying and had told her that if she didn't improve her job performance they might need to replace her. A law-enforcement source told the Post: 'She was told that if she didn't improve her work, she would be let go.' Two weeks ago, the mother of CNBC executive Kevin Krim said that the young family treated Ortega, as they would one of their own, 'bending over backwards' to help her and even buying plane tickets so she could fly to the Dominican Republic with them. Oretega allegedly repaid this kindness by murdering her children before trying to kill herself. Marina Krim discovered her son and daughter, Leo and Lulu, in a pool of blood in a bathtub, each with multiple stab wounds. She was due to meet Ortega and her other two children at the local swimming pool with her now only surviving child Nessie, three. But when they failed to show up, she returned to her three-bedroom, $10,000-a-month pre-war apartment at West 75th Street and found it dark, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. When she went into the bedroom, she discovered her children in a pool of blood and a bleeding Ortega. The nanny, who had slit her wrists, then plunged a kitchen knife into her own neck as the horrified mother walked into the grisly scene, police said. She stabbed herself with such force that she fractured a vertebra in her neck, police said. Distress: A woman and two children visit the apartment where the youngsters were killed . Sadness: A mourner places flowers outside the apartment as she breaks down in tears . Neighbor Rima Starr, 63, recalls the moment she heard Mrs Krim make the grisly discovery.: 'I heard blood curdling screams and I went down to the lobby and there was the mother screaming, hunched over the three year old. 'At time she was screaming things like: ""I'll never speak to her again"", repeating that over and over again, then ""it's all right, you'll be all right, you'll be alright"" to the child. 'Then she would get waves of the reality of what just happened and then she'd go into just plain bloodcurdling screams with her arms flailing out to the sides.' One neighbor revealed the superintendent of the apartment block went into the apartment and questioned Ortega, demanding: 'So you cut her throat? So you stabbed her in the neck?' His wife then came out to assist and told horrified neighbours who had heard the screams: 'Two babies, in the bath, nanny' and made a cutting sign across her throat. Mrs Friedman added: 'At that point I knew the nanny had something to do with it'. Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Found: Escaped prisoner Michal David Elliot was captured last night after a chase . A convicted murderer who escaped a maximum security prison by peeling two fences with his hands before kidnapping a woman at knife point and hijacking her Jeep has been captured. Michael David Elliot, 40, was serving life for four killings committed when he escaped from the Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan on Sunday night. Authorities found Elliot in Indiana last night following a major manhunt. Officials were stunned by the killer's brazen escape, as he had a record of good behavior during his 20 years in custody. He wore a white civilian kitchen uniform to evade security and blend in with snow at the western Michigan facility, prisons spokesman Russ Marlan said. Prison fences were equipped with motion sensors to alert guards. The fences also carry electric current to shock anyone that touches them. 'It appears that did not happen. ... He was not zapped with electricity, and he was not picked up by the motion sensors,' Marlan said. Once outside the prison, Elliot, abducted a woman and stole her Jeep. She escaped late Sunday when he stopped for gas in Middlebury, Indiana, some 100 miles to the south. The woman told police that Elliot was . armed with a box cutter and a hammer and had said he wanted to get as . far from the Michigan prison as possible. The woman's red Jeep was found abandoned nearby in Shipshewana yesterday. Scroll down for video . On the run: Michael David Elliot was identified in surveillance footage at a gas station in Middlebury, Indiana .

The . woman, who is in her 50s, locked herself in the gas station bathroom . and refused to come out, so Elliot took her vehicle and drove off . without her. It is understood she was not injured during the ordeal. Authorities put Ionia on lockdown as they searched for the fugitive. 'We had dog teams. We had a helicopter from the state police,' said Michigan Corrections Department Director Dan Heyns. 'The response was good, but he'd left the area by the time we were mobilized totally 100 percent. It didn't take him long to get down to Indiana.' Looking for clues: The abandoned Jeep was found six miles away from this gas station after the female owner of the car locked herself in the restroom . Lock down: Elliot allegedly only bought $10-worth of gas, and paid in mostly change . Elliot was serving life in prison without parole for fatally shooting four people and burning down their Gladwin County house on August 8, 1993 when he was 20 years old, according to court records. Elliot and his accomplices were trying to steal money from a drug dealer, police said. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tuffnell, his brother Bruce . Squires Tuffnell Jr. and Kathy Lane were killed. He was arrested a few days later and had a gun that tied him to the slayings.

"By . John Stevens . She is used to enjoying the luxury of multi-million-pound mansions set in vast grounds, with swimming pools, tennis courts and private driveways. But Anthea Turner has moved a rung or two down the property ladder and is now living in a rented terrace house, it can be revealed. The five-bedroom townhouse in South-West London is worth around £1.2million, and the 53-year-old former GMTV and Blue Peter presenter is paying around £6,000 month in rent. Scroll down for video . Write caption here . Even so, it is a far cry from her most recent grand home, a £5million mansion in Esher, Surrey, which she shared with husband Grant Bovey. Standing in almost two acres of land, it had an indoor swimming pool and marble-floored hallway. She moved out of the marital home in November and was pictured locking up for a final time in tears after the pair ended their 13-year marriage following his affair with a 25-year-old. Miss Turner, once the highest paid woman on British TV, has to park on the street at her new home, which does not have its own parking or driveway. She is also having to get used to having neighbours again, with properties on both side on the tree-lined street, which is close to council-run allotments. She is thought to have chosen the smaller property to be close to her sister, Wendy, as she rebuilds her life. At the end of last year, she said: ‘They say the top three slots on the stress league table are death, divorce and moving house. Well, I’m currently going through numbers two and three.’ She ended her marriage with Bovey after discovering her was cheating on her for a second time with socialite Zoe de Mallet Morgan. Bovey, 52, who lost his fortune when his property empire collapsed, has also downsized to a rented property in Cobham, Surrey. He became one of the most high-profile casualties of the recession when his business Imagine Homes, Britain’s biggest buy-to-let company at the time, filed for bankruptcy. Miss Turner succeeded in ring-fencing her money because she was never a director of any of her husband’s firms. She was last year reported to be in the early stages of a relationship with former Dragon’s Den star and Australian private investor Richard Farleigh, also 53. Last week she returned to London from Austria after reaching the semi-final of celebrity winter sports programme The Jump on Channel 4. After Anthea Turner married Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell in 1990 the couple built a £1.8million detached mock Georgian house in Twickenham, West London, but moved out when they split. She and second husband Grant Bovey bought Barbins Grange, a farmhouse in 50 acres at Dunsfold near Godalming, Surrey, for £2.2million in 1999. It had a library, wine cellar, stables, cinema, helipad, pool and polo field. They sold it ten years later for £11.5million. £9million profit: 50-acre Barbins Grange near Godalming, Surrey . They downsized to Hascombe Court Farm, which they bought for £6million from DJ Chris Evans, but lived there for only a year. The four-bedroom house, also in Goldalming, had a separate three-bedroom cottage and two-bedroom barn. They sold it for £5million. Their final home together was the six-bedroom property in Esher, Surrey, which was bought for £4.3million in April 2011. The couple also had a £4million ski chalet with an outdoor whirlpool bath, massage room and sauna in the French Alps at Megève. She reportedly told friends last year that she was selling it. £1million loss: Anthea Turner and second husband Grant Bosey bought Hascombe Court Farm from DJ Chris Evans .

"By . Lydia Warren . The father of a teen stowaway who survived a five-hour flight from California to Hawaii after hiding in the wheel well of a Boeing 767 today said Allah saved the boy as he spoke out for the first time. Abdilahi Yusuf Abdi, who lives in Santa Clara, California, said that he was shocked when Hawaiian authorities called him on Sunday to reveal they had found his son, whom he identified as Yahya Abdi. The 15-year-old was found on the tarmac in Maui after climbing into a plane at a San Jose airport and then likely passing out when it took off - surviving low oxygen levels and freezing temperatures. 'When I watched the analysis about the extraordinary and dangerous trip of my son on local TVs and that Allah had saved him, I thanked God and I was very happy,' the relieved father told VOA. Miraculous: The boy, identified by his father as Yahya Abd, is pictured after he was found on the tarmac in Maui on Sunday. He ran away in an attempt to reunite with his mother, who lives in Somalia . It was previously revealed that the teenager had left the home where he lived with his father and stepmother in a bid to escape to Somalia and reunite with his mother. 'He was always talking about going back . to Africa, where his grandparents still live,' his father said, adding that the living conditions there did not make going back an option. He added that his son did not receive a . good education in Africa and has struggled while at school in the U.S. He said that these school problems appeared to be bothering him. The father said his son is now recovering in a Hawaii hospital. The teenager is ‘resting comfortably’ at a hospital in Hawaii, spokeswoman Kayla Rosenfeld of the state's Department of Human Services said in a statement. Hiding place: This shows where the teenager stowed away on the Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 . The young Santa Clara resident is in . the custody of the department's Child Welfare Services division, and . officials were working to ensure his safe return to California, she . said. The teen's friends at Santa Clara High School were stunned to learn of his death-defying adventure. ‘He was kind of shy,’ Emanuael Golla told KGO-TV. ‘He really didn't speak that much. But we were all surprised about what . happened. We didn't really think it was him, but we're happy to know . that he's all right.’ The boy, who is originally from Somalia, enrolled in Santa Clara High only a few months ago. On . Tuesday, it emerged that the 15-year-old runaway allegedly spent up to . six hours undetected at Mineta San Jose International Airport after . scaling a fence at around 1am. In San Jose, airport officials said they were reviewing how the boy . slipped through security that includes video surveillance, German . shepherds and Segway-riding police officers. After taking off around 8am, the . Hawaiian Airlines jet landed in Maui at 10.30am (local time) and he . eventually stumbled out of his hiding place an hour later. Home: The teen lived with his father and stepmother at this Santa Clara home - but vanished on Friday . Breach: The boy scrambled over a fence at Mineta San Jose International Airport in the dark, crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner's wheel well . It emerged that he actually left the . house in Santa on Friday night, meaning he was missing for around 36 . hours by the time he was found on the tarmac at Maui airport, Hawaii. Despite his lengthy absence, Santa Clara police have confirmed his family did not file a missing persons report. According . to Maui airport manager Marvin Moniz, the boy did not want to go home to his father. 'He . told us that he wanted to go and live with his mother,' he said. 'He said he missed her. 'It . was clear from talking to him that he was not happy and he did not want . to return home. He did not get on with his stepmother and did not like . living with her. He was a teenager who was upset and he was not ready to . go back.' Mr Moniz went on: 'He was very . disorientated and weak. We gave him some teriyaki meatballs, rice and . salad to give him some strength. 'He spoke perfect English and didn’t really have an accent, so I assume he had been in the US for a long time. 'He . seemed OK physically. The only thing he complained about was that his . ears hurt. He said all the noise and the vibrations had given him a . really bad ringing in his ears.' How he did it: It is believed the teen went into some sort of 'hibernation' to be able to survive the extreme conditions . The incredible story has been met with disbelief by all those who know the teenager and his family. Neighbour Amy McGinn told KTVU: . 'They are very quiet, very private. When I heard there was an argument, . that was surprising, because I never hear anything, like loud noises . from the house.' McGinn . added that the boy's father drives a taxi, while the stepmother is . mostly seen taking her five children to and from school. It . was not immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized . space, where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero . and the air is too thin for humans to stay conscious. An FAA study of . stowaways found that some survive by going into a hibernation-like . state. The FAA says 105 stowaways have . sneaked aboard 94 flights worldwide since 1947, and about one out of . four survived. But agency studies say the actual numbers are probably . higher, as some survivors may have escaped unnoticed, and bodies could . fall into the ocean undetected.","Yahya Abdi, 15, wanted to go back to Somalia to find his mother .

"By . Will Payne In Danvers, Massachusetts . The mystery surrounding the brutal murder of beloved teacher Colleen Rizter took another twist today after it emerged a judge has banned ‘distressing’ evidence against Philip Chism from being made public. Ever since last Tuesday’s horrific slaying - during which Chism, 14, allegedly slashed Colleen’s throat with a boxcutter in a bathroom at Danver’s High School, Massachusetts – friends and family of the victim have desperately tried to uncover a motive for the seemingly senseless crime. Chism allegedly confessed to the killing when he was arrested at 12.30am on Wednesday morning, but the freshman, described as ‘stone cold’ by one officer has refused to say why he did it. Beloved: The 24-year-old math teacher was allegedly killed by a 14-year-old student at the school last Tuesday . Now a number of media organizations are launching a legal challenge to overturn Salem District Court Judge Michael Lauranzano’s order hiding details of a potentially explosive search warrant, which could finally shed some light on Chism’s motive. Investigators searched Chism’s family home in Danvers – a couple of miles away from the murder scene – but their findings have been kept secret. The reasons why the warrant was requested in the first place have also been banned, along with the actual motion from the Essex County District Attorney’s office requesting the court order. Certain other details of the case have also been sealed - including an affidavit outlining the facts of the investigation - all of which would normally be available to the public, particularly as Chism has been charged as an adult. When the District Attorney’s office explained the decision it claimed one of the reasons was to save 24-year-old Ritzer’s distraught family from even more upset. It issued a statement saying: 'We requested the impoundment because the search warrant affidavit and the motion to impound the affidavit contain sensitive information that may be prejudicial to the defendant and jeopardize his right to a fair trial; witness names who have yet to appear before the Grand Jury and information that may contribute to the increased psychological and emotional distress of the victim’s family.' Secrecy: A judge has sealed evidence against Chism, above, despite him being charged as an adult. The DA gave no specific reason but pointed to its 'distressing or prejudicial' nature . But now a number of media outlets, including local papers The Salem News and Eagle-Tribune are fighting the decision. Peter Caruso, of the firm Caruso and Caruso, which is representing The Salem News and Eagle-Tribune, argued in a motion filed on Tuesday morning that the DA’s reasons for the motion are not strong enough. He wrote: 'The press’s ability to keep the public informed is premised in large part on open access to the court system, and on its ability to examine and report on judicial documents. 'The impoundment challenged by (the newspapers) here seeks to deny that access, and will impede the press from carrying out its important responsibility of reporting fully and accurately on a newsworthy matter of legitimate public concern.'

A hearing has been scheduled for Monday and if the challenge is successful, questions about Chism’s motive could finally be answered, bringing some kind of closure to the people of Danvers. Ever since Tuesday afternoon’s tragedy friends and family have struggled to understand how Chism, a shy, but pleasant student could savagely murder one of the most popular teachers at the school. Her funeral on Monday attracted hundreds of mourners, but no one there had any idea why Chism apparently did what he did. Police sources have told the MailOnline they are looking into the theory that the star soccer player, who only moved to Danvers, from Clarksville, Tennessee at the start of the school year, had developed feelings for Ritzer and he snapped when she spurned his advances. But all that is certain are the details of the murder, which happened around 3.30pm on Tuesday, while the school was still crowded with children. Pain: Peggie Ritzer breaks down in tears as she walks from her daughter's funeral service with her son, Daniel, on Monday. Struggle: Laura Ritzer, the victim's sister, is accompanied by her father, Tom, right, as they leave the service . The Boston Globe reports that the last public interaction between teacher Colleen Ritzer and her killer Phillip Chism came when she saw him drawing in class. Another student recalls seeing Ms Ritzer notice his sketching and she said matter-of-factly: 'I didn't know you could draw.' Rania Rhaedaoui was in the class and said Chism just nodded in response. 'There was a test coming up and she wanted to know if he had any questions,' Rania added. A different student saw the two together an hour after the last class of the day had ended, and she was standing next to him as he was sitting down by her computer. 'It just looked normal, like any other day,' Cambria Cloutier told The Boston Globe. But soon after Chism allegedly followed Colleen into a bathroom in the school then punched her in the face and slashed her throat with a box cutter before stuffing her lifeless body in a recycling bin. He then dumped the body, the boxcutter and his blood stained clothes in woods just behind the school, before changing into a sweat suit he had brought with him to class. Around 45 minutes later Chism was caught on security camera looking calm and composed at the Hollywoods Hits movie theatre, where he watched the 4.30pm showing of Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmin. He then walked to a local Wendy’s where he apparently bought food with Ritzer’s stolen credit card. Chism was picked up by police walking along a road in neighboring Topsfield at 12.30 on Wednesday morning. Why? Police have not revealed why Chism allegedly killed the popular teacher. One source told MailOnline that detectives still don't know themselves and the student has offered no explanation . Last week police sources told the MailOnline Chism had been completely co-operative with investigators, telling them exactly what had happened, but refusing to give any kind of motive. A well-placed police insider said: 'When we picked him up wandering around early on Wednesday night, he was subdued and showed very little emotion. He was stone cold. 'With the help of camera around the campus we were able to build up a very clear picture of events. 'He didn't deny anything and did not hold back information. But he would give absolutely no reason why he did it. There seems to no rhyme or reason. That is very rare. If someone is going to reveal what they did, they would usually give a reason, because, however mad their views, they want people to know what their motive was. 'We are obviously working on theories, based on intelligence and intuition, but until he actually tells us what was going on in his head, it will be incredibly hard to give a definitive answer. 'One thing we do think is that this was completely planned. He brought a change of clothes with him into school and changed after the attack. He dumped the body, his original clothes and the box cutter in the woods. 'That has all been found and is now evidence in the investigation. It is incredible to think he did this in the day, when other children were about. There was soccer practice going on. It is just so strange.' Meanwhile, a copy of Ritzer’s death certificate obtained on Tuesday by the Boston Herald states she was pronounced dead at 3 a.m. last Wednesday after her remains were found in a recycling bin in woods beside the high school, but that her time of death was 'unknown'. The report confirms an autopsy was conducted, but notes that the cause and manner of her death were 'pending investigation'.","Colleen Ritzer, 24, was found killed behind Danvers High School last week .

"By . Tim Shipman . 'Arrogance': EU commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Laszlo Andor says British politicians are pandering to prejudices and ignoring the benefits migrants bring . David Cameron is ‘pandering’ to xenophobes by seeking to limit the number of migrants from the EU – and the price to pay will be a rise in British taxes, the European Commission will say today. In an outspoken assault on the Government’s demands to curb the free movement of people, Laszlo Andor – the Hungarian Employment Commissioner – said Brussels has been given ‘no evidence’ that benefits tourism is a widespread problem. He accuses Britain of an ‘inappropriate over-reaction’ to the lifting of transition controls on Romania and Bulgaria. And in a calculated rebuff to the Prime Minister, he will say that it is impossible for Britain to rewrite the free movement of workers around Europe – a key plank of the Mr Cameron’s plans to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum in 2017. In a speech at the University of Bristol Mr Andor will say politicians are avoiding the ‘inconvenient truth’ that the ‘vast majority’ of migrants move to work and are an ‘asset’ to economies like the UK’s with an ageing population. He will say: ‘Politicians should be responsible enough to talk about facts, rather than to pander to prejudice, or in the worst cases, xenophobia. ‘The truth, and indeed it might be inconvenient for some, is that they don’t do it in order to claim benefits. These workers are in fact of considerable benefit to the economies, and to the welfare systems, of the receiving countries.’ Mr Andor will add: ‘In the specific case of the UK, public debt would be much higher in the future without immigration because of the ageing population. Do people in the UK really want to pay higher taxes instead of immigration?’ The Government has already tightened the rules to limit the ‘pull factors’ in the benefits system which ministers believe has enticed Eastern European migrants to the UK. Grant Shapps (left), the Conservative Party chairman, says Britain is trying to 'get a grip' on its borders. Mr Andor's comments are a swipe at Mr Cameron’s wider reform drive . New migrants from the European Economic Area will no longer be able to get housing benefit from April 2014 and they won’t be able to claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) until they have been in the country for three months. And those who pass an Habitual Residence Test, will only be able to get JSA for six months. But Mr Andor will say he is yet to see evidence of widespread benefit tourism. He will add: ‘In the case of the UK, I have been asking for such evidence to back up their claims for over two years but all that we have received is a series of anecdotes about cases of criminal fraud and vicars performing sham marriages.’ In a direct swipe at Mr Cameron’s wider reform drive, Mr Andor will say freedom of movement is ‘just one of the four freedoms on which the EU’s Single Market is based, along with free movement of goods, capital and services. Member States cannot cherry pick which of the freedoms they want and leave the rest.’ The speech, which was briefed to journalists in advance, sparked fury last night. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Why Mr Andor thinks it’s his job to criticise the Government’s actions to get a grip of our borders is beyond me. A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith added: ‘These attempts to interfere in the British welfare state are frankly tiresome.’ Tory MP Nick DeBois said: This intervention typifies the arrogance, remoteness and lack of accountability of the European Commission.’","Laszlo Andor says benefits tourism is not the problem UK believes it is .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . One of the two owners of a Quebec retirement home where a fire killed as many as 32 people has finally broken his silence. Roch Bernier, co-owner of Residence du Havre, in L’Isle-Verte, spoke Sunday at a mass dedicated to the victims of last week’s inferno that burned the facility to the ground. More than 1,000 people attended the mass while search operations continue amid staggeringly cold temperatures, stiff wind and blowing snow, only 10 bodies have so far been recovered. Devastated: Roch Bernier (right), pictured with Residence du Havre co-owner Irene Plante (left) leaves the church after a  Sunday ceremony in L'Isle Verte . ‘Inside each individual here in the church, there is enormous pain,’ he told reeling locals, according to CPTV. ‘We will have very difficult moments, but we will live them together.’ 'We call them our residents, but we can go further than that: they are part of our family,' Mr Roche continued. 'I have to tell you that it has been very hard for us deal with all of this.' He received a standing ovation from the majority of the town's 1,500 residents in attendance. Co-owner Irene Plante joined him, but did not speak. In a statement to the media, Mr Roche said 'The Residence du Havre was not a little castle of cards -- there was a lot inside. There was an extraordinary spirit. If everyone helps out, maybe we will be able to relive that passionate spirit.' He did not take any questions. Parish priest Gilles Frigon struggled to find words, almost breaking down at times, according to CPTV. 'It's through suffering that we recognize true love,' he said, his voice cracking. 'Lord, we are all assembled feeling the same pain in this profound suffering that breaks our hearts. Today, we really need you.' Quebec Premier Pauline Marois also attended the mass, she called the blaze 'unacceptable' and said authorities will begin the task of reviewing fire codes to see what further precautions can be taken to prevent an incident like this in the future, according to CPTV. The search for victims is still ongoing, and as many as 32 are missing and feared dead from the Thursday fire. It has been hampered by a combination of brutal weather and thick ice as deep as two feet that encased the smoldering remains of the structure after water used to battle the blaze froze in sub-zero temperatures. Rescuers have been using steam to melt the thick ice in an effort to find more remains, but the search effort was called off Sunday afternoon as the weather worsened. Mobbed: Mr Bernier speaks to the media as he leaves the church, but he did not take questions . Also in attendance: Quebec Premier Pauline Marois during a Sunday visit to the site of the fatal fire . Still shell-shocked: People arrive for a commemorative service held Sunday for victims of the horrific blaze . The grim search operation resumed Monday as temperatures approached the freezing mark, but the reprieve is only short-lived. Temperatures are expected to plunge back into the single digits for the next two days. The coroner’s office has only formally identified three victims, with the most recent being 89-year-old Louis-Phillippe Roy. Media reports have speculated the fire began in the room of a smoking resident, but fire officials have said that is one of several theories being considered. The majority of the home’s 52 residents – all but five – were said to be infirm, and bound to wheelchairs or walkers. Some also suffered from Alzheimers. Wasteland: A firefighter checks for gas leak as rescue personnel search through the scorched, icy rubble for victims . Back at it: Emergency workers resume the search for victims after harsh weather Sunday caused it to be temporarily called off . Still grieving: Jean-Andre Michaud holds a photo of his father Paul-Etienne Michaud, 96, who tragically died in the fire . Killer nferno: The flames consumed the nursing home and burned it to the ground early Thursday morning, as many as 32 people are feared dead . Emergency responders were able to rescue 20 of the residents in a newer wing protected by a fireproof wall, the rest were doomed by inadequate sprinklers and malfunctioning smoke detectors, according to reports. Survivors have been moved to other nursing homes in surrounding towns, and the Red Cross has raised around $180,000 to help replace the scorched belongings. The fire was made increasingly tragic by the fact the small town’s volunteer firefighters had many relatives in the home – some watched in horror as relatives burn to death. The local fire chief referred to the blaze as ‘a night in hell.’","Co-owner Roche Bernier said 'there is enormous pain' to a standing ovation from more than 1,000 churchgoers .

"By . Robert Hardman . Flying low over the ocean formerly known as Somerset, we come to the frontline of this epic battle. And this really is a battlefield. Down below, entire squadrons of bulldozers and diggers are constructing a vast dam – a Hadrian’s Wall of mud – for mile after mile in order to prevent an enemy assault on nearby Bridgwater. The water has just swamped the main railway line outside the town, and a line has to be drawn somewhere. Fortress in the floods: A mud wall is all that separates this home from disaster in Somerset . A little to the north, an 18-vehicle convoy of juggernauts has just arrived from Holland carrying one of the largest water pumps ever seen in the British Isles. Are we looking at D-Day – or Dunkirk? Either way, it has come too late for those villages and farms which are already in occupied territory. Yesterday, the waters on the Somerset Levels just carried on rising and a steady stream of tearful, angry residents continued to head for dry land, surrendering to the elements. With one exception. As of last night, Sam Notaro was still cheerfully holding out behind surely the most extraordinary piece of DIY since Noah’s Ark. Having recently built the house of his dreams for his young family, Sam has encircled his pride and joy with a six-foot wall of mud and rocks which has now featured in bulletins and newspapers around the world. And it was still getting higher as dusk fell yesterday evening. As I later discover, the whole thing might be considerably taller still had it not been for an executive at the Environment Agency who held things up for a day because Sam had not obtained the requisite permit for earth-moving. Is it any wonder the agency’s management is regarded with such contempt in these parts? Sam has been nicknamed ‘King Canute’, much to his amusement. Protected: An aerial view of Sam Notaro's house on the edge of the village of Moorland which was evacuated on Friday . But Canute famously ordered the waves to halt and failed. Sam, on the other hand, appears to be winning. I’d say he’s more like Churchill. He’s certainly fighting them on the beaches. Just don’t bring up the Dambusters here at Dyers Farm. From my helicopter cockpit, I can see the waves lapping at the top of his ramparts, while Sam and his father and a couple of friends take it in turns to scoop up more and more mud with a pair of increasingly submerged diggers. After weekend storms brought big waves crashing in from the west, they have even built themselves a new breakwater and outer wall. What are spirits like down inside this besieged little plot? It’s impossible to touch down because the garden is completely waterlogged and the helicopter pilot fears he could get bogged down. So I plot an amphibious landing. Working my way round to the outskirts of the drowned village of Moorland, I meet Sam as he comes ashore to pick up some more diesel for his water pumps. He’s from a big family of local builders and the whole lot have rallied round. Mum’s put together a few bags of supplies – pizzas, bread, tomatoes and a couple of bottles of wine. What he’d really like now, says Sam, is some fresh socks. ‘I haven’t felt dry for a week – and I do miss my babies,’ adds the 40-year-old father of two small girls. Never give up: Sam Notaro and his father Joe in front of his home . He moved them and his partner, Alana, . to temporary digs last week. ‘I was feeling a bit down last night. It . was like the North Sea coming straight at us and I thought the waves . might break through. But we held out and we managed to get the second . digger in today and that’s cheered me up.’ As . we prepare to set sail, a couple of his neighbours are coming ashore in . a police rescue boat. ‘Goodbye, Sam. Don’t know when I’ll be back,’ says a lady called Lorraine, doing her best to put on a brave face. Her voice starts to crack as she explains that she’d only just installed a new kitchen. Sam offers his condolences. The whole area is in a state of bereavement. We set off in a boat skippered by Sam’s friend, Craig Fleming. A car dealer by trade, Craig has been helping out for a few days, staying up all the previous night to monitor the pumps so that Sam could grab some sleep. Poor Moorland is a dismal sight as we sail down the main road. Many people didn’t even manage to get their cars out in time. We turn towards Dyers Farm and the house is a truly surreal sight poking out of the sea – like Mont Saint-Michel with a four-bedroom executive home on top. When he started building this house four years ago, Sam worked out the highest point that flood waters had ever reached in these parts and then added on another foot. ‘I did apply to go three feet higher but the planning people wouldn’t have it.’ In some places beyond the wall, the water is now five feet over the ground and still climbing. This village in Somerset has been left devastated by the rising water levels has been virtually abandoned . We moor at ‘the jetty’, a series of pallets laid over the dam. The photographer steps on to the mud and promptly goes up to his thigh in gloop. It’s not the easiest landing. Inside the stockade, there’s a couple of inches of water on the ground but the house itself has been completely sealed up with sandbags and polythene. ‘Would you mind taking off your boots?’ asks Sam as we reach the entrance. I assume he is joking but he isn’t. Inside, it is a very warm, very tidy, very clean and rather empty house. All the furniture, it turns out, has been carried upstairs. The paintings are still on the walls, as is a television. Over a cup of tea in the spacious kitchen, with its panoramic sea view beyond the dyke, Sam’s father, Joe, 62, vents his exasperation. The family are deeply appreciative of the efforts of two local Environment Agency officials, both called Steve, who have helped them bring in pumps and sandbags. ‘They’ve been brilliant. It’s the people at the top who drive us mad,’ says Joe. Setting aside the now unimpeachable . arguments for dredging, he tells me how he had arranged for several . lorryloads of earth and clay to come in here last Tuesday as soon as it . was clear that the entire village was going to be submerged. Last man standing: The 40-year-old looks out of his recently constructed £1million house . ‘Then the contractor called me and said that he couldn’t deliver the earth because Sam and I didn’t have a permit from the Environment Agency. I called the agency and was told I could be fined £30,000 if I didn’t get a permit.’ The permit – to ensure that the earth was not in any way contaminated – would take six to eight weeks to be processed. A day later, after a series of increasingly frantic calls to different parts of the agency, an official finally agreed to waive the demand for a permit. Joe’s lorries finally arrived and Sam could start work on his dam. ‘These officials just don’t have a clue,’ sighs Joe. ‘They’re more worried about wildlife. I love wildlife, too – I wouldn’t even kill a spider – but they need a businessman running that agency. Someone who gets things done.’ Looking at the extraordinary earthworks taking shape around me, I suspect the agency could do with a Notaro or two, instead of the floundering Lord Smith. Between them, Sam and Joe have built their own mini-Netherlands in less than a week. Last night, Sam and his crew had another setback as one of his water pumps packed up. Today, if the floods are still rising, the diggers may have to leave before the water gets into the engines. ‘But we’re still in with a chance,’ says Sam, adding that the locals are very grateful for all the support from the Mail and its readers. ‘We’re still fighting.’","Sam Notaro was holding out behind his six-foot defences built out of mud .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A female teacher at a Wisconsin high school has been sentenced to four years behind bars after having sexual relations with two teenage students. Megan Garland, 29, entered a no contest plea as the court heard about how she 'groomed' her victims by flirting with them in class with sexualized banter and rewarded them with 'gifts' of snacks and rides in her car. 'Words cannot express how sorry I am,' Garland said in a statement read aloud in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on Friday. Behind bars: Megan Garland, 29, has been sentenced to spend four years behind bars after having sexual relations with two different teenage boys . She was first caught performing a sex act on a 14-year-old male student in May 2013 when passersby saw her car rocking back and forth with steamed up windows in the parking lot of nearby Destinly High School. Garland and the boy, whose name will not be released due to his age and the nature of the crimes, had no relation to Destiny High School but she had begun teaching science at Messmer High School at the beginning of the fall 2012 school year. She also had a sexual relationship with a different 15-year-old student and she faced separate charges for groping that boy. She also allegedly forced him to touch her in a sexual manner. Assistant District Attorney Erin Karshen . said in court that Garland would test the boys by telling them secrets . in an effort to build trust. Horrific: Garland, pictured here during class, had sexualized banter with her victims in class and would 'test' them by telling them secrets like when one of them saw her cutting herself while at school . The Journal Sentinel reports that the 14-year-old boy once saw Garland cutting herself inside Messmer High School and they made an agreement for him not to tell anyone. Treatment: Garland has had depression and anxiety issues for years and is now receiving medication . Garland's attorney and her father both told the court that she has had depression and anxiety issues for many years. Since her arrest last year, she has been seeking treatment which includes the use of medication. She said that she plans to continue to 'work on my issues'. 'All I can do is offer my sincerest apology,' she said in court. The mother of the older victim said that her son now struggles with his view of sex and trust in women after Garland 'meticulously planned' their trysts to 'indulge her sick fantasy'. That mother also read a statement from the other victim's mother who said that Garland, who made up lies about the boys to the basketball coach to get them suspended from the team, has ruined his chances of becoming a basketball star. 'You saw his potential and tried to kill it,' the woman wrote in the statement. Garland's attorney initially pushed for her sentence to be one year behind bars with probation, using her 'searingly candid' interview with police as a point to her credit. That did not convince the judge, as she now faces four years behind bars. Garland was suspended from her teaching at Messmer High School, where she has worked since last July .","Megan Garland, 29, had sexual relations with two students, one aged 14 and the other 15 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . For years it was assumed by staff at Lambeth Palace that the oil painting hanging in a private sitting room was of Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's sixth wife. But when experts from the National Portrait Gallery went to the Palace - the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury - to research a portrait of an earlier archbishop, they were able to shed new light on the matter. First, the portrait was in a frame that pre-dated the rotund monarch's sixth wife, second; her clothes were from an earlier period, and third, well, the woman also bore a startling resemblance to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon. The first Catherine... or is it? This portrait has finally been confirmed as being of Catherine of Aragon . Much-married monarch: King Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in 1509, and Catherine Parr in 1543 . Tests soon showed that they were right, and now the gallery has hung the portrait of the devoutly Catholic queen rather mischievously, side by side with a portrait of Henry, whose desperation to divorce her was the catalyst for England's schism with the Catholic church. The 'exciting discovery' about the picture was made when researchers from the National Portrait Gallery went to Lambeth Palace to find out more about William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury who married Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in 1509. The researchers, who were working on a project called Making Art In Tudor Britain, noticed the painting on the wall of a private sitting room, where it has hung since at least the 19th century but probably longer, under the assumption it depicted Catherine Parr. National Portrait Gallery curator Charlotte Bolland said: 'It was immediately apparent that it was in a very early frame, something which was a relatively rare survival from the early 16th century. 'It was a way of frame-making that went out of fashion. That was a kind of sign that it was something quite interesting.' They realised that the woman's earlier . costume and her facial features strongly suggested it was of Catherine . of Aragon, rather than Catherine Parr, who was born in 1512, three years . after the first Catherine had married Henry. Different clothes and head-dresses: Catherine of Aragon in another portrait, left, and Catherine Parr on the right . The Archbishop of Canterbury allowed the gallery to borrow the portrait, which is oil on panel, for further research, and experts subjected it to x-rays and infra-red light which indicated that under the paint was a green background similar to that on a portrait of Henry painted in 1520. The research also suggested that the features of the woman's face had been altered, and that she was wearing a veil, which the first Catherine would have done. The evidence proved conclusively that the portrait was of Catherine of Aragon, who became Henry's first wife after his older brother Arthur, whom she married in 1501, died. The National Portrait Gallery has now hung the picture next to a similar one of the king. Ms Bolland said: ‘It is wonderful to have the opportunity to display this important early portrait of Catherine of Aragon at the Gallery. 'Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon were married for nearly 24 years and during that time their portraits would have been displayed together in this fashion, as king and queen of England.’ Ms Bolland said that discovering the original Tudor finish on a painting like this was 'an extremely rare find'. She said the portrait had been compared with the gallery's portrait of the king from the same period and both were very similar. She said: 'Whilst not suggesting the works originally formed a pair, the costume dates them to the same period and the works are of the same scale. 'It is likely that both are examples . of the type of portraits of the king and queen that would have been . produced in multiple versions, some of which would have been paired in . this way.' Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence: Lambeth Palace where the painting of Catherine of Aragon was on display . Catherine . failed to produce a son who lived beyond 52 days and so was rejected in . favour of Anne Boleyn, her husband's pregnant mistress. Catherine Parr was Henry's sixth and last wife, marrying him in July 1543 and outliving him after he died in 1547. The portrait was first spotted by National Portrait Gallery staff in 2009 but nothing was announced about who its subject really was until today, following years of research and tests to confirm it. The portrait is now hung next to the similar oil on panel of Henry VIII in the National Portrait Gallery, where staff say the artists of both are unknown. Henry and Catherine Reunited is on display from today. Henry VIII's first wife was the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon, who had been previously been married to his older brother Arthur. When Arthur died, six months after their marriage, his younger brother Henry married her in 1509 and Catherine was crowned Queen of England in a joint coronation ceremony with her husband. Shortly after their marriage Catherine became pregnant but gave birth to a stillborn daughter in January 1510.  A subsequent pregnancy resulted in the birth of Prince Henry in 1511 and there were great celebrations, but he died aged 52 days. Catherine then had a miscarriage, followed by another short-lived son, but in February 1516, she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Mary, and the child lived. Henry still loved his wife but became frustrated by the lack of a male heir and took several mistresses, among them Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne. Anne refused to become Henry's mistress but he pursued her until she succumbed, as his desperation for a son grew. His worry was all the greater because he had read in Leviticus that if a man married his brother's wife, they would remain childless.  Despite having a daughter, Henry still felt himself 'childless' for not having a son. The King petitioned the Pope for his marriage to be annulled and when Catherine - a devout Catholic - heard of this, she was so upset that she, too, directly appealed to the Pope on her side. Catherine's argument was that as she and Arthur had never consummated their marriage, they were not truly husband and wife. The argument and machinations continued for six years and things came to a head in 1533 when Anne Boleyn became pregnant and Henry decided that the only way to marry her would be to reject the power of the Pope in England and have Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, annul the marriage. Catherine had to renounce her title as Queen and be known as the Princess Dowager of Wales, which she rejected for the rest of her life. Catherine and her daughter Mary were separated and she was forced to leave the royal court, living in dank manor houses and castles with just a handful of servants.  She was said to suffer ill-health but never complained, and spent much of her time praying. Catherine and Henry's daughter became Queen Mary I of England in 1553 and was known for her brutal persecution of Protestants - earning her the nickname 'Bloody Mary'.","Oil on panel portrait was thought to be of Catherine Parr, Henry's last wife .

"By . Larisa Brown . Workers will be referred for health assessments if they are sick for more than four weeks under a new government scheme. GPs will be able to refer any worker who has been off sick or is expected to be absent in plans drawn up by the Department for Work and Pensions. The service will assess how sick they are and draw up a plan to return them to health – and work - as soon as possible. Costly: Up to 960,000 workers were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013 . It comes after the DWP revealed almost one million workers take at least one month off sick each year. Up to 960,000 workers – one in every 25 employees - in Britain were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 and September 2013. In means employers face a yearly bill of around £9 billion for sick pay and associated costs, with individuals missing out on £4 billion a year in lost earnings. Under the new Health and Work Service scheme, assessments will carried out by occupational specialists to draw up a plan and timetable to get the patient back to work quickly. Employees will be referred by a GP or their employer but the assessments are not compulsory. Those working in the public sector are among the groups most likely to take extended sick leave while those in London are the least likely, according to the official analysis of the scale of long-term sickness in the British economy. Workers in the northeast are also among the groups most likely to take long periods of sick leave. Employees working for small companies are less likely to take long periods off than those with big employers. ‘Excessive days off cost taxpayers a . fortune and is a needless waste of their hard-earned money.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance . Taxpayers spend about £13 billion a . year on sickness benefits and the Dwp estimates that sickness among . working age people costs the economy around £100 billion a year. The . health assessment scheme is the latest move in the Government’s pledge . to cut the country’s welfare bill after introducing new disability . assessments and cutting benefits. As part of the assessment, employees will be given a plan including a timetable for returning to work, fitness for work advice and signposted to appropriate help. An advice service on the internet and phone will also be available under the scheme. The DWP believes the scheme, to be launched in England, Scotland and Wales, will save employers £70 million a year and cut the time people spend off work by 20 per cent to 40 per cent. The new Health and Work Service will be funded by abolishing a compensation scheme for businesses paying long-term sick pay to their employees. New scheme: In future, employees off sick for more than four weeks will be referred to an occupational specialists who will help devise a plan to get them back at work quicker . Any financial loss to business from . the ending of the statutory sick pay percentage threshold scheme is . expected to be offset by a reduction in lost working days, earlier . return to work and increased economic output created by the new scheme, . according to the Dwp. Around . 300,000 people a year fall out of work and into the welfare system . because of health-related issues, according to figures. Mike Penning, the work and pensions . minister, said: ‘More than 130 million days a year are lost to sickness . absence in Great Britain, which has a substantial impact on workers, . employers and taxpayers. ‘We are taking action to get people back into work. This is a triple win. It will mean more people with a job, reduced cost for business and a more financially secure future.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Excessive days off cost taxpayers a fortune and is a needless waste of their hard-earned money. ‘It’s time to combat a culture that allows this startling and unjustified difference between workplaces to continue unchallenged .’ The government is trying to reduce long-term sickness at work in an attempt to cut the 300,000 who move out of work on to benefits every year because of health problems. The move by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, follows his introduction of tests to determine whether sickness claimants are fit enough to work. According to the Dwp, this controversial move has contributed to nearly 250,000 people coming off incapacity benefits since 2010. The work capability assessments have not passed without controversy. One 39-year-old woman from Livingston, near Edinburgh, was judged fit to work just weeks before she died. A heart and lung transplant patient from Essex died nine days after being declared well enough for employment.","One in every 25 employees were on sick leave for more than a month each year between October 2010 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Tracey Connelly has allegedly said she deserves special treatment because of her 'suffering' after her son's death, and wants a bigger council house . Tracey Connelly, the mother of murdered Baby P, is asking to be rehoused in a larger two-bedroom council flat. Connelly, who was jailed in 2009 for allowing her son Peter to be tortured to death, says she needs the extra space to attract a new man . She claims that she is the real victim, and deserves special treatment because she has 'suffered' over the death of her baby. Connelly, 32, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for doing nothing while her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen to tortured her son to death. However she was released in October last year after a parole board said she posed no threat to the public and has since been living in a bail hostel in the north of England. According to the Sunday Mirror, an inside source said: 'She is extremely demanding, and for Tracey it's all about her. 'She wants her own nice flat but when you come out of jail you get what you are given, but Tracey won't accept that. 'The greatest irony is that she sees herself as the victim in all of this so expects to be looked after.' In December last year it was reported that Connelly was asking for gastric band surgery in order to help her lose weight and snare a new partner. The 32-year-old told friends at the halfway house where she has been living: 'I need to do something about my weight. No one will touch me looking like this,' the Mirror said. Connelly was jailed in 2009 for allowing the death of her son Peter (pictured), who was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen . Steven Barker (left) and Jason Owen (right) remain behind bars. The pair inflicted 50 injuries on the toddler whose body was discovered in 2007 . As well as the operation which costs the NHS between £5,000 and £7,000, Connelly said she wanted diet pills to help her lose weight. A source at the hostel in North England said: 'She is desperate to lose weight but wants a quick fix, slimming pills and a gastric band on the NHS. 'She talks about getting herself a fella all the time.' Connelly, who weighs 22 stone, reportedly spends most of her time in her room, only leaving the premises to buy sweets and chocolate mousse at a nearby store.","Tracey Connelly, 32, was jailed in 2009 for allowing the death of her son .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Seeking execution: Government prosecutors will now been seeking the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who is the younger of the brother duo who set the bombs at the April attack . Federal prosecutors have announced they will seek the death penalty against 20-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the Boston Marathon bombing. Though Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to press for Tsarnaev's execution was widely expected, the move instantly raised the stakes in what could be one of the most wrenching trials the city has ever seen. The twin blasts killed three people and wounded more than 260 others, and 17 of the 30 federal charges against him — including using a weapon of mass destruction to kill — carry the possibility of the death penalty. 'The nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision,' Holder said in a statement. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set. Dzhokar's mother was told the news but is still coming to terms with it. 'How can I feel about this? I feel nothing,' Zubeidat Tsarnaev said to ABC. Prosecutors allege that Tsarnaev, then 19, and his 26-year-old brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who had lived in the Boston area for about a decade, built and planted two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the marathon in April to retaliate against the U.S. for its military action in Muslim countries. His older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a shootout with police during a getaway attempt days after the bombing. Scroll down for video . Up to him: Attorney General Eric Holder was tasked with deciding whether or not the federal prosecutors would be seeking the death penalty or just a life sentence for the bomber . Caught: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was wounded but escaped on foot and was later found hiding in a boat parked in a yard in a Boston suburb days after the bombing . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was wounded but escaped . on foot and was later found hiding in a boat parked in a yard in a . Boston suburb. Authorities have said he wrote about his motivation for . the bombing on the inside of the boat. 'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians…. I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished,' and 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all,' he allegedly wrote. The bombings stunned the nation during one of Boston's most celebrated events as runners crossed the finish line and friends, families and spectators were gathered to cheer them on. Killed in the bombings were: Martin Richard, 8, of Boston; Krystle Campbell, 29, of Medford; and Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from Shenyang, China. At least 16 others lost limbs. Tsarnaev also is charged in the slaying of an MIT police officer and the carjacking of a motorist during the brothers' getaway attempt. Helping the wounded: The twin blasts killed three people and wounded more than 260 others including Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs . Tsarnaev's case has attracted a high-profile defense team, including Judy Clarke, a San Diego attorney who has negotiated plea agreements with prosecutors to spare her clients the death penalty, among them Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph. Victim: Martin Richard, 8, was one of the three people killed . The Tsarnaev brothers had roots in the turbulent Russian regions of Dagestan and Chechnya, areas that have become recruiting grounds for Islamic extremists. The indictment alleges the brothers downloaded bomb-making instructions from an al Qaeda magazine and gathered material online about Islamic jihad and martyrdom. Massachusetts abolished its state . death penalty in 1984, and repeated efforts to reinstate it have failed. Tsarnaev is the third person in the state to be charged under the . federal death penalty. Since . the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, 70 death penalty . sentences have been imposed, but only three people have been executed, . including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 2001. Eight . people have been taken off death row by a judicial or executive action, . while 59 people remain on death row, according to the Death Penalty . Information Center. The last federal execution was in 2003, when Louis Jones Jr. was put to death for the kidnapping and murder of 19-year-old Army Private Tracie McBride.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, will now face execution for his role in planting two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon with his now-dead brother .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . It's puppy love for the record books. The Labrador retriever was the nation's most popular dog breed last year for a 23rd year in a row, the American Kennel Club has announced. That's the longest any breed has been top dog since the organization's 1884 founding. German shepherds, golden retrievers, beagles and bulldogs are holding steady in the top-five pack, with Yorkshire terriers, boxers, poodles, Rottweilers and dachshunds continuing to round out the leading 10, which mirrors last year. Scroll down for video . Best in show: The Labrador retriever has been voted America's most popular dog breed for the 23rd year in a row . Top dog: The family-friendly Lab breed has taken the number spot on the most popular list for the 23rd consecutive year, the longest reign at the top in American Kennel Club's history . But the comical French bulldog is newly on their heels after a decade-long popularity spurt. Surpassing the poodle's 22-year reign some decades ago, the Lab has proliferated as a congenial, highly trainable dog that was developed to fetch game but has readily taken on other roles: search-and-rescue aid, therapy dog, competitor in canine sports and all-around family pet. 'They're a very versatile dog. They'll adapt to just about anything,' says Michael Wiest of Warren, N.J., who has bred them for 45 years. The rankings reflect newly registered dogs, mostly puppies. The AKC doesn't release exact numbers but estimates its registry has included more than 40 million purebred dogs over its history. Runner up: German Shepherds have come in second on the AKC's 2013 Most Popular Dogs in the U.S. list . Helpful: The working ability that has made Golden Retrievers such useful hunting companions also make them ideal guide, assistance and search and rescue dogs . Adorable: The Golden Retriever, with its intelligence and eager to please attitude, is the third most popular breed in the United States . Adorable: It's easy to understand why so many pet owners gravitate to the adorable golden pups . 1. Labrador retriever2. German Shepherd Dog3. Golden retriever4. Beagle5. Bulldog6. Yorkshire Terrier7. Boxer8. Poodle9. Rottweiler10. Dachshund . The top 10 remains a testament to the variety of purebreds, from the pert, portable Yorkie to the muscular, purposeful Rottweiler. But overall, the AKC has logged some leaning toward larger dogs in the past decade. Shih tzus and Chihuahuas have dropped out of the top 10, while Rottweilers and bulldogs have marched in. Such big breeds as the Doberman pinscher, the Bernese mountain dog and even the great Dane have made double-digit gains on the popularity ladder. Feisty: Bulldogs, known for their loose-jointed, shuffling gait and massive, short-faced head, came in at number five on the prestigious list . Cute canines: French Bulldogs, or 'frenchies', came in at 14th last year - up from 58th in 2002 . But no breed has rocketed up the . rankings quite like the French bulldog, now the nation's 11th most . popular purebred after its numbers more than quadrupled in the last 10 . years. The Frenchie was 14th last year - and 58th in 2002. With foreshortened faces, large pointed ears and an attitude that's been described as 'a clown in the cloak of a philosopher', French bulldogs were in vogue in the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century. Then their popularity waned until recent years, when they've gotten exposure in such venues as Martha Stewart's chic-domesticity empire, TV's 'Modern Family' and a 2012 Skechers Super Bowl commercial. Some people flock to Frenchies because they're compact and don't need a lot of exercise or elaborate coat care. After 15 years of breeding cocker spaniels, Gale Golden developed tendinitis in her elbow and had difficulty brushing them, so she decided to try the short-coated Frenchie. Now she has eight. The bunch: The American Kennel Club said big breeds such as Labradors, German Shepherds and Bulldogs are becoming increasingly popular as the economy improves . Snapping at their heels: After a decade-long popularity spurt, the French bulldog is working its way up the popular breed iist . 'They have so many funny and endearing qualities,' including being people-oriented, said Golden, of Marlborough, Mass. 'A Frenchie is everyone's friend.' Still, popularity causes some consternation for aficionados, who fear demand can drive irresponsible breeding. To be sure, dog breeding in general has critics who feel it's more focused on human tastes than canine health and draws dog lovers away from mixed-breed pets that need homes. Purebred fans counter that conscientious breeding aims to create healthy dogs with somewhat predictable traits, helping people and dogs make lasting pairings. Popular: The most famous Beagle of all is Snoopy from the classic comic strip 'Peanuts' Number four: The Beagle, a sturdy hunting dog, is one of the most popular dogs in the United States .","It's the longest any breed has been top dog since AKC's 1884 founding .

"By . Melissa  Kite . When I finally reach Dave and Sue Donaldson’s home, or what is left of it, their severely disabled teenage son has just been rescued from his downstairs bedroom by emergency crews. Lashed by wind, rain and relentless floodwaters, their house in Burrowbridge is accessible only by a narrow canal path running along the back of the garden. It is becoming increasingly treacherous: anyone walking along it risks being blown into the churning water by the wind. Marooned by water: Dave and Sue Donaldson with their daughter Heather, 12, at the flooded home in Burrowbridge, Somerset . The front of the house is cut off – marooned in an ocean of water stretching as far as the eye can see. This is the Somerset Levels, but you may as well be standing on Blackpool pier. A set of huge pumps, like cannons, fire water in terrifying blasts from the flooded plains in front of the Donaldsons’ house into the canal behind them, which in turn is rising inexorably, threatening homes on both sides. Standing ankle-deep in water in the downstairs bedroom of the Donaldsons’ 17-year-old son, Luke – where his now empty mechanised bed stands on pallets – is like being on board a sinking cruise ship. It took fire crews with special lifting equipment and a flood emergency truck several hours to take Luke, who is severely brain damaged and in a wheelchair, to safety. After a sudden surge of water last week, the police came on Friday to tell the family to evacuate. When I arrive, Mrs Donaldson is packing the family’s belongings. She plans to follow her son and 12-year-old daughter Heather, who are staying nearby in a special centre for disabled people. Dave, 49, a builder, is adamant he is staying behind. Devastated: The small community has been completely surrounded by water after the River Parrett burst its banks. An old sitting on top of the hill is one of the only structures left untouched . He has heard that looters have been active – they have already targeted a nearby farm – and is worried about break-ins. Mrs Donaldson, 48, looks ashen with stress and fatigue as she packs boxes. The carpets are rolled up in bundles. Most of the family’s furniture has been taken upstairs. All around the Donaldson smallholding in Burrowbridge it looks weirdly like a seaside village. Waves rush across the flooded fields driven by 80mph winds. In one of their paddocks, the water line is just a few feet from two pet pigs, Mary and Billy. Most of their animals – two ponies, a goat, some sheep and chickens – have been moved further afield. But the pigs belong to a friend who brought them here when she was forced out of her flooded home in nearby Moorland. The family are anxious about moving them again because they are deaf and blind. Their owner, Shirley Armitage, is sitting on the sodden ground feeding her beloved pot-bellies digestive biscuits. It is a sorry sight. Safety: Sandra Thecton (seated on the left of the boat) and Joanna Elton (right) had to be rescued by the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue service as the water levels in Burrowbridge continued to rise . Mrs Armitage, 56, and her 85-year-old father, Walter Richards, have been evacuated from their house. ‘It’s a nightmare,’ she says, hugging Mary with tears in her eyes. Mr Donaldson is angry about what he sees as the cause of all this: ‘Three words: Dredge the rivers.’ He is particularly furious about the inaction of the Environment Agency. ‘What they have concentrated on is wildlife and birds. They have encouraged farmers to keep the fields fallow to create wetlands. 'They have diverted money from dredging and spent it on wildlife sanctuaries. The Environment Agency sees humans as a bloody nuisance.’ It is a story you hear everywhere you go. A few miles down the lane in Bere Aller – a village of a few hundreds souls – you come to Charity Farm, for now just above the level of the flood waters. It is aptly named because the farmer here, Barrie Bryer, has been helping to move farmers’ cattle from flooded barns. In his kitchen, Mr Bryer takes out a map and points to the place – a spot called Dunball – where he told the Environment Agency to install pumps to clear a clogged-up section of the River Parrett. ‘It’s no good being angry,’ says his wife Rosemary, ‘but my husband has been telling them we need pumps at Dunball for 20 years.’ Saturated: Farms have also been devastated by the extensive flooding . People like this feel they understand the Somerset landscape and how it works – but that they have been ignored by those in authority. As night falls in Burrowbridge, rescue boats motor through the flooded plains carrying sandbags, and police officers knock on doors to check on those who haven’t yet left. The huge set of pumps are still roaring away, and in the few hours I’ve been here, the water in the canal has crept up several inches. David and Marilyn Gillard are stuck in the middle of the deep floodwaters. At some point in the next few hours, Mrs Gillard, 63, will be taken out by rescue crews. But Mr Gillard, 69, is staying because he has a thousand sheep in barns, some of whom have started lambing. The family is being incredibly brave, but they repeat what is becoming a familiar refrain. ‘We asked the Environment Agency last summer why they weren’t dredging the river,’ says Mrs Gillard, ‘and they said they couldn’t because there were voles – and voles are protected.’ She smiles a grim smile. It is a good job people here are so stoic or there would be a riot. People here have pulled together with a Blitz spirit that is nothing short of heroic. In a courageous attempt to carry on as normal, mothers canoed their children to school – but had to stop because there is raw sewage in the water. In a cottage with sandbags at the door, right by the canal that looks about to burst its banks, Tom Douglas, 30, a youth justice worker, offers to make us tea and says: ‘You know what, the spirit here is Churchillian.’ A cup of tea may not be much in the grand scheme of things, but the formidable – though increasingly despairing – people of the Somerset Levels are coming to understand that small human gestures mean a great deal when your life is being turned upside down.","Residents in Burrowbridge say rivers should have been dredged .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is where the Queen retreats each summer to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the Scottish countryside. But her beloved Balmoral estate could soon be offering the Glastonbury Festival a bit of competition in the rural rowdiness charts. The estate in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, is considering hosting rock concerts and other live events as it looks for new ways to pay its bills. The Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, which features Balmoral castle (pictured) has long been the favourite summer retreat of the Queen, but staff are now looking for new ways to pays the bills . Balmoral last hosted an open-air concert – its only one – in 2006 to mark the Queen’s 80th birthday. The event was headlined by the Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins and attracted a crowd of more than 4,000. Now the estate – privately owned by the Queen and paid for by her – is looking into outdoor concerts in the spring and early summer before the Royal Family arrive for their annual stay. The estate is privately owned and maintained by Queen Elizabeth (pictured on the grounds in 2006) Gary Marsden, visitor enterprise manager at Balmoral, did not rule out pop or rock concerts, saying: ‘We are open to any suggestions suitable for the location. We are not planning to stage concerts ourselves – it would be up to others.’ On its revamped website, Balmoral says the picturesque grounds around the castle are available for hire. ‘Balmoral provides the perfect setting for your event, with wonderful scenery and the castle providing a magnificent backdrop,’ it says. ‘Whether you are planning a charity event, gala dinner, training course, team-building exercise, car rally, conference or even a concert, we can assist. ‘Our events field is the ideal location for an outdoor function with full marquee facilities and parking nearby.’ It adds: ‘For a number of years the events field has been the venue for large events such as Balmoral Road Races and also the Bike Balmoral. ‘It is also the regular setting for smaller events such as car rallies and specialist holidays with onsite accommodation. ‘If you would like to make an appointment to discuss the possibility of using the venue facilities at Balmoral, please do not hesitate to contact us.’ More than 50 companies paid £1,000 each for corporate tables at the previous concert, in aid of the Anthony Nolan . Trust, the blood cancer charity. Midge repellent – often essential in the Highlands – was laid on for artists and guests. The 50,000-acre estate costs around £3million a year to run and attracts more than 70,000 visitors when it opens as a tourist attraction between April and the end of July. Coming soon?: The estate's website says the grounds are available for hire before the Royal visit, and staff have not ruled out the possibility of hosting open air concerts, like Glastonbury festival, held on Worthy Farm . However, the income they bring only meets around half the estate’s costs.Last month MPs said the Queen should rent out her palaces and homes to help pay for repairs. A committee said she had been failed by advisers who spent too much money and did not do enough to save her deteriorating palaces. More than a third of the royal estate has been found to be below ‘target condition’, with Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle in urgent need of repair. Balmoral’s efforts to pay its way have been boosted by updating its online gift shop to offer a new collection of 21st-century souvenirs. The range includes Harris Tweed laptop bags and iPad cases, tiaras and even pink princess T-shirts, with matching socks. Also on offer is a range of crystal jewellery said to be modelled on items worn by the Queen down the years.","Balmoral estate is a Scottish retreat owned and paid for by the Queen .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The school's wall collapsed onto Jennifer Doan Rogers as she . desperately tried to protect her third-grade students as a tornado . ripped through their Oklahoma community. The young teacher had laid one . of her hands on Nicolas McCabe, a 9-year-old with an infectious grin. But it wasn't enough to protect him. The monstrous tornado leveled part of Plaza Towers Elementary School . in Moore, killing six of her students - including Nicolas - last spring. Rogers, who was eight weeks pregnant at the time, lay buried under the . rubble with a broken back. Touching tribute: Jennifer Rogers, left, and her husband Nyle Rogers, right, smile as they hold their baby Jack Nicolas Rogers - named in part for Mrs Roger's student . Mrs Rogers carried little Jack Nicolas for several months with a back brace because the collapsing school broke her back . 'He was actually the closest one to me, that I had my hand on, that didn't make it,' she said. Seven months later, Rogers gave birth to a boy. She named him after Nicolas. Rogers, 31, said she had been thinking about it for some time. She . was unsure if it would bring her more sadness to name her own son after . her former student, a little boy who loved riding his go-kart and, . according to his father, never met a stranger. He also was very close to . his mother. Ultimately, Rogers said, she and her husband decided on Jack Nicolas. The new mother hoped her infant son, who was born in December, would . help in her recovery from the injuries - both physical and emotional - . that she suffered during the storm. The top-tier EF5 tornado, with winds . exceeding 200mph, ripped a 17-mile path of devastation through the . Oklahoma City suburb on May 20. The storm killed 24 people and destroyed . dozens of homes and buildings, including two elementary schools. Nicolas' father, Scott McCabe, struggles to talk about losing his . only son. But he said that anytime Nicolas would meet anyone new - regardless of age or . gender -  he would befriend them. He often shared his lunches with his . friends. Mixed feelings: Scott McCabe (left), little Nicolas' father, said he is honored by the actions of his son's teacher - but the grief is still too near for him to celebrate the name . Learning that Nicolas' teacher was naming her own son after his brought a wave of emotions, McCabe said. 'It's real hard. He was my only son. I mean I'm honored, yes, but she . was the last one to touch Nicolas,' McCabe said as he broke down in . tears. 'I don't know how to put it, she was the last one to see my . little boy. And it's still kind of hard.' Rogers, too, is still recovering. She suffered a fractured spine and . sternum. She refused pain medication for fear it would harm her baby, . and she wore a back brace for several weeks. Little Jack Nicolas Rogers is thriving - despite the trauma his mother suffered during pregnancy . 'It was a lot harder than my other pregnancies, for sure,' said . Rogers, who also has two daughters, ages 6 and 3. 'I was so limited. I . couldn't do a whole lot. For a while after everything happened I was in a . full brace and carrying him and it just, I mean, it was rough.' But she is determined to complete the necessary work to go back into . the classroom. Though she knows it will be tough, she said she hopes to . get approval to return to teaching next school year - at Plaza Towers. The school is being rebuilt, this time with reinforced safe rooms that can withstand powerful storms. 'I just feel like there's a lot of me in there still,' Rogers said. 'I would think it's hard at the same time, but it'll be a new year and a . new building.'","Nicholas McCabe was one six students to die from Jennifer Doan Rogers .

"By . James Tozer . Primary schools were yesterday urged to bring Shakespeare’s plays to pupils as young as five in the hope they will ‘catch the bug’ early. Gregory Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said that children should see historical dramas as well as works such as Romeo and Juliet, often seen as more accessible. He believes the language should not be simplified for younger audiences. Wide-eyed faces: The RSC has said Shakespeare in its original form, such as the recent Richard II starring David Tennant, can connect with primary school children . However, he admitted Education Secretary Michael Gove will ‘probably guffaw’ at the idea. The national curriculum states that pupils should study two Shakespeare plays between the ages of 11 and 14, but makes no mention of primary schools. Mr Doran said children could be captivated by abridged versions of Shakespeare long before they start secondary school, when they may come to regard them as difficult or boring. He is due to meet education secretary Michael Gove to talk about the RSC’s work in primary schools, but predicted Mr Gove would ‘probably guffaw’. ‘You have to let the bug bite before kids get cynical,’ Mr Doran said. ‘Letting them get involved when they are 13 is much harder than getting to kids earlier, without all the prejudices and stresses and strains of the idea that Shakespeare is somehow difficult or boring or academic. ‘What Shakespeare is brilliant at is speaking to a lot of audiences at the same time and we can appreciate it on many different levels. And it doesn’t just have to be A Midsummer Night’s Dream or Romeo and Juliet.’ Mr Doran told the Sunday Telegraph he recalled being ‘grabbed by the stories’ as a child before becoming engaged by Shakespeare’s language as he grew up. Reaction: The RSC said that even abridged versions of Shakespeare in schools produced 'dramatic' results . ‘But it’s more than just good stories and nice language,’ he added. ‘It’s about ethics and morality.’ The education secretary has pledged to extend the study of Shakespeare’s works in state schools as part of an ‘unashamedly elitist’ approach. Mr Gove has said keeping the ‘amazing intellectual achievements of our ancestors’ from children amounts to ‘stealing from their rightful inheritance, condemning them to a future poorer than they deserve’. But while he has backed a scheme to introduce young children to Shakespeare, it focuses on Elizabethan themes in other areas of the curriculum rather than the plays themselves. But Mr Doran said exposing younger children to the plays would capture a new generation of converts. Meeting: RSC artistic director Gregory Doran, left, is due to meet Education Secretary Michael Gove, right, to discuss bringing more of the company's works to schools, but experts Mr Gove will 'guffaw' at his plans . The RSC said it saw dramatic results when it performed abridged versions of plays in Shakespeare’s original language in primary schools. Recently its production of Richard II, starring David Tennant, was streamed to more than 7,000 primary school children around the country. At a school in Bolton where it was shown to a class of seven-year-olds, the teacher wrote: ‘About 20 minutes into the performance, as I looked around at all the wide-eyed little faces looking up toward the screen, I thought I was going to cry. ‘As one child in Year 3 said, “Miss, is this for real?” ’ Jacqui O’Hanlon, director of education at the RSC, said: ‘Even for the youngest children, it is all Shakespeare’s language. ‘They are never, ever working with translation. They don’t want to be patronised. ‘When you’re at primary school, nobody has told you Shakespeare is difficult. The earlier we start with children, the more is possible. ‘And there isn’t a play that you can’t do.’","Artistic director Gregory Doran said even young children can benefit .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The family of a murdered 16-year-old boy told how they feared they could be targeted next by the killer after he spent a second day on the run from prison. Alan John Giles, 56, was serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of student Kevin Ricketts, who he butchered in 1995 in revenge for being dumped by his older sister, Elizabeth. On Monday night Giles absconded from HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, after he walked out of an open section of the multi-category prison. Escape: Alan Giles (left) was in the open part of the multiple-category HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire, serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts (right) in 1995 . West Mercia Police launched a manhunt and have warned the public not to approach Giles. Hours . after the break-out the niece of murdered Kevin told followers on . Twitter that her family had been told to ‘stay in our homes’ until Giles . was caught. Hannah Tyler, . 19, posted: ‘Had a few people . asking about this so just to confirm yes the news about the escaped . prisoner does involve my family. ‘He . kidnapped and murdered my uncle and he’s out. He has been missing for . over 24 hours now and people need to know. Please contact the police if . you see him. My family’s safety is at risk.’ Detectives said Giles escaped between 6am and 11am on Monday from an open part of the 1,261-capacity jail - which houses both category B and D prisoners. Detective . Inspector John Cashion said: ‘We have a dedicated investigation team . working expeditiously to locate and apprehend Giles and to that end we . are also liaising with our colleagues in West Midlands Police and in the . Prison Service. Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty . ‘We have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible. ‘It should be borne in mind that Giles was in an open part of the prison when he went missing. ‘However we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999. HMP Hewell - which is governed by . Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a . scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said . it was unacceptably dirty. The . report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were . high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs . and some staff seemed to lack motivation. It . also said: ‘Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been . “cleaned” by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the . exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.’ The . prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender . Management Service said the management team had been strengthened. ‘Furthermore, we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay. 'We are leaving no stone unturned in order to find Giles as we will provide whatever resources are required in order to achieve that. 'I'm making a direction appeal to Alan Giles himself personally to hand himself in at the nearest police station as soon as possible or to phone us on 999. 'I would also urge anyone who is helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.' He added: 'We don't know why he left. 'We can't underestimate the fact that he was convicted of murder and kidnap. 'We have no specific information that gives us grave concern for any members of the public. 'We don't know what his intentions are.' No one else is thought to have been involved in helping the on-the-run killer, who may have used the public transport network to leave the area. It is understood measures have been taken to ensure the safety of members of Kevin’s family. Giles, . from Oldbury, West Midlands, is described as white, 5ft 9in in height . and of proportionate build, with short grey hair and blue eyes. He has a scar on the right of his forehead and another small one by his left eye. The murderer also has tattoos of an eagle on his back and a swallow, shark and flower on his left arm. Shy . teenager Kevin failed to return to the home he shared with his mother, . Carole, in Woodgate Valley, Birmingham, after a day at college on . January 31, 1995. Giles, who . had worked as a builder, quickly emerged as a suspect as he had . recently gone through an acrimonious split with Kevin’s older sister . Elizabeth. He was obsessed . with his former lover and even tried to climb up to the balcony of her . flat, forcing her to jump with their young daughter from the first . floor. Giles was jailed for a . month after breaking a court injunction to keep away from Elizabeth and . then hatched a plan to murder Kevin as revenge. Police . believe he staked out the teenager’s route to the bus stop and watched . his movements as he left for college every day before snatching him. Giles was initially arrested on suspicion of kidnap but got a breakthrough when key witness Carl Morris came forward. Mr Morris told police he had befriend Giles at a hostel and the murderer had roped him into helping destroy any traces of Kevin. Giving . evidence at court, the witness said Giles had driven him though . Moseley, Birmingham, instructing him to rip up homework and throw it out . of the window. Giles, a former labourer, was described by police as an ‘expert digger’ at the time of the killing. ‘I don't know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat' - murderer Alan John Giles describes to police the moment he killed Kevin Ricketts . He was found guilty of murder and kidnap and jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court in July 1997. At the time he was just the ninth killer in the UK to be put behind bars despite no trace of a victim’s body. In . a shocking twist, Giles phoned police from his cell in Gartree Prison . in Leicestershire in July 1998 to confess to the killing and reveal . where he had buried the body. After . spending hours carefully excavating earth in the back garden of a house . in leafy Gough Road, Edgbaston, West Midlands, forensic anthropologists . managed to recover a body which had been concealed five feet below the . surface and hidden by thick undergrowth. Dental . records and x-rays confirmed that the body was Kevin’s, although the . body was too badly decomposed to establish a cause of death. At Kevin’s inquest, a transcript was read out of the interview between Giles and police. It read: ‘I don’t know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. ‘You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat. ‘A struggle broke out. I left him on the ground, where I showed you, in the garden.’ He went on to say that he had hit the student with a piece of wood, but it was not clear whether that had killed him. After his murder, Kevin’s distraught mum Carole, now 68, suffered a nervous breakdown. She now lives in Birmingham. A friend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I know Carole well because we swapped bungalows about five months ago. ‘I . last saw her on Tuesday and she looked very pale and drawn. She was in . her car hurrying somewhere. It looked like she needed to get somewhere . fast. Troubles: The HMIP report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation . ‘Giles ruined her . and her family’s life. The fact he has been allowed to walk out of . prison is appalling and it means his family have to go through the pain . he caused all over again. ‘If he had any decency at all he would kill himself.’ A . Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The level of absconding . from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began. ‘Absconds . are still 13 per cent lower under this Government. We are not . complacent about this issue and are looking at ways in which the risk of . absconding can be reduced further. ‘We . are committed to ensuring that risk to the public is minimised. All . those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and . categorised as being of low risk to the public.’ Giles . was believed to have been wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and white . trainers. He has had recent contact with family in the West Midlands and . most of his friends are in the same area. HMP . Hewell was created by an amalgamation of the three former prisons on . this site, Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange, in June 2008.

"By . Ruth Sutherland . Expert's view: Ben Broadbent brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners . A leading Bank of England economist has hit out at fears the Government’s Help to Buy scheme could create a new housing bubble. Interest rates would have to rise ‘a fair amount’ before homeowners in the scheme run into trouble, he insisted. Ben Broadbent, who sits on the Bank committee which sets interest rates, brushed aside concerns that an increase in the base rate from 0.5 per cent could hurt millions of homeowners. There are fears many borrowers are already financially stretched and economists have warned Help to Buy could fuel another housing boom and bust. Those taking advantage of Help to Buy face having to pay interest rates of around 5 per cent on their loans. When mortgage rates do rise, they may be unable to afford the higher monthly instalments and, in a worst case scenario, could face repossession. Mr Broadbent, a former senior economist at Goldman Sachs said: ‘I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulty, I must say.’ He told Sky News that the ‘numbers entering this scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering how low a level we are starting from’. But critics of Help to Buy slammed Mr Broadbent’s remarks as ‘complacent’ and pointed out the Bank has a poor track record at predicting housing market bubbles. Decisions: Mr Broadbent sits on the committee at the Bank of England (pictured) which sets interest rates . ‘The idea borrowers on Help to Buy could withstand a rise in rates is very complacent. The Bank is not very good at spotting housing market bubbles ahead of time,’ said City economist Dr Tim Morgan. ‘I don’t like Help to Buy at all. It is the old story of pumping up the economy by persuading people to borrow. Movement: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2016 . ‘This is a bad way to run the economy and I am fearful for people who take up this offer. Houses are pretty highly priced and they will have to pay a higher rate from the start, of around 5 per cent interest. When they are paying that much, it would not take much of a rise to tip them over the edge.’ The Help to Buy initiative allows borrowers to buy a home of up to £600,000 with a deposit of just 5 per cent. A government guarantee will cover the remaining 15 per cent, meaning taxpayers could be faced with a multi-billion-pound bill if borrowers who use the scheme fall into difficulty. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2016, but they could go up sooner if unemployment falls significantly or inflation starts to run out of control. George Osborne has put in place measures to soothe fears he is stoking a new housing bubble through Help to Buy. The Chancellor last month gave the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee a mandate to review the scheme each year to check it is not posing a risk to the economy. Ray Boulger, a mortgage expert with broker John Charcol, said: ‘If interest rates rise quite quickly it would cause problems.’ But he added that those on Help to Buy may not end up with the worst problems. ‘The ones most at risk are those who struggled to get a cheap rate without going through Help to Buy. If you are on Help to Buy you will be used to paying 5 per cent now. ‘Then in a couple of years time the value of your property may have gone up and you will have paid some of the mortgage off, so you should be able to shop around for a lower rate. It is those who can only manage on a very cheap rate that could be in trouble.’ Marian Bell, a former member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, said: ‘I have doubts about whether the way forward is for people to take on more debt. I wonder whether the Government should be taking on that risk on to its books.’","Ben Broadbent's remarks slammed by Help to Buy critics as 'complacent'

"By . Rachel Reilly . Lurking: An alarming number of people take secret photos of good-looking strangers . Next time you are sitting on the train and the passenger opposite you gets their phone out, you might want to look the other way. New research has suggested that nearly ten per cent of UK adults engage in the rather disturbing habit of surreptitiously photographing attractive strangers using their mobile phone. And the locations for the these secretive snaps are diverse - ranging from the train carriage to the coffee shop to the doctor’s surgery. The poll also found that seven million people have taken revealing pictures of themselves, putting them at risk of having their photos broadcast on the internet. The research was carried out mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, who asked 2,076 Britons about their mobile habits. Thomas Messett, head of digital marketing for Europe at Nokia, said: ‘Our research has given us a real insight into the ever-changing quirky habits of the British public. ‘It would appear that wiping your mobile phone pictures is a typical part of the digital break-up and gone are the days when people would burn photos of their exes.' The research revealed that more than eight per cent of UK adults have photographed attractive strangers on public transport, in the park, in a coffee shop and even in the doctor's surgery, a new survey, according the a report int The Independent. It also found that more than 90 per cent of people erase all photographs of their exes from their mobile phones to 'achieve closure'. The survey also claimed that almost seven million Britons have admitted to taking an intimate picture of themselves and storing it on their phone, leaving themselves vulnerable to social media mishaps, researchers said . The survey also claimed that almost seven million Britons have taken an intimate picture of themselves and continue to store it on their phone, leaving themselves vulnerable to an accidental social media broadcast of the image. Despite this relaxed attitude to taking intimate pictures, almost five million did admit to being worried that the embarrassing pictures could end up on their Facebook page. More than a third of those questioned said they were more likely to take an intimate photograph of themselves because of the increased rise of smartphone cameras and improved picture quality. A quarter, however, of those surveyed said they refuse to let their partners see the pictures on their smartphones.","People admitted to taking photos of good-looking people in the park, on public transport, in coffee shops and even in GP surgeries .

"By . Meghan Keneally . An elderly couple has been found dead in their suburban Massachusetts home after an apparent murder suicide. The bodies of Elizabeth Coyne and her husband Donald were discovered on Tuesday when a relative stopped by their Weymouth, Massachusetts home out of concern. The Boston Globe reports that police found a pistol at the residence that belonged to Mr Coyne but the license had expired on the weapon several years ago. Unanswered questions: The couple was found dead in their Weymouth, Massachusetts home (pictured) on Tuesday morning when a relative went to check on them out of concern . The exact time of death remains a mystery, as the relative found their dead bodies at 7.12am on Tuesday and police have since taken them for examination and a full autopsy. No further details were released about the condition of the bodies or if there was any indication about who was the shooter. 'There is no known history of domestic violence,' the Weymouth police department said in a statement. Donald, 83, and Elizabeth, 81, have two grown children who live about a half-hour drive away. Weapon: A .25 caliber Walther pistol (like this one) that belonged to the husband was found near the bodies . One neighbor told The Globe that it was the couple's son who discovered their bodies. The spokesman for the district attorney would not say if either of the Coynes had a history of dementia or any medical issues that would be clear considerations. 'At this point, we don't see anything that is linked to the events of the day,' David Traub said. It is unclear how long the couple had been married, but their children are believed to be in their mid-to-late forties and prosecutors say the Coynes had been long-term residents of their house.","Elizabeth, 81, and Donald Coyne, 83, were found dead in their Weymouth, Massachusetts home .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Gone too soon: Dammion Heard, 20, a student at . Western State Colorado University, was found dead not far from from . campus five days after his disappearance . The parents of a 20-year-old champion wrestler who was found dead in Colorado two weeks ago say they are certain their son was the victim of foul play and not a suicide. The body of 20-year-old Dammion Heard was discovered April 2 on Bureau of Land Management property 8 miles east of Gunnison, Colorado. His 2004 Saturn Vue was found nearby. Heard was last seen alive the previous Saturday in the vicinity of Western State Colorado University, where he was a freshman studying petroleum geology. The Gunnison Police Department said at the time that no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus, suggesting that the student killed himself. Police later said the cause of death was strangulation by hanging. The freshman’s family, however, have questioned the preliminary results of the investigation, stating that their son was in no way suicidal. '[He was] always upbeat, never had any issues with depression,' Gary Heard, Dammion's father, told the station WFAA. According to the victim’s parents, the 20-year-old student athlete was involved in a fight, which broke out at an off-campus house party the night he disappeared. Scroll down for video . Rest in peace: Dammion Heard was laid to rest last weekend, nearly two weeks after his death . The next day, Heard was planning to meet up with a girl, and just minutes before he supposedly drove into an open field and hung himself, Heard was caught on a surveillance camera filling up his car. ‘None of it adds up,’ Mr Heard said. ‘It all just seemed really fishy.’ Police say the investigation into Heard’s death is still ongoing. They are waiting for a toxicology report in the case before making a final determination, which could take up to a month. Dammion’s father told the Star-Telegram that he drove to the site where his son’s body was found and conducted an experiment, which convinced him that the official version of events does not make sense. ‘I took a mannequin out there and hung it up from the only tree that was there,’ he said. ‘He couldn’t have been up there very long because you can easily see the tree from the road.’ Mr Heard also pointed out other clues that set off alarm bells for him, including the fact that the battery was removed from his son’s cell phone, and that Dammion had locked his car and placed the keys in his pocket before allegedly hanging himself. ‘I just don't get it,’ his father said. Foul play: Gary Heard (left), Dammion's father, is convinced that someone killed his son . The young man’s parents believe that the mystery surrounding their son’s death is linked to a house party he attended on the night of March 29, where he allegedly got into a scrap with someone. Eyewitnesses have revealed to Gary Heard that Dammion was seen being pulled into a bedroom by two men. He was later photographed with bruised hands. Clues: The student's family say Dammion was involved in a fight the night before he went missing, and the following morning he was supposed to meet up with a girl . On the morning of March 30, Dammion texted a girl asking her to meet with him at his dorm room, his father said. The friend replied that she was on her way, but did not hear back from him. At 1.30am, Dammion pulled up to a gas station in Gunnison, where a surveillance camera captured him filling up his Saturn with $25 worth of gas. ‘He wasn’t drunk or staggering,’ Gary Heard said after seeing the footage. The father has since obtained Dammion’s phone records showing that someone used his cell phone to send a text message while the student was pumping gas – even though there was no phone in his hands in the surveillance footage. The Heards are convinced their son was the victim of foul play. The father is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Dammion’s killer. ‘There is no way my son took his own life,’ Gary Heard declared. Their friends also have set up a memorial fund to cover legal fees and help finance the Heards' private investigation into Dammion’s death. During his senior year at Fossil Ridge High School in Texas, Heard won the 2013 state wrestling title in the 113-pound weight class, The Star-Telegram reported. His high school wrestling coach Tony Lopez told the paper that Heard had been a wrestler since childhood, and that his father, Gary Heard, helped train him. Western State Colorado interim president Brad Baca released a statement two weeks ago reacting to Heard's passing. 'Dammion was a vibrant and beloved member of the campus community, a great student and an accomplished athlete,' the statement read. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with his family and friends.' Triumph: Heard won a state championship title last year while competing in 113-pound weight class for his Texas school . Those who knew the 20-year-old student athlete from Azle, Texas, were left wondering about what may have led to the tragedy. On his Facebook page, the handsome, 5-foot-7, 125-pound student appeared well-liked and popular, with dozens of photos depicting him laughing and hanging out with friends. Coach Lopez said Heard had always struck him as smart and 'calm-headed.' No foul play: Police say no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus . Popular: Those who knew Dammion Heard described him as a well-liked, calm and intelligent young man who loved wrestling . ‘He understood wrestling,’ Lopez said. ‘He had his goals set and he knew what he had to do.’ Meanwhile, Heard's current and former classmates and wrestling partners took to Twitter to express their grief at his untimely passing. 'RIP to Dammion Heard,' tweeted Oliver Pierce. ‘Have had some awesome memories with you and your dad since the youth days! I feel sick to my stomach!’ Another friend Lorenzo Padron wrote: 'R.I.P to one of the best wrestlers I knew Dammion Heard 2x state finalist 2013 state Champ at 113.' Heard celebrated his 20th birthday in November 2013, writing on his Facebook wall: 'I turn 20 on Sunday nothing comes good at 20 lol!'

"By . Jenny Hope . Pressure: Stress caused by personal problems as well as trouble at work during middle age could lead to the onset of dementia, scientists have warned . Getting divorced, losing a partner or struggling with work problems in middle-age could increase your risk of suffering dementia in later life, warn researchers. They found conditions such as Alzheimer’s may be linked to the amount of stress experienced up to four decades earlier. Common stressful life events can have ‘severe and long-standing physiological and psychological consequences’ in the brain, claims a study that investigated the effects of stress on middle-aged women. The study began in 1968 when 800 Swedish women underwent neuropsychiatric tests, which were repeated in 1974, 1980, 1992, 2000 and 2005. At the initial assessment, the women, who were born in 1914, 1918, 1922 and 1930, were asked if and how they had suffered from the impact of 18 different types of dramatic events, known as psychosocial stressors. These included divorce, becoming a widow, work problems, serious problems with children and ill-health in a relative, including mental illness. One in four women had suffered at least one stressful event, 23 per cent reported two, one in five had suffered three and 16 per cent had been through four or more, says a report in the online journal BMJ Open. During the assessment period, 19 per cent (153) of them developed dementia, with 104 of these being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The number of stressors reported in 1968 was associated with a 21 per cent greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s and a 15 per cent extra risk of developing any type of dementia in later life. The report said: ‘Common stressors may have severe and long-standing physiological and psychological consequences. ‘The number of psychosocial stressors measured in middle-aged women was related to distress and incidence of Alzheimer’s disease almost four decades later.’ An increase in stress hormones in the body can cause harmful changes in the brain associated with heart disease, high blood pressure and dementia. Lasting effect: Higher levels of stress hormones can be measured several decades after traumatic events, experts have found . The researchers said higher levels of stress hormones can even be measured several decades after traumatic events, as found in Holocaust survivors. They called for more investigations to assess whether more therapy should be given to people who suffer from stressful events in their lives. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘We all go through stressful events. Understanding how these events may become a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease is key to helping us find ways of preventing or treating the condition.’ Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘These types of studies are important for highlighting areas for further investigation. ‘From this study, it is hard to know whether stress contributes directly to the development of dementia, whether it is an indicator of another underlying risk factor, or whether the link is due to an entirely different factor.’","Conditions such as Alzheimer's may be linked to mid-life stress .

"By . Chris Greenwood . A whistleblower has been sacked after challenging the rampant spending culture within the Police Federation. Fiona McElroy said she fell foul of a vocal minority after asking ‘difficult questions’ over ‘acts of bullying, inappropriate behaviours and attitudes’. The former senior Whitehall civil servant was brought in to help modernise the press office of the ‘police union’, but was sacked by officials just three months into her role. Luxury: The Police Federation HQ contains a 55-room hotel and 11 two-bedroom grace and favour apartments for top brass . Miss McElroy is understood to have raised ‘serious concerns’ about how Federation funds are being managed and spent. These include concerns over ‘significant amounts of money’ put through on corporate Mastercard credit cards. Some of the four-figure bills are believed to have come after a conference organised by the Scottish Police Federation last November. One source said: ‘There were large bills run up by several individuals. They included significant amounts of money.’ Similar questions were asked in . September when several officers arrived at the National Police Memorial . Day in a hired stretch Humvee. Miss . McElroy also accused officials of bullying at the Federation’s plush . £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey, which was built in 2007 . and boasts a 55-room hotel with a bar, swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom . grace-and-favour apartments. Questions have previously been raised why the Police Federation – which represents rank-and-file officers – needs such a lavish HQ. Miss McElroy was marched out of its offices last Monday after being told she had ‘alienated’ senior officials. The move prompted her to go public, highlighting the contrast between her treatment and that expected by Federation representatives towards their 130,000-strong membership. David Davis, former shadow home secretary, said there have been 'lurid accusations' about federation spending for many months . In a statement, she said: ‘I offered honest and objective advice based on my extensive experience, made recommendations and asked difficult questions, however uncomfortable that was. ‘This included challenging acts of bullying, inappropriate behaviours and attitudes. It is deeply regrettable that the organisation that represents rank-and-file police officers dismissed me without due process being followed as a member of staff, given that it expects such standards to be applied by other individuals and organisations when it comes to their own members.’ The ugly spat blows open a furious power struggle at the Federation which is still reeling from the aftermath of the Plebgate scandal. An independent review by former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Normington found a ‘worrying loss of confidence and competence’ and said it needed urgent reform ‘from top to bottom’. David Davis, former shadow home secretary, said there have been ‘lurid accusations’ about Federation spending for many months. He called on it to publish expense accounts and receipts from its senior members for the past five years. He said: ‘There are also clear questions, even raised by the tax authorities, about the use of grace and favour apartments and other subsidised food and drink to the benefit of the national officers, which have no conceivable advantage for the national membership.’ The Police Federation said it could not comment for ‘legal and professional’ reasons’.","Fiona McElroy fell foul of vocal minority after asking 'difficult questions'

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Sharon Ferguson allegedly dumped her baby boy in a trash can after giving birth . A mother has been arrested after she gave birth, wrapped the newborn boy in a plastic bag and dumped him in the trash, police said. Sharon Ferguson, 28, was taken into police custody outside a liquor store in Greenville, South Carolina on Monday afternoon after the conscious baby boy was discovered inside the trash. A family spokesperson said she is mentally ill and homeless, WYFF reported. A homeowner had arrived to check on his rental home in the Nicholtown community when he noticed a trail of blood, which led him to the trash can. When he looked inside, he discovered the newborn boy, who was wrapped in a plastic grocery bag, which was inside a pink blood-covered blanket, police told Fox Carolina. 'We . found what looked to be blood outside of a trash can, and a little bit . on the ground,' Officer Jonathan Bragg told WYFF. 'At . that point we started digging around and found the newborn inside the . trash can.' The baby was alive, but he was in critical condition. Neighbors reported seeing him moving when he was pulled out of the trash can. Found: The little boy was stashed inside this trash can and found when the homeowner spotted blood . Authorities said they did not know how long the child had been there. The South Carolina Department of Social Services said the baby was in 'good condition' on Tuesday afternoon and will be put into foster care before the department likely takes custody. WYFF reported that Ferguson allegedly admitted to giving birth to the boy on Monday and then discarding him in the bin. She was charged with one count of attempted murder and one count of unlawful neglect of a child or helpless person, and her bond was set at $125,000. She was taken to the hospital on Tuesday after asking to receive treatment. She had initially denied medical attention on Monday. A family spokesman told WFYY that Ferguson suffers a 'diagnosed mental illness'. Scene: Ferguson left her son in the trashcan outside this home in Greenville, South Carolina . Shaken: Neighbors on the street said they hoped the woman finally got the help that she needed . A neighbor said she could not tell that Ferguson, who wore the same clothes every day, was pregnant but said that she believed the woman was mentally ill. 'It was at times disturbing, Shanika Cohens said. 'She was pretty much a loner. She walked the streets day in and day out but didn't bother anybody.' Another neighbor, Tracy Fant, said her mental illness should have been taken into consideration by the authorities when she was charged. 'They need to downgrade the charges and get her help,' Fant said. 'She didn't know what she was doing or what was going on with her body.' Authorities said officers are looking into mental health concerns.","Sharon Ferguson 'gave birth on Monday, wrapped the boy in a plastic bag and towel and dumped him in a trashcan in Greenville, South Carolina'

"By . Alison Smith-squire . Transgender Sophie Husband, who once weighed 47 stones, today thanked taxpayers for funding the £28,000 gastric bypass that changed her life. Losing 29 stones gave Sophie, 42 – who used to be a man called Bailey – the confidence become a woman. And now the senior schoolteacher is looking forward to a £6,000 body lift to remove excess skin as well as a £10,000 sex change operation - also all paid for by the taxpayer. Transgender Sophie Husband lost 29 stones after a gastric bypass operation on the NHS . But 6ft 1in Sophie claims her weight loss surgery – which cost more than double because she was so big her op needed extra medical staff and specialist equipment - is money well spent. 'I don't feel guilty,' she says of her NHS bill, which will eventually total almost £50,000, 'at 47 stones I was so big I was confined to bed. I had to rely on carers and benefits. Now I've saved the taxpayer money because losing weight meant I could go back to work.' And Sophie, from Portsmouth, who sports a DD bust from taking female hormones, claims she is also entitled to gender reassignment surgery and a free body lift. 'Being born a woman in a man's body has been as traumatic as having cancer. And the saggy skin left from losing so much weight makes me sore so medically it needs to be removed.' Meanwhile, she only ate so much because her gender issues – which began when she was aged 11 - were not recognised when she was at school. 'At primary school I had difficulty making friends,' says Sophie who grew up with parents Ken, 69, a retired chemist, mother Pearl, 68, a retired financial administrator and sister Alice, 32, 'at the time I didn't realise why but in hindsight I didn't identify with boys and all their talk about cars and football. Sophie Husband, before when she was Bailey, with her father Ken, now aged 69 . Sophie Husband is looking forward to a £6,000 body lift to remove excess skin as well as a £10,000 sex change operation . 'I was always interested in make up and clothes with the girls. I cried when I couldn't go with the girls for talks about periods. It was then I knew I'd been born into the wrong body.' But she was so ashamed of how she felt that she didn't confide in anyone. 'I knew my parents would be horrified,' she says, 'and then I'd never even heard of anyone wanting to change gender.' Her secret led her to comfort eat. 'As a child I was slim but from the age of 13 I ate huge portions. As well as a cooked breakfast and school dinner, I would buy chips to eat on the way home from school. Then after a home cooked tea I'd sneak downstairs and make myself bacon butties.' The weight soon piled on. 'Aged 13 I weighed 13 stones and from then on I put on at least a stone a year.' Sophie says she is grateful to the NHS for her new life. 'I know I've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but I'm proof it is money well spent' Aged 15 and 15st, Sophie's mother took her to see her GP. 'I was referred to a dietician who told me to cut back on my portion sizes. But no-one addressed the real problem of why I was eating – because I was so unhappy being in a man's body.' By the age of 18, Sophie was so depressed she was on antidepressants. Meanwhile, after leaving school, she had trained to become an electrician. But her weight soared so much she became too heavy to climb a ladder or squeeze into tiny spaces and had to give up work. Sophie decided to become a teacher, going to university to do a teaching degree. However, her weight continued to soar. 'By the age of 24 I weighed around 26 stones. I'd start the day with a big fried breakfast, followed by chips, sausage rolls, fish and chips in curry sauce, eight bottles of lager, and then more take aways. I just ate all the time.' During her twenties she married twice – but both the marriages only lasted a couple of years. 'The first marriage was when I was 22 and met Amanda as a pen pal. But aged 24 we'd split up. Second time around I married another woman but again divorced after just two years. 'Looking back I just married because I longed to be normal. I thought getting married would make me happy but instead it made me realise how unhappy I was.' After her divorces, Sophie moved to be near with her parents who were living in the Isle of Man. However, by the age of 30, she weighed 47 stones and was unable to work or care for herself. 'Although I had my own cottage, I was forced to claim benefits because I was too fat to work. I couldn't even get out of bed or wash myself properly. Instead, I laid in bed all day, occasionally venturing out on a disabled scooter. 'A home help came in to wash and clean twice a day. Meanwhile mum would bring in food. I'd beg for takeaways. If she refused to get them then I'd order them in instead. As well as meals of sandwiches, and packets of crisps, I adored pizza or Chinese food. I just ate all day.' It was during this time that Sophie, who was still on antidepressants, went for a counselling session one day and as her usual doctor was away, saw another. Sophie claims her weight loss surgery - which cost more than double because she was so big her op needed extra medical staff and specialist equipment - is money well spent . 'It was speaking with him I realised that the reason why I was so fat and wasting my life was because I was so unhappy I was a man.' Sophie was referred to the gender clinic at Charing Cross Hospital and after consultations, Sophie was diagnosed with gender dysmorphia. However, before she could take hormones or have a sex change operation, she would have to lose weight. 'My doctor had recently said if I didn't stop eating I would only have a year to live. With no exercise I was a heart attack waiting to happen and I was heading for diabetes. As I had so much weight to lose it was decided the best option would be a gastric bypass.' Sophie had to lose four stones first – which she did by drinking slimming shakes and just eating one meal a day.  'I was so desperate to start my sex change treatment that for the first time in my life I felt I really had a future to look forward to and wanted to lose weight. However it took me six months to lose that four stones and by the end my weight was starting to edge up again. So I knew I'd never be able to lose so much weight just by dieting.' Before her operation: Sophie, from Portsmouth, with her father Ken, now aged 69 . 'I don't feel guilty,' Sophie says of her NHS bill, which will eventually total almost £50,000 . Aged 37 she was booked in for the gastric bypass - which works by removing some of the digestive system so food isn't so easily absorbed - at The Spire hospital in Macclesfield. She says: 'The doctor said due to my weight it was 50/50 whether or not I'd survive the operation. A week before I confessed to my parents I was doing it because I wanted to change sex. 'Both mum and dad were horrified, especially my mum. They had no idea I was having the gastric bypass so I could become a woman. Mum didn't speak with me for months because she was so shocked and upset. She kept saying perhaps I was just gay or going through a phase. She couldn't understand it.' Fortunately the four hour operation went well. 'For the first six months I could only eat shakes and sugar free ice lollies but I lost nine stones. 'And within ten months I'd lost 12 stones and begun to eat mashed food.' Sophie decided to move to London, where she would be close to Charing Cross hospital for her gender reassignment treatment. Win weeks she landed a teaching job and started hormones. 'I was thrilled with the results - a waist and hips plus a DD bust. I've since had laser treatment to remove facial stubble, grown my hair long and bought new feminine clothes.' She now weighs 18 stones and is on the waiting list for a full gender reassignment operation, which involves making a vagina from the penis. 'Luckily my mum has now come round. For my birthday recently she even sent me a daughter birthday card. She realises now although I've changed sex I am still the same person.' Because Sophie has so much flabby skin, she qualifies for medical reasons for a total body lift. 'Right now I get lots of infections in between the flaps of skin which are really painful. I can't wait to have it all removed. 'I hope to lose a little more weight, probably going down from a size 18 to 20 dress size to a size 16, and then after my skin removal op, I will be having my sex change.' As she is a supply teacher she moves from school to school. She says: 'Luckily I've never had that awkward moment when I've left one term as sir and returned the next as Miss. 'And people rarely seem to guess I even used to be a man.' She still hopes to find love – with a woman. 'There is someone I speak to regularly,' she says, 'we met online and she lives abroad. So it's early days yet in our relationship but I would adore to settle down with a woman.' Meanwhile, she is grateful to the NHS for her new life. 'I know I've been lucky to have had tens of thousands of pounds of treatment spent on me but I'm proof it is money well spent.'","Transgender Sophie Husband used to be a man called Bailey .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More than two dozen solar flares have erupted from the Sun in the past seven days, catapulting radiation towards the Earth that could potentially play havoc with global communications. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued four radio blackout warnings in the past two days after solar weather suddenly turned turbulent. Radiation from flares cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere to harm life on the ground, but when intense enough it can disturb the atmosphere in the ionosphere, where GPS and radio signals travel. Scroll Down for Video . Violent: The fourth of the Sun's massive X-class . flares in a fortnight, which peaked on October 29 is pictured. The image by NASA's Solar Dynamics . Observatory shows light in . wavelengths of both 304 and 193 Angstroms . Since October 23 the Sun has let loose with 24 medium-strength M-class solar flares, and four X-class flares - the most powerful kind. In fact, with our local star heading towards the peak of its 11-year cycle, a period known as the solar maximum, this shouldn't be unusual. But lead up to the solar max has been unusually subdued this year. Humans have tracked the solar cycle continuously since it was discovered in 1843, and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun's peak activity. Holly Gilbert, a solar physicist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, told the Los Angeles Times: 'It hadn't been active in months, so it's like it finally woke up. 'For those of us who study the dynamics of the sun, it is exciting because it gives us more events to study.' Solar flares happen when energy stored in magnetic fields twisted across the surface of the Sun is suddenly released. 'You get a tangled bunch of magnetic fields, and they get too tangled and too stressed, they end up erupting,' added Dr Gilbert. Turbulent: Another X-class flare exploding off the right side . of the sun, peaking on October 27. This image is in the 131 Angstrom . wavelength, which is particularly good for showing solar flares and is often coloured in teal . The recent solar flare activity has also been accompanied by several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), say Nasa officials. There are another kind of solar phenomenon that send billions of tons of particles into space that can reach Earth one to three days later. Like the radiation from solar flares, these particles cannot travel through the atmosphere to harm humans on Earth; but they can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground. CMEs can cause a space weather phenomenon called a geomagnetic storm, which occurs when they funnel energy into Earth's magnetic envelope, the magnetosphere, for an extended period of time. The CME's magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of Earth's fields changing their very shape, distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids. They also can cause aurora. Storms are rare during solar minimum, but as the sun nears solar maximum, large storms occur several times per year.","U.S. NOAA has issued four radio blackout warnings in two days .

"MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with . Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their . former players, who was also in jail at the time, to hurt him . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Just as you thought things could not get any worse for Rob Ford, Toronto's crack-smoking mayor was ticketed Friday night for jaywalking and public intoxication in Vancouver. Canada's most notorious public official was in town for the funeral of a family friend when he was stopped by police for crossing the street on a red light. Eyewitness Ian Currie told Global News that he overheard the mayor tell police officers: 'I f-ed up, boys... I thought it was looser on the West Coast, I thoughts you were cooler over here.' More trouble: Rob Ford, Toronto's crack-smoking mayor, was ticketed Friday night for jaywalking and public intoxication in Vancouver . The News reported that the mayor was walking on North Road when he was flagged by an officer outside a Shell gas station. According to the news site, Ford, who has been battling drug and alcohol addiction, may have ducked into a nearby pub called Foggy Dew earlier in the evening. Ford's latest run-in with police drew a sizable crowd in Vancouver, with the hapless public servant pleading with onlookers not to take pictures of him because he is 'going to get in a lot of trouble.' The incident comes just days after the embattled mayor was named in a lawsuit filed by his sister's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail to prevent Ford's illicit behaviors from becoming known. A lawsuit submitted Wednesday by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs. The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye was threatened with 'dire consequences' if he did not remain quiet. He was in jail after being charged with threatening the mayor, for saying he would expose his 'unsavory activities,' the lawsuit says. Rob Ford, accused of planning an attack on his sister's ex, has a history of drug use and tongue slips . Rob Ford may have some secrets he'd do anything to keep quiet . MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their former players, who was also in jail at the time, to beat MacIntyre up. Ford and Aboodowleh arranged for staff members at the Metro West Detention Centre to 'ensure 'there was no supervision or surveillance of the area' where the alleged assault occurred, the lawsuit says. Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said the allegations are 'without fact or foundation.' When questioned further if the mayor had conspired in any way to harm MacIntyre, Morris said, 'The answer is no.' Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit. The mayor acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack, but he has rebuffed pressure to resign. The lawsuit also names Ontario's Ministry of Correctional Services, which is responsible for the province's jails, Aboodowleh and Aedan Petros, the former football player who MacIntyre alleges attacked him.

"By . Jenny Hope . Women who have Botox injections to get rid of laughter lines are more likely to feel depressed – because they can’t smile properly. The treatment, which works by temporarily ‘freezing’ muscles in the face, cuts off the signals sent to the brain when we smile which make us feel happy. It means the treatment may indirectly spark depression, according to Cardiff University psychologist Dr Michael Lewis. Cosmetic injection: Botox treatment works by temporarily 'freezing' muscles in the face (file picture) Botox is one of the most popular drugs used for medical and cosmetic treatments, including the reduction of facial lines and wrinkles by regular injections. Previous research by . Dr Lewis showed that treating frown lines left people feeling less . depressed. Because they could not frown easily, their mood improved. His latest study looked at 25 women who had Botox jabs for frown lines or crows’ feet, or facial fillers. They were asked to complete questionnaires, rating symptoms of depression between two and four weeks later. Women who had their crows’ feet treated scored around 12 compared to an average of seven by women who had their frown lines treated – more than 50 per cent higher. Dr Lewis said: ‘The expressions we make . on our faces affect the emotions we feel. We smile because we are happy . but smiling also makes us happy. ‘Treatment with drugs like Botox prevents the patient from being able to make a particular expression. ‘For example, those treated for frown lines with Botox are not able to frown as strongly. This interrupts the feedback they would normally get from their face and they feel less sad.’ There is some evidence that people who have their foreheads treated become more gullible because they can no longer raise their eyebrows in surprise and scepticism, he added. Dr Lewis plans further research to help people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who have heightened feelings of disgust. By using jabs to reduce the facial expression of disgust – the wrinkling of the nose – he hopes to diminish the patient’s feelings, and therefore their symptoms. Dr Lewis added that some women might be better off letting their laughter lines tell their own story. ‘They should be encouraged to celebrate the emotions they express and enjoy the laughter lines – they are there for a reason,’ he said. Charles Nduka, a consultant cosmetic surgeon and a council member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said he has seen Dr Lewis’s research in action. Some of his work involves restoring facial animation to patients after a disease or stroke. He said: ‘Enabling people to smile more has a beneficial effect on mood. ‘When I have operated on someone with facial palsy I do see an elevation of mood, partly because they feel better about their appearance but another positive effect is from the rehabilitation process which requires them to smile more often.’","Botox treatment works by temporarily 'freezing' muscles in the face .

"By . Mark Duell . Currency: The historic gold dinar being sold weighs 0.15oz and is slightly larger than a 5p piece . The first ever coin to record the famous Islamic phrase 'There is no God but Allah' is set to sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer. The historic gold dinar from 690 AD was minted in Damascus by the Umayyad dynasty - the first Arab empire, which stretched from Spain in the west to India in the east at the peak of its power. The coin, which weighs 0.15oz and is slightly larger than a 5p piece, comes in a set of 56 gold dinars struck between 690 and 750 - expected to sell for £500,000 at auction next month. Dated 77 in the Islamic calendar, the words written on the coin translate in English to: ‘No God but God, Unique, He has no associate. ‘Muhammad is the messenger of God who sent him with guidance and the religion of truth that he might make it supreme over all other religions. God is one, God is eternal. He does not beget nor is he begotten. In the name of God this dinar was struck in the year seven and 70.’ Andre Di Clement, head of Islamic coins at central London auctioneers Baldwin's, said: ‘What makes these coins so important is that they are from the first Arab empire. Islamic faith: Muslims gather in the historical Umayyad mosque in old Damascus city in September 2007. The historic gold dinar from 690 AD was minted in Damascus by the Umayyad dynasty . ‘With Umayyad the Islamic world spread from India to Spain. One of the things they did was eradicate coinage from conquered lands and introduce their own coinage systems. ‘These coins, and coins like these, would have been used to finance the building of the Umayyad empire. Each year a new coin was made. ‘At this time they were far more advanced than anybody else in the world. Although the first coin is worth £300,000 it comes as part of a set. It is one of the finest examples known. ‘This is the most sought-after Islamic coin out there, whose legends set the pattern for centuries to come. The coins were introduced at a period of expansion. ‘It was a military campaign, where they conquered and converted people to Islam. They used to create the coins by melting down coinage from those they had conquered.’ 'These coins, and coins like these, would have been used to finance the building of the Umayyad empire. Each year a new coin was made. At this time they were far more advanced than anybody else in the world' Andre Di Clement, head of Islamic coins at central London auctioneers Baldwin's . The coins have been owned by the same European collector, now in his 80s, for the last 35 years. He built up the collection by attending auctions in the likes of Switzerland, France, the U.S. and Britain. Mr Di Clement said: ‘He has children and grandchildren - none of whom are interested in the coins. He doesn't want them to be wasted so that's why he has put them up for sale. ‘He has been keeping them in a bank in recent years for security purposes, because of how much they are worth.’ The coins will be sold as part of a wider collection of Islamic coins by Baldwin's on May 9.

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . British authorities claimed the domestic partner of reporter Glenn Greenwald, 46, was involved in 'terrorism' when he tried to carry documents from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden through a London airport in August, according to police and intelligence documents. Greenwald's partner, David Miranda, was detained and questioned for nine hours by British authorities at Heathrow on Aug. 18, when he landed there from Berlin to change planes for a flight to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. After his release and return to Rio, Miranda filed a legal action against the British government, seeking the return of materials seized from him by British authorities and a judicial review of the legality of his detention. Detained in August: David Miranda, was detained and questioned for nine hours by British authorities at Heathrow Airport when he landed there from Berlin to change planes for a flight to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil . 'Terrorism': David Miranda, left, partner of Glenn Greenwald, right, the American journalist who first published the documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, has been called 'a terrorist' by UK authorities . At a London court hearing this week for Miranda's lawsuit, a document called a Ports Circulation Sheet was read into the record. It was prepared by Scotland Yard - in consultation with the MI5 counterintelligence agency - and circulated to British border posts before Miranda's arrival. The precise date of the document is unclear. 'Intelligence indicates that Miranda is likely to be involved in espionage activity which has the potential to act against the interests of UK national security,' according to the document. 'We assess that Miranda is knowingly carrying material the release of which would endanger people's lives,' the document continued. 'Additionally the disclosure, or threat of disclosure, is designed to influence a government and is made for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This therefore falls within the definition of terrorism...' Miranda was not charged with any offense, although British authorities said in August they had opened a criminal investigation after initially examining materials they seized from him. They did not spell out the probe's objectives. A key hearing on Miranda's legal challenge is scheduled for next week. The new details of how and why British authorities decided to act against him, including extracts from police and MI5 documents, were made public during a preparatory hearing earlier this week. Greenwald, left, with Miranda. British authorities claimed Miranda was involved in 'espionage' when he tried to carry documents from Snowden through a London airport in August . British authorities have said in court that items seized from Miranda included electronic media containing 58,000 documents from the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Greenwald, who previously worked for Britain's Guardian newspaper, has acknowledged that Miranda was carrying material supplied by Snowden when he was detained. Former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who leaked documents to journalist Glenn Greenwald . Condemns accusations: Greenwald, right, says the allegations against Miranda, left, show that the UK is 'absolutely and explicitly equating terrorism with journalism' In an email to Reuters, Greenwald condemned the British government for labeling his partner's actions 'terrorism'. 'For all the lecturing it doles out to the world about press freedoms, the UK offers virtually none...They are absolutely and explicitly equating terrorism with journalism,' he said. Separately on Friday, media disclosed details of an open letter Snowden issued to Germany from his place of exile in Russia, in which he says his revelations have helped to 'address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust' and added that 'speaking the truth is not a crime'. Snowden said he was counting on international support to stop Washington's 'persecution' of him for revealing the scale of its worldwide phone and Internet surveillance. Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert with the Federation of American Scientists, said that given the nature of the material that Miranda was carrying, a harsh response by British authorities was not unexpected. Miranda was not charged with any offense, although British authorities say they had opened a criminal investigation after initially examining materials they seized from him . 'It seems that UK authorities were attempting to seize or recover official documents, to which they arguably have a claim,' Aftergood said. 'The authorities' action was harsh, but not incomprehensible or obviously contrary to law.' In a separate document read into the court record, MI5, also known as the Security Service, indicated British authorities' interest in Miranda was spurred by his apparent role as a courier ferrying material from Laura Poitras, a Berlin-based filmmaker, to Greenwald, who lives with Miranda in Brazil. 'We strongly assess that Miranda is carrying items which will assist in Greenwald releasing more of the NSA and GCHQ material we judge to be in Greenwald's possession,' said the document, described as a 'National Security Justification' prepared for police. 'Our main objectives against David Miranda are to understand the nature of any material he is carrying, mitigate the risks to national security that this material poses,' the document added. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington had no comment on the court proceedings or documents.","David Miranda was detained and questioned for nine hours in August in Heathrow Airport, London, while in transit between Brazil and Germany .

"By . Lee Moran . Updated: . 08:43 EST, 15 February 2012 . Explosives experts today linked yesterday’s botched terror attack in Thailand with two earlier blasts amid mounting evidence that Iran is running a covert campaign against Israel. The homemade ‘sticky’ bombs, which feature distinctive magnetic sheets, were similar to those used against Israeli targets in New Delhi, India, and Tbilisi, Georgia, earlier this week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today warned that Tehran’s actions were destabilising the world and its aggression must be stopped . ‘Iran’s terror operations are now exposed for all to see,’ he told the Israeli parliament. ‘World countries must condemn Iran’s terror acts and draw a red line.’ Scroll down for video... Marked men: CCTV of the three Iranians, before they were caught with explosives in their Bangkok home . Mistake: Iranian Saeid Moradi, who is still alive, had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him, as police closed in on him outside a Bangkok school . Iran today announced it had stopped . oil exports to six European countries - the Netherlands, Greece, France, . Portugal and Spain, in retaliation for European Union sanctions. Meanwhile, CCTV footage has emerged of the three Iranian men believed to have been plotting a terror campaign on Bangkok - including the bungling bomber who blew his own legs off by accident. The three men are pictured . separately, dressed casually in jeans and t-shirts, walking down the . road in the run-up to yesterday's blasts. Release of the image comes as it was revealed one of the trio has fled to Malaysia. The fugitive, who has not yet been named, went on the run after a bizarre sequence of blasts in the Thai capital. It started when a stash of explosives accidentally blew off the roof of a house occupied by three Iranians. Two ran away while wounded Saeid Moradi staggered out and tried to wave down a taxi. Covered in blood, the driver refused to take him, and so he hurled a grenade at the vehicle. And when police arrived he then tried to throw another at officers - but it bounced off a tree, landed at his feet, and blew off his legs. Moradi has been charged with illegal possession of explosives, causing explosions, attempted murder and assaulting a police officer. Four people were injured in the events. Detained: Mohammad Hazaei (centre) speaks to police after he was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on Tuesday night . Explosion: Bomb disposal experts work on the Bangkok house rented by three Iranian men, which was blown up on Tuesday . One of his accomplices, 42-year-old Mohammad Hazaei, was arrested at Bangkok's international airport yesterday, but the third, Zedhaghat Zadech Masoud, slipped past security and fled to Malaysia. Deputy National Police Commander Pansiri Prapawat said: 'Our latest intelligence is that the suspect has escaped from Thailand ... to Malaysia already.' Thailand's National Security Council secretary Wichian Podphosri said the explosives used in Monday's and Tuesday's attacks, which also included a bomb that failed to explode in the Georgian capital Tblisi, used the same 'magnetic sheets'. He said: 'The individual was in possession of the same magnets and we are currently examining the source of the magnet'. Iran, which has been accused of being behind the attacks, has strongly denied any involvement. But Israeli ambassador Itzhak Shoham countered this, claiming Thai police had found and defused another two magnetic bombs that could be stuck on vehicles, after yesterday's Bangkok blasts. He said: 'They are similar to the ones used in Delhi and in Tbilisi. From that we can assume that there is the same network of terror. 'With the arrest of the two Iranians it leaves not too much room to assume who was behind it.' Investigation: A Thai bomb disposal expert analyses the damage following the blasts in Bangkok on Tuesday . Carnage: A bomb disposal expert checks out the damage, which also hit a police car, yesterday . Warning: Israel and the U.S. have told their citizens to be alert in the capital . On Monday, a bomb wrecked a car in New Delhi taking an Israeli embassy official to pick up her children from school. She was in stable condition today after surgery to her spine and liver. Her driver and two passers-by suffered lesser injuries in the attack which police believe was also a botched job. The motorbike rider who stuck the bomb on to the car put it on the opposite side to the petrol tank - if it had been on the tank side it would have been a bigger blast and likely caused fatalities. Five people have been detained for questioning. Israeli officials said an attempt to bomb an embassy car in Tbilisi failed and the device was defused. Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat confirmed that the blast there was caused by a 'sticky bomb'. He said witnesses saw a lone motorbike rider attach the device to the right rear side of the car in which the Israeli diplomat's wife was travelling. Destruction: Saeid Moradi lies on the ground, by a telephone box, after his legs were seriously wounded in the blast . The device was about the size of an iPad, would have exploded about three to five seconds after it was stuck to the vehicle and magnetic fragments were found at the scene. Bhagat said: 'This is the first time that this modus operandi has been seen in India. We don't yet have the evidence to point the finger at anybody. We are exploring all possibilities.' Indian media said investigators were scanning records of all Iranian nationals as well as Lebanese students who arrived in the country in recent months. India also said yesterday it was still unsure who was behind the attack, remaining pointedly silent on Israel's accusation that Tehran was the culprit. Police were visiting the Israeli Embassy today, with two Israeli Mossad agents reportedly flying into New Delhi. Fireball: The Bangkok blasts came the day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders . Closer examination: Indian security and forensic officials examine the car on Monday - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately blamed Iran for the attacks . New Delhi has good relations with both Iran and Israel, so the attack makes its diplomatic balancing act between the two countries all the more difficult and has thrust the mounting tension between the Middle East rivals on to its doorstep. Israel is the second-largest supplier of arms to India. But India is Iran's biggest oil buyer, relying on it for about 12 percent of its needs, and it is Tehran's top supplier of rice. On the diplomatic front, India regards Iran as an important partner to protect its regional interests when U.S. troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan. India's Economic Times questioned why Iran would take the risk. 'The idea that Iran would want to make India a theatre in its rivalry with Israel is far-fetched and does not sit well with the track record of Tehran's relationship with India,' it said. 'Iran is in a desperate position because of western financial sanctions to punish it for its nuclear programme but it is certainly not desperate enough to alienate New Delhi by ordering an attack on its soil.'","Wounded bomber arrested and charged after Thai blasts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The college administrator at the California Christian college where a gunman went on a deadly shooting rampage said yesterday she believed that she was the intended target - but had been  teaching elsewhere that morning. Ellen Cervellon said alleged shooter One Goh, 43, dropped out of the nursing program at Oikos University in November but had returned to the Oakland campus several times to demand a full tuition refund from her. Ms Cervellon said Goh was furious when she told him that the school could not refund all his money because he had been enrolled for nearly half of the program. Vendetta: One Goh (pictured left) reportedly shot seven dead at Oikos University in California after going to the school looking for administrator Ellen Cervellon (right) Police had previously said Goh was seeking a female administrator when he went to the college campus on Monday. When Goh was told the woman was not on at the college, he began shooting indiscriminately in classrooms. He killed six students and a school receptionist while wounding three others. The coroner's office named the . victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward . and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan first confirmed Wednesday that Ms Cervellon was the apparent target, but late in the day he said investigators believe another female administrator instead was targeted. He declined to say why police believe the other school official was targeted and would not identify her. 'She is terrified,' he said.

'Every single one of those students were going to be an excellent, excellent nurse. They're in my heart and they always will be.' Ms Cervellon said she was not on campus that morning because she was doing her other job, teaching nursing to students at California State University in East Bay. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told . reporters yeterday that Goh was angry after being expelled from the . school, but Ms Cervellon said he was never expelled and decided to leave . on his own. Support: A gunman fired indiscriminately on the campus on the morning of April 2nd as students attended classes . Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California . She said: 'He was never forced out, he showed no behavioral problems, and he was never asked to leave the program. 'He decided on his own to leave the program.' Prosecutors charged Goh with seven counts of murder today after the massacre at the college. The 43-year-old was also charged with three counts of attempted murder. He also faced a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty. Lost mother: Kathleen Ping, 24, was killed in the school shooting.

"By . Becky Evans . Five people are believed to have died during a prison riot in Indonesia yesterday, in which 200 inmates escaped. Scores of inmates, including terrorists, are still on the run after escaping from a crowded Indonesian jail that was still burning this morning. Thousands of policemen and soldiers are deployed around Tanjung Gusta prison to blockade roads linking Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, to other provinces, while fire brigades were battling the fires. Scroll down for video . Five people were killed during the riots at the Tanjung Gusta prison in Indonesia . About 200 inmates escaped in the riot with dozens still on the run the following day . A prisoner flashes a peace sign from behind the iron gate of the burned prison . About 200 prisoners escaped following the riot late yesterday in which three prison employees and two inmates were killed. Inmates forced their way out from the . prison while others set offices on fire and held about 15 officers . captive inside the jail, prison directorate spokesman Akbar Hadi said. Officers deployed to hunt the escaped inmates have re-arrested 55 of them and are searching for the remaining prisoners who are still at large, said local police chief Lt Col Nico Afinta. Three of 22 convicted terrorists have been recaptured. He said the prison employees who died, including a woman, were trapped and killed in an office building that was burned by prisoners during the riot. Prisoners set fire to the building after a blackout and three prison employees died when they became trapped . A burn victim is evacuated from the jail by Red Cross personnel . Crew use riot shields to protect themselves from rocks hurled by inmates as they try to put out the blaze . Convicted terrorists are among those to have escaped from the prison, which holds 2,600 inmates . The riot appeared to have been triggered . by a power blackout that knocked out water pumps, leaving inmates . without water since yesterday morning. None of the hostages was still being held this morning. The prison holds nearly 2,600 prisoners while its normal capacity is 1,500, Mr Hadi said. Witnesses said gunshots were heard from inside the prison, and television footage showed security forces carrying a white body bag into an ambulance from the burning building. The fire sent raging orange flames jumping several yards into the air and a huge column of black smoke billowing over the jail. Indonesian prisoners gather behind the window of the burned Tanjung Gusta prison building . Most of the escaped prisoners have been found and Indonesian officials said they will take legal action . Mr Hadi estimated about 500 inmates were resisting calls to stop the riot and said an evacuation was planned for the safety of prisoners who could become hostages as tensions showed no signs of easing. Vice Minister of justice Denny Indrayana, who is in Medan overseeing the operation, has requested evacuation of all inmates and appealed to those who remain at large to give themselves up. 'Legal action will be taken to chase them, and tougher action will be applied to those who refuse to surrender,' he said.","Scores of inmates still on run from Tanjung Gusta prison in Medan .

"By . Janet Tappin Coelho In Rio De Janeiro . A top Brazilian police officer who 'exuded testosterone' has shocked colleagues by taking a long holiday, only to return to active duty as a woman. Thiago de Costa Teixeira, 33, served in an anti-drugs unit and is currently in charge of a division in the city of Goiana. He took a three-month holiday at the end of last year in order to get a sex change in Thailand, and will return to work as Laura next month. Sex change: Thiago de Costa Teixeira, left before surgery, had an operation to become a woman, right, and is now known as Laura . Her 'bravery' has been hailed by superiors in the police force, and LGBT campaigners have said that it is a first for a Brazilian worker not to be forced out of their job after having a sex change. The police officer was previously married to a woman and has two young sons. Along with the sex change operation Miss Teixeira also had facial reconstruction surgery to create a softer female jawline and nose. Miss Teixeira, who has applied to have a gender and first name changed legally, said: 'I’ve always wanted to be a woman. But I was too ashamed to admit it. Eventually I couldn’t hide who I was. 'At first I was worried about how my police colleagues would react to the news but so far the reception has been great. Prominent: Miss Teixeira, pictured before her surgery, leads a police department in Goiana . 'Very macho': Colleagues spoke of her surprise at Miss Teixeira's decision in light of her previous professional persona . 'I haven’t received a negative comment from any of the people I work with. In fact, everyone is treating me as if nothing has happened, she told Brazilian newspaper O Popular. She has worked for the Goias state civil police force for over four years, first in the special narcotics division and then as the head of a division in Goiana. Daniel Diniz Adorni, Deputy General Delegate of Goias civil police, said: 'We see Laura’s personal decision as an act of bravery,' said . 'For us, her case is not an issue. We are more concerned about tackling the corruption, violence and negligent behaviour of some of our police officers,' said the senior officer. 'Laura has always been a valued and respected member of the corporation and this doesn’t change just because she has undergone surgery. She will continue to be employed in the same position that she held as Thiago.' Luiz Mott, a Brazilian LGBT campaigner, said: 'This is a historical moment in the fight for equal rights for transgender employees. New look: Miss Teixeira posted photographs on Facebook of her new appearance. She will return to work in February . 'To my knowledge this is the first case of its kind in Brazil where a worker has had a sex change and has not been forced out of their job. 'Even more important is that Laura works for a public corporation and is being allowed to return to her duties without any opposition from her managers. This is something to be celebrated.' Changes: Miss Teixeira also had surgery to alter the shape of her face, so that it would appear more feminine . On her Facebook page Miss Teixeira posted a picture of a phoenix - a symbol of rebirth in Classical mythology - rising from the ashes along with photographs of her as a woman, with long coiffured hair wearing make-up and a Civil Police black shirt. However, some officers have warned that despite the public support she has received, Miss Teixeira could be in for a less pleasant reception from her colleagues. One anonymous source described her as ‘very macho’ with 'all the characteristics of masculinity' you could 'hardly believe that he would turn into a woman.' Another said: 'As far as I can remember he’s never shown any tendencies towards homosexuality or wanting to change his sex. I think he will have a difficult time settling back into the job dressed as a woman with a female name.' Another who remembered her time as coordinator of the special narcotics investigative team, said: 'The chief was fearless in times of danger demonstrating his strength and courage as a man when facing killers and drug dealers. I remember he even had a beard at one stage. 'He exuded testosterone. He was not the sort of guy you would expect to become a female,' he added incredulously. But according to officers who work closely with Miss Teixeira, the sex change hasn't come as a surprise. Home turf: Miss Teixeira is an officer in the city of Goiana, in north-western Brazil . 'A number of us knew he was gay, it was an open secret but not something widely discussed especially as he was such a tough cop and someone you didn’t mess with,' said one. Carlos Gorski a senior police officer with the Goias force said: 'Unfortunately, we still have to live with the fact that some police officers will be shocked and make jokes when they meet Laura, but we preach tolerance and democracy. 'People have the impression that the profession is very masculine. We are trying to change attitudes internally so that police officer’s behaviour improves not only towards colleagues who are homosexual but most importantly towards the general public.' Brazil suffers from a high level of homophobic violence and abuse. According to government statistics complaints of violence against gay people more than doubled between 2012 and 2013. Miss Teixeira has already indicated that he plans to ask for a transfer from his old job running the police station in Goiana to the police unit that specialises in tackling crime against females. 'I feel that as a woman now I can make a difference investigating and helping transgender victims in particular who suffer abuse and violence because of who they choose to be,' she said.","Thiago de Costa Teixeira, 33, leads a department in the city of Goiana .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . 'Flagrant breach': Nigel Smith has been fined £250,000 for breaching a planning enforcement notice on five occasions . A man who flouted planning laws to set up an 'eyesore' business park on land at his farm is facing a record £250,000 fine - after the council used Google Earth to catch him out. Businessman Nigel Smith, 57, laid down hardcore to form a compound at the rural spot near Doncaster in 2009, before gradually adding a residential caravan, portable offices and shipping containers - all without planning permission. Smith continued to operate out of the site at Manor Farm, Moss, despite being fined £2,000 in November 2011 for failing to comply with an enforcement notice issued by Doncaster Council. Now - after the authority's planning team used a Google Earth image to demonstrate Smith's intrusion into a green field site - the businessman will face prison if he does not pay out £250,000 for his 'flagrant breach' within 30 days. Smith was convicted at Sheffield Crown Court after pleading guilty to breaching Doncaster Council's enforcement notice on five occasions during late 2011 and 2012. He was warned in court that he faces a two year jail sentence if he does not pay the enormous fine - thought to be the biggest ever for breaking planning laws - by the time the 30 days are up. Smith is understood to have been running various businesses out of the lot, which one neighbour in Moss has likened to a concentration camp. The landlord of the Star Inn pub, which . is on the same road as Smith's farm, said the businessman had created an eyesore. Google Earth: Doncaster Mayor Peter Davies said satellite images from Google helped to demonstrate Smith's intrusion into the green field site . 'He's put up huge bright flood lights and high barbed wire fences, it looks like a concentration camp,' said Malcolm Bulmer. 'He's . running Internet businesses from there and has employed a load of . Polish people to run them for him, but I've no idea what the businesses . are,' added the 56-year-old, who claimed the development has affected lunchtime trade at his pub. 'We are in a quiet rural area where people used to come out for their Sunday lunches. But no one wants to sit and eat looking at that monstrosity he's built.' 'Eyesore': Smith brought residential caravans and portable office buildings on to the rural site in Moss, Doncaster . Unsightly: Smith laid down hardcore to form a compound at the site - in breach of planning laws . Smith has said he intends to appeal against the fine, and against the way Doncaster Council dealt with earlier requests he submitted for planning permission. Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court he said: 'A planning inspectorate in Bristol assured me the containers would not be a problem. 'I brought in the caravans for my polish workers - they need somewhere to live. 'I run a butchery, a market stall in Doncaster and two coal mines. I know what I'm doing when it comes to business,' Smith added. Smith was ordered to pay Doncaster Council's costs of around £13,500 in full at Monday's hearing. Sentencing him, Mr Recorder Hubbard QC said it was 'difficult to imagine such a flagrant breach in defiance of the enforcement notices'. Fine: Smith has been given 30 days to pay the enormous £250,000 fine, or face a prison sentence of up to two years . 'Pleased': Doncaster Mayor Peter Davies welcomed the result of the hearing, which saw Smith ordered to pay the council's costs . Doncaster Mayor Peter Davies said he was pleased with the result of the hearing. 'It sends a clear message that Doncaster Council will not tolerate people using land for unlawful and inappropriate purposes,' he said. 'We will always seek to prosecute in these cases. 'We have a planning investigation team who gather evidence, which help build our cases. The team will use whatever tools they have available, in this case Google earth was one of those used.  'The Google earth image showed the intrusion on the green field site, which definitely helped the judge with his decision,' Mr Davies explained. 'He was able to see the transition from green field to a developed site.'","Nigel Smith set up a makeshift business park on green field land in Doncaster, parking portable offices and caravans on the site .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He may have been wanting to phone home, but nerds from the 1980s are still obsessed about the thought there may be hundreds of Atari Computer games buried in a New Mexico landfill. After decades of rumors, digging will finally begin this weekend in a New Mexico landfill for an apparent stash of what some call 'the worst video game ever.' The dig at the Alamogordo landfill is where the computer company Atari reportedly discarded millions of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial game cartridges in 1983 and will start excavating on Saturday morning along with officials from Microsoft-owned Xbox. Get digging! Gamers will finally know the truth behind the gaming legend of whether or not Atari buried millions of video games cartridges of the epic flop E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial in a New Mexico landfill in 1983 . Fail! The game was one of the worst commercially released games ever made and is often blamed for the game industry crash of 1983 . After the success of the Steven Spielberg film Atari snatched up the rights for an astronomical $22 million to release a game. The game was produced in just five weeks and was one of, if not the worst commercially released games ever made. Despite being a complete flop, it was still one of the Atari 2600's best selling game. Two million copies were sold before anyone realised how bad it was. It left another three million copies left unsold. Looking for E.T.:Crews begin digging at the old Alamogordo, New Mexico to search for copies of the Atari game""E.T. The Extraterrestrial purportedly buried there in the 1980s . The excavation will be open for public viewing. The company is joining with Fuel Entertainment and LightBox Interactive to search the landfill. All three companies are making a documentary about the project. Microsoft plans to release the documentary on its Xbox One console. If anything is recovered, the  city would have the rights to any discovered games. City Attorney Stephen Thies said any game cartridges will be stored by the city for possible marketing. However, a tentative agreement between the Alamogordo City Commission and Fuel Entertainment's parent company calls for Fuel to receive some games. The city will give Fuel either 100 game cartridges or 10 percent, depending on which is the lesser amount. The company plans to hand out the cartridges to film crews. A roaring success: The video game was based on the wildly popular 1982 Steven Spielberg movie about a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial who is mistakenly left behind on Earth . One for the trash! This game console is playing E.T., which is widely considered one of the worst games of all time. The game was so bad, and the business plan so badly thought-out, that it nearly destroyed the entire game industry . All three companies gained approval last month from the New Mexico Environmental Department for their waste excavation plan. The agency plans to send a representative to monitor the project once it commences. Atari paid director Steven Spielberg tens of millions of dollars to license the wildly popular 1982 movie's name, and game developers completed the project in just six weeks. In the game, the player takes on the role of the titular alien and tries to elude FBI agents while collecting pieces of a telephone to call E.T.'s spaceship. The end result was a huge commercial dud that caused the troubled company's worth to sink even further. Atari purportedly disposed of millions of game cartridges and other equipment by the truckload at the landfill. The area's supposed role as a gaming burial ground has taken on urban-legend status over the years. The landfill was first used as a dumping ground in the 1920s but has been closed since the late 1980s, officials said.","Steven Spielberg film that became one of the most iconic movies of all time .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Snejana Farberov . A couple who crashed the wedding of a Pennsylvania bride and groom have come forward to apologize for turning up uninvited. Newlyweds Krista Lamlin and Andrew Reilly had turned to the internet to try to track down the pair, after they were spotted enjoying their wedding reception three months ago. The hotel hosting the reception escorted the uninvited guests off the premises, but when the newlyweds saw how much the pair featured in their photos they wanted to know who they were. Spotted: The wedding crashers, seen enjoying champagne at the reception, have come forward to apologize . 'We wanted to know if there was malicious intent or if they just wanted to party,' she said. After hearing about the appeal the wedding crashers, who have not been named, came forward to apologize to the newlyweds. They said they had been staying at the Valley Forge Casino and Radisson Hotel in January and, when they saw the party, thought it would be fun to join in. The couple offered to buy the bride and groom a belated wedding gift, but Ms Lamlin refused. 'I didn't ever want to get them in . trouble. I apologized to them for calling them out, but I . did want to get the message out there that it wasn't OK to do,' she told ABC News. She added that if she hadn't spent so much time planning her wedding, the crashers may have gone unnoticed. Unwelcome guests: Newlyweds Krista Lamlin and Andrew Reilly, left, started an internet appeal to find the couple, pictured right. The uninvited guests later came forward to confess to gatecrashing the reception . 'Just be aware of who is on your dance . floor. Had these people just hung out in the background, I . probably wouldn't have noticed them,' she said. On the day of the reception, Ms Lamlin spotted the couple sitting at a table surrounded by her cousins. ‘I knew who I had sat at that table and knew they didn't belong,’ she told ABC6. What helped the alleged wedding crashers blend in with Ms Lamlin and Mr Reilly's 120 guests was their attire, which consisted of a button-down shirt and tie for the man and a little black dress for the woman. The couple made no effort to keep a low profile during the festivities, spending most of the night on the dance floor and waving happily at the camera. The brazen party-goers even posed for photos, one of which depicts the two grinning and embracing. Happy couple: Krista Lamlin and Andrew Reilly were married in January . Attention to detail: Lamlin did her own seating plan so she and Reilly, right, soon realized the guests they had seen at a table with family members had not been invited to the reception . Answers: Krista Lamlin says she wanted to know why the couple, above, had decided to crash her big day . The ruse eventually caught up with the sneaky duo, who were escorted out of the venue by the hotel's wedding coordinator. The newlyweds, who live in Reading, Pennsylvania, appealed to ABC6 Action News to help them find and identify the mystery guests. Ms Lamlin said she was upset because the unwelcome guests had marred her wedding video and photos, which were supposed to be reserved for their friends and family.","Couple come forward to say they just wanted to join the party .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . Quincy, Massachusetts firefighters leaped into action when a cab driver knocked on their door in the wee hours and said his passenger was having a baby. The firefighters in Quincy, south of Boston, not only delivered the baby girl on the sidewalk at the corner of Hancock st and east Squantum at 1:36 a.m. on Friday, they saved her life. Fire Lt.

An ambulance showed up and transported the baby and her parents to the hospital, where all are reportedly doing well. 'Everybody was breathing, crying and happy,' Darcy said to CBS. The Mail Online spoke with Deputy Chief Fenby who said that all firefighters are trained to deliver babies though it doesn't happen often. 'Most mothers know when they're about to have a baby,' he joked.

"By . Daniel Bates In Chicago . The brother of the $1m lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide the day after he got his winning check was the one who got the case re-opened, MailOnline can reveal. ImTiaz Khan called up the Cook County Medical Examiner in Chicago because he thought ‘something wasn’t right’ with the unexpected death of Urooj Khan, 46. ImTiaz was concerned because he learnt Urooj had coughed up blood as he died which was not consistent with the original ruling that heart disease was the cause of death. Scroll down for video . Not right: The brother of Urooj Khan called police demanding they re-open the investigation into the death. His call prompting the discovery he died of cyanide poisoning at the home he shared with wife, Shabana Ansari . Killer meal? Urooj died after eating a Kofta curry at his family home. His brother discovered he had been coughing up blood despite his official cause of death being a heart attack at first . MailOnline can also reveal that now Urooj’s demise is a being treated as a homicide, the Khan family are living in fear the poisoner may strike again. One relative, who refused to give his name for fear of retaliation, said that ‘anything is possible’ -  and that he fears his own children might become a target too by 'enemies that I don't know exist'. Urooj  died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the oversized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the winning scratchcard. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum. The initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes. It was only when ImTiaz intervened that the poison was found by further tests. Cruel death: Urooj Khan (right) poses with his lottery winnings alongside his wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) Loving family: Urooj shared his home with his wife, above, his father-in-law Fareedun Ansari, and daughter Jasmeen . Urooj’s body is now set to be exhumed to conduct further analysis to find out if he ingested or inhaled the fatal dose. No arrests have been made so far and Urooj’s wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied having anything to do with his death. Ansari told MailOnline ‘certainly not’, when asked on Thursday if she was responsible for the death of Urooj Khan. 'It's tough without him, it's really tough because he was my support and he was my courage and he was my strength,' she said. MailOnline has also revealed a Chicago police source has claimed that she did not share his last dinner, the traditional Indian Kofta curry she prepared at their home in Chicago. Urooj's daughter from a previous marriage, Jasmeen, 17, who lived at the property, did not eat the curry either. Also living at the address was Shabana's father, Fareedun Ansari. It has emerged he owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes that led to the IRS had taken out a lien on the property they were all sharing. Legal battle: Meraj Khan (right) launched a legal battle to win custody of her late brother's 17-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (center). Unidentified woman, left. Speaking to MailOnline the relative paid tribute to Urooj, a workaholic who ran three laundries in Chicago, as a ‘great guy, a loving caring man’. The ex-wife of the poisoned $1m lottery winner has not seen their daughter for 13 years in the latest sign of tensions tearing his family apart. Maria Jones said that it was back in 2000 that she last set eyes on Jasmeen, now 17, when Urooj Khan forcibly took her back to India. Mrs Jones was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so she was unable to contest custody. Even today her emotional scars are so deep that she has left a dramatic voicemail on her home answerphone: 'If this is Jasmeen, please leave your number and I will call you. I’ve been waiting to hear from you. I love you.' The disclosure is another sign that the death of Mr Khan, 46, last July the day after he collected his winning cheque has exposed the divisions within his family. Tests showed he died from cyanide poisoning but no arrests have been made. His second wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied she has anything to do with his death. Speaking to the Chicago Sun-Times, Mrs Jones, 43, said that she was 'shocked' when she saw her daughter's face on TV earlier this week. She said: 'I don't know if she knows I'm still alive. I thought she was in India all these years'. Mrs Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997. She said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told that he had left the US for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come back. Mrs Jones did not want to discuss her relationship with her ex-husband. She merely said it was a 'really really long story' but said she was desperate to see her daughter. She said: 'I don’t know what she knows. She was so little. I don’t want to hurt her.' When MailOnline visited Mrs Jones at her home in Granger, Indiana, her husband Billy Jones answered the door and said she was in the bath. When our reporter called later on the phone he said: 'She has decided not to comment at this time. She's a bit emotional, it's all a bit raw'. He said: ‘ImTiaz is the one who pushed it to an investigation. Urooj was only 46 years old so he (ImTiaz)  thought that something wasn’t right. How could a man die all of a sudden and one day after winning the lottery? It was weird. ‘When he passed I know that he threw up some blood and in a heart attack you don’t throw up blood.’ The relative said that the killing had sent shockwaves through the Khan family and caused them to ask each other hard, uncomfortable questions. Requesting he not be identified, the relative said: ‘I don’t want to cause any trouble or make enemies that I don’t know exist. ‘Anything is possible. It’s something you hear about on TV or CSI. ‘I don’t want to cause trouble and make enemies for myself. You never know. Someone poisoned somebody in my family and if I speak anything negative or positive I don’t want anything to happen to my family or me either. ‘This was just for the money, just for the money. I can’t believe it. Hopefully justice will be served and they will find the person who did this.’ The relative also said that Urooj’s daughter Jasmeen, was ‘OK’ and that ‘everyone’s supporting her’. The relative said: ‘She’s doing the best she can, we’re all there for her.’ Even if Urooj’s body is exhumed none of the family will be there as it will be ‘too painful’ to see, the family member added. When MailOnline went to ImTiaz’s house nobody answered the door. Two female family members who went in declined to comment. A woman who answered the phone at the office of his Chicago lawyer Michael Erde said: ‘Mr Erde is not taking calls and has asked me to say he is saying no comment.’ Agony: The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' Stephen Cina, the Cook County Medical Examiner, has declined to confirm who it was who called up and asked him to re-investigate the case. Urooj’s family went to war with Shabana after his death amid claims she tried to cash the winning check in the days after his death. Urooj’s brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after his demise but for some reason was unable to. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . ImTiaz also claimed his late brother and his wife were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on the 50 per cent of the lottery prize she would otherwise be entitled to. In response, Miss Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate. In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan launched a separate legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter from his first marriage, Jasmeen. Meraj successfully got custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her step mother, most of her life. And as a result of the filings, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for another three months. The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organising how the funds will be handed out - normally it is 50 per cent to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for a complaint.","ImTiaz Khan was concerned because his brother Urooj, 46, had coughed up blood as he died in agony a day after collecting winning check .

"By . Louise Boyle . A teenage drug dealer has been arrested for the fifth time on drug charges alongside his pregnant girlfriend who was allegedly smuggling black-tar heroin in her crotch. Brandon Lee Rumple, 19, and Tasha Nicole Simpson, 25, who is eight-months' pregnant, had been under surveillance in Rowan County, North Carolina. A special investigations unit had received a tip that Rumple, who was out of jail on more than a $1million in bonds, had been spotted at a known 'heroin distribution point' in Charlotte. Brandon Lee Rumple, 19, (pictured left) was arrested for the fifth time on Wednesday on drug charges in North Carolina. His girlfriend Tasha Nichole Simpson, 25, who is eight months pregnant allegedly had black-tar heroin stashed in her crotch and was also arrested . Simpson, 25, who is eight-months' pregnant was charged with trafficking heroin after she was caught in a police sting . When police tried to stop the couple's car on Wednesday, Rumple threw a powdery substance and a plastic bag out of the passenger window, according to arrest reports. The couple kept driving until they came to the home of Rumple's father Christopher Todd Rumple. Rumple threw a bag to his father while officers attempted to apprehend the suspects. Christopher Rumple then ran into the house and tried to flush the bag down the toilet. When officers searched Miss Simpson they found 12 grams of black tar heroin in her crotch area. Black tar heroin - named for its dark, gooey consistency - is grown in Mexico and Colombia and trafficked into the U.S. It is popular with drug producers as it is easier to produce than pure heroin - but extremely dangerous for users. Deputies found powder on Brandon Rumple’s face, clothes and in the car. They also recovered a  plastic bag nearby with two grams of a tan powder, which tested positive for MDMA. Baby-faced trafficker: Brandon Lee Rumple, 19, was arrested for the fifth time on Wednesday on drug trafficking charges. He is now jailed on $2.5milllion bond . Around $1,200 was found in the couple's car. Rumple was charged with possession with intent to manufacture, sell or deliver MDMA, resist, delay and obstruct a public officer, alter and destroy evidence and possession of drug paraphernalia. Rumple’s bond was set at $2.5 million. Simpson was charged with two counts of trafficking heroin, possession with intent to manufacture, sell or deliver heroin, fleeing and attempting to elude law enforcement and possession of drug paraphernalia. The mother-to-be's bond was set at $250,000.","Brandon Lee Rumple, 19, and Tasha Nicole .

"By . Alex Greig . A Washington woman who was hailed a hero after saving her young son from their burning home and who lost her infant daughter just one day later has been arrested for setting the fire herself. Melinda 'Mindie' Sayers, 37, was initially called a 'hero' by firefighters for pulling herself and her two-year-old son to safety out of a bedroom window as a fire ravaged her Puyallup home. Now, the married mother is being held by the Pierce County Sheriff's Department on suspicion of torching her own home on April 1. Praised: Melinda Sayers said she rescued her young son from a fire that ravaged her house on April 1 . Deliberate fire: It was initially thought that the fire was accidentally sparked by a leak in these oxygen tanks, but investigators say Sayers has admitted lighting it herself . Sayers told authorities that she and her son were at home when 'thick, black smoke' suddenly came billowing into the bedroom. She said she opened the bedroom window, kicked out the screen, threw her son out the window and then jumped out after him. “About two to three seconds later, there was a huge explosion,' Sayers said. Sayers' 11-month-old daughter, Abigail, was born prematurely and spent most of her young life at Seattle Children's Hospital. After five brain surgeries, the little girl was considered healthy enough to return home earlier this month. Sayers said a leaking oxygen tank that had been set up in preparation for Abigail's return home caused the fire. Desperation: Police say Sayers told them she was unprepared for her brain-damaged baby girl to come home and wanted her to remain in hospital . Community help: The family's plight was taken up by well-wishers, who donated more than $32,000 to help them after the fire and premature death of baby Abigail . 'Now we have nowhere to live. We have nothing for her (Abigail when she is released from hospital). You know, it's really hard,' Sayers told Q13 Fox. Baby Abigail died in hospital the following day. The story was widely reported and many in the community who heard about the family's plight felt compelled to help them. A charity fund was established that raised more than $32,000 for the family. Detective Ed Troyer says officers investigating the case 'noticed that the fire was not consistent with the evidence at the scene to be an accident.' Detectives questioned Sayers on Thursday, and she reportedly confessed to the arson. Explosion: Sayers threw her son and herself out this window before a 'huge explosion' rocked the house and ruined most of the family's belongings . Fraudulent behavior: Investigators discovered that Sayers was a nurse with knowledge of oxygen tanks who was charged with unprofessional conduct in 2013 for filling prescriptions for herself . 'The reason that she gives is that she was busy, did not have time, or the desire, to take care of the kid,' Troyer said. 'When you eliminate the place where your child is going to go, you eliminate the problem.' Troyer says that several other red flags were raised during the investigation, including that Sayer is a Registered Nurse with experience with medical equipment such as oxygen tanks, and that she has a past fraud on her record. Sayers was charged in 2013 with unprofessional conduct by the nursing commission for falsifying patient records and filling prescriptions for herself. Her husband, Chris Sayers, had no involvement with the fire, say investigators. She's expected to make an initial court appearance Friday.","Melinda Sayers, 37, told firefighters she saved herself and her two-year-old son from a house fire April 1 .

"By . Lydia Warren . A six-year-old boy whose mother forced him into a dog cage then poured syrup and kitty litter on him was rescued after neighbors heard him screaming, 'Do you love me?' to his abuser, authorities said. The boy's mother, Crystal Jean Hostetter, 24, and her long-term girlfriend, Sarah Elizabeth McClain, 30, allegedly abused the boy - who has psychological issues and does not like sticky substances - for two hours on Saturday. Neighbors witnessed the treatment and alerted authorities. The two women, from Douglasville, Georgia, appeared in front of a Douglas County Magistrate on Thursday, where they were both charged with cruelty to children. 'Cruel': Crystal Hostetter, left, and her girlfriend, Sarah McClain, right, allegedly forced Hostetter's six-year-old son into a dog cage and poured syrup and kitty litter on him and forced him to hold up a brick . They allegedly forced the boy into a small crate, covered his feet and hands with syrup and kitty litter and also made him hold a brick above his head for 15 minutes, police told the Douglas County Sentinel. The boy was heard screaming, 'Please don't kill me!' and 'Do you love me?', police said. Hostetter carried out the treatment to punish her son and told cops she poured syrup on him because she knew he did not like it, Douglasville Police Sgt. Todd Garner said. 'He . acts out based on the things that they have diagnosed him with and she . doesn't like that so she has issued these forms of punishment,' Garner . said. 'She has also gone to the point of taking his bed out and making . him sleep on the floor because he slept on the floor one night. So she . said, ""If you don't like your bed, you cannot have it"".' 'Sick': The couple allegedly used the treatment as punishment for the boy (pictured), who suffers from psychological problems. They chose syrup because they knew he hates sticky substances . He added that the child is supposed to be on medication, but Hostetter has failed to collect them. 'He’s supposed to be on three different medications that . she has not filled or given him,' Garner said. 'In our conversation, I asked her, ""You . just think that you know more than the doctors?"" She said yes.' He . did not detail the extent of the boy's psychological issues, but said . that he had been hospitalized earlier this year in Pennsylvania. According to police, a neighbor witnessed the boy being abused on Saturday and called the Department of Children and Family Services hotline, but when they could not get through, they contacted the boy's school and police were called. Jailed: The women were arrested after a neighbor witnessed the treatment and alerted authorities, and the boy is now in the custody of an adult caregiver . When police arrived, they found the home covered in fleas from the couple's three cats. Hostetter and McClain admitted to the . alleged crimes after a DFCS worker came to their home on Monday . evening, the County Sentinel reported. The youngster is now staying at the home with an adult caregiver, while the women are being held without bond in the Douglas County jail. The couple, who have been dating for three years, . moved from Pennsylvania in March and . police are looking into whether there have been reports in Pennsylvania . of similar treatment.","Crystal Hostetter, 24, and her girlfriend, Sarah McClain, 30, 'locked the boy in the cage and forced him to hold a brick above his head for 15 minutes'

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Nina Golgowski . Wanted: Police believe Eugene Palmer, 73, may still be alive and on the run after shooting his daughter-in-law dead and then taking off into the wilderness in September 2012 . Police fear a retired park ranger accused of gunning down his daughter-in-law before fleeing into the wilderness of upstate New York 19 months ago is alive and still on the run. Authorities previously believed that 73-year-old Eugene Palmer of Stoney Point was dead after escaping into Herriman State Park only moments after allegedly admitting to committing the cold-blooded crime. Crime stoppers are offering a  $2,500 reward for information regarding his whereabouts. Police accuse Palmer of fatally shooting Tammy Palmer, 39, three times as she was walking home from dropping her two children off at a school bus on September 24th. After allegedly confessing to the crime to his sister, Elaine Babcock, she says he took off into the 45,000-acre park, an area authorities say he's well familiar with and backs onto their property. 'We thoroughly searched these woods over the course of two weeks, I don't believe he's here,' Sgt Lutz said. 'He knows that park like the back of his hand.' 'I believe he went into those woods and eventually came out,' Sgt. George Lutz of the Haverstraw Police Department told FoxNews.com on Friday. Lutz declined to elaborate further on that theory. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Killed: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 after walking her children to a school bus stop . Authorities at the time thought there was no chance he could have survived the woods considering the impending winter's freezing temperatures. Palmer's son also says he's convinced his father's dead with the 73-year-old being a severe diabetic and was on heart medication. When asked if he suspects Palmer is still alive, Lutz  told Fox, 'Of course.' 'We are investigating this case as if he's alive,' he said. 'We have no proof that he's not. We're not going to stop investigating until we have Mr. Palmer or his remains.' Authorities' search has expanded internationally as well. Palmer was charged with the murder of Tammy Palmer two months after she was killed. His truck was found in nearby Harriman State Park on the same day Tammy was killed and officers began their search for him.. Tammy Palmer's family claimed that . Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the . 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged . husband, John. Crime scene: Tammy Palmer lived in this home on property shared with Eugene Palmer but had filed a restraining order against his son, and her husband, fueling her murder according to family . Great escape: Authorities say they have combed through Harriman State Park's 46,600-acres (pictured) since his disappearance but have yet to find a body or a trace of his presence . The order prevented him from entering . the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. She . lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law. Babcock, Palmer's sister claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, ""Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough. ""I . shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever . you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,"" and then . he just took off,' Babcock told CBS. Babcock said she immediately called police. Search teams began hunting woods . for the man, a retired park ranger, using tracking dogs and helicopters. They soon discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram . pickup truck. Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter. They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight. Harassed: Before her September 24, 2012 death, Tammy Palmer, pictured left, said the man had been harassing her since she separated from his son, John . Mourning: Violet Pannirello, left, says her daughter Tammy's, right, relationship with her father in law had grown ugly. Tammy had just dropped her children at the school bus when she was shot dead . 'She . told me ""Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright."" I don’t think she ever . thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello . told CBS. 'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said. Detectives have previously revealed the details of . Palmer's criminal past and warned that he is believed to be dangerous - . owning to a large gun collection. It has been reported by police that the grandfather had previously threatened to kill a Department of Environmental Conservation officer.

"By . Rick Dewsbury . The biggest ever gold coin, in both size and value, made by the Royal Mint is set to be cashed in for £65,000. The enormous coin measures 4.5 inches in diameter - about the size of a CD - and is made from 1kg of solid gold. Its value is £1,000 - the largest denomination for a coin ever issued by the Royal Mint. But it would be a little foolish to use the legal tender coin as payment for an item as the 32ozs of gold used to make it is worth £33,000. Expensive: The Queen's head on the £1,000 coin and right, a Chinese Dragon on the reverse, signifying that 2012 is the year of the dragon. Just ten of the coins are in existence . Ten of the coins, that are three quarters of an inch thick, were struck having been commissioned by specialist coin auctioneers Baldwin’s of London. They are legal tender in the Channel island of Alderney and have an enormous image of the Queen on one side and a Chinese dragon on the other. They were made this year to commemorate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee as well as the Chinese Year of the Dragon. This example has been made available for sale by Baldwin’s with a pre-sale estimate of about £65,000. The auction is to take place in Hong Kong to appeal to the burgeoning Asian market. Ian Goldbart, managing director of . Baldwin’s, said: 'This is the first year we have commissioned a Royal . Mint coin with a Chinese zodiac design, and I think the dragon is an . obvious start. 'It is the biggest gold coin made by the Royal Mint as far as I know - both in terms of denomination and size. The coin sits inside the commemorative wooden box set. It is the biggest ever gold coin, measuring 4.5 inches in diameter, and is being auctioned with a pre-sale price of £65,000 . A second shot issued by the Royal Mint ahead of the auction in Hong Kong reveals just how big the gold coin is. They are being auctioned in Asia to appeal to the wealthy market . 'It is legal tender and in theory the owner could walk into a sweet shop and use the 1,000 pounds coin as payment. 'They would be very foolish to do that of course, because it is made from 32 ounces of solid gold which is worth about 33,000 pounds. 'And the exceptional rarity of the coin means its value is likely to be double that amount. 'There is a massive market in the Far East for this sort of thing. 'There is also a great investment potential in it as well. Because it is legal tender, there would be no capital gains tax to be paid on it in the future which would be good for the owner if the price of gold goes up. 'It is definitely something for somebody to put away for the future.' The coin, created by the Royal Mint’s most senior engraver Gordon Summers, comes in a mahogany case and with a special certificate. It is being auctioned by Baldwin’s in Hong Kong on August 23.","Biggest gold coin ever made and the metal alone is worth £33,000 .

"By . John Hall . A group of farmers have come up with an ingenious way of recycling the thousands of external fuel tanks jettisoned by U.S planes during the Vietnam War - by turning them into river boats and canoes. The huge chunks of aluminum were discarded by U.S. planes during the late 1960s and early 1970s and remain scattered throughout the forests of southern Vietnam to this day. But rather than leaving the abandoned fuel tanks to go unused, local farmers have started cleaning and customising the hollow tubes, with dozens of them now in use as river boats and canoes throughout the region. Ingenious: A group of farmers in southern Vietnam have started using thousands of fuel tanks cast off by U.S fighter jets and bombers during the Vietnam War as river boats and canoes.

The fuel tanks arrived in Vietnam in far less peaceful circumstances, attached to the bottom of U.S. fighter jets and bombers which used them as a backup to internal fuel supplies while on long flights over the forested areas. Although they were key to increasing endurance and even allowed the planes to be refueled while flying, the auxiliary fuel tanks also slowed the planes down and limited maneuverability, so could easily be cast off if they needed to accelerate quickly to attack or escape the enemy. Now the fuel tanks are experiencing a second life as key modes of transport among the remote and heavily forested areas of south Vietnam. Getting around: With limited roads connecting small villages, the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places, so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people .

With limited roads connecting small villages, the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places, so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people. Although they have been used for centuries, the traditional wooden river boats that are built and used in the area have a fairly limited lifespan and are in need of regular maintenance and repair. It's not surprising then that farmers were among the first to spot an alternative use for the large pieces of aluminum scattered throughout the local forests - not least because they naturally float thanks to their hollow bodies, lightweight frames and aerodynamic designs. With just a small amount of customisation - including cutting large holes in the top to make them easier to board and load - the abandoned fuel tanks are now considered a simple and free way for the poor farmers in remote areas to ensure they are able to buy and sell their products in nearby villages.","Fuel tanks ditched by aircraft during the Vietnam War are still scattered throughout the country's forests .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The only thing worse than getting caught somewhere you shouldn't be is getting caught lying about it. That's what happened to Kentucky Senate candidate Matt Bevin on Thursday night when a local news station played video of the Tea Party Republican at a pro-cockfighting rally saying he would 'not support' future efforts to criminalize the blood-sport. 'Criminalizing behavior, if it’s part of the heritage of this state, is . in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it,' Bevin can be heard saying in the video. A Kentucky news station released video on Thursday night of Kentucky Senate candidate Matt Bevin, pictured here in October, at a pro-cockfighting rally saying he would 'not support' future efforts to criminalize the blood-sport . Bevin and his campaign had previously acknowledged his presence at the event. However, Bevin denied having knowledge of the pro-cockfighting theme of the rally. 'It wasn’t a cockfighting event, that’s where you all need to start telling the truth about what happened,' Bevin told MSNBC. 'This was a gathering of people talking about states rights. I don’t . know what they talked about other then the fact that when I was there, I . talked about my campaign.' But an undercover video taken by a WAVE 3 News reporter who attended the rally proves that not only did Bevin know he was at a pro-cockfighting rally, he was specifically asked by American Gamefowl Defense Director Dave Devereaux whether he would 'vote to support the effort to legalize gamecock fighting in the state of Kentucky.' 'I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is . our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal . government’s,' Bevin said before explaining why he would not support criminalization. When the reporter from the video approached Bevin this week at a campaign event about his comments, Bevin' said, 'I honestly wasn't even paying attention.' 'I was thinking about what I . was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that.' Bevin apologized on Friday afternoon for attending the event and insisted that he does not support cockfighting. 'I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event . which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a . discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many . Kentucky voters,' Bevin said in a statement, Politico reports. 'I am not and have never been, a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty.'

Leader Mitch McConnell in next month's Republican primary. After Corbin, Kentucky newspaper The News Journal . first broke the Bevin-cockfighting story earlier this month, Bevin . accused his opponent of making the scandal up to 'distract people.' 'This is what McConnell does, he makes up lies, he spins the fluff, and . all of it is intended to distract people that aren’t thoughtful enough . to actually dig under the hood and ask hard questions,' Bevin told MSNBC. Bevin and his campaign had previously acknowledged the Tea Party Republican's presence at the cockfighting event. However, Bevin denied having knowledge of the pro-cockfighting theme of the rally . McConnell's . campaign called Bevin a 'pathological liar' in light of Thursday's . revelation. 'Matt Bevin's . cockfighting episode will go down in history as one of the most disqualifying . moments in Kentucky political history,' McConnell campaign press secretary Allison . Moore said in a statement. 'Twenty years from now, we will all remember the time when the East . Coast con-man thought so little of Kentuckians that he pathologically lied to . us about absolutely everything until an undercover camera caught him red-handed . at a cockfighting rally.' Polls have shown McConnell leading Bevin by a double-digit margins for months. In light of Wave 3 News' undercover video, it's difficult to see how Bevin's campaign is not cock a doodle done.

"By . Darren Boyle . Employers have been warned that writing honest references for former employees could land them in court if they are particularly negative. Employment experts have warned that a written reference which is critical of a former employee could see them sued for defamation or even 'post-employment victimisation'. This follows a recent case where a car body repairer successfully sued his former employers after they provided a poor reference to an employment agency after he complained about discrimination. Employers have been warned that they may face court action if they write overly negative references about former employees attending job interviews (picture posed by models) Litigation fears could even see good candidates receiving bland references  summarising only the briefest of details of their career. Paul Megson, a tax partner at Deloitte told The Times that employers can speak freely on the phone but written references tend to be compiled by human resource managers 'intended to say as little as possible'. He said: 'If you are downbeat . about someone and they have an offer withdrawn, there is a concern over . whether you have defamed them. If you are too generous, the . new employer could say ""this guy turned out to be an idiot"".' Former employees can access written references supplied to prospective employers under the Data Protection Act. A recent case in the Court of Appeal saw car body repairer Pat Jessemey awarded almost £25,000 for unfair dismissal and age discrimination against his former employer Rowstock Ltd from Didcot, Oxfordshire. Employers who give bad references about former employees could face prosecution for 'post-relationship victimisation' after the Court of Appeal upheld a recent Employment Tribunal discrimination case (picture posed by models) The court heard that a director from the company gave Mr Jessemey a poor reference because he had made a complaint about discrimination before leaving the company. The court upheld an earlier Employment Tribunal decision that Mr Jessemey had suffered 'post-employment victimisation' as a result of the bad reference and had been discriminated against. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said 'post relationship victimisation' should be specifically outlawed. The Commission's legal director Wendy Hewitt said: 'We supported this case in order to clarify an important principle of law namely that the Equality Act 2010 should be read as prohibiting victimisation which happens after someone has left their job and is then treated unfavourably because they have made allegations of discrimination. 'The fact that this claim has been successful means that it is clear that this protection also applies to former relationships in education, services, public functions and associations.'","Employers warned they could face legal action for giving a poor reference .

"By . Neil Sears . Switched off: The lamps in Ashford, Kent, had been extinguished to cut costs (file photo) When a series of cars were broken into in quick succession, victims were quick to dial 999 to call for help. And the police were soon on the case, using dogs to hunt the culprit before bravely giving chase when a suspect was seen running away. Until, that is, the manhunt was abruptly called off – because it was ‘too dark’ for it to continue. Last night it was still not clear whether the officers were scared of the dark, or concerned about the risk of tripping. But angry local residents said it was ridiculous that a criminal had been allowed to escape when they were on the verge of being caught red-handed. The incident took place in Ashford, Kent in the early hours of Saturday a fortnight ago. Residents called the police after they discovered somebody had broken into several cars and swiped wallets, electrical gadgets, designer sunglasses and a mountain bike. Officers from Kent Police immediately responded and arrived with dogs to track down the thief. They managed to catch sight of a suspect – but he was able to escape after officers decided it was too dark to pursue him on foot. A statement from a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who was briefed by police blamed a new streetlight switch-off scheme which is meant to save the council £1million a year. The statement read: ‘A figure was chased but due to the light switch-off it was almost impossible for officers to search the area effectively and no one was detained.’ Growing areas of Britain are seeing streetlamps switched off at night by cost-cutting councils, despite fears that the measure will lead to a rise in crime. A survey suggested two-thirds of councils were either dimming street lights or turning them off to cut bills. Around 750,000 lights in 81 local authority areas are thought to be involved in the switch-off. Kent county council launched its Safe and Sensible lighting scheme a few months ago, saying 70,000 street lights would be turned off between midnight and 5.30am. Nothing we can do: Police spotted the suspect but were unable to apprehend him (file photo) But residents of the Little Burton estate said the measure has left them feeling unsafe at night. Kelsey Lapthorn, 42, said: ‘There are places that were safe where you just can’t go now after the lights are off. It’s pitch black up there and people just don’t feel safe. ‘I’m getting security lights fitted today and I know a number of my neighbours are thinking about doing the same.’ A council spokesman said: ‘We continue to work closely with police to monitor crime. We will review the lighting requirements if any increase can be attributed to the absence of street lighting.’ And a police spokesman added: ‘It is too early in the scheme to give any indication as to whether the reduction on lighting levels has impacted on crime.’ They were unable to say whether the officers involved were afraid of the dark.","Residents in Ashford, Kent, called police when thief broke into several cars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'Wordsworth would be having fits': Andrew Motion . William Wordsworth would be ‘having fits’ about the development planned for the countryside, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion has said. Now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, he made the claim as he criticised the  Government’s ‘philistine’ relaxation of planning laws in favour of builders. He said: ‘It is pretty clear that Wordsworth would be having a series of fits about what is going on now and the great tragedy of it is that a lot of this stuff doesn’t need to happen. ‘There are a million-and-a-half brownfield sites available – build on them. The Government should be incentivising builders to build on them which provides the kind of housing that we need. ‘It regenerates often rather decayed landscapes, it means we don’t have to create new infrastructure. It is plain good sense. ‘We need to be extraordinarily vigilant about this because when it is gone, it is gone forever.’ Wordsworth immortalised the Lake District with his 1807 poem Daffodils. Sir Andrew also referred to Philip Larkin’s 1972 poem Going, Going in which he wrote of his concern ‘that will be England gone’ because of shoddy development. The former Poet Laureate blamed the National Planning Policy Framework of 2012, which aimed to cut red tape, saying it was the work of ‘philistine’ Whitehall officials. Untouched: The beauty of the Lake District inspired William Wordsworth's poem Daffodils . Sir Andrew told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I feel in my lifetime there is a greater risk to our countryside because of these careless loosenings of things which need to be very properly defended. ‘It is philistine but worse because it is so unnecessary. It is a betrayal of the heritage, it is the pursuit of money and development.’ He also criticised councils for approving ugly ‘boxlike’ homes.","New CPRE President slammed 'philistine' decision to relax planning laws .

"By . Liz  Hull . Computers in Whitehall were used to make insulting alterations to Wikipedia entries about the Hillsborough disaster, it emerged yesterday. The Cabinet Office has pledged to make ‘urgent inquiries’ into the anonymous changes, which were made over three years. They began on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy when ‘blame Liverpool fans’ was added to the online encyclopaedia. Tragedy: Supporters are crushed against the barrier as disaster strikes before the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in Sheffield on April 15, 1989 . The words ‘nothing for the victims of the Heysel stadium disaster’ were also added to a description of the Hillsborough memorial at the Anfield stadium. Computers on Whitehall’s secure intranet were used again in 2012 to change the phrase ‘You’ll never walk alone’ to ‘You’ll never walk again’. Further abusive revisions were traced to IP addresses of computers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and the Solicitor General’s office. On another occasion, the description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the well-known quote ‘He made the people happy’ to the bizarre ‘He made a wonderful lemon drizzle cake’. Edit: The description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the well-known quote 'He made the people happy'. The statue is pictured here at its unveiling in 1997 . The revelations came to light after 34 IP addresses of Whitehall computers were disclosed via a parliamentary question. 'We’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this' Sheila Coleman, Hillsborough Justice Campaign . Analysis of Wikipedia’s revision history revealed at least two of these unique ID codes were used to amend the Hillsborough and Anfield pages with the sick comments. An investigation has now been launched. Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, described the references as ‘absolutely disgusting’ and said the families of the 96 victims who perished at the FA cup semi-final would demand a formal inquiry. Remembered: Players from Manchester City and Liverpool line up for a minute's silence on April 13 in front of fans at Anfield displaying cards to form a message in remembrance of the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives . She said: ‘We’re still in the inquests and we’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this. It’s absolutely appalling, disgraceful. 'I hear something like that and it upsets me a great deal, it makes me incredibly sad' Margaret Aspinall, Hillsborough Family Support Group . ‘It’s shocking that these comments came from within the Government, no matter how spurious. 'The fact is that these changes came from within the Government and that’s very saddening. It warrants an investigation and we will be seeking formal advice from our legal team.’ Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: ‘I don’t even know how to react, it’s just so sad.

Margaret Aspinall of Hillsborough Family Support Group: 'It's so sad'"
"By . Julian Robinson . Margaret O'Driscoll said she was with her son all night when quizzed by police after shots were fired in Chorlton, but then it turned out she had been texting him the whole time . A mother who gave her son an alibi for a crime he hadn’t committed has been locked up for lying to police. Fabian O’Driscoll, 20, walked free from court after prosecutors dropped an attempted murder charge against him following a street shooting. But his mother Margaret, 43, is now beginning an eight-month jail sentence for her needless effort to keep him out of trouble. Police called at her home looking for . her son minutes after shots were fired at a 37-year-old man he was . feuding with on Chorlton’s Merseybank estate. Ms O’Driscoll, of Waincliffe Avenue, Chorlton, lied to officers and told them he was at home at the time of the crime, sticking to her story in repeated accounts over several weeks - even after CCTV evidence proved he was on the street. In an ironic twist, the same footage that revealed Ms O’Driscoll had lied about her son’s whereabouts, leading to her conviction, also cleared him. Fabian O’Driscoll was wearing light-coloured clothing on the night of the shooting - and while the victim had identified him as responsible, the shooter was dressed entirely in black. Last month, on the day he was due to face trial, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case against Fabian O ‘Driscoll, who had been arrested and charged last year. Meanwhile, Ms O’Driscoll admitted perverting the course of justice, and has now been jailed for eight months. Hours . before the .32 bullet was fired at him on September 23, the target of . the shooting turned up at the home Mr O’Driscoll shares with his mum . armed with two rottweilers, but no-one was in. Manchester . Crown Court heard that the two men crossed paths at Merseybank Avenue . at 9.30pm that night, when Mr O’Driscoll was part of a group of ten men. In the stand-off that followed someone shouted ‘get the ting’ - meaning . get the gun - and a shot was fired at the victim. In a text she sent Fabian, Ms O’Driscoll said: 'I told the police you went out at ten - you were in all day’. He replied with a ‘smiley face’ emoticon, saying ‘luv u mum, ur the best’. Helen Richardson, defending, said: 'She says she instinctively responded to police in a protective manner to her son.' Judge Michael Henshell, said: 'The public must realise that to give false alibis will always be dealt with by prison sentences.' Margaret O'Driscoll, pictured left, said she was with her son Fabian O'Driscoll, right, all night when quizzed by police after shots were fired in Chorlton - but Manchester Crown Court heard she had been texting him the whole time . Fabian O’Driscoll insists his mother thought she was telling police the truth. That is despite the fact the former . office worker, a mother-of-three from Moss Side, pleaded guilty to lying . to officers in court. O’Driscoll, . 20, said: 'I did nothing wrong and she did nothing wrong. I just feel . disgraced by the system. She was gobsmacked when she was first arrested . and they pursued and pursued the case. 'My mum didn’t lie intentionally. When she told the police I was at home, that was what she believed. 'I am a grown man I don’t tell my mum every time I leave the house. She thought I was at home. 'She . pleaded guilty because she couldn’t take any more of the stress and . worry. She’s never been to prison before. It’s upsetting for everyone. Going to be prison will be a huge ordeal for her. 'But I know she’ll cope because she’s a strong woman.' Margaret O'Driscoll, 43, was jailed for eight months at Manchester Crown Court for her needless effort to keep her son out of trouble.","Fabian O'Driscoll walks free from court after attempted murder charge dropped .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Ten British women are fighting in the civil war raging in Syria. The women are thought to have joined their husbands in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), a hard-line Muslim faction so extreme it has been disowned by al-Qaeda. Among the jihadists are two teenagers from Portsmouth, a Surrey woman, two Londoners and five from the north of England. Ten British women are thought to have travelled to Syria to engage in jihad, probably alongside their husbands, in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), a hard-line Muslim faction so extreme it has been disowned by al-Qaeda (File picture) However, rather than helping the fight against President Bashar al-Assad they may actually be unwittingly helping him. Shiraz Maher, an expert on the area from Kings College London told the Daily Mirror: ‘Most British jihadists go to Syria for sincere reasons to help in what they believe is a struggle against oppression but many don't appreciate the reality on the ground. ‘There are around 10 British women out there, we believe, and most have travelled to Syria with their husbands. Smoke rises after what activists said was a barrel bomb dropped by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the Al-Maysar neighbourhood of Aleppo . ‘They go believing they will fight jihad to overthrow Assad but may actually be getting in the way of the rebellion by joining groups and fuelling the infighting they are involved in. Bashar Hafez al-Assad has been president of Syria since July 2000 when he succeeded his father Hafez, who led Syria for 30 years until his death. President al-Assad, 48, has a degree in medicine and studied at at the Western Eye Hospital, in London. He became heir apparent when his elder brother Bassel was killed aged 31 in a car crash on January 21, 1994. Human Rights groups, such as Amnesty International, have claimed that President al-Assads’s government and secret police routinely tortured, imprisoned, and killed political opponents, and those who speak out against the government. President al-Assad is a member of the minority Alawite sect and his government has been described as secular. ‘Depending on who they sign up with, like Isis, they will end up fighting some of the original rebel groups such as the Free Syrian Army. There is evidence that in the complex struggles ISIS in particular has been infiltrated by Assad’s forces.’ It is believed that almost 600 Britons have fought in Syria since the hostilities began three years ago and 20 are thought to have died. Abdulla Deghayes, 18, from Saltdean near Brighton in East Sussex, is the latest to be killed – he is believed to have died in Kassab, Latakia, earlier this month. Deghayes has two brothers, Jaffar, 16, and 20-year-old Amer, still in the country where they fought with al-Qaeda terror group Jabhat al-Nusrah. British police yesterday asked Muslim parents to inform them if they believe their children are likely to become jihadists. Around 40 this year have been stopped leaving the UK to go to Syria. Colonel Fateh Hassoun of the Free Syria Army (FSA) claimed that there are links between Isis and President Assad and that Isis is winning because it is financed by £700,000 a day in stolen Syrian oil cash. Abdullah Deghayes, 18, from Brighton, who has died in Syria, pictured with a female friend . Syrian president Bashar al-Assad (in rain-soaked jacket) visited the predominanetly Christian city of Maaloula, to celebrate Easter . Soldiers loyal to President Bashar al-Assad hold a Syrian national flag with a picture of Assad, as they pass Mar Bacchus Sarkis monastery, at Maloula village, northeast of Damascus, after taking control of the village from rebel fighters . Hassoun said that Britain and America has stopped funding his organisation because of the clash between the FSA and Jabhat al-Nusrah and Isis. ‘We had the momentum but trouble with extremist groups meant the West stopped paying the money and this other group is gaining power,’ he said. ‘Astonishingly we have intelligence that even President Assad is doing deals secretly with Isis, just to put even more pressure on us. We have been badly weakened by western inaction and we need help. We are even losing fighters to this rival group.’ The West paid the FSA £2million a month and in turn it paid its 45,000 troops £30-a-month. In contrast Isis pays its soldiers £300-a-month. Isis is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdad and many of his commanders served under Saddam Hussein. Hassoun denied the FSA was responsible for any atrocities. He said: ‘Any crime done by a member of the FSA is an individual act and not a response to orders. And those acts are very few.’","Jihadists are two teenagers from Portsmouth, a Surrey woman, two Londoners and five from the north .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This shocking photo shows the moment a police community support officer left her van illegally parked on double yellow lines - while she went shopping for tuna and sweetcorn. The officer, who was dressed in full police uniform, stopped her van in the middle of the afternoon before strolling into a Co-operative supermarket in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, with another PCSO. The driver allegedly parked just yards away from the store's customer car park - which had dozens of empty spaces. Caught: The police van was parked on double yellow lines while two Police Community Support Officers popped into the nearby Co-operative supermarket for some food . The van was spotted by shopper Richard Smith, 28, who saw the illegally-parked van as he went to the nearby post office . The pair were spotted by outraged shopped Richard Smith, who took a photo of the incident on his phone. The 28-year-old said the officers 'breezed through' the supermarket, laughing and joking with customers - before buying the tuna, sweetcorn and mints. He said: 'When they parked on double yellow lines I couldn't believe it. The two women officers were allegedly seen laughing and chatting with customers and flicking through magazines as they walked down the grocery aisle in the store in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire . One officer bought tuna and sweetcorn, while the other bought some mints. Mr Smith said the van was parked just yards away from a half-empty car park . 'If there was an emergency then fair enough. But ten minutes later I saw them breezing through Co-op looking at the groceries. 'They were laughing and joking with other customers and they were definitely not in a rush.' Mr Smith, who said he parked in the correct car . park while he went to use the nearby post office, said he first saw the officers chatting in the vehicle for several . minutes. Ten minutes later, when he returned to his car, he saw the empty van and took several . pictures. He then popped to the supermarket for a lottery ticket - and saw the two officers walking down the grocery aisle, looking at magazines. Mr Smith was so furious that he took photos of the two women while they paid for their items. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said the PCSOs had been legitimately parked on the double yellows when they were making enquiries about a missing person . But the spokesman said the officers had 'briefly' gone to the shop afterwards - which was a 'lapse of judgement' He said: 'Every other driver has to watch their backs for parking wardens and would never dream of parking on double yellows - especially when the car park was half empty. 'It's outrageous. These two either think they're above the law, or they don't know the rules of the road. It's one rule for them and another for the rest of us. 'I've been hit with fines before for stopping on double yellows, so they should be too. 'They're lucky that there aren't cameras there automatically fining cars that stop on double yellows.' Police officers are only allowed to stop on double yellows if they are dealing with a motorist or attending an emergency. But the Highway Code states that traffic laws apply to everyone, including police cars. The cost of a PCN for stopping on double yellow lines is £70 or reduced to £35 if paid within two weeks. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: 'A police vehicle, being used by the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, was legitimately parked on double yellow lines while two Police Community Support Officers made enquiries in relation to a missing person. 'The vehicle was not causing any obstruction, however, after completing their enquiries the officers briefly attended a nearby shop to purchase some items before returning to the van. 'This was a momentary lapse of judgement for which the officers have received advice.'","Police community support officer left her van illegally parked on double yellows while she went food shopping in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire .

A farm is letting customers pump milk straight from the cow after installing a new vending machine that cuts out the milkman. Farmer Alan Hewson, 56, who runs Crossroads Farm in Eastwell, Leicestershire, installed the machine to give his customers the freshest milk possible. The only process the milk goes through to get from the udder to the mouth is pasteurisation, which kills bacteria. Scroll down for video . Milk-lover Clara Ceney fills up a bottle at the new 'straight from the cow' vending machine at Crossroads Farm, Leicestershire . The milk is pasteurised before being stored in a tank so customers to remove however much they want . Farmer Alan Hewson says the new machine offers his customers the freshest milk available . The freshly pumped liquid, once pasteurised, is transferred into the tank of the vending machine, which visitors to the farm can use to fill up their bottle. Mr Hewson, who runs the farm and creamery with his wife Jane, 57, is allowing customers to pour themselves milk, produced by Alan's 60 Red Poll cows, which graze just yards away, for just £1 a litre. Father of five Mr Hewson said: 'You can't get much fresher than this. The milk isn't homogenised so the cream will separate naturally from the milk. 'People can either shake the milk to mix it all back up, or if they fancy semi-skimmed simply take the cream from the top.' Visitors can choose how much milk they want by pressing the 'stop' button when they have enough and if they haven't got a traditional pint bottle they can buy a re-usable container for £2. The mechanism within the machine automatically calculates how much milk has been drained and it also gives out change. Mr Hewson, who runs the farm with his wife Jane, 57, hopes the machine will mean almost none of his milk is wasted . Most of the farm's milk, produced by their Red Polls cow herd, is used to make a cheese called Colwick . Clara and her mother Eleneanor take advantage of the machine, which charges just £1 per litre . Mr Hewson said: 'It has been amazing how popular the vending machine has been. It has just spread by word of mouth. 'We had two girls come to sample the milk after they heard people talking about it down the local pub. We are out of the way in location but there is a steady stream of motorists who travel in this area. 'We are happy to offer milk straight from the cow - a nutritious and wonderful tasting milk which a lot of people have never experienced before.' The Hewsons use most of the milk from their Red Polls herd to make a historic and popular cheese called Colwick, which was invented in 1660 in the village of Colwick, Nottinghamshire. But as the couple found they had lots of excess milk, they decided the perfect thing to do was introduce their vending machine, so nothing went to waste. Mr Hewson said: 'We are happy for people to come and help themselves. Lots of younger people have been coming to sample our fresh milk which is great, as it's so nutritious.'","Leicestershire farm unveils machine that pumps milk straight from the cow .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Carl Ashby has spent eight months with an open wound in his ankle and fears he could lose his foot . A man has spent eight years with an open wound in his ankle and fears he could lose his foot - after doctors refused to remove a loose screw they put there. Carl Ashby is in constant pain after the screw, one of three put in his ankle to correct a club foot when he was a child, came loose and caused the gaping hole in his ankle. Now the 48-year-old security guard fears he will lose his foot after doctors told him they could not remove the inch-long metal screw floating around in his damaged ankle because 'there’s nothing more they can do'. Mr Ashby, from north London, said: 'I’ve had this loose screw floating around my ankle for eight years and doctors keep telling me that there’s nothing more they can do. 'Why can’t they remove it? The last time the hole opened up in my ankle was more than two years ago, and it just isn’t closing up. 'Every step I take is like walking on hot coals. 'I’m struggling to do my job, which is a terrible shame because I don’t want to let this ruin my life. 'I’m worried the doctors will be left with no choice but to amputate it if anything worse happens. It’s an open wound - what if infection sets in?' Mr Ashby, who was born with two club feet, had successful operations to correct his twisted ankles when he was six and eight. But in 2006, after a pain-free life, his right ankle began throbbing. Eventually, one of the scars in his ankle opened up, revealing a gaping hole underneath. Carl said: 'I went to the doctors who told me that the wound would heal all on its own. 'That took ages to heal, but eventually it did. Then another hole opened up in the same place, and again it healed. Mr Ashby is in constant pain after the screw, one of three put in his ankle to correct a club foot when he was a child, came loose and caused the gaping hole in his ankle . 'This time it opened up in 2012, and hasn’t closed since. It’s horrible to look at - makes people feel sick.' He is now growing increasingly frustrated because despite a series of X-rays, ultrasounds and appointments, he is yet to find a solution. He said: 'I feel I am not being taken seriously. I am in excruciating agony and the uncertainty of it is emotionally draining. My skin has been completely eaten away. 'I fear I will end up losing my foot. I heard a story about a woman who died - and it was later found she’d had a metal pin in her foot like mine which had become infected. Mr Ashby is referring to the case of Carole Denby, 63, who killed herself after claiming doctors had left a piece of metal in her ankle. He was revealed to have been right all along after a titanium screw was found in her ashes. Mrs Denby was so depressed that doctors wouldn't take her claims seriously that she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A conwoman has been sent to prison after a distraction burglary on an elderly woman – who turned out to be an MP’s mother. Callous: Leanne Smith, a conwoman has been jailed after a distraction burglary on an elderly woman - who turned out to be an MP's mother . Leanne Smith, 34, knocked on the door of Connie Morris, the mother of Grahame Morris, Labour MP for Easington in Durham, and asked to borrow a tea bag. She was then invited in for a cup of tea and once inside the 77-year-old’s house, Smith took precious and irreplaceable property including wedding and engagement rings. But she was caught after one of the pensioner’s family reported it to the police. Smith, who has a previous conviction for forcing her way in to another pensioner’s home during a robbery, was sentenced to four years behind bars. Prosecutor Simon Worthy told Newcastle Crown Court how Smith went to the pensioner’s house last July, asking to borrow a tea bag. The victim told police that she lived by the philosophy of doing ‘a good deed every day’ so decided to invite in Smith, who she recognised from the neighbourhood. Smith, from Murton, Co Durham, distracted her by claiming there was a knock on the door, knowing there was nobody there and buying herself time to take what she wanted. The grandmother-of-two discovered her bag, which contained £100 in cash, jewellery and her inhalers, was gone after a relative called to say that the bag had been found in a bin. The widow, whose husband Richard died 25 years ago, then realised her jewellery and other goods were gone. In a statement read to court, Mrs Morris said: ‘She conned her way in and stole personal items which had great sentimental value . ‘She had no thought or regard for the street and anxiety she has caused and she’s not once expressed any remorse. ‘Those items, such as wedding and engagement rings, are irreplaceable to me. ‘The financial value is immaterial; those rings were given to me by my husband, who has passed away. Graham Morris, MP - his 77-year-old mother was robbed by conwoman Leanne Smith . ‘She has given no thought of what those items meant to me, nothing can replace what those items meant to me. ‘She has not disclosed where she sold them so I can try to find them. If she felt genuine remorse she would help me recover what she stole. ‘The loss of the items has devastated me. I think she deserves significant prison time.’ Her son Grahame added: ‘It’s very upsetting when it’s your own family and I hope that other elderly people will learn from this .","Leanne Smith, 34, jailed for 4 years; already convicted for similar offence .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 2012 and 2013 Portuguese-born photographer Edgar Martins was granted unparalleled access to the European Space Agency (Esa). For those two years he photographed 20 classified facilities belonging to Esa across Europe, from the UK to Germany to Kazakhstan. And now he’s revealed the stunning photography he took, which includes space simulators and launch sites, in a new art exhibit opening tomorrow. Photographer Edgar Martins has revealed the images he took inside Esa after being given unparalleled access for two years. Pictured is the sight up from the bottom of the 50-metre (165 feet) tall mobile launch gantry for Esa's Vega launcher in French Guiana. When preparation is complete, the 1,000 tonne gantry rolls back on rails, leaving the Vega rocket on the pad ready for launch . Known as The Rehearsal of Space and the Poetic Impossiblity to Manage the Infinite, the collection will be on display at the Wapping Project Bankside in London from Friday 25 April to 29 May. The photographs were shot in long exposures of up to one hour using a 10x8 inch, large format camera. The locales include test centres, robotics departments, space simulators, laboratories, launch sites, astronaut training centres and satellite assembly rooms. ‘Whilst the visions that inspired the space age were drawn from artists and writers, in more recent times the gulf between the space community and arts world drifted apart,’ says Martins. ‘So in 2012 I presented the European Space Agency a very ambitious proposal: to produce the most comprehensive survey ever assembled about a leading scientific and space exploration organisation and its programs. ‘I explained my intention to critically engage with Esa and its partner’s programs, such as the telecommunication, navigation, integrated biological life support system for space applications, microgravity, human spaceflight, lunar and Mars exploration programs, whilst also reflecting on the new politics of space exploration as well as the impact of this kind of technological application on our social, cultural and existential consciousness. In this image Portuguese-born Martins has show the exterior of a Node 2 mock-up at the Erasmus centre in Esa's scientific and technical heart at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Node 2 is a European-built module of the International Space Station (ISS) that was installed in 2007 . This is the interior of the Large Space Simulator (LSS) Vacuum Chamber at Esa-ESTEC, Noodwijk. At 15 metres (50 feet) high and 10 metres (33 feet) wide, the LSS is the largest vacuum chamber in Europe and is used to test full-size spacecraft in representative space conditions . Pictured is the interior of the Columbus Training Simulator, at Esa-EAC in Cologne, Germany. The is a full-sized mock-up of the Columbus module on the ISS . Pictured is a space glove once worn by a cosmonaut at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, Russia . ‘I was also interested in reflecting on the impact of imagery of space exploration on popular culture and our psyche and how this might also impact the work I would produce.’ ‘On and on I had hoped this project would promote a dialogue between space exploration, science, contemporary photographic art and the wider public. ‘I am interested in the techniques of artistic expression these engagements can activate, and in the dialogue that these projects and envrionments can provoke. The European Space Agency (Esa) was established in 1975. It is composed of 20 European states. Its headquarters are in Paris, France while its primary spaceport is the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana. In 2013 the total budget for Esa was €4.28 billion (£3.64 billion; $5.51 billion) Among Esa’s flagship missions it is involved in the International Space Station . In September with its Rosetta mission it will also become the first agency to land on a comet . ‘So I was extremely pleased when they agreed to support my endeavour. ‘It seems I had contacted Esa at crucial time in their history, when they have recognised the importance to mantain a coherent dialogue with the general public and hopefully now also the arts.’ Martins says his project is the first time in the history of Esa that an artist has been granted exclusive access to all of their facilities. He was also given full access to staff, their programmes and technology at the space agency. Even for other large institutions such as Nasa or Cern, such access is unprecedented. From his time on the sites, Martins says the things that most struck a cord were the complexity of operations. ‘Esa is unique in that it is a multinational, “world” space agency,’ he says. ‘Although my way of working is more akin to a scientist or an archaeologist than it is a photographer, witnessing “space time” in motion is a humbling experience.’ He also says that he was able to read astronaut’s mission notebooks, exchange stories with them and get ‘an insight into an astronaut’s life in space.’ Here you can see the cleanliness of a fuelling hall where spacecraft are filled with propellant before launch - the S5 payload preparation complex at CGS-Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana . This is an 'Ergolier' (French for fuel) helmet photographed in Kourou, part of the protective wear for people handling spacecraft fuel. They are specially designed to ensure protection during use and manipulation of special products like fuel for satellites and rockets . Martins says he was given unprecedented access to staff, programmes and facilities at Esa.

But Martins adds that he hopes his project will remind the public how important space exploration is to the development of science, technology, engineering, education and medicine. ‘I was able to photograph a myriad of technology which will have similar applications in the future. ‘Although the framework of space exploration has traditionally been tied with national security and the political aspirations of states, today, budget cuts in an era of worldwide economic downturn has opened the doors to the commercialization and privatisation of space. ‘However, I'm pleased to say that there is a continued focus on more exploratory programs, allowing us to peer further into deep space and to better understand our surroundings and humanity’s origins. ‘There are new and exciting programs being developed at present and I have no doubt that we are entering a new golden era of space exploration. ‘We are slowly getting a new picture of the Universe that is pushing the limits of understanding current cosmological theories, making the confluence of the infinitely large and the infinitely small an ever more viable proposition.’ But, he concludes, ‘for all the advancements in technology and robotics, space exploration is still inherently dependent on the individual.’","Photographer Edgar Martins has unveiled his unprecedented photography of Esa facilities and programmes .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Bookmaker William Hill today threatened to close more than 100 shops after George Osborne’s tax raid on high stakes betting machines. The Chancellor stunned the industry in last month’s Budget when he increased duty on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling. The increase means 109 loss-making William Hill shops will never make money and have to shut, the firm said. Bookmaker William Hill warned 109 shops will close as a result of the tax hike on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals . Mr Osborne said the mega-jackpot machines were ‘highly lucrative’ and hiked  the levy on them from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The Mail has campaigned against the machines, which are found in high street betting shops and allow users to lose up to £100 per spin. Critics say they are highly addictive and make casino-style gambling accessible on the high street. But William Hill said the duty increase made it unlikely that dozens of its shops, most of which are loss-making, can be successfully turned around. The company has already warned that tax rise will cost it around £22 million a year. Critics warn the big jackpot machines, dubbed the 'crack cocaine' of gambling, have blighted high streets . Shares in William Hill and Ladbrokes have fallen sharply in the wake of last month's tax raid, which the industry called ‘knee-jerk and ill-considered’. In a trading statement today, William Hill chief executive Ralph Topping described the shop closures as ‘particularly disappointing’. He added: ‘Through the economic downturn, we have worked hard to grow our retail base but this further planned increase in indirect taxation makes this action necessary.’ The closures would put 420 jobs at risk and result in exceptional costs of up to 24 million pounds, it said. Chancellor George Osborne increased gambling duty on FOBTs from 20 per cent to 25 per cent . William Hill also said operating profit had fallen by 14 percent in the first quarter of 2014, hit by big payouts to gamblers on two weekends on which many top soccer sides had won. But the group is hoping heavy betting on the soccer World Cup in June and July will help to offset the first-quarter problems. ‘While there is no guarantee we can make up the difference, we continue to believe the increased customer confidence from such wins should be good for business, especially in this World Cup year,’ Mr Topping said. In the Budget, Mr Osborne said: ‘Fixed-odds betting terminals have proliferated since gambling laws were liberalised almost a decade ago. These machines are highly  lucrative and therefore it’s right we now raise the duty on them to 25 per cent.’ Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months – with the Mail leading campaigns to highlight their dangers. The machines allow players to stake up to £100 a time on a 20-second spin of a wheel for games such as virtual roulette.","Bookmaker says 109 loss making shops will have to close .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Another Bush may be running for president. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush left the door open to running when asked this week if he was considering a 2016 bid on the Republican ticket. ‘The decision will be based on, can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,’ he told local media gathered Wednesday during an appearance at a suburban Miami school, according to WFOR. Will he or won't he?: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was non-committal about whether or not he would run in 2016 during a school visit this week . Jeb Bush is the son of 41st President George H.W. Bush and brother of 43rd President George W. Bush – family matriarch Barbara Bush said last year when asked about a potential run by son Jeb that ‘we've had enough Bushes.’ Those remarks and a surge in popularity by New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie led many to believe Jeb Bush wasn’t eying a run at the Oval Office. But the last there months have changed things. Mr Christie’s popularity has begun to fall as he endures multiple scandals related to lane closures on the George Washington Bridge and tying Superstorm Sandy aid owed to Hoboken to the approval of real estate projects. With no clear frontrunner, Jeb Bush might have a clear path to at least the Republican nomination were he to run. 'Can I do it joyfully?': Jeb Bush says that unless he can uplift the spirits of the voters, he will not run . ‘I’m going to think about it (running for president) later,’ said Jeb Bush. ‘I don’t wake up each day saying, ‘what am I going to do today to make this decision? ‘I’m deferring the decision to the right time which is later this year and the decision will be based on, can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,’ he continued. ‘It’s a pretty pessimistic country right now; and, is it right for my family? So I don’t even want to think about that till it’s the right time and that’s later on,’ he added. Other potential candidates whose names have been floated round include Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and fellow Floridian Marco Rubio. 'I love her': The youngest Bush son said he loves mother Barbara Bush despite her saying she hopes he doesn't run for president . Former first lady Barbara Bush said, despite her reservations, that ‘Jeb is the best qualified person to run.’ When asked about his mother’s remarks about another presidential run by the family, Jeb Bush replied that ‘she is 89 years old and if you have elderly parents or grandparents, you know they speak their mind. ‘There is not much stopping between thinking and speaking,’ he continued. ‘I love her.’","Jeb Bush is the son of former President George H.W.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Twenty-one cars were completely . destroyed in a blaze at a long-stay car park close to Edinburgh Airport . in the early hours of today. The vehicles were parked in a row at the 2,000-space long-stay car park close to the terminal on the Lochend Industrial Estate in Newbridge. The burnt out wrecks are said to include Vauxhalls, Renaults, a Mini and an expensive Audi. Firefighters were alerted at around 1.16am, receiving reports that 10 cars were alight at the LowCostAirportParking.com site. A fire tore through a long-stay car park at Edinburgh Airport in the early hours, destroying 21 cars parked while their owners enjoyed a holiday . Firefighters responding to a 999 call were told 10 vehicles had caught light at the LowCostAirportParking.com site close to the airport terminal in Newbridge. The blaze quickly engulfed 21 cars, leaving them completely destroyed . But the flames spread, engulfing a total of 21 cars. A team of 10 firefighters from Sighthill tackled the flames, bringing the fire under control by 4.30am. One onlooker said: 'There was every kind of car alight -- by the end you couldn't tell the difference between an Audi and a Vauxhall. They were all burned to a crisp. 'Most of the owners will be on holiday -- they'll be devastated to come back to this. All the bonnets were blown up. 'It's just amazing that more cars weren't destroyed as the car park was full and they were tightly packed together.' A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Investigation Unit is attempting to determine the cause. Police Scotland, who also attended the blaze, said that depending on the result they may also investigate. A Fire Service spokeswoman said: 'We received a call at 1.16am reporting several cars alight at Lochend Industrial Estate at Newbridge. 'Appliances from Sighthill attended and found vehicles alight within the long stay car park. There were ten cars reported alight but it quickly spread from vehicle to vehicle. The final total was 21 affected. While the burnt out vehicles were hardly recognisable, one eye-witness claims they include Vauxhalls, Renaults, a Mini and at least one expensive Audi . The eye-witness said the bonnets of most of the cars had blown off. A fire service investigation is underway to try and establish the cause of the blaze, as Police Scotland said they could not rule out an inquiry of their own . 'Around ten firefighters used three lines of high pressure hose to extinguish the fires by 4.22am. 'A fire investigation is taking place to look at the circumstances.' A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We attended a fire at the Low Cost Parking company car park on Queen Anne Drive, Newbridge at around 1.30am after receiving a call from the Fire Service. 'Officers attended until the fire was extinguished. The Fire Service are currently leading the investigation.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A pair of Hindu deities bought for pennies at a street market in Tibet and kept hidden under a desk because 'they were too nice to use as doorstops' have sold for a staggering £113,000 at auction. One of the statues sold for more than 1,000 times its asking price fetching £90,000 when it went up for sale. The 300-year-old gilt bronze statue was part of a pair picked up by a British collector years ago. He left them to his nephew when he passed away. Unaware of their mammoth value, he kept them under his desk until a clear-out prompted him to sell them because 'they were too nice to use as doorstops'. This 300-year-old deity of the Hindu god Shiva was valued at £80 to £120 after being bought for 'pennies' at a Tibetan market. Staff at British Bespoke Auctions were shocked when it sold for £90,000 to a Chinese collector . Auctioneers British Bespoke Auctions put an £80 estimate on the pearl-set figure of supreme god Lord Shiva, hoping the 26cm statue might fetch £120. But they were astonished when an international bidding war saw the rare figure go to a Chinese collector for £90,000 - 1,135 times its asking price. The smaller statue was also snapped up for £23,000 - excelling its £60 estimate. Nicholas Granger, owner of the Cotswold’s auction house in Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, said: 'They really were the most amazing two items we’ve ever had in six years of having the auction room. 'They are thought to be up to 300 years old and they were very difficult to value. It just shows the power of the internet. 'As soon as we put them up there we had interest from all over the world. We had ten different buyers on the phone as well as all the interest in the room. 'Making the vendors aware of the outcome was a very special moment. I made sure they were sitting down first.' The larger statue - set with pearls, emeralds and coral - was valued at between £80 and £120, when it came in from a couple in Winchcombe. The smaller 18cm deity, decorated with similar jewels, was valued at just £60 to £80, and it is thought the heavy pair were once used in a Tibetan Hindu temple. Speaking of the initial buyer, Nicholas said: 'He was just a general collector. He would go round stalls in Tibet, just picking up bits he would like. A smaller statue, measuring 18cm - also bought at a street market in Tibet for 'pennies' - sold for £23,000 despite being valued at £60 to £80 . 'It would have cost him pounds, just a few pounds, or even pennies. The gentleman left it to his nephew and it was sat under his desk for quite a few years. 'They were doing a clear out and they thought ‘these are a bit nice to have a doorstop’ so brought them along to the local auction house.' The most expensive of the pair had already attracted initial bids on the books for around £5,000, but pledges in the room on Thursday saw it quickly climb to £15,000. But action turned to the phones with bidders increasing their offers by up to £10,000 at a time. 'It just went up and up and up,' said Nicholas. 'It was going from the room to the phones to the room to the phones. 'It was very exciting. It was nail-biting stuff. That’s what I like about this business. You never know what’s on your doorstep.' The smaller statue went to a buyer in the room, a representative of a collector. Nicholas defended his small auction house but admitted the estimates were 'very low'. 'We’re very very realistic with our estimates here,' he said. 'We like to put low estimates to attract attention. We find it works. But yes, this was very low. 'If we had put £15,000 or £20,000 on them it might not have gone for so much. We aren’t Sotheby’s or Christie’s. Buyers like provincial auction rooms. 'Most of them [Hindu diety statues] are about 13cms, so I think it was the size of these ones that made them so special.'","Pair of statues bought by collector for 'pennies' in a street market in Tibet .

"By . Darren Boyle . A heartbroken family has been ordered to demolish their dream £500,000 home - after bungling builders made it 6ft too high and 4ft too wide. Car sales manager Andy Murray, 51, paid £164,000 for a building plot and a further £300,000 constructing the four-bedroom property. He left the project in the hands of his architects and builders but claims they failed to follow the plans. The local council rejected Andrew Murray's planning application because his house in Glasgow had exceeded size guidelines . Council officials objected to the large balcony at the rear or the property and claimed if they allowed it to remain it would set a precedent . The four-bedroom dream house and en-suite bathrooms throughout and a designer kitchen, according to the plans, pictured . After the home was built and fitted with a £27,000 kitchen and four bathrooms costing £25,000, the council stepped in and ordered it to be demolished. Mr Murray and his wife Frances, 53, will even be charged £11,500 for demolition - due to take place next week - and will have to sell his current home, valued at £350,000, to cover the debts. The father-of-three, of Strathaven, Lanarkshire, said: 'It’s a disaster for us. We’ll be out on the street. 'I don’t blame the council. They have exhausted every other avenue.' Planners at East Dunbartonshire Council in Scotland say the property is more than 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than the plans stated and also has too many windows and an unapproved 13ft balcony. Andy Murray has been told that he must pay almost £12,000 to demolish his dream home, pictured, after the council denied planning permission . Mr Murray said that some of the interior fittings inside the property, pictured, have been removed and the interior has been vandalised . Now, the property which is much larger than others in the area, pictured rear, will be demolished on Tuesday . In a letter to the council, Andy said he had put 'trust and faith in the professionalism of our friend who we understood to be reputable builder who would oversee the project on our behalf'. He added: 'However, it is now evident that we were too trustworthy and that we did not give the project the attention that we should have.' Thomas Glen, the council’s head of development and enterprise said: 'The house as constructed differs considerably from a previously-approved scheme, is not in line with local plan policy and guidance, and raises considerable amenity and potential precedent issues. 'Following the decision, the council’s planning service will initiate formal enforcement action.' Mr Murray claims builders Textura and the architects told him the home would meet council regulations and planning consent would be given retrospectively. But in the two years since the house was put up it still has neither planning permission nor a building warrant. A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP who are based at this building in Glasgow said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time' It also lacks an electricity supply, plumbing and a waste water system. The builders have now gone bankrupt and it is thought subcontractors were not paid and stripped out fixtures and fittings. The house has also been broken into and vandalised. Mr Murray said: 'The whole thing has had a terrible effect on my family. It is a financial catastrophe. 'To invest all this money in a new home and lose it, and lose my old home because of the huge debts is beyond a nightmare. 'We were never rich. But we worked hard to attain what we thought was a comfortable position. All of that is gone now and we don’t know where to turn.' Mr Murray used Textura UK Ltd to build the house who used CRGP Ltd Architects and Surveyors to lodge the unsuccessful planning application with East Dunbartonshire Council. John and Mary Houston, who live next door to the house, said they were 'heartbroken' for the Murrays. Mr Houston, 76, said: 'The council has been out in our garden checking it out. One official said the side wall looks like the Berlin Wall. 'It’s tragic for Andy and his family.' Mrs Houston, 74, said: 'We know the house is out of place here but in all honesty we would rather it was allowed to stay.' According to company records, the building firm Textura UK Ltd is in 'voluntary creditors' liquidation' and not able to comment. A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time.'","Family face agony of watching their dream home demolished on Tuesday .

"By . Mike Dawes . Mike Tyson has a new-found respect for the IRS after revealing that they forgave some of his owed back taxes - while Evander Holyfield admits to have had financially problems too. The 47-year-old has infamously struggled with his finances for years and declared bankruptcy in 2005, stating that he was $23million in debt. He has been working his way back to even with the IRS after failing to pay taxes for years. Putting the past behind them: Evander Holyfield (left) and Mike Tyson (right), seen together on Saturday, both told about how they struggled with the financial windfall of their success . That moment: Tyson infamously bit off a portion of Holyfield's ear during a 1997 fight (pictured) but only had kind words for his former competitor when they went to promote a documentary about themselves . At a Tribeca Film Festival talk over the weekend, he alluded to the fact that the debts were not necessarily paid off but he is working towards it, saying 'Just look at the IRS check I just sent!' 'The IRS was very kind to me the other day. They excused $2million off my bill. I like the IRS now,' he said. Tyson spoke about his appreciation for the government agency during a talk that coincided with the launch of a documentary called Champs which profiles Tyson, his former rival Holyfield and fellow boxer Bernard Hopkins. Holyfield, who had a part of his ear bitten off by Tyson during a fight in 1997, was by his side at the Manhattan event on Saturday and said that he had similar financial problems. 'All of sudden when I started making . $20million a fight . . . and they started talking about things I had . never heard of before so I just listened and figured they’d do the right . thing,' Holyfield said according to The New York Post. 'Unfortunately, . it’s not people you don’t know, it’s people you do know and people you . trust. A lot of the time we trust our family members, but you have to . forgive. Because I have forgiven.' Proud dad: Little is known about Tyson's seven living children but he was accompanied to the Tribeca Film Festival event with his son Miguel . Tyson has taken a similarly Zen attitude towards the issue, focusing on the positive aspects of his life and how his seven living children have been able to thrive. (One of his daughters, Exodus, died in 2009 after getting strangled by a cord on a treadmill at the age of four.) 'I didn’t spare any quarters any nickels or dimes either. I’m not regretful for that whatsoever,' the 47-year-old said, according to the Tribeca Film Festival. 'I had a 9th grade education. But my kids go to Ivy League schools. I’m dumb as s*** but I did something right.' 'I am a better parent than my mother and my father and that’s a victory in itself. 'Ten years ago, if you asked me where I’d be now, I’d have said f****** dead. But I’m not dead. I have an awesome life. And I’m just very grateful. That’s the one thing I try to convey. Gratitude.'","Boxing legend has been paying the IRS back after failing to pay taxes for years and filed for bankruptcy in 2005 .

"There are suggestions the club will try to curb Mourinho’s excesses as soon as they start to harm its image . By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . How much longer can the Chelsea hierarchy continue to endorse the desperate behaviour of manager Jose Mourinho that is causing plenty of upset elsewhere in the game? ‘Appalling’, ‘disrespectful’, ‘deeply embarrassing’ was a cross-section of views from referees, managers and football administrators about Mourinho’s recent irrational conduct. Yet Chelsea, in public at least, are backing Mourinho to the hilt, claiming he is entitled to his opinions, whether about referees or fixture scheduling. Chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Ron Gourlay were to accompany their rebel manager in a meeting they requested with referees’ chief Mike Riley, but that was declined, despite the PGMO boss claiming his door was always open. VIDEO Marvel at Mourinho's most MISCHIEVOUS moments this season . Who you gonna call? Jose Mourinho's has been backed by the Chelsea top brass despite his recent antics . However, outside Stamford Bridge, there are suggestions the club will try to curb Mourinho’s excesses as soon as they start to harm its image; some say this may have already happened. Mourinho ducked his last two pre-match PL press conferences in protest at FA charges. Despite receiving more of the same this week, he is expected to talk to the media before Sunday’s game at Liverpool. The ongoing negotiations between David Moyes, his League Managers’ Association advisers and Manchester United over his severance terms are likely to be combative in the extreme. The Moyes camp will make the most of the widely criticised way United handled his leaked departure. Meanwhile, United are said to be very unimpressed with LMA boss Richard Bevan being so critical of their ‘unprofessional manner’ in the middle of sensitive pay-off talks. Hard times: Negotations to reach David Moyes' settlement are expected to be combative . Ashley . Cole picked a novel way of showing how long he’s been out of the first . team at Chelsea before his midweek Champions League semi-final return — . he grew a beard. However, it is expected to have been shaved off by his . next appearance. ........................................................................................... Manchester .

England will be among 20 to 25 countries, including Wales and Scotland, that will put in bids by Friday’s deadline to be one of the 13 host cities for Euro 2020. Wembley, almost certain to be awarded three group games and a KO stage match, are also contending for the semi-finals and final package, but Istanbul is the hot favourite. The most unlikely bid is from Ukraine, considering they co-hosted Euro 2012. There’s also the current massive upheaval in the territory. ........................................................................................... David Beckham is by many millions of pounds the best-paid former footballer working on TV without any need to act as a pundit. On top of his extraordinary £20million deal as a Sky ambassador in Europe, he has another very lucrative role as a World Cup ambassador for China Central TV. This ensures CCTV will be first in the queue for Beckham interviews when he arrives in Brazil for the World Cup semi-finals and final. Not just a pretty face: David Beckham is set for another windfall . FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been known to change his mind on numerous issues. But UEFA regard it as ‘very strange’ that Blatter is now considered a certainty to run for a fifth term of office in 2015. He had announced at the 2011 FIFA Congress in Paris that this current term would be his last. UEFA chief Michel Platini, the most likely contender for the FIFA presidency, says he will not make up his mind until a UEFA summit in October. Staying power: Will Sepp Blatter continue in his role as FIFA president past 2015? Such is the mistrust between warring sports subscription networks BT and Sky that newcomers BT believe their rivals will do all they can next season to downplay the flagship Champions League in comparison with the Premier League — the last campaign before the Euro football rights transfer to BT.","Jose Mourinho's recent conduct has attracted widespread criticism .

Eleven middle school students and their driver were injured when their school bus jumped a curb Thursday and rammed into trees in Southern California, authorities said. Three of the injured — the driver and two of the students— were taken to hospitals in critical condition after the 3.30pm accident, Anaheim police Lt. Bob Dunn said. The other nine young victims sustained minor injuries, and most of them were released to their parents. Scroll down for video . Dramatic scene: Firefighters extricate the driver from the front . of a school bus that crashed Thursday in Anaheim, . California, leaving three people in critical condition, among them two children . Local news reports showed the Orange . Unified School District bus tilted sideways and leaning against a tree . on a roadside embankment next to Anaheim Hills Golf Course. The driver was trapped inside the bus and it took firefighters up to 20 minutes to extricate him before he was taken to the hospital. The bus was taking students home from an after-school activity at El Rancho Charter Middle School in Anaheim when it crashed, said a statement from Michael L. Christensen, superintendent of the Orange Unified School District. Jak Pintches, 14, said the bus went off the road during a turn and hit a tree and a lamp post. 'I flew out of my seat and hit the other side of the bus' and injured his back, the teenager told the Orange County Register. Part of a tree went into the bus and cut a girl on the leg, he said. Smashed: A firefighter walks past a school bus leaning against a eucalyptus tree after it veered off the road in Anaheim near a gold course . Chaotic scene: Several scraped and bloodied students were seen hanging out of the bus' windows and yelling for help from passing drivers . After the crash, someone ran up and told everyone to get off because the bus was leaking gasoline, he said. Witness Andrea Shurtz, one of many people driving nearby who saw the crash, said the bus was going very fast when it hit a curb and appeared to go airborne. 'It came flying down the hill,' Shurtz told KABC-TV, 'and took out trees along the way.' Shurtz said the driver and several students were hanging out of the bus's windows and yelling for help from passing drivers. 'Kids were screaming. Gas was pouring out the back,' Shurtz said. 'People just came running from everywhere.' Good Samaritans who rushed to the victims' aid observed that some of the children were bloodied and bruised. The bus was equipped with seat belts, police said, but it wasn't clear how many of the students were wearing them at the time of the crash. Aftermath: Three of the injured ¿ the driver and two of the students¿ were taken to hospitals in critical condition . The father of the injured driver, whose name has not been released, told CBS Los Angeles that his son always made sure that children were secured in their seats. But some of the passengers admitted that they had unfastened the seat belts during the trip. The driver has been a full-time driver for the Orange Unified School District since October 2010. The California Highway Patrol will take over the investigation. There is no immediate word on the cause, but investigators do not believe that another vehicle was involved in the collision. The crash took place in Anaheim Hills, an affluent community within the city of Anaheim about 10 miles east of Disneyland and 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.","Two students from El Rancho Charter Middle School in Anaheim and their driver suffered critical injuries in the accident .

Magistrates heard he was overpaid a total of £19,985.10 in Disability Living Allowance between May 2009 and June 2012. Chris Coughlan, prosecuting, said a surveillance operation had been launched following three anonymous tip-offs that Sheard, from Wolverhampton, was doing ‘occasional work’ and playing golf three times a week. Plea: Sheard appeared before Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court on Monday where he admitted failing to notify the Government of a change of circumstances that affected his entitlement to benefits . Investigation: A surveillance operation had been launched following three anonymous tip-offs that Sheard, from Wolverhampton, was doing 'occasional work' and playing golf three times a week . He added: 'He was filmed walking his dog over long distances, lifting a wheelbarrow, lifting a 6ft by 7ft metal mesh fence panel and manoeuvring wheelie bins. 'Mr Sheard allegedly could not walk in excess of 10 metres and did not go outside.' Richard Burch, defending, admitted Sheard should have told authorities his condition had improved. He said: 'He was still disabled and probably would have been entitled to some form of disability allowance, although not at the rate at which he was being paid. 'The defendant still suffers from severe ill health. He suffers from chronic pancreatitis, which means he has difficulty eating. 'He has to take a lot of medications. He is diabetic. He also has a bad back. Active: Despite saying he couldn't move without the aid of walking sticks Sheard can be seen in one clip moving a 6ft 7in metal fence to allow his pet dog through to another field while enjoying a leisurely stroll in the park . Changed man: The court heard Sheard - who appeared in court on crutches - had not received Disability Living Allowance since the matter came to light in 2012 . 'He is a person who does have considerable medical problems. It is not suggested that there is a matter of dishonesty.' Mr Burch said that Sheard's form had been completed in 2007 by one of the defendant’s daughters. 'She put basically that the defendant couldn’t really walk without sticks,' he said. 'Occasionally he went to a golf course and he has been seen with a wheelbarrow and walking short distances. 'He did take a dog to a little wooded area near to his house. 'He should have informed the authorities that his walking wasn’t quite as immobile as it was on the form.' The court heard Sheard - who appeared in court on crutches - had not received Disability Living Allowance since the matter came to light in 2012. The case was adjourned for reports and he was told to appear before the same court for sentencing next week.","Alan Sheard, 59, was caught on camera by DWP officers .

"By . Laura Clark . Children with TVs in their bedrooms and their own mobile phones suffer significant falls in reading achievement, a major international study showed yesterday. Research among 4,000 pupils in England has linked ownership of TVs, DVD players and phone handsets to markedly lower scores in reading tests. Two thirds of 10-year-olds have been given their own TVs, with similar proportions owning DVD players and mobile phones. Research among 4,000 pupils in England found children with TVs in their bedrooms and their own mobile phones suffer significant falls in reading achievement . But youngsters who owned these gadgets lost on average at least 20 marks in a reading test given to children in 45 countries and provinces. In contrast, owning a musical instrument was associated with a 30-mark boost in results. A linked study found that teenagers who spend hours on social networking sites do significantly worse in science and maths tests. The trends emerged in international research charting the performance of 10-year-olds in reading and 10 and 14-year-olds in maths and science. Pupils in English primary schools improved their standing in global rankings of reading achievement, rising from 15th place in 2006 to 11th - a gain attributed to back-to-basics 'phonics' teaching. But the number of weak readers remained high, with more than twice as many 10-year-olds 'stuck at a very basic level' compared with the US. Youngsters who owned a television in their bedroom lost on average at least 20 marks in a reading test given to children in 45 countries and provinces . And England tumbled down a world science league of dozens of countries and failed to improve in maths. Ten-year-olds slipped from 7th place to 15th in science after being leapfrogged by several nations including Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics, while flatlining in maths, in 9th place. Performance by 14-year-olds in both maths and science also stalled. Our teenagers were ranked tenth and ninth respectively. East Asian countries including South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan dominated the upper reaches of the tables. As well reporting achievement in key . subjects, the studies paint a picture of the home and school environment . in each country using detailed questionnaires given to pupils and . teachers at the time of tests. More . than one in six English teenagers are being taught in maths or science . classes that are severely disrupted by classroom troublemakers. The research linked ownership of TVs, DVD players and phone handsets to markedly lower scores in reading tests . Responses from teachers revealed how 17 per cent of 14-year-olds are taught in classes where disruption affects lessons 'a lot'. Teachers also said pupils' failure to get enough sleep at night affected significant numbers of lessons. A minority suffered a lack of basic nutrition, which also impaired teaching. It also emerged that more than a quarter of primary pupils and one in 10 secondary pupils reported being 'hit or hurt' for example by kicking or shoving within the last month. And tens of thousands of pupils - up to eight per cent - are taught in secondary schools not considered by their teachers to be 'safe and orderly'. The studies were conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research in England, and overseen by academics in the US and Netherlands. Part of the research asked pupils whether they had mobile phones, TVs or DVDs of their own. The answers were compared with their performance in reading tests, where the average mark internationally was 500, and the highest 571. 'There was a negative association between achievement on the PIRLS tests and ownership of the following items - your own mobile phone, your own television and your own DVD player,' the study said. 'In each case, pupils who reported possessing the item obtained, on average, a lower mean score (by more than 20 scale points) than those who did not possess the item. 'Conversely, the 76 per cent of pupils who owned their own musical instrument scored an average of 31 scale points more than those who did not.' Pupils with their own DVD player, for example, scored 542, against 569 among those who didn't. It also emerged that one in five 10-year-olds spends at least three hours a day watching TV and DVDs. And 13 per cent of 14-year-olds reported using social networking sites for four hours or more on a normal school day. There was evidence that performance in science and maths declined as time spent on the sites increased. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss welcomed news that more children were reading for pleasure than in 2006, when the study was last carried out. But she warned of a 'long tail' of under-achievement in reading. 'Our lowest performers are stuck at a very basic level, only able to find and reproduce information with explicit guidance,' she said. A sharper focus on phonics in schools would boost results further, she said.","Two thirds of 10-year-olds have been given their own TVs and mobiles .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Louis van Gaal is interested in appointing Roy Keane as his assistant manager if he is given the job of replacing David Moyes as Manchester United manager. The Dutchman is among the favourites to take charge at Old Trafford this summer, with owners the Glazer family keen to get the club back on track after Moyes' disastrous 10 months at the helm. Club chiefs are interested in retaining at least one former player to help manage the first team next season, opening up the possibility of Keane returning after more than eight years away. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis Van Gaal: I want to manage in the Premier League . New man? Holland boss Louis van Gaal is tipped to replace David Moyes as Manchester United manager . In the frame: Van Gaal could appoint former United midfielder Roy Keane as his assistant at Old Trafford . The 42-year-old is currently assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland's senior team, working under boss Martin O'Neill. ‘I . don’t know anything about it, I really don’t,’ said O’Neill on a flying . visit to Dublin on Wednesday to open a football pitch in Rathfarnham. Keane's experience as a manager, most notably with Sunderland, is attractive to both United and Van Gaal as they plan for the future. The 62-year-old is understood to remember Keane's impressive performance against his country in 2001, a game which stopped Holland qualifying for the following year's World Cup. Down to business: Ryan Giggs arrives for Manchester United training at Carrington on Wednesday morning . Give us a wave: Wayne Rooney looks focused as he makes his arrival at Carrington on Wednesday . Keane is precisely the type of iron-willed personality needed to ‘sort out’ Manchester United’s problems, according to Hull City and Ireland midfielder David Meyler. The 24-year-old Republic of Ireland international, plucked from the Airtricity League by Keane six years ago, has no doubts about the ability of the Ireland assistant manager to revive United’s fortunes, if asked. ‘Do I think he’s good enough to do the [United] job? Yes, of course. He’d sort out a lot of stuff out there fairly lively,’ said Meyler. Prepared: Giggs, pictured carrying the balls away at Hull in December, took full training . Insecurity: Giggs was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed . ‘For me, he’s probably the best Irish footballer ever. To try and learn so much off him would be great,’ he added. Ryan Giggs has been installed as the interim manager while senior club staff begin the process of searching for and naming a new manager following the departure of Moyes just 10 months into a six-year contract. The role for Giggs is purely temporary, with officials at the club not confident they can impress the midfielder upon any new manager's backroom staff. Nevertheless, Giggs has the full support of his mentor Sir Alex Ferguson and  see him as a United boss in the long-term.","Man United keen in retaining at least one former player to help manage the first team .

"By . Claire Bates . Parents often struggled to persuade their children to eat healthy vegetables, but now scientists have found a simple solution - give them superhero names. A study revealed that giving greens catchy labels such as 'X-Ray Vision Carrots' led primary school children eat twice as much of the vegetable. Carrots: May not give you X-ray vision but are an excellent source of carotene, which we turn into Vitamin A . Researchers from Cornell University in the US asked 147 students ranged from eight to 11-years-old to taste a new lunch menu over three days, which included carrots. They found the different names did not change the amount of carrots the students put on their plates. However, children ate 66 per cent of the orange veg when they were named 'X-ray vision . carrots,' while 32 . per cent consumed when labeled 'Food of the Day' and 35 per cent when . they weren't named. In another part of the study, the researchers renamed broccoli as 'Power Punch Broccoli' and beans as ""Silly Dilly Green Beans"" in one . school's lunchroom. A neighboring school acted as a control with the . names of these foods left unchanged. The researchers found that, compared to the control school, sales of . these vegetables were up by 99 per cent while buying in the control . school declined by 16 per cent. Study lead author, Professor Brian Wansink, said: 'This research suggests that schools have a low-cost or even no-cost solution . to induce children to consume more nutritious foods. 'These results demonstrate that using attractive names for healthy foods . increases kid's selection and consumption of these foods and that an attractive . name intervention is robust, effective and scalable at little or no cost. 'This research also confirms that using attractive names to make . foods sound more appealing works on individuals across all age levels.' The research team had previously found that associating healthy foods with superheroes like Batman would encourage more children to eat these foods. The latest study will be published in the journal of Preventive Medicine.","Children ate 66% of their veg when labelled 'X-ray vision carrots' compared to 32% just labelled 'Food of the Day'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 06:38 EST, 5 July 2011 . The Japanese man accused of raping and murdering Briton Lindsay Hawker apologised to her parents yesterday for causing her death – but insisted it was an accident. Tatsuya Ichihashi, 32, spoke at the opening of his trial over the death of the 22-year-old English teacher at his Tokyo apartment. Her parents Bill and Julia Hawker, from Brandon, Warwickshire, arrived in Japan on Sunday with their two other daughters, Lisa and Louise, to attend the trial in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba. On trial: A courtroom sketch depicting Tatsuya Ichihashi, who is on trial for the rape and murder of Lindsay Hawker, with her parents Bill and Julia, right, in the gallery at Chiba District Court . In court Ichihashi knelt on the floor . and bowed his head in their direction. Later he said tearfully: ‘I had . no intention of murdering her, but I’m responsible for the death of Miss . Lindsay. I’m the one who scared her and left her dead. I’m really, . really sorry.’ The accused man - one of her students . - was arrested in Osaka, in western Japan, on November 10, 2009 and has . been in custody since. The . defense argued that Ichihashi tried to revive Miss Hawker after suffocating . her by accident in an attempt to keep her from crying out for help from . the neighbours. Ichihashi, however, admitted to tying her up and raping her. Looking for justice: The family murdered British teacher Lindsay Hawker arrive at a Japanese court for the trial of the man who has confessed to her murder: (L-R) Her mother Julia, father Bill and sisters Lisa and Louise . Victim participants: Due to the Japanese judicial system, the Hawkers will be allowed to question Ichihashi during the trial and express their opinion on sentencing . Prosecutors have not yet entered a sentencing demand, but the crime could bring the death penalty. Miss Hawker's parents Bill and Julia are attending the trial at Chiba District Court. 'I'm here to get justice for my daughter,' said Mr Hawker. 'It's been a long time coming.' For . Miss Hawker's family, their trip to Japan is the first time they has . visited Japan together since 2009, when they marked the second . anniversary of the death of their daughter, a Leeds University graduate. Before . leaving Heathrow to travel to Japan, Mr Hawker of Brandon, near . Coventry, Warwickshire, gave a brief statement, saying: 'We are a very . strong family and we're going to see this through to the end. Raped and murdered:Miss Hawker was an English teacher and had educated the accused man, Tatsuya Ichihashi . Memory: Bill Hawker holds a photo of his daughter Lindsay outside the court in Chiba, Japan, and right, Tatsuya Ichihashi pictured shortly after his 2009 arrest . Under the Japanese system the Hawkers . will be classed as 'victim participants' and will be able, at the . discretion of the court, to question the defendant and give their . opinion on sentencing. They will also be able, for example, to ask to examine the prosecution evidence. In January Ichihashi promised to donate the proceeds of a book in which he confessed to the killing to Miss Hawker's family. It detailed how he spent two and a half years on the run following the murder and how he used false identities and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance. Ichihashi also apologised to Miss Hawker's family, claiming he wrote the book as 'a gesture of contrition for the crime I committed'. He doesn't describe the crime or his motives in the book, titled Until the Arrest, instead detailing his life at large, during which he traveled up and down the country, in constant fear of arrest and obsessed with cosmetic surgery. Accused: Tatsuya Ichihashi spent two and a half years on the run following Miss Hawker's murder and underwent plastic surgery to evade capture. He is pictured here before, left, and after the operations . It tells how he scissored off his . lower lip, dug two moles out of his cheek with a box cutter and even . gave himself a nose job in an attempt to obscure his identity. He also claimed to have embarked on a . pilgrimage tour of temples on the south-western island of Shikoku, . wishing Miss Hawker could 'come back to life'. He was finally arrested in Osaka while waiting for a ferry to Okinawa. The Japanese court, in Chiba, will . work in much the same way as the English system, Kenichi Kinukawa, the . lawyer representing the family, said. On the first day of the trial the defendant heard the charges and gave his plea to the allegations. The major differences with the UK courts are the victim participation system and the saiban-in (lay judge) jury system. The lay judge system sees members of . the public selected to participate in the most serious trials, working . together with professional judges to determine guilt or innocence and . sentence.

"By . Sam Greenhill . Detectives investigating Jimmy Savile have been passed the names of three doctors accused of molesting youngsters, it emerged last night . They abused children at the same hospitals where the late entertainer preyed on young and vulnerable patients, it can be revealed. One victim told the Mail she was groped aged 12 by a Stoke Mandeville doctor who had a Jim'll Fix It picture on his wall. Helen Wakeling, from Richmond in Surrey, who was attacked by Jimmy Saville in 1973, when as a nurse working at Stoke Mandeville Hospital,  she asked for an autograph for her sister. She is pictured here with him, moments before the attack . Another woman, who named a separate doctor, is convinced there was a 'sex abuse ring' operating at the Buckinghamshire hospital. There are now demands for a full independent inquiry into how Savile was given easy access to his victims at children's homes and NHS hospitals, as well as at the BBC. So far, no NHS trust has apologised for Savile – despite him being given the keys to Broadmoor, a bedroom room at Stoke Mandeville and free rein of Leeds General Infirmary. As the list of his victims grew, a former Stoke Mandeville nurse yesterday waived her anonymity to tell how Savile assaulted her in her bedroom, while a hospital volunteer said the star raped her while wearing a 'Sex instructor, first lesson free' T-shirt. Former nurse Helen Wakeling said Savile shoved her on to a bed and tried to molest her. Mrs Wakeling, 59, of South West London, said: 'One afternoon in 1973, I came off duty at about 4.30 and bumped into Jimmy Savile and I invited him round to the nurses' quarters for a cup of tea. I made him tea in my room, and the next thing I know he pushed me on to the bed and jumped on top of me. 'I was so shocked, but I was 20 and a Londoner and I just said to him, “What do you think you're doing?” 'He was trying to grope me, but I shouted at him and pushed him off. He stood up and said he was “only joking”, but obviously he wasn't.' There are already accusations Savile had at least one accomplice at the BBC, and at Top of the Pops, he allegedly ran a 'gang of four' – staff including a cameraman who were part of the paedophile scandal. Abuse: Sir Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in September 2003 . The block at Stoke Mandeville Hospital where Sir Jimmy Savile had a room for 24 years and where he allegedly abused children . Jimmy Saville gets ready for another day, in his flat in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in July 1982 . But Pete Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the NHS was a major line of inquiry. He said: 'We have had several calls alleging abuses by doctors at the same hospitals that Savile worked at. This is much bigger than we thought.' One woman said her Stoke Mandeville doctor sexually abused her every fortnight for four years from the age of 14. She said: 'There is no doubt in my mind there was a sex abuse ring operating at Stoke Mandeville. It is no coincidence that this man was doing the same thing as Jimmy Savile.' She said the doctor operated on her at the hospital after a burns accident, and she then attended his follow-up clinics at a separate hospital. Now 52, she recalled: 'He called me his “special patient”. I had to go and see him once every fortnight for cortisone injections under the skin.' But the doctor insisted he needed to 'massage' the fluid into her body in her groin area, she said. She reported it to her teachers and her mother but said no one took her allegations seriously. The doctor accused by the woman has since died. A second woman told the Mail she was abused by a Stoke Mandeville consultant paediatrician called Dr Michael Salmon, at his clinic on another site. In 1990, Salmon was jailed for three years after admitting indecent assaults on two 13-year-old girls and a 16-year-old girl. The woman told the Mail: 'I was so shocked but I didn't know what to do, and I never told anyone. But he had a Jim'll Fix It picture on his sideboard and he worked at Stoke Mandeville, so now I wonder if there was any connection with Savile.' A third doctor has also been implicated in Leeds. A spokesman for Stoke Mandeville said: 'We have been shocked and saddened to hear of the very serious allegations about Jimmy Savile dating back to the 1970s. We have no record of any complaints of this nature and would have taken swift and decisive action if this had formally been raised with us.' The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday faced questions over why it let Savile off the hook three years ago despite a 'clear pattern' of claims against him. Keir Starmer QC announced a review of why four cases were dropped at the end of a two-year probe involving two police forces in 2009. The Director of Public Prosecutions said he believed the right decision was taken and the internal inquiry will take place out of an 'abundance of caution'.","Former nurse waives her anonymity to tell how Savile assaulted her .

"By . Martin Beckford . and Michael Powell . The young woman kept as a ‘slave’ all her life became obsessed with a neighbour, writing him scented love letters and sending him photographs of herself, it was claimed last night. The 30-year-old allegedly held captive by a cult-like Left-wing commune along with two older women was seen as ‘spooky’ by neighbours but did have some limited contact with the outside world. She is said to have sent hundreds of love letters to neighbour Marius Feneck who lived two floors above her at the block of flats in Brixton, South London. Scroll down for video . Guard: Police stand in front of a property in Brixton, Borough of Lambeth, south London where three women were allegedly kept as slaves for at least 30 years . In one of the heat-rending notes, in . which she addresses him as her 'beloved sweetheart', she warns him not . reply or talk to anybody about it because she feared he captors would do . something 'evil' to him. Mr Feneck told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘She . used to send me pictures and write me letters about how she wanted to be . with me. I wasn’t interested but she wouldn’t stop trying to get with . me.’ 'Love letters': Marius Feneck, pictured, who allegedly received scented letters and photographs from one of the women . He showed seven . photographs of a slim, brunette woman with pale skin, wearing Western . clothes, claiming she stuck them on his door to ‘tempt’ him. Mr Feneck’s girlfriend, Rachael . Price, 25, said the girl, who they knew as ‘Rose’ had been writing him love letters for seven . years, posting them when she walked to the local Tesco supermarket with . her alleged captors. ‘They . were scented and she would walk slightly behind the old couple as they . passed the building’s letterboxes on the ground floor, so she could slip . them in our letter box. ‘In . them she said she loved him and wanted to be with him for ever. There . must have been about 500 letters sent to him over the years, some with . lipstick kisses on them, and they were deeply obsessive. 'But she told . him never to visit her because she lived with people who were racist.’ Miss Price said the alleged captive had recently written her a ‘vile letter’ falsely accusing her of attacking Mr Feneck. ‘She . said I was disgusting, and my children didn’t deserve me. Rose had a . weird dead-eyed look to her and I was scared of her. I was thinking of . going to the police. If I had gone, she might have got away earlier.’ Possessions: Boxes of crayons and other items sit on a window ledge at the south London . Neighbours said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops . The case came to light after the Irish woman rang the Freedom Charity last month to say she had been held against her will. The Malaysian woman is believed to have suffered a stroke but was being denied mdeical care. Freedom Charity founder Aneeta Prem said: 'These women have had traumatic and distributing experiences, which they have revealed to us. The first thing the youngest of the three women asked for after escaping the south London flat was make-up. The 30-year-old was freed into the care of the Freedom Charity along with a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman. Freedom charity founder Aneeta Prem told the Sunday Times: 'It was the first thing that she asked me for and one of the things she was very, very keen on. 'She liked the way I did my make-up. I don't know if she had ever worn make-up. I ended up buying them all foundation, mascara, eye liners, powders lipsticks. 'They were absolutely thrilled and excited when I took the box of make-up out.' 'What needs to happen now is that the . three victims, who have begun a long process of recovery, are able to . go through their rehabilitation undisturbed, without being identified.' Police were last night guarding the . address where it is believed the three women – aged 69, 57 and 30 – were . kept for some of the  30 years they spent in captivity. Lambeth . Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about . the women, rescued last month from a housing association flat where they . were living with two suspected illegal immigrants from Tanzania and . India. The suspect man and woman, both 67, . were arrested on Thursday but released on bail after being questioned . over false imprisonment and immigration offences. Neighbours . said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out . of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops. The . woman, apparently born in Britain and called Rose, allegedly tried to . become close to a man living in a nearby flat – and was jealous of his . girlfriend. The young woman and her alleged captors lived in a ground-floor flat in the housing association block, which is thought to have been built only a decade ago, along with the two older women. Police are looking for other properties the group previously lived in. Questions: Lambeth Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about the women who were rescued last month . Police are conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area around the housing association flat in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London . The women were seen digging up weeds . outside as well as visiting shops, and even allegedly chatting to police . officers on the estate. It emerged yesterday that the couple suspected of holding the women captive came to Britain in the 1960s. Scotland . Yard said the man met the older victims – one Irish, the other . Malaysian – in London ‘through a shared political ideology’ and they all . lived together in a ‘collective’. Peckford Place: A 30-year-old British woman, a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were rescued from a house in Lambeth, south London, last month . The commune collapsed but the two women continued to live with the suspects and were subjected to ‘emotional and physical abuse’. Police said they were so in thrall to their captors they initially refused to let police arrest them after they were rescued. ‘Rose’ is thought to have lived with them all her life but her birth was registered with the authorities – prompting questions as to why health visitors or school bosses never checked up on her.

"By . Bianca London . They say that honesty is the best policy - particularly in loving relationships. But when it comes to matters of dress size, it seems that for women at least, truth is a dirty word. A new survey has revealed that almost half of women admit to hiding their true dress size from their partners, friends and colleagues. The latest research revealed that a third admitted to telling colleagues fibs when it came to their vital statistics, with 77 per cent of women wishing they were a size smaller. Nearly half of British women lie about their dress size to friends, colleagues and partners after failing to slim down for summer . Just eight per cent of women polled were happy with their measurements this summer and it was a svelte size 12 that topped the charts as the most desired shape. And ladies across the UK aren’t just twisting the truth about their dress size - 60 per cent even admit to inflating their bosom by at least one cup size. Busty 34D, or DD, topped the poll as the most longed-for bra sizes.

"By . Jack Doyle . An illegal immigrant who feared her sham marriage was about to be exposed deliberately became pregnant to try to stay in Britain, a judge said yesterday. Zambian Leya Mtonga made a ‘conscious decision’ to conceive after she was arrested by Home Office immigration officials, a court heard. Yesterday she was accused of a ‘selfish and cynical’ act as she was jailed for two years for her involvement in a sham marriage ring – and faces being deported from Britain. Zambian Leya Mtonga, 39, entered into a sham marriage with co-conspirator, Portuguese national, Nuno Moriera, 29 . The 39-year-old wed Portuguese national Nuno Moriera, 29, in Nottingham in 2009. She wanted to use the marriage to get the right to live in the UK. He was paid to join in with the pretence. The couple were pictured smiling together in photographs seized by investigators. But the marriage was exposed as part of a wider probe into a mass immigration scam, involving a dozen sham weddings in the city. Mtonga was arrested in June last year and the court heard she then set out to get pregnant to prove her relationship was real. She is due to give birth in nine days. Zambian woman Leya Mtonga, 39 signing the marriage register with Portuguese national, Nuno Moriera, 29 . Home Office Immigration inspector Andy . Radcliffe said: ‘We do not know who the father of Mtonga’s baby is, but . she insists it is Moriera. If this is the case then it is our belief . that they sought to have a child together in a deliberate attempt to . make their sham marriage appear credible. ‘It is hard to think of a more selfish and cynical act.’ Sentencing . Mtonga and her husband to two years’ imprisonment yesterday, Judge . Philip Head refused her lawyer’s plea that she should avoid jail because . she is  due to give birth, the Nottingham Post reported. The judge said: ‘I’m driven to  the conclusion that it was a conscious and deliberate decision to try to bolster your claim to a genuine marriage. Happy couple: The pair pictured on their wedding day in 2009 . ‘For the avoidance of doubt, I refer to Mtonga’s pregnancy. It is my judgement it was a deliberate manoeuvre on your part. Custodial facilities exist that are more than capable of meeting your needs.’ Mtonga, 39, came to Britain on a student visa to train as a dental nurse, but never went home. As . her visa was due to expire she turned to HCI Consultants in Nottingham, . a firm which claimed to offer ‘immigration advice and services’ but was . allegedly at the centre of a string of sham weddings. The couple were married in Nottingham Register Office in October 2009. Pictures from the day suggest they looked every inch the happy couple. But a three-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard theirs was one of a number of sham weddings in the city. Police and immigration officials are still searching for the alleged ringleader, Nigerian Eustace Okere, who was arrested in October 2009 but jumped bail. He is accused of providing fake references for European nationals designed to show they were living and working in the UK – so their new spouses could obtain visas. Home Office officials insisted they were still determined to kick Mtonga and her child out after she gives birth. However, she could use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to a family life – to try and launch an appeal. Two other immigrants, Duke Okorie and Michael Eke, both 39 and Nigerian, were also jailed for two years for sham weddings. Three other members of the conspiracy, from Nigeria, Zambia and Trinidad, were jailed at earlier hearings and have been deported.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A small study suggests mosquitoes contribute to the problem of childhood obesity in parts of the United States . Mosquitoes contribute to the problem of childhood obesity in some parts of the United States, a small study suggests. Researchers from Brandeis University in Massachusetts led an experimental study to investigate whether the amount of time children spent playing outside varied depending on whether the mosquito population was controlled or not. They found that children spent more time outside in areas with effective abatement compared to those with lots of mosquitoes to conclude effective control of mosquitoes could play a role in cutting the rate of childhood obesity. The scientists asked 38 children from Cliffwood Beach and Union Beach between 2009 and 2012 to log the time they spent outside, when treatment to kill mosquitoes was alternated between the two places to see if there was a correlation. John Worobey, lead author of the paper published in the Journal of . the American Mosquito Control Association admitted the study was limited because of the small number of participants and children's self-reporting, but believes the results were clear. Children living in areas where effective action was taken to cull the mosquito population spent more time exercising outside. He said: 'Because obesity is difficult to treat, . public health efforts need to be directed toward prevention, which could . include mosquito abatement since physical activity protects against . obesity.' The study also found that 75 per cent of . the local population said they would spend more time outside if it . wasn't for mosquitoes and households spent $86 a year on their own . mosquito controls, indicating that they take the problem seriously. Distribution of Asian Tiger mosquitoes in the United States, by county, researched in 2000. The mosquitoes invaded 30 states in 1985 and are believed to have hitched a ride on shipments of car tyres from Japan . Scientists said people spent an average of an extra two hours a week exercising in the outdoors when the mosquitoes were kept under control. The study is one of many seeking to quantify just how much misery mosquitoes cause. A project by scientists at  Rutgers University focused on the impact of the Asian Tiger mosquito - a particularly blood-thirsty species that has colonised half of the US since 1985. They said that at times the mosquitoes were so plentiful they kept children indoors and passive during the summer months. While the cost of pest control is considerable, Dina Fonseca, a population geneticist at the university said the cost of not controlling them could be childhood obesity. The $3.8 million study into Tiger Mosquito invasions in Trenton shows the pests negatively affect people's quality of life. Because obesity is difficult to treat, public health efforts need to be directed toward prevention, which could include mosquito abatement since physical activity protects against obesity,'  said Mr Worobey . People spent an average of an extra two hours a week when mosquitoes were kept under control . Asian Tiger mosquitoes invaded 30 states in 1985 and are believed to have hitched a ride on shipments of car tyres from Japan. While they are not thought to transmit serious diseases in the US, they spread dengue and the  chikungunya virus in the hotter climates of South East Asia. Scientists are examining the mosquitoes as the US Department of Agriculture, which is part funding the Rutgers study, wants to work out the best way of controlling the pests before they start carrying disease as the US climate warms up. Professor Randy Gaugler, the project organiser, told USA Today: 'Mosquito control in urban settings came first, and the children's physical activity idea was birthed from that.'","Two scientific studies conclude mosquitoes prevent children and adults exercising outside in certain parts of the US in summertime .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pictured: Paul Anthony Ciancia, pictured at right in his mugshot, is the 23-year-old man who opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday morning, killing one TSA agent and injuring three others . The motive for the Friday morning shooting at Los Angeles International Airport has not been confirmed, but a note thought to be written by the gunman is shedding some light on his thought process. Shooter Paul Anthony Ciancia had 'anti-government' leanings and was reportedly carrying a note which said that he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs'. The note was found in a bag that he was carrying- which was likely the same bag that he used to bring a semi-automatic rifle into Terminal 3. Multiple sources have added that the note was signed with the letters 'NWO' which stands for 'New World Order'. The conspiracy theory of a 'new world . order' asserts that there is a secret group of powerful individuals who . used their money and global influence to eventually gain control of the . world. The concept of . the New World Order has many different strains that have evolved over . time, and has come to include mysterious elite groups like the . Illuminati and the Freemasons. Some . of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret . members of the New World Order will order a coordinated coup d'etat in . the United States and other powerful countries using black helicopters . and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world. Scroll down for video . Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory . Warning signs: In recent days, Ciancia sent multiple rambling text messages about his hatred and disgust with the government. His last text to his brother hinted that he was suicidal, so relatives called the police . The Los Angeles Times . reported that in a note found in his bag, he wrote about his . 'disappointment with government' and how he did not intend to injure any . civilians, only federal employees. In . addition to the note found at the scene, investigators are using some . other writings of Ciancia’s to help build a case for what drove him to . kill a TSA agent on Friday morning. CNN reports that the suicidal text he sent to his brother just hours before the shooting was not the first one that scared family members. In others, which were sent to his brother and father, Ciancia was said to have rambled about his negative outlook on life, his disgust with the government and his disappointment with his life in Los Angeles. A federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff. 'This was clearly a suicide mission... he did not expect to walk away from this,' the official told USA Today. Such hatred of the federal government would explain why witnesses say he was clearly targeting TSA agents, as multiple survivors have said that the gunman asked them if they were members of the agency. When they said no, he calmly continued walking looking for his next victims. Witness Stephanie Rosemeyer told the paper that she was waiting to board a flight and was walking near the food court in Terminal 3 when she saw a man carrying a gun walking around while wearing a bulletproof vest. Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim) She said that she locked eyes with the man, who did not appear to be a police officer. 'He looked back at me and said ""I don't like this."" I took a step toward him,' she told The LA Times. The man, who is presumably Ciancia, then shouted an expletive about the TSA. 'I decided to walk away, and then I heard gun shots and so I walked faster,' Ms Rosemeyer said. A similar story was told my traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper. 'I was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr Saryan told CNN. Lock down: Police are now searching his family's home in Pennsville, New Jersey (pictured) as well as the apartment where the 23-year-old was living in Los Angeles . He said that while he was going to get his shoes taht were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit it seemed to be a grazing wound.' At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner- right when the gunman came up to him. '(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said ""TSA?"" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon. 'If I had a TSA uniform I wouldn't be here talking to you.'","Paul Ciancia, 23, had sent his relatives multiple 'rambling' text messages talking about his disgust with the government and unhappiness in general .

"By . Keith Gladdis . and Paul Revoir . Channel 4 went ahead and broadcast an uncensored repeat of its Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2012 last night despite hundreds of complaints about its vile jokes. The panel show, presented by Jimmy Carr, caused outrage when it was first shown on Sunday. It featured comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden apparently getting drunk as they made lewd jokes about the Queen, Barack Obama, Usain Bolt and Susan Boyle. Some of the most offensive comments – about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh – were made within minutes of the 9pm watershed. No comment: Channel 4 bosses refused to break their silence over the furore surrounding Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012. Featured guests included  Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall,  James Cordon and Gabby Logan . Anger: Comedian Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden were behind many of the offensive remarks on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the year 2012 . Television watchdog Ofcom has . received at least 160 complaints about the content of the prerecorded . show and Channel 4 has received another 130. It means Ofcom is coming under increased . pressure to launch an investigation into why C4 bosses allowed the . pre-recorded show to be broadcast at primetime during the Christmas . holidays. However that did not stop Channel 4 from broadcasting the quiz again at 11.35pm last night or editing its content. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch UK . said: 'This show should have always been consigned to the latenight slot . and should never have been on at primetime. 'It is postpub television but it was . put out at a time when people are usually expecting shows such as . Downton Abbey or Call The Midwife.' Channel 4 chief executive David Abraham will return to his desk on Monday to find out whether Ofcom is to launch an inquiry. Targets: The comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter Usain Bolt, left, and singer Susan Boyle, right . Bad taste: Obscene jokes were also made about the Queen (pictured left) and President Obama (right) Only one board member, Mark Price, responded to MailOnline's requests for a comment, saying only that it was not up to the board to make 'creative' decisions. The C4 press office said its board members would not be making any comment. It repeated a request for us not to contact its chairman Lord Burns and said its chief executive David Abraham was still on holiday in Vietnam. The only comment C4 would make was one issued on New Year's Eve which said: 'Big Fat Quiz Of The Year is a well-established comedic and satirical review of the year's events with well-known guests and was broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings.' Silence: Despite at least 240 complaints from viewers, C4 has refused to comment on the furore . Conservative MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons culture select committee, said: 'The number of complaints speaks to the fact that the British public think that obscene jokes, not least about members of the Royal Family, are unacceptable. The management at Channel 4 ... need to be reminded that there are standards of behaviour that are required from public broadcasters. Channel 4 is in receipt of public money so it needs to be accountable to public opinion.' Ofcom is likely to consider an investigation into the broadcast because much of the crude content came so soon after the 9pm watershed. A media source said: 'Ofcom has warned in the past that there should not be an abrupt change in content after 9pm. It has said it is a ""watershed not a waterfall"" and consideration should be given to that.'","Comedy panel show featured vile sexual slurs minutes after 9pm watershed .

"By . Damien Gayle . Former Dr Who assistant Karen Gillan: Redheads still face prejudice despite prominence of stars with red hair and numbers of women who dye their hair red . They suffer a lot of stick for their unusual hair colouring, with hurtful taunts of 'Ginger!' resonating around playgrounds across the country. Despite the prominence of stars Karen Gillan, Prince Harry and Damien Lewis, redheads still complain that they fall victim to prejudice and discrimination. But new research shows that, far from being rare, Britain and Ireland are in fact host to a secret army of red hair gene carriers. The results of the study, published today, indicate that more than 20million people in the UK and Ireland have the genes that can cause red hair. The researchers have put together the . first-ever map detailing the distribution of red-headed genes across . the two countries, showing exactly where red heads are most . concentrated. The most . red-headed part of Britain and Ireland is the South-East of Scotland . with Edinburgh as a red-hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three . common red hair gene variants. But . the biggest surprise revealed by the research is just over 34 per cent . of the population of parts of the north of England are carriers, making . Yorkshire and Humberside as red-headed as Ireland. The . results of the year-long project have been published today by ancestry . company Britain's DNA to coincide with the Redhead Convention to be held . in Crosshaven, County Cork, Ireland, this weekend. It . comes in the wake of the UK's first ever Ginger Pride march in . Edinburgh a fortnight ago, where more than a hundred redheads paraded . through the streets to demonstrate against prejudice against people with . red hair. A spokesman for BritainsDNA said: 'No-one needs a DNA test to tell if they have red hair. All they need is a mirror. What BritainsDNA set out to discover was a hidden story, one never before told. This is the story of the secret carriers. 'Since red hair is recessive, children born with red hair need both parents to be carriers of one of the red hair gene variants. 'But millions of people in Britain and Ireland have no idea that they are carriers. Our project at last reveals just how red-headed a nation we really are.' The study has found that the 'number of people is Britain and Ireland who are carriers is very large indeed. We estimate a total of 20.4 million people are carriers of the red hair variants,' the spokesman added. 'That should help play down ginger jibes.' This map produced by BritainsDNA shows where redheaded genes are concentrated. The most red-headed part of Britain and Ireland is the South-East of Scotland with Edinburgh as a red-hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three common red hair gene variants . The study is based on data from 2,343 people who have undergone DNA tests to learn more about their ancestry. Researchers looked at three different variants of the MC1R gene, which causes red hair. According to BritainsDNA, those with 151-Cysteine-red have a 70,000 year old variant that probably arose in West Asia; those with 160-Tryptophan-red are descendants of someone who probably also lived in West Asia 70,000 years ago; and 294-Histidine-reds belong to a much younger group who come from a European who lived about 30,000 years ago. In order for a child to develop red hair, both parents must be carriers of one of these red-hair gene variants. But even then there is only a 25 per cent their child will be born ginger. Approximately 6 per cent of Scots have red hair, or about 300,000 people. Of the English, about 4 per cent - around 2.1million people - are red heads. Dr Jim Wilson, a geneticist at Edinburgh University and chief scientist at Britain's DNA, said: 'The big surprise for me was that the frequency of the redhead variants was lower in the NW of Scotland, where many people probably think there are more redheads than elsewhere. 'However, this makes sense when we realise that just like in the Midlands and South of England, this probably means that the genes of the indigenous people have been diluted, in the north by Norse Vikings and in the south by Anglo-Saxons.' BritainsDNA now hopes to continue their study further using new state of the art gene testing technology which can test for all known variants of the MC1R gene. Once completed they expect to find the number of red hair gene carriers is even higher.","Researchers create first ever map showing distribution of red head genes .

"By . John Hall . This is the terrifying moment a huge great white shark attacked a boat carrying four men and started chewing on the outboard motor. The fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of Pottsville in the Australian state of New South Wales, when the shark started circling. Although it launched an attack on the boat minutes later, the fishermen were not fazed, laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna, before slapping it and sending it on its way. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: A boat carrying four fishermen was attacked by a 16 foot great white shark near Pottsville in northern Australia. The huge creature swam among dolphins while circling the boat before trying to attack its outboard motor (pictured) and bait box . Prowl: The fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of Pottsville in the Australian state of New South Wales, when the shark started circling . Fear: The fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier. Reality struck, however, when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell-tale fin started protruding from the water . Stalking: The fishermen switched off their engine after the great white attacked the boat, which appeared to calm it down. The shark followed the boat as it drifted along for about two hours, giving the men time to take photographs and film themselves feeding it tins of tuna . Not scared: Although it launched an attack on the boat, the fishermen were not phased, laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna, before slapping it and sending it on its way . The fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier. Reality struck, however, when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell-tale fin started protruding from the water. 'I saw one with a massive fin and said 'that’s not a dolphin', then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board,' fisherman Daniel Flemming told Australia's Nine Network news channel. 'When it first came up it was a bit daunting, it was a shark the same size as the boat and it pushed the boat around a couple of times,' he added. Confusion: Fisherman Daniel Flemming thought the massive great white shark may have been a dolphin at first. He realised he had made a mistake when the creature started attacking the outboard motor and bait board . Visitors: Once the fishermen turned off their engines the shark calmed down and followed them as they drifted. The fishermen even called other boats in the area to the scene (pictured) so they could also enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime spectacle . Risk: The great white appeared so content that the men even started teasing the wild animal by putting their hands in the water, as they were confident it wasn't going to attack them again .

Goodbye: Deciding they had had enough of its company, fisherman James Tate eventually slapped the shark on the nose, scaring it off. The men estimated it to be about 16 foot long - the same length as their boat . Damage: Although the shark was calm for much of the time it spent following the fishing boat, the consequences of its attack on the outboard motor were clear to see . Speaking to Australia's Nine Network news channel later, fisherman Daniel Flemming (pictured) said: 'I saw one with a massive fin and said 'that¿s not a dolphin', then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board' Perhaps unsurprisingly the shark started nudging the boat shortly after, and began trying to attack the bait box the fishermen were carrying onboard. Deciding they had had enough of its company, fisherman James Tate then slapped it on the nose, scaring it off. The men estimated the shark to be about 16 foot long - bigger than their boat. Last week a monster female great white who is so notorious she has been nicknamed Joan of Shark forced the closure of a popular beach in Albany, Western Australia. The largest great white ever tagged in Australia, Joan is more than 16 foot long, weighs around 1.6 tonnes and is believed to have made more than a dozen appearances in the last month.","Boat carrying four fishermen was attacked by a 16 foot great white shark near Pottsville in northern Australia .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A Tibetan monk who posed for a selfie with London Mayor Boris Johnson was so caught up in the moment that it caused him to lose a laptop containing his life’s work. Lelung Rinpoche, 43, was excited to find he was travelling on the same London Underground train as the mayor. But after posing for a photograph, the expert on Buddhist scriptures grabbed his young son and left the train as he suddenly realised he had reached his stop. Boris Johnson posed for a selfie with a Tibetan monk while on a train. Lelung Rinpoche was so caught up in the moment - he accidentally left his laptop, which contained his life's work, on the train. In the picture the mayor is holding what appears to be a copy of The Beano, the children's comic. It is folded to show a page headed 'PieFa', which may be Pie Face, who is a sidekick of Dennis the Menace. It was only moments later that he realised he had left on the train his laptop containing nearly 1,000 pages of rare scriptures he had collected from around the world. It was in a rucksack that also contained a camera, keys and his passport. Since then, the bag has been handed in anonymously to London Underground staff and his camera, keys and passport have been returned to him. But the all-important laptop, which disappeared as he travelled between Uxbridge and Eastcote on April 10, is still missing. Mr Rinpoche, who had become engrossed in a deep conversation with Boris Johnson about Tibet during their brief meeting on the Metropolitan Line train, had nearly complete drafts of two books on the laptop. The books aimed to help preserve ancient teachings which are under threat of being lost due to the political unrest in his Tibetan homeland. Mr Rinpoche is the spiritual director of the charity the Lelung Dharma Trust, based in Eastcote, northwest London. His work featured in a BBC2 documentary in 2010 called Buddha in Suburbia. One of the centre’s volunteers, Connie Dusek, who is on holiday in Majorca, said today: ‘The bag has come back, but not the laptop. ’I think someone has taken it in order to sell it on. Underground staff at Baker Street received the bag back with the camera, passport and bunch of keys, but not the laptop he needs so desperately. Fascinating conversationalist: Lelung Rinpoche was so engrossed in his chat with Boris Johnson that he almost missed his stop and left his rucksack on train containing his laptop . ‘They have no information on the person who handed it in. Perhaps they did not see who it was.’Mr Johnson had been in Uxbridge to attend a political event. Mr Rinpoche, whose charity is offering a £500 reward for the laptop’s return, said: ‘I saw Boris on the train and he was two or three seats in front of me. Other people were having pictures with him, so I did too. ‘I thought he was a very modest person to take the tube and we talked about Tibet. Part-recovery: Underground staff at Baker Street (pictured) received Lelung Rinpoche's bag back with the camera, passport and bunch of keys, but not the laptop he needs so desperately . ’He said he really wanted to visit. When I got off the train, he waved at me and I went on my way.’ The Tibetan, who had been travelling back from registering the birth of his baby daughter, added:‘Some of the work has taken months and months, and have been taken from different books. ‘The laptop had two book’s worth of material, around 900 pages that I had collected from around the world. I had visited libraries in countries like Mongolia to try to find any pages they have. ‘The two books were nearly at a stage where I could publish them. But I have lost almost all of it.’","Lelung Rinpoche, 43,chatted with the mayor about Tibet .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Royal Bank of Scotland has been banned from paying bankers bonuses worth twice their salaries by the government. The Treasury said the huge payouts could not be made while the troubled lender was still part-owned by the taxpayer. But staff at RBS will still receive bonuses worth an entire year’s pay, and 77 people will be paid more than £1million. Royal Bank of Scotland has been blocked from doubling bonuses by the UK government . Under new European rules, banks can pay staff bonuses worth 100 per cent of salary. But to increase it to 200 per cent they must get the agreement of shareholders. In the case of part-nationalised RBS, the taxpayer is the largest shareholder, and the . UKFI, which manages the Treasury stake, has blocked the increase. The troubled bank reignited the row over pay in February when it revealed plans for huge bonuses, including £237million for its investment bankers, despite slumping into the red with an £8.2billion loss. At the time Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and, you know, it needs to continue to come down.’ George Osborne''s Treasury said it could not back bigger bonuses at RBS while it is still 'in recovery' Now RBS has warned that not being able to pay bigger bonuses will put it at a competitive disadvantage because staff could be lured to rival firms with the promise of bigger pay deals. It said: The board believes the best commercial solution for RBS is to have the flexibility on variable to fixed pay ratios that is now emerging as the sector norm. ‘This would also allow RBS to maintain the maximum amount of compensation that could be subject to performance conditions including clawback for conduct issues that may emerge in future. This position was understood during consultation with institutional shareholders.’ However a Treasury spokesman insisted there could be no rise in the bonus cap at RBS because the bank has not yet completed its restructuring and remains majority public-owned. The Treasury will not oppose a 2:1 bonus ratio at Lloyds Banking Group, in which it still has a 25 per cent stake, because the bank has largely completed its restructuring. It added that RBS's pay policies mean that the firm will remain a back-marker in its overall remuneration compared with other banks. The spokesman added: ‘We have made clear there will be no rise in the bonus cap for an RBS still in recovery, but a bonus cap at Lloyds that reflects the progress it has made in getting money back for taxpayers. ‘A few years ago, bonuses were out of control, banks needed bailing out and the economy was shrinking. ‘Under this Government's long-term economic plan bonuses are down, the banks are recovering and the economy is growing.’ The losses of the taxpayer-backed lender, which is just over 80 per cent owned by the Government, have widened significantly from £5.3billion in 2012. It includes  £3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal-related charges and a £4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘bad bank’. The EU bonus rules, which came into force on January 1, limit annual payouts for 2014 onwards to 100% of annual salary, or a maximum of 200% with shareholder approval. Despite using the rules to block bigger bonuses at RBS, the UK government officially opposes the policy . It claims the plan will not support stronger and safer banks and has launched a challenge to the rules in the European Court. Barclays yesterday won the support of shareholders for payments of up to 200 per cent of salary, while also introducing new role-based pay awards that mean staff can still pick up bumper handouts.","Treasury refuses to sanction pay-outs worth 200% of annual salary .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Daniel Martin . Created: . 19:52 EST, 20 February 2012 . Jobless people attending courses run by David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar  Emma Harrison were ordered to sign blank timesheets, it was alleged yesterday. Others complained of being forced to waste hours sitting doing nothing instead  of being allowed to look for gainful employment. A damning dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e has been handed to the Comptroller and Auditor General by former minister Fiona  Mactaggart. She is the Labour MP for Slough, Berkshire, where last week A4e's offices were  visited by police as part of a fraud probe. The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts  which A4e won to help the long-term unemployed find jobs. 'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets . Millionairess Mrs Harrison, 48 - made . families tsar by Mr Cameron after she  boasted she could help problem . families find work - triggered outrage when she  paid herself . £8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash. Ministers . have sought urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' of the . public purse, after Thames Valley Police were called in by the . Department of  Work and Pensions. Ms . Mactaggart's dossier contains accusations from constituents who were . made to  attend an A4e 'back to work' course as a condition of receiving . state benefits. One claimed: 'Every Friday, the ""clients"" have to sign a blank timesheet and  the times are filled in later. 'Members of my group were told to fill in a blank piece of paper outlining any  ""modules""...and to sign a blank ""review"". 'I would guess this was to fraudulently claim that all ""criteria"" as laid down  by the government was adhered to.' Another . complainant, a construction worker, said he had spent 13 weeks on an . A4e course supposedly to renew a forklift operator's licence yet had . 'received  no training at all', despite repeatedly asking for some. Attendance . on a back-to-work course is mandatory for the long-term unemployed  if . they want to keep being paid benefits, and companies such as A4e charge . taxpayers millions of pounds to run them. But a third person described a 'chaotic, unorganised' A4e course in which 'we  would mostly be shunted in and out of rooms, staring at walls, long silences  with none of the staff telling the group what was happening'. She told the MP her group was forced to 'learn' menial tasks such as how to  write a letter on a computer. She said: 'I did not learn anything that I did  not know already, and it is ridiculous and worrying that people like myself  should be forced into this position where I have a proven work history.' Last night Ms Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister and a member of the  influential Public Accounts Committee, said: 'I think there is a series of what  appears to me on the face of it to be fraudulent actions - expecting people to  sign blank time sheets and so on. Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to sack his 'back to work' tsar after a fraud probe was launched . 'It is in itself wrong to get vulnerable unemployed people to sign blank time  sheets, because this company is in the position where it has the power to put  people in breach of their Jobseekers' Allowance conditions. 'In my view, that makes A4e not fit to receive a government contract. The  government should absolutely consider suspending the contracts. 'The concerns that my constituents have raised are sufficient for me to believe  that they are not a proper company to get taxpayers' money and to be dealing  with vulnerable people.' The MP forwarded the complaints to Sir Amyas Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor  General - the head of the National Audit Office which scrutinises the accounts  of government departments and agencies. She demanded an investigation, telling him the cases seemed to be examples of  'A4e taking money from the Government without actually delivering anything  worthwhile'. Other MPs have attacked Mrs Harrison's vast dividend, which she paid herself  after A4e recorded a £234million turnover. A4e - which used to be called Action  For Employment - makes all its UK income from state contracts. Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, lives in a £7million country  mansion in Derbyshire with her husband Jim, their four children, and a group of  11 close friends and their six children in a 'posh commune'. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended . Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, yesterday  tabled a parliamentary question asking whether the Government would suspend the  company's contracts pending inquiries. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers visited the offices of A4e in  Slough as part of an allegation of fraud, which was referred to the Force by  the Department for Work and Pensions. The investigation is ongoing and at an  early stage, therefore we are currently unable to comment any further.' A4e said the police had only come in 'for a meeting' and had not taken away any  documents. It said the fraud probe concerned an isolated incident two years ago  relating to four employees who had since left the company, and that A4e had discovered the alleged fraud itself and reported it to the Department for Work  and Pensions within 48 hours. Last night an A4e spokesman insisted the concerns raised by Ms Mactaggart had  been resolved, saying: 'Under the new Work Programme, customers are no longer  required to fill out timesheets. 'All our staff have clear guidelines on how to complete claims made under Work  Programme and these claims are independently verified by the employer and by  JobCentre Plus. 'A4e has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour that might lead  to allegations of fraud. 'The concerns raised by Fiona Mactaggart's constituents are not linked to the  current Thames Valley Police investigation.'","Dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e .

"By . Matt Blake . One of Britain's most historic country mansions has gone on the market for a bargain £2.5 million. With its own minstrels' gallery, 18th century classical library and vast Italianate gardens, Apethorpe Hall has all the trappings of a palace fit for a king. But there is just one thing missing that no monarch could live without ... a throne of porcelain and a bath to match. The princely pile, near Oundle, Northamptonshire,  has no bathroom and carries a £100,000-a-year maintenance bill.

Ravaged by years of neglect with dry rot its only permanent resident, the Government spent over £4 million on pulling it back from the brink of ruin. The house was developed as the focal point and power base of leading Tudor and Jacobean families, closely involved with the Court of England's ruling monarchs for over 150 years from Edward IV to Charles I. The east wing: From the windows on this side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the procession announcing the arrival of Elizabeth I . Courtyard from the south: Experts estimate another £4 million is still needed to restore it to its full former glory . Originally built in 1470-80 by Sir Guy Wolston, who served as constable of the nearby royal castle at Fotheringhay, Esquire of the Body to Edward IV, and sheriff as well as MP for Northamptonshire. It then sold to Sir Walter Mildmay, an English statesman who would serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Queen Elizabeth I. It stayed in his family for 350 years. From the windows on the east side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the arrival of the Queen. Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road.

From the windows on the east side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the arrival of Elizabeth I. Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road. It was also a favourite haunt of monarchs James and Charles I who enjoyed magnificent feasts of venison and wine. James I himself is believed to have enjoyed homosexual trysts when he visited the home 10 times between 1614 and 1624. The restoration work uncovered a secret doorway leading from the king's bedchamber to the bedroom used by his 'sweetheart' and favourite courtier George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham. It was at Apethorpe Hall that the pair are thought to have met for the first time. Once described as Britain's most neglected Grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and a millionaire Libyan who fled the UK following the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher.

Once described as Britain's most neglected Grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and millionaire Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila. After the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher during the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984 Mr Burweila was among the many Libyans who fled the UK. He had been negotiating to sell the property to a consortium led by Harold Winton, the honorary life president of Queen's Park Rangers football club, which reportedly bought the property for £1.35 million. But two days later, on account of its dilapidation, the Department of Culture Media and Sport served the compulsory purchase order and took it off their hands. After years of wrangling and a lands tribunal, the Government was eventually forced to pay £3.18 million for the house. The house has been used for filming scenes of various television historical dramas as well as the 1984 film Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth. The latest sale has sparked anger amongst campaigners who have accused the Government of wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money by selling the house at a huge discount on what it originally paid for it. Emma Boon, Campaign Director of the Tax Payers’ Alliance said: 'It’s devastating that taxpayers have ended up paying millions only to see the property go back into private hands. 'This shows that Apethorpe should have been left to be restored properly by the property developer it was bought from in the first place. We all want to see historic buildings like this preserved as far as possible within reason,but this sorry saga means a huge loss to taxpayers at a time when the country can least afford it.' A spokesman for English Heritage said: 'Following many years of neglect and decay, Apethorpe Hall had fallen into a state of significant disrepair and was in danger of being lost forever. As the government’s protector of England’s unique legacy of historic buildings, it was crucial that English Heritage took action to save Apethorpe Hall before it was too late. 'Following service by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport of a full Repairs Notice in 2001 and a Compulsory Purchase Order in 2002, English Heritage took over the property in September 2004 and subsequently carried out a programme of major repairs.","Apethorpe Hall, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, was once a haunt of James I, Elizabeth I and Charles I .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Recovering: Springer spaniel Lilly, pictured with owner Zoe Flynn, is back at home recuperating after plummeting 80ft down a cliff . A brave springer spaniel is recovering at home after miraculously survivng a 80ft plunge off the edge of a rocky cliff. Lilly bolted off while on a walk with owner Viv Salisbury, crawling under a gap in some railings before plummeting down a steep rock face on the Kent coast at Broadstairs. Still holding on to the leads of her other three spaniels - Ozzie, four, Toby, two, and Milo, one - Ms Salisbury, 49, screamed for her husband Harold Acheson, 54. He ran towards the edge and was confronted with Lilly's lifeless body lying 80ft below. Making his way down the cliff, he feared the worse finding the spaniel lying on her side. But miraculously the stunned pooch survived the accident on April 18 with only a few scratches and bruises. Viv, a cook who walks her dogs daily along the beach said: 'We keep the others on a lead but we usually let her off. 'I yelled, ""Where's Lilly?"" when I realised she'd gone. 'I then noticed a gap in the railings and saw she must have gone through it and over the cliff. 'I thought there is no way she could have survived a fall like that. 'But, thankfully, she is very light and landed on sand. It was scary, we're so pleased she's alright.' Mr Acheson, a business owner, scooped a shocked Lilly up in his arms before putting her in their car and driving her straight to the vets. After a thorough check-up to see if she had broken any bones or suffered serious internal injuries Lilly was given the all-clear. Plunge: Owner Viv Salisbury said she was walking her four dogs at Broadstairs in Kent, when Lilly bolted, crawling through a gap in the railings outside The Captain Digby pub . Lifeless: Ms Salisbury screamed at her husband Harold Acheson, who ran down the cliff face where he was confronted with Lilly's lifeless body. He scooped her up and rushed her to the vets, where she was found to have suffered only a few scratches and bruising . Bruised and scratched: Mother-of-two Ms Salisbury, added: 'She is quite badly bruised and on morphine. 'But she's well on her way back to full health and it won't be long til she's bounding around again' The couple took her home to Rochester, Kent, where she was given painkillers and put to bed. Mother-of-two Ms Salisbury, added: 'She is quite badly bruised and on morphine. 'She gets restless and tries to jump around, but soon realises she can't do what she usually does at the moment. 'But she's well on her way back to full health and it won't be long til she's bounding around again. 'We like going to the coast because the dogs can go on the beach all the year round and they like to swim in the sea. 'Despite the shock of what has happened it would not put us off going there again. 'Being springer spaniels they are lively dogs but we shall be keeping a close eye on Lilly next time.'

Laura Potts, 25, from Cardiff, hated working out and had never lifted a dumbbell in her life before meeting muscle man Johnny Reid, also 25. But after falling for Johnny she started gym sessions because it was her only chance of seeing him. Teaching assistant, Laura Potts, 25, before she started bodybuilding (right); she now competes in competitions around the world (left) Body builders Laura Potts, 25, and Johnny Reid, 25, of Pontypridd . Laura said: 'Johnny trains three hours a day, seven days a week - he practically lives in the gym. 'He said the only way the relationship would work was if I had a go at bodybuilding too.' Now after a year of pumping Iron she is competing with Johnny in the World Amateur Body Building championship in Greece this summer. But before that the gym buddies have an ever bigger event - they are getting married in Las Vegas. Laura said: 'I was not into fitness and bodybuilding when I met Johnny a year ago. 'On the rare occasions that I did go to the gym I'd go straight for a McDonald's afterwards. Laura, pictured before she started bodybuilding, and her boyfriend are planning to get married . 'But I wanted to spend more time with Johnny so I decided to join the gym and bodybuild with him. 'It wasn't easy to start with and the dedication required is immense - but I love Johnny so much and I will do anything for him.' Laura and design engineer Johnny compete as a team and have already won two major body building titles. The pair are competing in the World Amateur Body Building championship in Greece this summer . They are both on strict diets of four boiled eggs for breakfast, nuts, egg and meat for lunch and protein pancakes for tea. Laura drinks six litres of water a day and no alcohol or tea, coffee, fizzy drinks, dairy or wheat is allowed. She says: 'Once a week we have a cheat night and will have burger and chips or a curry but other than that we keep strictly to our diet.'

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Driven by jealousy and hurt pride': Harpreet Singh, 25, sent nearly 400 'threatening' text messages to Elaine Tilbury, 20, after she dumped him . A Met special constable bombarded his ex-girlfriend with hundreds of texts branding her a slut when she broke up with him. Harpreet Singh, 25, sent nearly 400 'threatening and distressing' text messages to Elaine Tilbury, 20, after she dumped him because he was controlling and needy, a court heard. Miss Tilbury was left 'scared and intimidated' and was too frightened to leave the house during his campaign of harassment. Singh, who was a civilian worker with the Central Communications Command at the Met and also served as a special constable in Wandsworth, was yesterday found guilty of one count of harassment. The pair had begun their relationship when Singh was working as a security officer in Debenhams. The fling continued after he began working with the Metropolitan Police, but Miss Tilbury eventually broke it off last year. 'Driven by jealousy and hurt pride,' Singh began bombarding the young woman with 'unpleasant' texts, including threats such as saying things will 'end up nasty' between them. A judge dismissed Singh's claims in court that he thought their relationship was still alive and that she was 'happy to' get the messages from him. Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Singh remained impassive and stared at the ground as the verdict was given at Wimbledon Magistrates Court yesterday. District Judge Barbara Barnes said: 'This case concerns two people in a volatile relationship that turned sour. 'Elaine Tilbury was credible and compelling in what she explained. She was a young woman trying to extract herself from a relationship. 'There was communication between her and you and that several texts from you that I find to be unpleasant in nature. 'The content of these messages was threatening and distressing. 'Scared and intimidated': Miss Tilbury was too scared to leave home during Singh's campaign of harassment . 'I considered your evidence. You . expressed your view that you thought the relationship was still going on . so Ms Tilbury happy to receive text messages from you. 'You said you were trying to salvage the relationship. I find your evidence was not compelling. 'You . were not prepared to accept the relationship was over and as a result . resorted to sending numerous messages driven by jealousy and hurt pride. 'Your whole behaviour here does amount to harassment. Ms Tilbury didn't want to receive this volume of contact from you. 'You knew or ought to have known this was harassment. 'Driven by jealousy and hurt pride': Miss Tilbury began receiving the 'unpleasant' text messages from . Singh, . including threats such as saying things will 'end up nasty', after she broke off their relationship last year . 'Sending such messages saying things will 'end up nasty' is threatening and abusive and the sheer volume of the texts is such that you ought to have known it amounted to harassment. 'Ms Tilbury was scared. She was scared, intimidated and reluctant to leave the house ... you are guilty of the offence.' Singh, of Ilford, Essex, was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced at the same court on May 16.","Harpreet Singh, 25, sent Elaine Tilbury, 20, texts labelling her a slut .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Diabolical: Tracey Murfitt, 47, was shocked when hospital security guards threatened to call the police, accusing her of stealing hospital electricity when she plugged her phone in to charge . A patient was threatened with arrest while sitting in a hospital waiting room after security guards claimed charging her phone was tantamount to theft. Tracey Murfitt, 47, plugged her Samsung Galaxy S4 in to charge at Southend Hospital's A&E department, so she could call a friend to warn them she had been admitted. But security staff who witnessed Ms Murfitt connecting up her charger threatened to call the police about the matter. Ms Murfitt, from Leigh in Essex, was left stunned by the heavy-handed threats used by hospital staff. She said: 'All of a sudden I was approached by security staff telling me they were going to call the police for stealing hospital electricity. 'I couldn’t believe it - it was absolutely diabolical. 'They said I could use a hospital phone, but I had to charge my mobile phone to get the number.' Ms Murfitt was rushed to hospital by ambulance at around 2pm on April 10. She suffers from diabetic gastroparesis and anemia often leading to extended spells in hospital at short notice. The chronic illnesses are so severe they have left her unable to work and often lead to uncontrollable bouts of sickness. The ambulance she arrived in was . forced to queue at the hospital before she was placed in a  wheelchair . in a busy waiting room with nurses warning her she could face up to a . five-hour wait. During the wait she was violently sick due to her anaemia and became concerned no one knew she had been admitted to hospital. The . grandmother-of-two explained: 'I asked the nurse if there was somewhere . I could plug my phone in to quickly to make a quick call but they said I . wasn't allowed. 'It was emergency as I needed to let someone know I was at hospital and my daughter was on  holiday so I did it anyway. Emergency: The grandmother-of-two was rushed to Southend Hospital after falling ill diagnosed with diabetic gastroparesis and anemia. She said she plugged her phone into charge in the A&E waiting room so she could tell her friend and family she had been admitted to hospital . 'The . security guard came over and said: ""Miss, if you don't unplug the phone . and turn it off you could be arrested for stealing NHS electricity"". 'I thought he was joking as it sounded so ridiculous. 'He carried on though but I ignored him and eventually managed to ring my daughter's mother-in-law. 'She came and picked me up as I just thought I'm not going to sit here after all of that.' Ms Murfitt's condition worsened overnight and she was readmitted to hospital the next day. Following a week-long stay in hospital, including blood and iron transfusions, she is now recovering at home. She said: 'It is very frustrating as all this could have been avoided if I had been admitted immediately. 'My GP had told me I should get an ambulance to hospital and my medical background is in my notes. 'I had been ill all day on the Thursday so I never even noticed my phone battery had died. 'I never realised it was going to cause such a problem at the hospital.' A spokeswoman for the hospital said: 'We are sorry Ms Murfitt is unhappy with the service she received and we invite her to contact us directly to talk about her concerns.'

"By . Wills Robinson . A mother who stopped the execution of her son's killer as the noose was placed around his neck has described how the rage 'vanished from heart' as she slapped him. Alinejad Hosseinzadeh, whose son Abdollah, 18, was murdered in a street fight, has described how she wanted her son's killer to die up until the final moments of his life. She said the teenager, who died seven years ago, appeared to her in a dream 10 days before the execution and begged her to have mercy on his killer, known as Balal. Last minute reprieve: Alinejad Hosseinzadeh slaps her son's killer after granting him clemency moments before he was supposed to be executed . Act of mercy: The victim's parents take the noose off the convict's neck after sparing his life, however, under Iranian law, the family does not have any say in the killer's jail sentence . Alinejad was supposed to kick the chair . away from under him, but in a dramatic last minute reprieve, asked the . rope to be removed and slapped him. Her husband Abdolghan quickly lifted the noose and he was pardoned. Alinejad described how her son appeared in a . dream ten days before the execution, asking her to spare his life. He . then appeared eight days later, but refused to talk to her. Speaking to The Guardian, she said her decision to spare the killer's life did not come until moments before he was scheduled to die. 'I stood very firm in my belief that I want him punished, so they didn't expect me to forgive,' she said. United by grief and joy: The convict's mother is embraced by the sobbing woman whose teenager was stabbed to death by her son after her incredible act of forgiveness . The Iranian man was due to have the chair that he was standing on kicked away from under him by the dead man's parents . Premonition: The victim's mother (pictured) had a change of heart after her dead son appeared to her in a dram . 'Balal was naive. He didn't want to kill, it wasn't in his nature, he was angry in seconds and had a knife in his hand. 'All these years, I felt like a moving dead body. But now, I feel very calm, I feel I'm at peace. I feel that vengeance has left my heart.' After the noose was removed, Balal's mother, Kobra, reached across the fence surrounding the execution site and hugged the victim's mother. She then went to kiss Alinejad's feet, but the victim's mother stopped her saying 'she is a mother just like me'. The victim's father, Abdolghani . Hosseinzadeh, revealed his wife's actions were even more remarkable because they had lost another son in a motorbike crash when he was just 11 years old. Despite the reprieve, Balal is still in jail. Under Iranian law, the victim's family can save a killer's life but cannot spare his prison term. Pleas: People in the crowd shouted to the victim's family to forgive the killer and spare him from death . Spared: The killer, known as Balal, was sentenced to death for stabbing the 18-year-old victim during a street fight years ago .","Alinejad Hosseinzadeh gave killer, known as Balal, a last minute reprieve .

"Published: . 16:47 EST, 25 April 2014 . | . Updated: . 16:47 EST, 25 April 2014 . Like the 'selfie' or searching for one’s own name on Google, it has become something of an irresistible – and very modern – pastime. A study claims that we have become a nation of property price junkies, increasingly addicted to checking the value of our own homes. The phenomenon is now so widespread it has been dubbed the new ‘property porn’ – and, for some homeowners, has even become a daily obsession. The average estate agency branch has just 42 homes to sell compared to 100 homes in 2008 . Up to a quarter in some parts of the country religiously check and recalculate the value of their property every week on the internet. In total, almost a third who own a property check its worth at least once every two months, an ICM survey found. Experts said with house prices now so variable, homeowners are becoming increasingly paranoid about getting a bad deal should they decide to move. But for the most part, they are addicted to the thrill of discovering the price of their home has gone up. ‘Monitoring property prices is a bit like watching bamboo grow. You can see it shooting up in front of you,’ said estate agent Russell Quirk. ‘As property prices rocket, homeowners are becoming addicted to finding out how much asset-richer they are getting. It’s a new variant of property porn.’ Feeding homeowners’ ‘addiction’ are the increasingly easy methods to get a reliable indicator of values, such as property websites, smartphone apps and the Land Registry. The National Association of Estate Agents say the housing market is being crippled by the lack of available homes to buy . This is reflected in the huge traffic to websites such as Zoopla, which attracts 20million visits per month. It and the two other biggest such sites, Rightmove and Prime Location, are used by 61 per cent of house hunters. The survey, commissioned by online estate agents eMoov, found 30 per cent of homeowners across the UK check the value of their property once every two months. Among male homeowners, the figure is 34 per cent. The most obsessed live in London, where 57 per cent check every two months and 24 per cent recheck the prices every week. The next most obsessed region is the North East, where 36 per cent check the values every two months and nine per cent every week. Research manager Robert Cross, from Forest Gate, East London, said he looks at the value of his home as often as every day. ‘I bought my three-bedroom property in 2011 for £285,000. The price has risen by about £90,000,’ he said. ‘I check every day in my lunch break. It helps me work out changes to our equity.’ Jane Holbrook, a recruiter, said: ‘We bought a two-bedroom flat in London in early 2007 for £290,000. I probably re-calculate the value every week or two. In this market it can become a bit addictive.’","Survey by ICM shows around a third of owners check every other month .

"By . Richard Spillett . Christopher Brassington caused £120,000 of damage to Rinaldi's restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire after hearing claims the owner was seeing his wife . A jilted boyfriend who drunkenly ploughed a truck into a restaurant - after hearing a rumour the owner was seeing his ex - has been spared jail. Christopher Brassington, 39, flew into a rage after hearing the mother of his children may have started a relationship with Glyn Margrave, the owner of Rinaldi's Italian restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Leeds Crown Court heard that former property developer Brassington snatched a friend's truck and caused over £120,000 of damage to the eaterie on January 7 last year after downing six pints of lager. Matthew Harding, prosecuting, told the court that Brassington heard the rumour during an pub drinking session with his former business partner Nigel Coxan. Leaving the bar, Brassington jumped into the driver's seat of Mr Coxan's Toyota Hilux and drove to the restaurant, while his friend pleaded with him to stop. Brassington then revved the engine and smashed it into the building, shattering glass and bulldozing chairs and tables inside, before it was stopped by a supporting post. Johnny Watson, representing Brassington at an earlier hearing, claimed his client had not acted out of jealousy, but was having mental health problems. He said: 'This is a bizarre entirely freakish incident which seems to have almost been taken from a Quentin Tarantino movie.' Although Brassington, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, admitted criminal damage, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving with excess alcohol, a judge deferred sentencing for six months to give him time to address his problems. And at Leeds Crown Court yesterday, Judge Neil Clark was told that Brassington had got psychiatric help, stopped drinking and stayed out of trouble. The pick-up screeched through the restaurant, smashing glass and scattering tables and chairs . The court heard Brassington was attempting a three-point turn in the devastated eatery before he was stopped by police . The owner of the truck, Brassington's friend Nigel Coxan, was screaming at him to stop, the court heard . Judge Clark told Brassington that the previous judge in the case indicated that he would not jail him immediately if he had got help and he would honour that promise. He handed Brassington a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision and an 18 months driving disqualification. During the hearing in October, prosecutor Mr Harding had told how, on the night in question: 'His friend said that the mother of the defendant's children was believed to be having a relationship with an individual that owned a local restaraunt, Rinaldi's. 'Mr Coxan said that he believed the defendant was aware of the relationship. He [Brassington] was surprised but not upset.' Brassington (pictured above right and below) had heard restaurant owner Glyn Margrave (above left) was seeing his ex-girlfriend before he took the vehicle, the court was told . The court heard how Coxan was sat in the passenger's seat screaming while the jilted lover committed his revenge. The prosecutor said: 'He was relieved to see the restaurant was in darkness. The defendant went to the adjacent car park, facing the restaurant. He reversed the car about five metres. 'He said the only words he spoke during the journey were ""I'm sorry"". Then he accelerated towards the window. 'Mr Coxan was screaming. He recalled the defendant screaming. He remembers glass smashing and tables and chairs within the restaurant scattering. The restaurant was left picking up the bill after the smash in January last year . Brassington got a suspended sentence this week after a judge heard he has since stopped drinking and sought psychiatric help . 'The defendant drove four to five metres inside the restaurant before hitting a supporting post which stopped the vehicle.' Mr Harding said that Brassington then appeared to attempt a three-point turn. Police later arrived and pulled him out the car window before he held out his hands 'as if he was going to be handcuffed'. The court previously heard Brassington had built a million pound property portfolio in the 1990s before suffering a mental breakdown. At the time of the incident, he was also receiving psychiatric treatment, following the collapse of his business and a series of debts and financial hardship, the court heard.","Christopher Brassington furious at hearing restauranteur seeing his ex .

The 41-year-old veteran TV host tweeted to her followers Thursday: 'Today is my final round of chemotherapy. I wanted to share this moment with you to encourage anyone facing this battle.' The message was accompanied by a collage of photographs from the past six months depicting Robach counting down with her fingers the number of remaining chemo sessions. Mission accomplished: Good Morning America presenter Amy Robach tweeted this collage showing her counting down with her fingers the number of chemo sessions that were in store for her . Celebratory tweet: Robach, 41, accompanied the image with a message announcing that on Thursday she had her eighth and final chemo session . A short time later, Robach shared another picture with her 51,000 Twitter followers featuring her front door plastered with colorful drawings and encouraging messages from her large family congratulating her on the medical milestone. 'This was sight for sore eyes... The best welcome home ever,' Robach wrote, adding the hashtag '#nomorechemo# . Robach has taken over the anchor job following the sudden departure of Josh Elliott in late March. Warm welcome: The mother to two young girls and step-mother to three boys was greeted with drawings and sweet missives attached to her front door . Fighter: Amy Robach, pictured left with fellow GMA anchor Lara Spencer, is turning to work to distract her from her chemotherapy treatments following her breast cancer diagnosis last year . 'Amy considers getting up every morning . and having something to look forward to a gift,' a source told People magazine earlier this month. 'It's a much needed . distraction from her treatment.' Robach, a mother to two young girls and a step-mother to three boys, was diagnosed with breast cancer last October after undergoing a mammogram for Good Morning America. She discovered she had a . malignant tumor in her right breast, and it was only after she had a double mastectomy that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some . abnormal cells in the left breast. After . the surgery, it also became clear that the disease had spread to her . sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the magic bullet. Shock: She was diagnosed with cancer after undergoing an on-air mammogram last October . But amid the treatments, she has stayed positive by focusing on her work. 'Feeling like I have a purpose is very . helpful,' she told the magazine. 'Mentally I feel stronger, knowing I'm still me. I . still have my job. My life isn't just cancer, so it's very important for . me to try and get my butt up.' She returned to the air in December and after cutting her hair short on air, she went to Sochi to cover the Olympics while undergoing chemo. She told the magazine that she takes naps to keep up but that it can sometimes takes several days 'to get my mojo back'. Preparation: She was filmed chopping off her locks as she started undergoing chemotherapy . Strong: Robach, showing off her new hair, has barely missed a day from work, sources have said . With her final chemo treatment now behind her, Robach will undergo breast reconstruction later this spring. Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were. They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.","GMA news anchor, 41, was diagnosed with breast cancer last October after undergoing a routine mammogram on air .

Described as 'a hug' by the magazine, the stray arm was dubbed 'awkward' by one user and 'not appropriate' by another. Others said: 'What is it with our PMs touching up royalty!' and 'What a creep'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jewish students at New York University have been targeted by a pro-Palestinian group that reportedly slipped 'eviction' notices under the doors of several Jewish students in one of the university's Greenwich Village residents halls last week. 'If you do not vacate the premise by midnight on 25 April, 2014 we . reserve the right to destroy all remaining belongings. We cannot be held . responsible for property or persons remaining inside the premises,' the fake eviction slips read. The NYU student group Students for Justice in Palestine have taken credit for notices, which came with a disclaimer at the bottom stating, 'this is not an eviction notice,' and explaining that the notices were meant to draw attention to the group's claim that the Israeli government issues similar eviction notices to Palestinians living in Israel. Phony: These phony eviction notices were slid under the doors of several of NYU's Jewish students . NYU's Palladium residence hall on 14th Street in Manhattan reportedly was targeted because of its large Jewish population . The pro-Palestinian group targeted the NYU resident housing facility Palladium, on East 14th Street in Manhattan, because it is believed to house a lot of NYU's Jewish students, the Times of Israel reports - according to the paper, the building even has elevators that operate without buttons for students acknowledging the Sabbath. A spokesman for NYU says the prank crossed a line. 'It is disappointingly inconsistent with standards we expect to prevail . in a scholarly community,' spokesman John Beckman told the New York Post. 'Our Residence Life and Housing . Office will be communicating with the students in the dorm, looking . into the matter, and following up appropriately.' According to Beckman, it's unclear why the group targeted the Palladium dorms. Credit: The student group Students for Justice in Palestine have taken credit for the 'eviction' notices . 'However, were it to be the case that the fliering was done there . because it was perceived to be a dorm with a higher proportion of Jewish . students, that would be troubling, dismaying and a matter of deep . concern for our community,' Beckman said.

'This is a major heroin seizure, which has removed a major source of funding from terrorist criminal networks,' said the ship's commanding officer Commander Terry Morrison. The coup came as part of the joint . operation's bid to preserve order in a huge region spanning the Red Sea, . Gulf of Aden, Arabian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and the Gulf of . Oman. The area includes the waters off . Somalia's Horn of Africa, which have been blighted by piracy including . several high-profile hijackings of British yachts. Coup: The bales of heroin are lifted onboard HMAS Darwin on Wednesday . Kenyan defence spokesman Bogita Ongeri told Nigeria's Saturday Nation that the haul was not seized within Kenya’s territorial waters. 'I can authoritatively say that the seizure of such heroin never happened within our Exclusive Economic Zone,' he said. 'We are doing daily surveillance within our territorial waters and we have not received such a report.' News agencies described the vessel as a dhow, a traditional African and Middle Eastern sailing boat, although no sails were erected when it was photographed by the Australian Navy. There has been a surge in the volumes of heroin trafficked through eastern Africa in the past few years, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Heroin is typically routed through the region - known for its porous borders and weak maritime surveillance - from Pakistan and Iran on its way to Europe. More illegal narcotics were seized in Africa in the first five months of 2013 than in the previous two years, the UNODC said. This month, a Canadian battleship patrolling the Indian Ocean seized 130kg of heroin from a dhow 100 nautical miles east of Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, and last year a Canadian warship confiscated 500kg of heroin from a dhow more than 300 nautical miles off Zanzibar. The southwestern Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden are also used by bands of pirates from Somalia, as well as human traffickers. CMF cooperates with the European Union's maritime force EUNavfor in the region as well as NATO naval forces.

"By . Sam Webb . and Rebecca Camber . Emotional phone messages in which Home Secretary David Blunkett told his married lover that she was ‘breaking his heart’ were intercepted, recorded and stored by the News of the World, a court heard yesterday. Tapes of the ‘deeply personal and intrusive’ voicemails – taken from the hacked phone of Mr Blunkett’s lover Kimberly Quinn, with whom he had a three-year affair – were found hidden in a safe, the Old Bailey was told. Police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from Mr Blunkett and associates. Heartbreak: In the messages, Mr Blunkett was said to have repeatedly declared his love for Ms Quinn as she tried to break off their affair . In some, Mr Blunkett asked Mrs Quinn, . the then publisher of the Spectator magazine, not to end their . relationship, which is thought to have begun in 2001. In . one recording the Labour politician says: ‘You are breaking my heart.’ In others, he tells Mrs Quinn, now 52, that he ‘yearns’ and ‘longs’ for . her. Referring to messages . left on July 19, 2004, Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘There are . messages in which Mr Blunkett expresses his love. She was ending the . affair and he was distressed about it.’ Mrs . Quinn’s voicemail messages also included ones left by Simon Hoggart, a . Guardian journalist and contributor to The Spectator, with whom she was . also said to be having an affair. One . bundle of tapes were found at the house of the News of the World’s . private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, and another duplicate set was in . the safe of the tabloid’s legal manager Tom Crone, the court heard. Also . in the safe was a draft article by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, . who nicknamed Mr Blunkett ‘Noddy’ and his lover ‘Big Ears’. The article claims Mr Blunkett was left ‘devastated’ when Mrs Quinn ended their affair in 2004. In . his draft for a story that the News of the World ran on August 15, . 2004, exposing their affair, Thurlbeck wrote: ‘Noddy and Big Ears have . been having an affair since July 2001. The exact date it started is to . be pinned down. ‘In a . message left at 11.48am on July 22, 2004, Noddy says, “I just yearn for . you. It was a very different meal and a very different journey to this . exact Thursday three years ago. Oh, what can happen in three years. I . still long for you though”. ‘We are supposing that July 22, 2004, is the third anniversary of their meeting, having dinner, kiss etc.’ Blunkett and Ms Quinn, the publisher of the Spectator Magazine, were accused by the News of the World in August 2004 of having a three-year affair, printed after Coulson confronted the senior politician . Thurlbeck . went on: ‘Reading the message, they are clearly splitting up after a . three-year affair. This has been instigated by Big Ears. Noddy is . devastated and is seeking a meeting as soon as possible. He is at an . address of a country home . ‘She . is about to leave for another place in the country. I have a possible . address for her there and we have bikes and cars on her round the . clock.’ Thurlbeck’s memo . revealed that reporters were carrying out extensive surveillance on the . couple: ‘There is a meeting scheduled for Wednesday August 11 AM. No . further details on where. But if it is brought forward, we are in a good . position to catch it.’ The court heard several drafts of the expose on Mr Blunkett's affair drafted by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck were found in the safe . A few days after the News of the World exclusive about their affair, The Sun ran a story revealing that Mrs Quinn was pregnant. The . court also heard that Thurlbeck, who has admitted phone hacking, . suspected Mrs Quinn had a third suitor at the time known only as Mr X. But . his memo suggested she was giving the ‘cold shoulder’ to the mystery . man, who had a long-term partner, so he was not pursued by the tabloid. The . then editor of the paper, Andy Coulson, confronted Mr Blunkett about . the fling before the story was printed. In a tape of a meeting played to . the jury, Coulson said: ‘People know about this affair. I’m not saying . it’s an open secret, but people are aware of it.’ Mr Blunkett refused to . confirm or deny it as his private life was ‘not fair game’. The court heard phone records showed that on that day Coulson was in contact with Rebekah Brooks, then the editor of The Sun. It . was also said Mr Blunkett’s hacked voicemails included one about a . party he went to hosted by Mrs Brooks to celebrate her then husband Ross . Kemp’s 40th birthday. Brooks and Coulson, both 45, deny conspiring with others to hack phones. The case continues. England boss Sven Goran Eriksson refused to use mobile phones to contact his secret lover because he believed his phones were being tapped, the Old Bailey heard today. The Swede told lover Faria Alam of his fears and would only call her using a landline towards the end of their affair. Ms Alam said in a statement read to the jury: ‘We were in contact until July 2005, but it was done by landline telephone because Sven believe his telephone had been tapped.’ This came after a torrent of publicity of their affair sparked by a News of the World expose allegedly fueled by phone hacking. The Old Bailey was told that Sven Goran Eriksson, pictured appearing on This Morning today, had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager . The court heard The News of the World hacked into his voicemails and stumbled on him being offered a place on Italy’s version of Big Brother. The 65-year-old admitted being tempted by the reality TV when he quit as manager of the national team in summer 2006. The alleged hacking of Eriksson's phone in 2004 happened in the run up to the NoTW expose of his affair with FA secretary Miss Alam . Glenn Mulcaire, a private . investigator for the News of the World, had a recording of the message, . left in Italian, when his flat was raided by police in August 2006. The Old Bailey heard this was key evidence to prove Mr Eriksson had been a hacking target for the disgraced tabloid paper. It is alleged Mr Eriksson was hacked repeatedly between 2004 and 2006 by Muclaire, including on the eve of the first game of the 2006 World Cup. The alleged hacking of Eriksson’s phone in 2004 happened in the run up to the NoTW expose of his affair with FA secretary Miss Alam. In her statement to the court, Ms Alam confirmed her address, phone number, and voicemail PIN numbers were in Mulcaire’s notes. She told the court: ‘In my first week at the FA, England coach Sven Goran Eriksson started to pursue me. ‘Eventually I went to lunch with him at Kettner’s restaurant. We went there three times and Sven would have us dine in a private dining room. ‘I was impressed, I would sat at the office I was going for a long lunch.’ She said the affair continues with romps at Eriksson’s home in Regent’s Park and became ‘more intense’. When the football coach returned from Euro 2004, he was told the Italian media knew of the affair. ‘I freaked out’, she said. ‘I told him to leave me and don’t make contact.’ Faria Alam received £300,000 to sell her story to two Sunday newspapers, a jury has been told. Alam began an affair with Eriksson while working as a secretary at the FA and the Old Bailey has heard 'first details' emerged when the News of the World hacked their phones. After she was fired because of the relationship in September 2004, publicist Max Clifford cut a deal for the News of the World and Mail on Sunday to give her £150,000 each for her side of the story, the court heard.

"By . Neil Ashton . John Terry is ready to accept a one-year contract at Chelsea if it means prolonging his playing career at Stamford Bridge. The club captain, showing some of the best form of his career, comes to the end of his current five-year, £150,000-a-week deal in June. Terry, 33, had wanted a two-year deal, but was told Chelsea policy for players over the age of 30 is to offer only 12 months. He has accepted this and is hoping to start his 17th season as a professional with Chelsea in August. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho reveal who gave Chelsea's pre-match pep talk . Staying? John Terry could be about to sign a one-year contract extension with Chelsea . Form: Terry (left) has been playing some of his best ever football for Chelsea this season .

JAMIE STRONACH . The centre back, the last Chelsea player to establish himself in the first team having come through the academy, is already in line to be the club’s player of the year. It is even possible Terry will be PFA player of the year. Voting for the award takes place next month. He was outstanding in the 1-0 victory at Manchester City on Monday and has played every minute of all 24 Barclays Premier League fixtures under Jose Mourinho. The manager has assured Terry his contract will be taken care of by the summer, but the defender wants the situation resolved before then. Terry’s appetite to continue at Chelsea can only have been strengthened by the victory at the Etihad, which highlighted Mourinho’s tactical genius and unmatched attention to detail. For two days solid, he walked and talked his team through his plans for City. These are the games Mourinho craves, the special occasions with a cup-tie feel. Chelsea’s players, along with those he left behind at Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, will tell you that he is at his best in these moments. Even when Mourinho took his squad into the media auditorium to run them through some video grabs, the bit every player hates, they listened intently. Tactician: Mourinho masterminded an impressive Chelsea victory against Manchester City . Strike: Branislav Ivanovic scored Chelsea's winner to hand his team a 1-0 win against City . They wanted to nick a result at City, just as they had when they beat Manuel Pellegrini’s team 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Instead it was a performance of shock and awe, laced with enormous belief. The 1-0 scoreline did not do it justice. Much of Mourinho’s work is bluff but no-one can dispute his success. Can you imagine David Moyes pulling a stunt such as passing on the pre-match team talk to a masseur? Of course not. But that is what Mourinho did, handing over responsibilities to Billy McCulloch in the minutes before kick-off. Nothing would give the Chelsea manager greater pleasure than to win a third league title at Stamford Bridge but victory against a City team scoring goals for fun - and with 11 straight wins at home - probably just makes it into his top 10 all-time results. Mourinho’s capacity to shock, as he did with Porto when Costinha’s added-time goal knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2004, is one of his strengths. Big game: Mourinho celebrates Porto knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2004 . Talent: Eden Hazard (centre) is quickly becoming one of the best players in the Premier League . Solid: Mourinho's Chelsea team look more powerful with new signing Nemanja Matic (above) in midfield . A few months later Mourinho engineered the destruction of Monaco in the final when Porto ran out 3-0 winners in Gelsenkirchen. As Mourinho closed in on his second European Cup in 2010, Dutch ace Wesley Sneijder gave the performance of his career to help Inter win 1-0 on the manager’s return to Stamford Bridge. Then, in the final at the Bernabeu, Louis van Gaal was lured into Mourinho’s trap by focusing Bayern Munich’s energies on nullifying Samuel Eto’o. The striker agreed to sacrifice himself and his forward partner Diego Milito scored twice to win Inter the trophy. Mourinho trusts his methods and repeats training-ground drills until players match his demands. Those exercises were not a lot of fun for Chelsea this week, but the manager knew they were necessary before facing a team with a goalscoring record at home that now reads: 4, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4… and 0. Inspired: Mourinho claimed Chelsea masseur Billy McCulloch (left) gave the team talk ahead of the City match . ‘We prepared very well,’ said Nemanja Matic, who got to grips with the drifting runs of David Silva in the first half. ‘The coach showed us some videos of City and of course they showed their quality but also their mistakes. The preparation was very good and of big quality.’ On Saturday, more than 48 hours before kick-off, Mourinho’s players couldn’t work out his team or the system he was likely to employ. Willian, though, looked certain to be . out, with Ramires taking his place on the right. Either Mourinho changed . his mind or he only made a decision when he called his team together at . their Manchester hotel at noon on Monday. ‘We have more confidence now because it is not easy to play Manchester City,’ added Matic. ‘We can prepare for any team.’ With Mourinho in charge, Chelsea have the measure of most of them. Anything for you, boss: Samuel Eto'o sacrificed a forward role to play from the wing for Mourinho at Inter Milan .","John Terry currently on £150,000 a week at Stamford Bridge .

"By . John Stevens . A district nurse put an elderly man on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway at his home without any consultation with his family, it was claimed last night. Thomas James, 90, had cancer but insisted he was not ready to die until after his granddaughter's wedding. But he passed away at home after he was given sedatives by the nurse who allegedly claimed that the drug was just to calm him, and reassured his family that it would not make him sleepy. Debbie Croston from Braintree, Essex, with her father Thomas James, who died on the Liverpool Care Pathway at his home . The next day they were unable to wake him to give him food or drink and he fell into a diabetic coma. His daughter demanded that he was taken off the drug, but he died ten days later, on October 8, from pneumonia. Last night Mr James's family told how he was determined to go to the wedding and had picked out a red tie to match the bridesmaids' dresses just days before he died. The former trombone maker and soldier in the Royal Engineers, who lived near Braintree in Essex, had stomach cancer and diabetes, but was still active and going to the shops on his mobility scooter in the week before he was put on the Pathway. His family have made a formal complaint to their NHS Trust. They believe that he was put on the Pathway and given an end-of-life drug without proper informed consultation and that as a result his death was hastened. Ironically, the family had chosen to have him treated at home as they believed doctors had tried to put him on the Pathway in hospital two years earlier after he had a leg amputated. (File picture) Controversial: The LCP is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment . The Liverpool Care Pathway, which can involve the sedation of patients and the withdrawal of foods and fluids, is designed to ease the suffering of dying patients in their final hours. But the Mail has highlighted several cases where relatives have not been consulted about the use of the procedure or where patients have turned out not be terminally ill and have gone on to live for up to two years after being taken off the Pathway. Mr Thomas's daughter Debbie Croston, 50, said: 'He had a reason to live as my daughter is getting married at Christmas and that was why all he wanted was to survive until December 29. 'It's all he mentioned. We went out and bought his tie just before he died. He felt rough but he said, “I'm going to be here whatever happens”. He was determined to be there for her and it was snatched away.' Mr James was receiving care from district nurses at his home and was being treated with antibiotics for a chest infection. 'They need to start actually caring for people. Everybody makes out we're such a caring society, but we're not.' Mrs Croston . During one visit a nurse asked to speak to him alone and got him to sign a DNR (do not resuscitate) form. She then suggested that she give him an extra drug. Mrs Croston said: 'She said, “I've thought of something else that will make him more comfortable”. I told her that he's not uncomfortable, he's just sitting in the kitchen sleeping, he is 90. But she said, “No, I think I'm going to put this drug Midazolam in”. 'I asked what it was and she gave us a thing to read and we saw it was a sedative and told her we didn't want him to be more tired. But she said, “No, I can absolutely assure you it's not a sedative, all it's going to do is keep him calm at the dose we use”. 'Not once did they say to me about the Liverpool Care Pathway, that this was it. 'That night he had his  dinner and ate some sausages and went to bed. 'Next morning I rang his carer to see how he was and she said that they were struggling to wake him up. He was almost gone, you could not wake him up, he was just slipping into a coma.' Mrs Croston ordered the nurses to take him off the Midazolam and he roused so they could give him tablets and dextrose mixed with fromage frais. But after nurses found out that the family were feeding him, they told them to stop and one wrote in his notes: 'Up against the wall with this family'. When the family refused to let nurses administer the drug again, they say one told them: 'To be honest, it's my decision, not yours'. Mr James was no longer given any sedatives, but his family say it was too late. Mrs Croston said: 'He never recovered properly, his lungs filled up with fluid as he could no longer get out of bed and he died of pneumonia.' Mrs Croston, who owns a hotels business with her husband, said: 'Midazolam is an end-of-life drug. Once people have it they don't come back from it, and they were so insistent on giving it. 'They just wanted to finish him off as he was a drain on resources, I suppose. 'I'm convinced he would have made the wedding. I'm not saying he would have been well afterwards, he could have gone the next week, but there's no way he was ready to go on that Friday when they put that stuff in his arm.' Mr James's family had wanted him to be treated at home after they claim doctors tried to put him on the Liverpool Care Pathway two years earlier after he had his leg amputated when he was put on morphine and had his drip taken away. Mrs Croston said: 'You think we're safe at home. We'd fought tooth and nail not for him to go to hospital because you don't know if he'd come out. Yet they got rid of him at home. 'People say he was incredibly old, and he was, but that does not give them the right to decide when their life is finished. 'Once their last breath has gone out of their body that's it, you can't bring them back. If I'd known it was a natural end, it was his time to go, it would have been easier to accept. 'They need to start actually caring for people. Everybody makes out we're such a caring society, but we're not.' Jane Hentley, director of nursing at Central Essex Community Services, said: 'We would like to offer our condolences to the family at this sad time. 'Central Essex Community Services is taking this case very seriously and we are conducting a thorough investigation. We are unable to comment further.'","Thomas James died at home after he was given sedatives by the nurse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A rare Nazi bling-ring once owned by Adolf Hitler has been sold at auction but for significantly less than was expected. The 'Hitler Ring' is made of silver and was originally plated with gold, and features a ruby-encrusted swastika on its base. It was auctioned in Maryland and had been expected to fetch at least $110,000 but only made just over half of its estimated price, coming in at $65,725. The ring was made for Adolf Hitler by fanatical Nazi goldsmith Karl Berthold . Set on an elaborate base and inside a silver ball, the ring is made from solid silver and topped with a huge ruby. Though an official certificate shows it was made for Hitler, we have no way of knowing if he wore it . 'We are very happy with the result,' Andreas Kornfeld, vice president of international client relations for . the auction house told the Baltimore Sun. 'It is very difficult to estimate objects and relics such as the ring, . since there are, or have been, no comparisons on the market.' The ring was purchased by an American collector whom Mr Kornfeld would not identify. 'We got many — hundreds of thousands — of page views on the item,' he said. Mr Kornfeld said the auction house did not receive any complaints about the controversial background of the item. On the ring is a huge swastika that is supported by other swastikas and . swords. The piece is crowned by a large ruby and mounted in a silver . globe which rests on an elaborate foot, also with a swastika. Though an official certificate shows it was made for Hitler, there is no way of knowing if he wore it . The ring was sold by the Alexander Historical Auctions House in Maryland. The jewellry was accompanied with documents testifying that it was made for the Fuhrer. The ring was crafted by the master goldsmith Karl Berthold who was a . fanatical Nazi and kicked Jewish craftsmen out of his business in . Frankfurt shortly after the regime came to power in 1933 - long before . laws forbidding them from working came into place. He wrote to Hitler saying he had fired the 'Bolshevik-Jew servants' and . was commissioned by a party functionary to make the ring for the Nazi . leader. The ring was found at Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountain retreat in Bavaria, in 1945 by American troops. One of the soldiers pocketed it as a souvenir before selling it on. It had been owned by several collectors over the years, the last of whom . died two years ago and whose grandson put it up for sale this time . around is now selling it . The Alexander Historical Auctions House is famous for selling Nazi-themed militaria and artefacts. Three years ago it sold the diaries of Auschwitz 'Angel of Death' Josef . Mengele - the camp doctor who performed terrible medical experiments on . inmates - that he kept while on the run in Brazil. Another more common kind of Nazi ring is the so-called 'death's head ring' awarded by Heinrich Himmler, the chief engineer of the Holocaust, to officers he considered particularly loyal or courageous. One such ring was auctioned at Northamptonshire-based JP Humbert Auctioneers in 2008. It had been signed by Himmler (pictured right) himself and was dated to commemorate the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler purged a section of his own paramilitary which he considered to be challenging his authority. A second death ring was stolen from a museum in Berchtesgaden in 2005 and was thought to be worth between four and 40 thousand pounds. The theft prompted a Europe-wide warning from police to collectors to protect their items after Hitler's own gold Nazi party badge was stolen just a few weeks earlier.","The ring was expected to sell for close to $110,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Treatment: Caroline Biden has been transferred from a Pennsylvania rehab facility to one in the warmer climes of Delray Beach, Florida . Vice President Joe Biden's niece has been ordered to receive anger management treatment at a beach side rehab facility in Florida. Caroline Biden was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent. She was last seen in court on October 29 when she attended a hearing and appeared to have a black eye that she tried keeping hidden using sunglasses. The 26-year-old was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and harassment. She was not present at the latest hearing that took place on Wednesday and her team of lawyers appeared in her place. 'She’s undergoing treatment for the issues she has with anger management,' attorney James Liguori told the court, according to The New York Post. 'She’s truly sorry for what she did and she’s truly remorseful.' Biden, who graduated from Georgetown University and was working at a Manhattan art gallery before her arrest, was transferred to a Florida rehab facility on January 20 after receiving treatment at their sister site in Pennsylvania. It is unclear when she first checked into the Pennsylvania facility, called Caron Place. Scroll down for video . Serious setting: A Manhattan judge has ordered that Biden, 26, has to remain at Caron Renaissance Ocean Drive (pictured) for three more months . Picturesque: Before moving to the Florida facility on January 20, Biden had been staying at the sister site in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, which does not treat anger management issues unless it is an underlying cause of drug addiction . Her lawyers only said that she was receiving treatment for anger management issues, but The Post reports that Caron Place only provides assistance with anger issues if they are connected to drug addiction. A former friend previously reported that Ms Biden attended a different rehab program for alcohol and Adderall addiction during college. While she may have been enjoying the rural location of Caron Place in Wernersville, which is surrounded by mountains, the latest facility is located in a much more enviable climate. She is now staying at Caron Renaissance Ocean Drive in Delray Beach, Florida where the weather on Thursday had an expected high of 81. The facility's website describes how their executive chef prepares all of their patients' meals but they also have fully-stocked kitchens with state-of-the-art amenities in their rooms. 'A full housekeeping staff helps clients stay focused on the task at hand rather than day-to-day chores,' the site explains. Signs of trouble: Caroline was transported to a hospital wrapped in a sheet by wheelchair after being arrest on September 17 for getting into a physical altercation with her roommate . Drama: After being treated for undisclosed injuries or conditions, she was released and appeared in court the next month, though her lawyers went in her place this week as she is in Florida . Treatment there costs $35,000 for the first month and $18,000 for each subsequent month. The Manhattan District Attorney stipulated that she stay there for an additional three months as part of a plea deal, meaning that the total sum will be north of $71,000, not including the fees for her time in the Pennsylvania facility. Connected: Caroline is the daughter of Vice President Joe Biden's brother James . The anger management treatment was deemed necessary after she got into a physical altercation not only with her roommate but also with the police officer who arrested her. Court documents described how she also tried to sneak out of the station house once officers put her inside a holding cell. 'I am informed that Officer Martin had to outstretch both of his arms horizontally so the defendant could not get around him and that the defendant stated in substance, ""Don’t touch me,"" and attempted to push away from Officer Martin,' an officer wrote in the criminal complaint. 'I am informed by Officer Martin that he was able to gain control of the defendant by holding her arm and that when he was walking her back to the holding cell, the defendant grabbed a door frame, and held onto cells, in an effort to prevent Officer Martin from bringing her back to the holding cell, an official function.' This is not Miss Biden's first run-in with the law, as she was briefly detained by Amtrak police over a disputed train fare in 2009. At the time she claimed she was treated unfairly because of her family's connection to the Vice President, and said she had intended to pay for her ticket on the train, a friend said.","Caroline Biden, 26, has been receiving treatment for anger issues since she was arrested this fall .
