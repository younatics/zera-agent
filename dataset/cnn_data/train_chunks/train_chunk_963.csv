"Sir Alex Ferguson’s wife Cathy talked the United manager into letting Rio Ferdinand off a club fine for refusing to wear a Kick It Out campaign t-shirt. Ferdinand reveals that Fergie was furious when, with the John Terry race row still raging, he was part of a high profile rebellion against football’s official anti-racist group who he believed had not given his brother Anton proper backing.

Balotelli appeared good value for money in his debut where, despite missing several chances, he combined well with Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in Liverpool's 3-0 victory over Tottenham. However, the Italian maverick is always accompanied by unpredictability and a rash challenge and subsequent altercation with referee Chris Foy led to him being substituted for his own safety in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Wolves last week.

"A Perth Islamic preacher has posted to Facebook in support of the Islamic State saying scholars who support an Islamic State 'are on the front lines, in the battlefields, backing their words with actions'. Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has rejected claims that he leads an extremist youth group tied to terrorist group ISIS, posted that they were 'suffering in the prisons' and 'known for speaking the truth, no matter what it costs them'. The 25-year-old also went on to mock 'The ones who spew the nonsense of ""patriotism"", ""Australian Muslims"", ""deradicalization"", and other terms for which Allah has sent down no authority.' Scroll down for video . Mohammed Junaid Thorne rejects claims of leading an Islamic extremist youth group in Perth . The 25-year-old was deported from Saudi Arabia last year for protesting his older brother Shayden's imprisonment on terrorism-related offences . Mr Thorne, who is an Australian citizen, also told his followers he will be in Sydney next week for some Ruqyah (spiritual healing) sessions, urging them to make contact if they wanted to meet with him. This comes just days after American photojournalist James Foley was executed by ISIS in Syria, after being abducted by the group in 2012. In June, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the federal government was investigating Mr Thorne's online posts. 'Any promotion or support for terrorism is against the law in our country,' she told the ABC. 'And [ISIS] is a proscribed terrorist organisation.' Mr Thorne says he is a university student and claims to have memorised the Koran at age six. The 25-year-old, who was deported from Saudi Arabia last year for protesting his older brother Shayden's imprisonment on terrorism-related offences, has previously been accused of being a radical preacher for allegedly praising militants responsible for beheadings and mass killings in Iraq in June. Mr Thorne and his brother Shayden moved to Saudi Arabia 19 years ago for their father's work, AAP reported. Mr Thorne (pictured left) says the accusations are all 'a big misunderstanding' Their mother, who lives in the Perth suburb of Thornlie and is divorced from their father, said her sons were Aboriginal, Australian citizens but identified primarily as Muslims. Curtin University terrorism expert Anne Aly, who is based in Perth, said Mr Thorne used to be the leader of Islamic group Millatu Ibrahim AU but she was not sure if it was still functional. 'I think now they're just a bit rag tag, a group of guys that stick together and he's trying to put his thoughts out there now,' Dr Aly told Daily Mail Australia. Dr Aly said he was intentionally trying to be provocative. 'He's been saying he's very much against democracy - they don't believe in democracy which means they don't believe in voting or Australian rule of law which is pretty typical of the jihadi ideology,' she said. 'The stuff he's put up about supporting the Islamic State, underlying that is this belief system that only those who go and fight – the mujahedeen – are true Muslims or are the best Muslims and that is very much what the Islamic State puts out there. 'That's very extreme to say.' Dr Aly said Mr Thorne was attention seeking but it was important to expose Mr Thorne's views in order to challenge them. 'If the young people he's speaking to via social media, if that's the only message they're getting, they don't have any other opportunity to get another message they only get that one side,' she said. 'Often their families who might be expressing concern don't know that this is how they started to believe these extreme ideas in the first place. 'But if it's out there in the broad media then there's more opportunity for those young people to hear another viewpoint.' Videos of Mr Thorne's speeches have been posted to the YouTube channel Islam In Focus Australia over the past few months. 'Our sisters being raped by these filthy Jews and Christians,' he said in one video posted in June. 'Our sisters are in the streets, their bodies are filling the streets, bombs dropping on houses killing women and children.' In a talk titled Islam and Democracy, posted on August 6, Mr Thorne said: 'No one has a problem with you worshipping Allah [the exulted]. 'But when you start speaking against or start speaking the truth, and you start calling people to the way of Allah [the exulted] and proving to them the falsehood of their false deities, and the corruption of their evil systems, this is when people start getting on edge and this is when people see their desires being attacked.' Last week, Mr Thorne said that reports he and a dozen Perth youths, from various ethnic backgrounds, were associated with the terrorist group ISIS were all part of 'a big misunderstanding' - despite posing in a video with ISIS flags. 'I don't have a group of youth nor Australian reverts, there is some big misunderstanding going on - I don't know why,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Thorne (left) said he did not know of any 'Australian reverts' while a Perth man, who's believed to be named Matthew Smith (right), claims Islam saved him from a drug addiction . Smith (centre), Thorne (fourth from right) are pictured with others in front of ISIS flags . Mr Thorne wouldn't comment any further but said he will be releasing a video that will be 'a response and clarification to the current situation'. Although he denied knowing any Australian reverts, a recruitment video shows a ginger-bearded former Curtin University student who converted to Islam, The West Australian reported. A photo also shows Mr Thorne and the former hip-hop rapper posing together with ISIS flags. When asked about whether he knew the man, Thorne neither confirmed nor denied knowing him. The man, allegedly named Matthew Smith but calls himself 'Terry Wrist' - a play on 'terrorist', claims Islam saved him from a drug addiction in Perth in 2006. In the video, he expresses his invincibility through Islam and encourages others to join him. 'You gonna kill, you won't kill me because Allah says I'm alive, I'm receiving sustenance,' he said in the video. 'So what can you do to me? Absolutely nothing. 'Come to Islam, feel this feeling...come to Islam and you will not regret it.' He ends his passionate speech with: 'plenty of cold ones in paradise. All you can drink. Can't wait'.","Mohammed Junaid Thorne  posted in support of the Islamic State .

"West Ham co-owner David Gold has condemned those Upton Park fans who contributed to helping paying off a fellow supporter's fine after he was convicted of invading the pitch during their Premier League opener against Tottenham. Jordan Dunn, from Dover in Kent, became an internet sensation after he kicked the ball towards the goal when West Ham were defending a free-kick at Upton Park last month. The 22-year-old was convicted for the offence of 'entering the playing area' and was told to pay £305 but was sparred a ban from attending future matches. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino: Eric Dier was Tottenham's hero . No: David Gold has slammed West Ham fans who contributed to helping pay off a fellow supporter's fine . However, after launching a fundraising appeal on website Gofundme.com his fellow supporters donated the whole amount in record time. Gold believes that Dunn's example could set a dangerous precedent in the future which could lead to dire consequences with more fans potentially misbehaving in grounds on the basis they know their fine can be split amongst other supporters. 'Well meaning fans have paid the 'pitch invaders' fine,' Gold tweeted. 'I'm fearful that this will encourage more such events, with dire consequences. Whilst in court, Dunn apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it is an offence to go on to the playing area without lawful authority or excuse. Naughty boy:  Jordan Dunn saw his £305 fine paid off with the help of fellow Upton Park fans . Passing sentence at Thames Magistrates' Court in East London, District Judge Gareth Branston said: 'On the afternoon of August 16 about 35,000 football fans sat down at Upton Park to watch 22 men in shorts and football boots kick a football around for 90 minutes. 'Those 22 men were paid for that, to entertain. 'Some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch. That was you. You weren't paid to do that.' The judge said he proceeded to run 'some 70 yards' across the pitch, chased by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where Tottenham were lining up a free kick. Hold up: Dunn (right) was fined after he ran onto the pitch during West Ham's clash at home to Tottenham . The judge said: 'You took it for them. To be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball. 'It was a longer run than was strictly necessary. 'You had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like Beckham. 'Regrettably it was about 30mph slower than Beckham.' Wheeling away: Dunn celebrated his effort wildly whilst running away from the match stewards . The judge said the effort was 'easily' saved by West Ham goalkeeper Adrian but referred to Christian Eriksen's subsequent effort after play restarted, saying: 'I understand that the professional footballer who followed you did not do any better.' Judge Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by stewards. He also said it was a 'small mercy' that Dunn had 'decided to remain fully clothed'. Showing restraint: An intoxicated Dunn (centre) tried to fight off the presence of stewards after being caught . Dunn, who smiled as the judge compared his effort to the former England captain, told police it had been a dream of his to play at the home of his favourite team West Ham from a young age. The judge said: 'You told the police and you tell this court that having achieved your childhood ambition you won't be doing it again. 'Others need to be deterred from attempting to do what you did otherwise football matches would become very tedious affairs if everyone was allowed to run onto the pitch.' The judge said a greater risk was that 'drunken hooligans' may invade the pitch and attack players though he said he accepted that Dunn had 'no violent motivation'. He said he could not condone the offence but must also put it into perspective. The judge declined to impose a football banning order called for by the prosecution, saying he was taking into account Dunn's previous good character, his 'motivations' on the day, the remorse he expressed and the fact that 'you will not want disappoint your young son' by repeating the stunt. Let's 'ave it: Dunn sticks his tongue out to the Upton Park crowd as he is escorted away from the ground . Dunn told police in interview he had been a West Ham fan since he was a little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to 'run on the pitch and kick the ball', the court heard. Ben Edwards, prosecuting, added: 'Now he could say he had done it. He also said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it again.' Earlier Dunn told the judge he was 'sorry' for committing the offence and admitted he had drunk around six beers before the match but denied being a 'hooligan', 'thug' or 'yob'. Asked what was going through his mind, Dunn said: 'Nothing really - it was just a moment of madness. It was a spur of the moment thing. I just went.' The judge said he had seen footage of the incident on YouTube and asked: 'Were you intending to take the free kick?' Dunn replied: 'No. All I was going to do was run and as I was running I just saw the ball there so I thought I would just kick it.' Matchwinning moment: Tottenham won the game 1-0 thanks to a late Eric Dier (left) strike . Dunn, who works as a receptionist at a hotel, said he has a ten-month old little boy. Referring to the prospect of a banning order, he said: 'I was a bit concerned that when my little boy grows up I want to take him to watch the football.' The judge asked if his mother had 'expressed disapproval'. Dunn, who represented himself, said: 'At first she was concerned because she didn't know the consequences but when she saw the YouTube video she saw the funny side but she has had a go at me, as a mother would.' Mocked: One fan on Twitter commented that Dunn's free-kick was better than Christian Eriksen's effort . He declined to comment after the hearing. The pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media, with one fan saying the effort was better than Spurs star Eriksen's free kick once play had resumed. He wrote on Twitter: 'Fair play to that pitch invader at West Ham v Spurs.. He got the Free kick on target when Eriksen couldn't.'","David Gold is worried that West Ham fans have set a dangerous precedent .

"Marouane Fellaini has been working his way back to full fitness by training hard on a beach in Belgium during the international break. The big-haired midfielder appeared to be heading out of Old Trafford last month, with Rafael Benitez's Napoli seemingly keen, but an ankle injury put an end to any potential move.

"A notorious prisoner is the victim of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern times and should have his conviction overturned, a former Tory MP argues in a compelling new book. Andrew Hunter says that Jeremy Bamber, who has spent more than a quarter of a century in jail for shooting dead his adoptive parents, his sister and his two six-year-old nephews, has been the victim of ‘questionable’ police evidence. Mr Hunter, who has been working on the Bamber case for the past ten years, says he has come across previously unconsidered evidence which suggests that the prosecution was seriously flawed. Clue: Jeremy Bamber says this picture shows blood on his sister Sheila's foot . Furthermore, the former Basingstoke MP argues that recent revelations of police corruption – including the cover-up of the Hillsborough stadium disaster and the controversy over the resignation of Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell and the ‘Plebgate’ row in Downing Street – reinforces his demand to take a completely fresh look at the case. Bamber, now 52, was convicted of the murders at the family’s farm near Maldon, Essex, in 1985 by a 10-2 majority jury verdict. He has strongly insisted on his  innocence ever since – but until now has lacked such a high-profile public advocate of his case. Bamber (left, in 2002) has spent more than a quarter of a . century in jail for shooting dead his adoptive parents, his sister and . his two six-year-old nephews. He says his sister Sheila (right), who was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, suffered a psychotic episode and carried out the murders before turning the gun on herself . Bamber says his sister Sheila, who was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, feared having her children taken into care, suffered a psychotic episode and carried out the murders before turning the gun on herself. But the police argued that Bamber must have carried out the murders because the gun had been fitted with a silencer, which made it too long for her to be physically able to shoot herself. The police also said that if she had gone on a rampage her feet would have been covered in blood, which they said was not the case. Now Mr Hunter says that after a  25-year fight, Bamber’s lawyers have obtained a picture of the feet – which shows bloodstains. Cold-blooded: Jeremy Bamber murdered his parents . Nevill and June Bamber (left) and sister Sheila and her children Daniel . and Nicholas (right) And his defence team have also . received new forensic results which suggest that burn marks on the back . of Bamber’s father, Nevill, had been made by the muzzle of a rifle . without a silencer. In . addition, his team say that even if the gun had been fitted with a . silencer, it would have been possible for Sheila to have shot herself. They have used an actress with the same length arms as Sheila to demonstrate that she could still have reached the trigger. Mr Hunter says he has also unearthed evidence that the silencer produced as evidence in court had been claimed to have been found three days after the killings when, he alleges, it had actually been found nearly a month later. He believes that the alleged extra time could have been used to add ‘scratch marks’ on the silencer, to back up claims – later used by the prosecution – that Jeremy Bamber had been involved in a confrontation with his father while trying to carry out the killings, which had led to  marks on both the silencer and a wall in the house. Mr Hunter argues that crime-scene photographs prove that additional scratches appeared on the wall in the days after the crime was committed. Police had initially worked on the theory that Sheila, a model known as ‘Bambi’, had been responsible. Bamber, now 52, was convicted of the murders at the family's farm near Maldon, Essex, in 1985 by a 10-2 majority jury verdict . But they then put Bamber at the centre of the investigation after his girlfriend, Julie Mugford – whom he had two-timed – claimed he had confessed to her his plans to hire a hitman to murder the family. She named the hitman, but he turned out to have a cast-iron alibi and was released. Two years ago, Bamber’s legal team thought they had made a breakthrough when a recently unearthed police phone log recorded a call on the night of the killings from Nevill. The log, entitled ‘daughter gone berserk’, said that Mr Bamber had said his daughter had stolen one of his guns and gone ‘berserk’. However, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) declined to  refer the case to the Court of Appeal – which has turned down Bamber  twice – saying that it had not identified any evidence that raised a possibility the court would overturn  the conviction. Bamber is the only one out of 38 prisoners in England and Wales serving a whole-life sentence who still protests his innocence. The case has caused unease in legal circles for years because the verdict was not unanimous and there was no direct forensic evidence linking him to the crime. The prosecution relied heavily on motive and character, arguing that Bamber was ‘greedy’ and ‘arrogant’, and had set up his sister to appear to be the culprit because he was motivated by the prospect of inheriting the £436,000 family fortune and considerable land. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge, Mr Justice Drake, described Bamber as ‘warped’ and ‘evil, almost beyond belief’. Now Mr Hunter, MP for Basingstoke from 1983 to 2005, argues in his book, Beyond Reasonable Doubt, that the evidence relied on by the prosecution was full of contradictions. He says that he expects the new forensics to form part of a third appeal attempt. ‘I think we are looking at one of the worst miscarriages of justice in recent times, and there is compelling evidence that much of the evidence provided by the police and others was unreliable,’ he said. ‘I’m afraid the police did dreadful things back then. Don’t forget the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.’ Mr Hunter, now 70, was a classics teacher at Harrow School until entering Parliament in 1983. As a Right-wing member of the Monday Club, he does not fit the more usual Left-wing profile of political  critics of the police: in 2004, shortly before stepping down from the Commons at the 2005 General Election, he joined the Democratic Unionist Party. Bamber was put at the centre of the investigation after his girlfriend, Julie Mugford (both pictured), whom he had two-timed, claimed he had confessed to her his plans to hire a hitman to murder the family -  a claim that was later proved false . Mr Hunter first became interested in Bamber’s case while still serving as an MP, when he signed a Commons motion raising doubts about his conviction. Bamber wrote to  Mr Hunter to thank him, and  the two men started corresponding frequently, with Mr Hunter paying visits to him in Full Sutton prison  in York. Campaigners working to free Bamber have set up a website which includes regular blogs by the prisoner, based on letters written to his supporters by Bamber. In the most recent posting, on September 29, Bamber wrote: ‘Today is like all the others, as I wake in jail having completed 28 years wrongfully imprisoned. Now I begin year 29, a new day, a good day, one that none of us will ever see again.’ Bamber hinted at Mr Hunter’s findings in a June posting, saying: ‘I wanted to write a short piece about all the work that has been done to resolve matters regarding my wrongful imprisonment, both in proving my innocence and in proving that Sheila took her own life after killing our family. ‘We now have all the raw data that’s key to resolving every aspect of the case, facts and figures extracted from three-and-a-half  million pages of case documents.’ Former Tory MP Andrew Hunter (above) says Bamber has been the victim of 'questionable' police evidence . Bamber has kept a low profile in prison, apart from the time he was forced to defend himself with a broken bottle when a prisoner attacked him with a knife. He received 28 stitches on his neck following a second attack by another inmate. Bamber was the son of a vicar’s daughter who had an affair with a married Army sergeant. He was adopted by Nevill and June Bamber aged six weeks. Privately educated, at the time of the murders he was just 24 and living in a cottage owned by his father three miles away. Seven years ago he took and passed a lie-detector test. He has seen numerous therapists and psychiatrists in his time in prison, none of whom has suggested that he is mentally unstable. His legal team have also highlighted what they describe as other flaws in the original trial, including the fact that a bloodstained Bible, found by Sheila’s side and open at pages containing Psalms 51-55 – a section relating to the struggle between good and evil – was never forensically examined nor produced at trial, despite repeated requests from Bamber’s solicitor. Photographs also showed a handwritten note sticking up from between the pages of the Bible reading ‘love one another’ – the same words that were on a banner on a wall in a room in Guyana when 909 people died in a mass murder-suicide. And it has emerged that shortly before her death, Sheila’s ex-husband, Colin Caffell, wrote to Nevill expressing deep concern about her mental state and asking him to ‘try and convince Sheila that it would be better for her and the boys if they stayed with me most of the time’. But when Bamber told his trial that Sheila had feared losing her children – which could have triggered one of her psychotic attacks – he was accused of making it up. Last night, a spokesman for the CCRC said: ‘We have no current application in relation to Mr Bamber’s case.’ A spokesman for Essex Police said: ‘Essex Police has no comment to make on these claims given that Jeremy Bamber’s conviction has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the CCRC and there has never been anything to suggest he was wrongly convicted.’","Bamber, 52, was convicted of murders of his adoptive parents, his sister Sheila and his two six-year-old nephews in 1985 .

"Gary Pearce, pictured, messaged and swapped naked photographs with a 14-year-old boy on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex . A former teacher who groomed a schoolboy 26 years his junior after they met on gay hook-up app Grindr has been jailed for five years. Gary Pearce messaged and swapped naked photographs with the 14-year-old on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex. The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up. Pearce, 40, then drove in his sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath at the end of the summer holidays in 2012. They then went back to Pearce's house in Sidcup, Kent, where he performed sex acts on the teenager. They then showered before Pearce dropped him back at the car park, a court heard. However, the boy's mother discovered messages on her son's mobile phone and confronted him before calling the police. When Pearce was arrested, detectives found four indecent images of children in the trash folder of his computer which had been downloaded sometime around 2009. He admitted picking up the schoolboy and having sex but maintains he thought the boy was over the age of 16 - the age of consent. He made no comment to any other police questions and was charged in July last year. He had denied sexual activity with a child and sexual grooming but was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court. The jury had been shown a video interview given by the boy wearing his school uniform in December 2012 during which he insisted he told Pearce his real age early on. He told detectives 'I said how old I was, I said I was 14 or 15' before the messaging continued. Describing how they eventually met, the boy added: 'He waved at me and I was nervous because obviously I had never done it before. 'I don't remember what we talked about but he put his hand on my leg. I didn't expect it so I jumped but not too much.' They then went to the home and the boy said that he 'showed me around his house' before the pair engaged in a sex act. Gary Pearce, 40, drove in his sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath (pictured) at the end of the summer holidays in 2012 . Asked how he felt about what had happened during the interview, weeks after meeting Pearce he said: 'Well I now have sort of a girlfriend.' Detective Inspector Neal Burton from the Sapphire Command said: 'Pearce utilised the internet to manipulate the child into meeting him. 'This crime again shows the vulnerability of the internet and social media, which is used by paedophiles to meet their victims. 'This conviction will provide reassurance that we will relentlessly pursue those who commit these dreadful crimes against children.'","Gary Pearce 'groomed' boy after meeting him on gay hook-up app Grindr .

"Splash: Customers made more than 120,000 complaints to water firms in a year. File picture . Customers made more than 120,000 complaints to water firms in a year, a  report has showed. A total of 123,218 written complaints were sent to companies between April 1 2013 and March 31 this year - the equivalent of more than 300 every day. More than half were about billing and charges, the Consumer Council for Water (CCWater) said. However, the total complaints tally fell by 18 per cent compared to 2012/13. It was the sixth successive year that the number decreased, and the rate of the fall was twice that seen in the previous year. Water firms were warned the cost of bills faced by hard-pressed households was still a crucial factor despite improvements. Tony Smith, chief executive of CCWater, said: 'Most water companies have responded well to our challenge to improve performance, with complaints now at their lowest level since we were formed in 2005. 'But affordability remains a huge challenge for the industry, with one in five customers telling us their water bill is not affordable. 'Water companies and the regulator Ofwat must deliver prices for the next five years that customers can afford and find acceptable or risk a backlash from struggling households.' Southern Water and South East Water were singled out for being the two worst performing companies when complaints are measured per 10,000 connected properties. The report said: 'We have repeatedly told them that they need to bring themselves into line with the rest of the industry, but they continue to lag significantly behind.' Four companies - South West Water, Affinity Water, Severn Trent Water and Dwr Cymru Welsh Water - bucked the industry trend and reported an overall increase in complaints. Wessex Water, Portsmouth Water and Cambridge Water were hailed as the industry's best performers. Thames Water, the country's largest water and sewerage company, was said to have responded well to pressure to improve by reducing complaints by almost a third. Steve George, customer services director at South East Water, said: 'We are pleased to see the downward trend continue during 2014 but we recognise that there is still more to do. 'Over the past year we have been working hard to integrate the new communications technologies into customer service. 'Not only has this new instant approach been welcomed by our customers, our own staff have enthusiastically embraced each development as it has come on board. 'Although our focus is to prevent problems, when things go wrong for our customers we are always sorry and we endeavour to fix things as quickly as possible. 'We're pleased that complaint numbers have reduced by almost 30% again last year - the fourth best improvement in the industry. We will continue to work hard again this year until we're head to head with the best.' Southern Water and South East Water were singled out for being the two worst performing companies. File picture . Darren Bentham, Southern Water's chief customer officer, said: 'While our performance in 2013/14 saw a big improvement, we are still lower down the results table than we want to be - and where our customers want us to be. 'However, we are continuing to make changes which ensure we focus on our customers - from training, to new systems and an improved website. These changes are making a huge difference as proved by a significant reduction in written complaints over the past 18 months. 'Our customers have told us they expect better service and we have promised to bring more improvements. There is still work to do but we're confident we can deliver our promise, while ensuring bills are affordable for all.' A spokesman for South West Water said complaints have dropped by 50 per cent over the last five years. He said: 'Despite a slight increase in initial complaints in 2013/14 compared to 2012/13, largely due to exceptional weather, more than 97 per cent were resolved first time, which represents the second best performance of all water companies. 'Encouragingly, written complaints this year are lower than the same period last year, reinforcing the overall downward trend in recent years.' An Affinity Water spokesman said:'Affinity Water is committed to maintaining a high level of customer service. We remain a top five industry performing company, for the fourth consecutive year, with written complaints below half the industry average. 'However, we are not complacent and we are focused on improving our customer experience.' A Dwr Cymru Welsh Water spokesman said the report shows they had the second lowest volume of customer complaints among the ten water and sewerage companies in England and Wales. He added: 'However, we did experience a slight increase in the number of complaints received last year compared with 2012-13 and this was mainly due to the warm summer weather which posed challenges in terms of maintaining water supplies in pockets of our operating area. 'Despite this hot dry weather, the plans and measures we put in place meant that our customers did not experience any significant disruptions during this period.' Water UK, the trade body for the water sector, said the data on complaints was 'great news', adding: 'The industry will continue to work hard to provide the very best services and drive down complaints even further.'","More than half of the complaints were about billing and charges .

"Two 13-year-old girls have been taken to hospital and a further 22 are being treated  for shock after a suspected lightning strike at a Sydney high school. Paramedics were called to Clancy Catholic College at West Hoxton, south west of Sydney, about 9.30am this morning.

Paramedics were called to Clancy Catholic College at West Hoxton, south west of Sydney, before 10am on Tuesday . Some students reportedly had symptoms of headaches and dizziness following the lightning strike, while others said they had felt numbness in their limbs . The class of students were on the school oval during an electrical storm when a loud clap of thunder was heard. Students ran for cover minutes later complaining of headaches, the Daily Telegraph reports. Witnesses had reported thunder at the time, but the spokeswoman said it was 'hard to ascertain whether there had actually been a lightning strike' or if it was a 'static electricity discharge'. Four ambulances rushed to the school and it's understood a triage was set up to assess students. 'It looks like no one was directly hit,' a police spokeswoman told Nine News.

A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said witnesses had reported thunder at the time, but said it was 'hard to ascertain whether there had actually been a lightning strike' or if it was a 'static electricity discharge' About 20 parents rushed to the high school after news of the lightning strike. There was an announcement over the school's PA system at 10.30am to say all students were well. A meterologist for WeatherZone, Rob Sharpe, said there were several lightening strikes in the area around the time the students reported feeling sick. 'It's entirely plausible that lightning did strike (the oval),' Mr Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald.","Paramedics were called to Clancy Catholic College in Sydney's south west about 9.30am on Tuesday .

"Shahab Reza, of Perivale, London, has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars . A deaf couple and his family falsely claimed £900,000 meant for sign language interpreters to fund a luxury lifestyle and diamond jewellery, a court heard today. Shahab Reza, of Perivale, west London, submitted fake invoices to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) but used the money to fund holidays, jewellery and university fees, prosecutors say. The 51-year-old and his wife, Shehnaz Reza, 53, both of whom are deaf, also involved their children, Zainab Reza, 22, and Abbas Reza, 26, it is claimed. Father Shahab has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars. Mother Shehnaz and children Zainab and Abbas all deny being part of a conspiracy. Southward Crown Court heard Shahab Reza and his wife Shehnaz Reza oversaw a massive four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters. They recruited their son Abbas Reza, now a 26 year-old doctor, and daughter Zainab Reza, now 22, to help with the scam, jurors were told. The family splurged the proceeds on a luxury home, a £600,000 penthouse, gold jewellery and an £8,000 ‘flawless’ diamond, it is said. Mastermind Shahab Reza has admitted his role in the con. But his wife and children, who claim they were ‘doing what they were told’, are now on trial for assisting him by signing off documents, jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard. Shehnaz Reza (pictured, left) and her children, Zainab (centre) and Abbas (right), deny conspiracy to defraud . Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC told jurors the children had been ‘drawn into the fraud very early’. She said: ‘There was an interesting agreement found in the search of the family home. This was a contract signed by both siblings, an employment contract between brother and sister in 2008 when Zainab would have been 16 and Abbas would have been 20. ‘The agreement was to employ her for £400 a month - that is just a sham agreement. ‘Shahab Reza knew he could trust his children to sign those documents and they would not ask any questions. ‘We say that the young people - Abbas Reza and Zainab Reza - are intellectually able. ‘Certainly we know that Abbas Reza is a fully trained and qualified doctor. Zainab Reza has a degree as well and they are no fools. 'However young they were when they first signed the documents, they grew in age and  were not stupid.’ Both children and their mother were accomplished in signing off expense claims through one of the family’s six sham companies, the court heard. Ms Cottage said: ‘What was being claimed as a business expense was, for example, a home burglar alarm, Mrs Reza’s travel expenses of £300 in April 2009 and her mobile phone bill. She didn’t seem to be doing very much work for the company, though.' Meanwhile Zainab Reza was claiming her travel expenses and Abbas Reza was claiming insurance for his mobile phone, jurors heard. Ms Cottage said: ‘I say that they were put through by Abbas, Shehnaz and Zainab Reza because it wasn’t just Shahab Reza getting hold of the family receipts and doing it himself. ‘They were brought into the fraud at every possible opportunity and signed off documents at requested.’ Zainab Reza and her mother claimed for travel and ‘everything they ate’ on a trip to Dubai to purchase an investment property, it is claimed. And qualified doctor Abbas Reza is said to have splashed cash on a trip to America in July 2009 and claimed back spending money and travel in expenses. Southward Crown Court heard Shahab Reza, 51, and his wife Shehnaz Reza, 53, oversaw a massive four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters . Prosecutors said that when the alleged fraudsters were arrested there was thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 diamond. The court heard Shahab also lied about his family's financial circumstances to Harrow Council, netting nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions between June 2002 and August 2010. The Reza family is also accused of conning the NHS and the Student Loans Company, with Abbas allegedly receiving a fraudulent bursary. Ms Cottage told the court: 'The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous. The extend of the Reza family's greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.' Abbas, Shehnaz, and Zainab Reza, from Stanmore, each deny conspiracy to defraud. Shehnaz Reza further denies a single count each of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception, and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability. Zainab denies a further count of fraud by false representation, while Abbas denies two counts of fraud by false representation. Four deaf friends of the family - Saifur Rahman, 31, Ahsan Naseer, 29, Natela Babina, 30, and Daiva Alisauskaite, 42 - are also on trial, accused of being part of a swindle. Naseer, of Birmingham, Babina, of Wembley, north west London, Alisauskaite, of Hackney, east London, and Rahman, of Camden, north London, all deny conspiracy to defraud the Department of Work and Pensions. The trial at Southwark Crown Court in London, which is expected to last two months, continues.

"He looks like your average adventurous toddler with his huge grin and playful antics, but on the inside Braxton Rayner is battling a rare and inoperable brain tumour. In his short life, the two-year-old from Dalby in Queensland has already undergone two brain surgeries, fallen ill to meningitis, suffered multiple seizures and had eight MRIs. Now, his parents Kirsten Kay and Clinton Rayner have been hit with the heartbreaking news the tumour has started to grow. Two-year-old Braxton Rayner from Dalby in Queensland is undergoing surgery for third time this week in a bid to get a biopsy for his inoperable brain tumour . Braxton's parents Kirsten Kay and Clinton Rayner were recently told their only son's tumour had started to grow after he was first diagnosed 11 months ago . Braxton was first diagnosed with the inoperable tumour 11 months ago. There's no way for doctors to know exactly what type of tumour he has and whether it is malignant unless they carry out a biopsy. 'He's had surgery twice to try and get a biopsy. They go in through the top of his head but they can't see the tumour so that can't do it. They can only do it if they go behind his head,' Ms Kay told Daily Mail Australia. 'If they go through there, there's a very high risk he'll lose his sight and any movement because it is growing at the top of his spinal cord. There's no way for doctors to know exactly what type of tumour Braxton has and whether it is malignant unless they carry out a biopsy . Braxton has already had two surgeries to try and get a biopsy but doctors haven't been able to see the tumour. They can go through the back of his head but there's a high chance he'll lose his sight and movement as the tumour is growing at the top of his spine . 'My son is on the go, he's always outside. He loves playing around. We can't take that away from him – it's a very hard and difficult decision for us.' Braxton is having his third surgery to try and get a biopsy this week. 'They've always said they won't do chemotherapy until they detect growth. Unfortunately they need to treat it and they've told us it needs to be treated straight away,' Ms Kay said. 'To treat him with the right chemotherapy, they need to do a biopsy to work out what kind of tumour they're dealing with and that just can't be an option.' Braxton, pictured here with his dad Clinton getting antibiotics in June  after catching two brain infections, has been back and forth between Brisbane Children's Hospital and his home in rural Queensland for the past 11 months . Braxton's mum Kirsten said he had been through more than most adults over the past year and had shown remarkable courage . Despite the trauma of the past 11 months, Ms Kay said Braxton had shown remarkable courage. 'He's been through a lot more than many adults would have and he's been so brave,' she said. 'Braxton is my hero, he's so strong. 'As soon as he wakes up from surgery and the morphine wears off, he's running around and smiling. You would know there's something that big in his head.' The young family have been back and forth between their home in Dalby, in central Queensland, and Brisbane since October. 'Even though he's young, he's not stupid. When we're in the elevators at the hospital and we stop on level two he reacts and doesn't want to get out. He knows that's the level surgery is done on,' Ms Kay said. 'When he does his MRIs he will just cry lying on his back. He knows what's going to happen. It's cruel but he takes it. I just have to tell him it's okay and I love him. 'He's our first child so the whole time I try not to think of the negatives.' His parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over in October 2013. Three weeks later, Braxton stopped walking altogether . Kirsten and Clinton had built a brand new home in Dalby just before Braxton was born. Kirsten said if they had to sell the house they would to pay for the ongoing medical costs . Braxton's parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over - three weeks later he stopped walking altogether. 'The first doctor we went to said it was an ear infection because that can make you wobbly,' Ms Kay said. 'After he stopped walking we went to the best GP in town and he said we needed to get an MRI immediately. We went straight to Brisbane where they told us he had a tumour. 'We were transfered Brisbane Children's Hospital and they did surgery the next day - it all started back then and hasn't stopped.' The constant time away from home is starting to take its toll financially on the family. 'We built a brand new home just before Braxton was born. It's our home but if we have to sell it we will,' Ms Kay said. 'It would just be a lot easier if we knew what it was, but we don’t. I hope there’s someone or something out there that can cure Braxton.' The Braxton Fight Foundation has been set up to raise money for the two-year-old's treatment.

"The ageing process of a woman from infancy to old age is captured beautifully in this timelapse illustration  by Korean artist and illustrator Seok Jeong Hyeon. Mr Seok, who is better known as Stonehouse, has meticulously rendered each of life’s stages in layers, so that a baby swiftly transforms into a growing girl who, in her turn becomes a young lady before the inevitable happens and an ageing woman emerges from the skilful brush of the artist. The four-minute video captures the poignancy of ageing wonderfully as the artist affects minute changes which thoroughly alter the painting, although the features of the 'subject' remain the same throughout. Remarkable work of art: Korean artist Seok Jeong Hyeon adds minute changes to each layer so that an entirely new picture emerges in the end . Step-by-step details in short, swift strokes are added to the painting, which becomes more and more lifelike as it ‘ages’. The face becomes longer, losing its baby fat chubbiness and hair goes through various colour and length changes. Mr Seok manipulates his digital brush skilfully, adding minute changes upon each layer and building a picture of a woman who has left her youth behind and is going towards old age. As the painting becomes ‘older’, the subject too takes on mature gaze. Ageing gracefully: Wrinkles etch the face as the subject loses its flush of youth and heads towards maturity . Coming full circle: The artist skillfully demonstrates the poignancy of growing older in the four-minute video . The artist adds more wrinkles to the picture and an older lady emerges. Hair is now nearly snow-white and the wrinkles have deepened even more and are no longer just constrained to the corners of the mouth and eyes. Skin has lost its elasticity, and sags down. Signs of ageing are most obvious in the neck area, a truly lifelike representation of old age. This level of precise detailing is carried through to the clasped hands, with gnarled and bony knuckles.","Artist Stonehouse transforms a baby to an old woman in minutes .

"Scalpers are cashing in on the prodigious demand for the new iPhone 6 by selling their pre-ordered handsets for exponential prices. Pre orders for the new devices opened in Australia last Friday, causing the Apple page to crash under the pressure. Since then, there has been a spate of ads on sites like eBay, offering pre ordered iPhone's at exorbitant prices. The iPhone six (left) and the iPhone six plus (right) were made available for pre order last Friday in Australia . The iPhone six plus, offered on an eBay ad for $2,999-over $1,600 more than the pre order price . One eBay seller advertised a 64GB iPhone 6 Plus for $2,999. The same  model is advertised at Apple's official online store for $1129. There is little in place to police online scalping, as Apple can only control the prices inside retailers. Tom Godfrey, the head of media at consumer affairs group Choice, warned people to reconsider about paying top dollar for the newest Apple models. 'My understanding is that Apple has done a synchronised release, so our advice is it's better to wait,' Mr Godfrey told Sydney Morning Herald . 'Apart from the fact that you're going to pay a high price, we also know that first-generation phones often come with a lot of bugs. So paying a premium for a buggy phone is not a great idea.'

Mr Godfrey advised consumers to consider some competitive products before they decide to get the newest Apple product. 'The Samsung Galaxy S5 or HTC One M8 are both great competitors to Apple and will come with a lot less bugs and a much smaller price tag,' Mr Godfrey said.

"A husky puppy broke out of her cage and saved a family of five after a suspected arson attack on their home. The 10-month-old dog woke Mark Johnston by pawing at him and barking as he slept downstairs - before bounding up the stairs to alert his partner and three children. A wheelie bin had been pushed up to the front door of the house in Breightmet, Bolton, Greater Manchester, at around 4am on Sunday and set on fire. Scroll down for video . Husky puppy Araya broke out of her cage and woke Mark Johnston and his partner Emma, pictured, saving them from an arson attack on their home . Mark Johnston (pictured with his partner Emma and their children McKenzie, left, Courtney, front middle, and Taylor, right) were asleep in their home when arsonists pushed a wheelie bin against their front door and set fire to it . The  husky, called Araya, forced her way out of her cage under the stairs as smoke was starting to creep under the front door. Mr Johnston, who had been sleeping downstairs as he was due to leave early for work on Sunday morning, said: 'Without Araya, we would probably be dead. 'I was sound asleep and the door between me and the front door was shut so I was not going to wake up. She came in and was pawing at me and barking. 'Everyone was asleep upstairs so you dread to think what might have happened.' Police say they are investigating the blaze after a wheelie bin was pushed against the front door and set alight. The burnt remains of the bin are pictured . Araya (pictured) forced her way out of her cage under the stairs as smoke was starting to creep under the front door (right) After alerting 30-year-old Mr Johnston, Araya went upstairs to wake his partner Emma, 31, and the three children, Marshall, four, Taylor, seven, and McKenzie eight. The couple's other daughter, 13-year-old Courtney, was staying with a friend. Mr Johnston, who called 999 after being woken, used a wet cloth to open the front door, and was met by flames shooting up around the door frame. He said: 'As I was calling the fire brigade, Araya ran upstairs to get the others up. 'The smoke was coming through the door and she has somehow got out of the cage. She must have bent it a lot to force it open. Araya ran upstairs to wake Emma, pictured, and the three children as flames threatened to engulf the front door . Mark Johnston believes Araya may have forced her cage open before waking the family . 'Dogs can sense danger, and that must have been what has happened.' The couple had only had the puppy for a week before the blaze. After the family fled from the home, Mr Johnston was taken to hospital as a precaution after suffering smoke inhalation. Nobody else was hurt. The couple's other dog, nine-year-old rottweiler Tyson, was sleeping behind a closed door in the kitchen. A fire service spokesman said: 'The fire came from a wheelie bin pushed up to the front door.' Police say an arson investigation is underway.","Husky puppy broke out of cage and saved family of five from arson attack .

"A father is fighting to see his four-year-old son after forcing him to stand on the sidewalk with a sign reading 'I hit girls' for an hour. The creative punishment came after Rob Devine discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates. But when Tristan's mother Brittany Tweed heard about the stunt, she called social services and vowed to take full custody of the child. Controversy: Rob Devine (left) forced his son Tristan (right) to hold this sign after hitting girls in school . Mr Devine, of Monroe, Michigan, is now fighting for the right to see Tristan and avoid a penalty. However, he claims he does not regret the move. 'Honestly I just wanted to do what I felt was right for my son,' he told WXYZ. 'I want him to know you can't go out and do these things and expect them to go away unnoticed and expect me not to deal with it.' Ms Tweed has refused to let Mr Devine see Tristan until he has taken parenting classes although she concedes that the CPS may not grant her full custody of the child. She told the news channel: 'I think it's sad for a four-year-old to have to go on one of the busiest intersections holding a sign. Custody battle: Tristan's mother Brittany Tweed (left) has refused to let Mr Devine see Tristan since the stunt . Sidewalk: Ms Tweed said making a four-year-old hold a sign on the intersection in Monroe, Michigan, was 'sad' 'Rob has had issues in his life, and no one put him out on the street and made him use a sign.' The dispute has sparked controversy in the town and on social media. Some tweeted 'this dad has gone too far'. One said: 'Bad parenting all around, had he taught his son how to behave initially, this juvenile parenting tactic wouldn't even be on the table' However, many supported the punishment.

"Britain's most senior civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood has urged businesses to reveal their concerns about independence, it was claimed this morning . Britain’s top civil servant has been accused of asking businesses to warn against independence. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has spoken to company chiefs asking them to publicise their concerns, according to the editor of business newspaper the Financial Times. Lionel Barber told the Today programme that business leaders have been ‘saying privately’ for months that prices will rise after independence and that there will be significant economic costs to independence. He said: ‘We know Jeremy Heywood has been on the phone to business leaders asking them to speak up about their concerns.’ The allegation will spark accusations from the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign that the civil service, which is obliged to be political neutral, has unfairly intervened in the independence debate. But the Cabinet Office tonight rejected the accusation. A spokeswoman said: 'It is simply untrue.' It comes less than a week after Sir Jeremy Heywood dismissed SNP claims that there was a breach of the Ministerial Code after it emerged that RBS was preparing to move its headquarters to England in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote on Thursday. Sir Jeremy wrote to Alex Salmond to say no rules had been broken when the BBC reported that RBS had a contingency plan to move its legal office south of the border. The senior civil servant was replying to Mr Salmond’s call for an investigation into the BBC’s reporting of the move. The First Minister accused the Treasury of briefing the BBC with ‘market sensitive information’ about RBS before the markets opened. Sir Jeremy’s letter said the Treasury had simply been confirming the position after reports appeared elsewhere in the media and there had been no breach of the Ministerial Code. He said: ‘This was not a UK Government announcement - it was simply a confirmation of the Treasury’s understanding of RBS’ contingency planning. ‘In response to .... informed media reports about RBS, the Treasury judged that it was important to set this out - at a time when the UK financial markets were closed - given their overarching responsibility for maintaining financial stability in the UK.’ Mr Salmond today repeated his allegation that the Treasury leaked information to the media. He went on to have a testy exchange with BBC Newsnight journalist Allegra Stratton after she questioned him on what currency an independent Scotland could use. Ms Stratton was questioning the First Minister on his claims the UK would agree to a currency union with an independent Scotland. When asked why he was assuming this to be the case, Mr Salmond, who has accused the BBC of bias in its coverage of the referendum, replied: 'If you had followed the debate you'll know.' Mr Salmond also claims the Prime Minister’s 'fingerprints are all over a scaremongering' campaign being orchestrated by Unionists. Scroll down for video . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond speaks to the media after a photocall  with business leaders at Edinburgh Airport this morning . Mr Salmond has accused the Treasury of releasing market sensitive information about RBS's plan to move its HQ to England in a bid to discredit the 'Yes' campaign . The Scottish First Minister made the accusation during a meeting with Scottish business leaders at Edinburgh Airport. His comments come after a number of banks, businesses and leading retailers voiced their concerns over independence. Voters will decide the future of Scotland when they go to the polls on Thursday. Mr Salmond said: 'When you try to pressurise people, pressurise companies, as the Prime Minister has undoubtedly been doing and indeed the Treasury, then that's a different circumstance. 'I think people in Scotland will know the Prime Minister's fingerprints are all over the scaremongering campaign and the Treasury's fingerprints are all over the bank campaign.'","Sir Jeremy Heywood accused of asking firms to voice their concerns .

"An angry mother attacked bar staff with her stiletto heels and handbag after she was 'caught having a drunken romp' in a nightclub. Angelina Lloyd, 38, was so furious at having her tryst with a mystery man interrupted, she took out her false teeth and went on a rampage. Lloyd, who works as a baker, unleashed a torrent of abuse at staff before hurling one of her high-heeled shoes at doorman Alex Jenkins, hitting him on the head. Scroll down for video . Angelina Lloyd has admitted assaulting bar and door staff after they challenged her over claims of sexual activity with a man in a nightclub . She then punched a barmaid before swinging her handbag at a female bouncer and jabbing her in the chest. She fled the SugarHouse in Colne, Lancashire but was arrested when she returned home. Details of the brawl emerged at Burnley Magistrates Court where Lloyd, from Colne, admitted three counts of assault by beating and was fined £65 and ordered to pay £105 costs. Dominic Howe, prosecuting, told the court the incident occurred on July 25 after Lloyd was seen by fellow clubbers 'engaging in sexual activity with a male' in the nightclub and both were asked to leave. Mr Howe said the man was leaving the nightspot, but Lloyd took exception to being ejected and became abusive. He told the court: 'She swung her handbag at a club worker and punched her in the chest. Lloyd continued to be abusive, approached a bar lady and punched her in the forehead. 'The defendant then hit Alex Jenkins with one of her stiletto shoes.' The incident happened at the SugarHouse nightclub in Colne, Lancashire in July this year . He added: 'She threw both of her stilettos at him. One missed, the other hit him on the head. Fortunately, nobody was injured.' The court heard Lloyd had a previous conviction for being drunk and disorderly, but her defence solicitor claimed the attack was an isolated incident and she had shown remorse. Daniel Frazer, defending, said: 'Passions had been running high at the time, but when she had time to calm down she had thought long and hard and acknowledged her behaviour was unacceptable. 'She says she was doing nothing untoward with this gentleman. It was misconstrued. She was remonstrating and asking why she was being ejected from the club.' The solicitor said that, during the altercation, bakery worker Lloyd says she was pushed by a staff member, causing her to fall to the floor and she reacted by throwing her shoes at him. Mr Frazer said: 'She apologises to all three people who have been subjected to this incident. The defendant has no previous convictions for violence.' Lloyd was unavailable for comment after the hearing.

"'They would see this as a declaration of war by Australia.' With those words, one of the country's best military minds has said what the politicians have been careful to avoid saying. Professor Clive Williams is one of Australia's pre-eminent voices on military intelligence and he says the militant fighters in Iraq and Syria who saw the Americans as a direct enemy to attack, 'now see us as the enemy too'. 'They (Islamic State militants) will see this as a declaration of war by Australia' Professor Clive Williams. 'They now see us as the enemy, just as they have the United States' In announcing the deployment of 600 defence personnel to the Middle East, the Prime Minister warned the operation could take 'many months' He has also cast serious doubt on the involvement of the air force. 'We must remember that these terrorists are not easily visible, in fact they are embedded within the towns and villages and amongst civilians,' Professor Williams said. 'I am not sure what we are doing there with FA-18s, the targets are very small. You can't bomb them so I don't see how they can mount air strikes effectively.' Prime Minister Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis have been at pains to emphasise that Australia will be part of an international coalition and the deployment does not mean Australia was at war nor will there be combat troops on the ground. The PM says the measure of success is 'if ISIL is dislodged, if the Iraqi government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security' 'If ISIL is dislodged, if the Iraqi government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security, that will certainly be a success,' Mr Abbott said. 'You may well see the air element leave by the end of the week and some of the special forces may well leave before then.' It's believed the elite SAS members could be on their way as early as Wednesday. But according to Senator Brandis the decision is simply to 'pre-position Australian forces in the UAE in the event that Australia decides to commit to a multi-national, essentially humanitarian force, to deal with the ISIL insurgency in northern Iraq'. 'We are involved in war-like operations. If we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time. We need a clearly defined mission, go in, achieve it and then get out,' says Independent MP Andrew Wilkie . Independent MP Andrew Wilkie says 'these are semantics really, we are involved in war-like operations'. 'We helped start a war 11 and a half years ago based on a litany of lies. We started a war which continues to this day, so what in fact what we are dealing with today is in part our own making. 'They (IS) are wanting to draw us into this war .. and we are being drawn in. We have to be very mindful of mission creep, if we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time. 'We need a clearly defined mission, go in, achieve it and then get out,' Mr Wilkie said. Senator Brandis (left) says the decision taken by Cabinet was to 'pre-position Australian forces in the UAE in the event that Australia decides to commit to a multi-national, essentially humanitarian force, to deal with the ISIL insurgency in northern Iraq'. Professor Williams (right) claims 'this is alliance politics on our behalf' Prof Williams thinks there is little chance Australian combat troops will be required, even if the operation is drawn out. 'We will train and advise, like we've done previously in Iraq,' he added. 'This is alliance politics on our behalf.' But, equally, he is not confident a successful mission against the Islamic State terrorists if the ground battle is left to local military forces. 'If you really wanted to effectively deal with the terror threat you would have to deal with the Assad regime in Syria and lean on both Saudi Arabia and Qatar - and the US is not going to do that.' Further, he said, was the Iraqi national army 'isn't worth much at all and is not motivated'. 'On the other hand, the Kurdish fighters are very motivated but not very capable.' Prof Williams has been at the helm of terrorism and national security courses since leaving Defence more than a decade ago. Of greater concern, he says, is the impact Australia's decision to commit military forces to Iraq has had in Indonesia. Not very confident of success. Professor Clive Williams says bombing the so-called Islamic State terror group is not an option and local forces are not strong enough or capable of forcing the militants out . 'Terrorism specialists there have made it clear that the chatter in Indonesia has now turned to attacking westerners,' Prof Williams added. The Islamic State terror groups grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq 'which we never effectively dealt with, we never hit them with the killer punch'. Latest figures have those working with IS numbering 31,000 across Syria and northern Iraq. Militants aligned to the so-called Islamic State group march through a town in Syria . A pro-ISIL fighter pictured in the city of Mosul in northern Iraq . 'It's now attracting a lot more people. 2000 have pledged there allegiance in recent days across Indonesia. 'Intelligence shows that just six months ago these groups (in Syria and Iraq) numbered about 12,000, so support has grown considerably,' he said. Mr Wilkie says we are now facing increased terrorist threats because of this decision. 'Every time we interfere in the Middle East we become more of a target,' he said. 'Clearly we are pre-positioning for what is coming next.' 600 Australian defence personnel will be sent to the UAE ahead of likely deployment into Iraq as part of a multi-national operation against 'Islamic State' militants . Unlike other missions, the Federal Government has promised there will be 'no combat troops' on the ground in Iraq but SAS troops are believed to be preparing to leave, perhaps as early as Wednesday . The Independent MP has called on the government to reveal its forward plans. 'Clearly they had (made decisions) some weeks ago and they made announcements now,' he said. 'They are now saying we are only pre-positioning, that's exactly what they said 11 and a half years ago, we were only pre-positioning and no decisions had been made about going to war. 'We are doing what the enemy would like us to do. We must have a very clearly defined mission, apply the resources needed to achieve that mission and then get out.' 'This is a problem for the world and that is why we in Australia are engaged, we need to be engaged, it affects particularly the Western world,' Senator Brandis said. As Australia prepares to deploy its forces, it's expected new counter-terror laws will be tabled in parliament, perhaps as early next week. They will all but prohibit travel to countries like Syria and Iraq, which are areas now designated as terrorism hubs.","Professor Clive Williams is one of Australia's leading military analysts .

"People who consume soft drink are significantly more likely to be overweight and sip more of the sugary beverage than their healthy counterparts, research reveals. An analysis of two government surveys in Western Australia and South Australia has found about 23 per cent of people drink soft drink every day. In both surveys, men were more likely than women to have a soft drink, and beverage consumption decreased with age. Overweight people are more likely to drink sugary drinks over healthy beverages . Curtin University researcher Christina Pollard said people who drank diet refreshments were more likely to be overweight, but overweight and obese people were also more likely to be soft drink consumers. People of a healthy weight drank about 80ml of soft drink a day, while obese people drank up to 152ml. Ms Pollard told the Public Health Association of Australia conference in Perth on Monday that interventions to limit soft drink consumption needed to be developed. She said consumption increased during the warmer months and after a growth in brands' spending on advertising. Young people in particular were not aware of the consequences of drinking sugary beverages, which could cause weight gain, tooth erosion and poor dietary quality when consumed in excess, Ms Pollard said.

Yesterday a coroner ruled that Ms Hooper killed herself and unlawfully killed Joshua. He recorded an open verdict on toddler Sam. The hearing was told a Dutch holidaymaker sent police a photo which showed Ms Hooper and Joshua on the rock in the moments before they fell to their deaths. Other witnesses told how they watched in horror as Ms Hooper walked to the edge of the rock with Joshua on her back and fell. Ms Hooper and Joshua both died from multiple injuries, suffering head and neck wounds, the inquest heard. A pathologist was unable to ascertain what killed Sam. The South Devon coroner Ian Arrow said: 'I am not certain that I can record drowning as his medical cause of death.' Mr Arrow said Sam 'probably died before' the day his mum and older brother fell to their deaths and he said Ms Hooper and Joshua had left their home 'in a hurry' after he died. A Home Office forensic pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said Sam's death was 'suggestive of drowning'. The inquest heard Joshua (left) was seen holding onto his mother's back before the fall and Sam (right) was found in a wet double bed at the family's home in Paignton, Devon . Ms Hooper's father said his daughter had previously taken an overdose, but 'sounded alright' before the deaths . The pathologist said there was no evidence that Sam had been smothered but a bath half full of water was found by police. Detective Sergeant Andy James, from the Major Crime Investigation Team, said people climbing the rock near Bovey Tracey, Devon, saw a woman with a young child. He told the inquest: 'They seemed to be precariously close to the edge of the rock.' A German holidaymaker said Joshua was 'on the back piggy back style walking slowly to the edge' before sitting down. Another tourist said: 'She was standing there with the child on her back. It was flashing through my mind that it was dangerous, standing there. 'There was a child on her back, then she left it and sat there lying down like she was sunbathing. She was looking at me, I was only about five metres away.' The coroner ruled Joshua (right) had been unlawfully killed by his mother but returned an open verdict on Sam . Ms Hooper's father told the inquest in a statement that his daughter was a 'lovely, caring person' After their bodies were later found at the foot of the rock, police broke into the family home and found Sam 'laid out' on a double bed wearing a damp blue T-shirt. He said it appeared Sam had been laid on the bed and the water from his clothes seeped into the bed. The inquest heard from Ms Hooper's father Peter, who said in his statement that his daughter was a 'lovely, caring person'. He said by Christmas 2012 'a little bit of the spark had gone' from Ms Hooper and a week later she took an overdose of pills and went missing. The two boys were taken into care and were returned to her two weeks later. Mr Hooper said what happened in July was 'a complete shock' when she jumped off the rock killing Joshua and herself. He said when he last spoke to her on the phone 'she sounded alright'. Police found the mother and son at the foot of a rock on Dartmoor before breaking into the family home . A police officer at the scene where tourists saw Ms Hooper sitting with Joshua before the fall . Coroner Mr Arrow said he was satisfied Ms Hooper intended to take her own life and it was self inflicted. He said of Joshua: 'On the balance of probabilities his mother jumped from rocks with the deceased on her back. I am satisfied, sadly, he was unlawfully killed.' The coroner said the deaths were 'an intensely sad situation' the families had to bear. After the hearing, the boys' father Neil Patterson, who was estranged from Ms Hooper, made a statement blaming social services for the deaths. He said if social workers had intervened when the boys failed to turn up at school and playgroup then their lives would have been saved. He said he believed that Sam had accidentally drowned in Ms Hooper's bath and said  'the unimaginable sight' of finding him dead led her to fear she would face criminal charges.

"A teenager bullied for having Asperger’s and told he will never walk again after falling 50ft from a bridge . has told of the horrific moment he lost his footing while scrambling to escape his tormentors. Joshua Davies, 18, was running away . from a gang of boys across a river when he plummeted on to rocks below, . breaking his spine in four places and leaving him paralysed from the . waist down. He said he has been picked on . relentlessly over the past five years by a group of younger teenagers, and said the last thing he remembered as he slipped and fell was stones being hurled at him in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd. Joshua Davies, 18, was running away from a gang of boys across a river when he plummeted on to rocks below, breaking his spine in four places and leaving him paralysed from the waist down . The teenager said he has been picked on relentlessly over the past five years by a group of younger teenagers, and said the last thing he remembered as he slipped and fell was stones being hurled at him . The teenager, . who has Asperger’s syndrome, had been working as a ride attendant at a . travelling funfair over the summer, before his accident on August 17. He said: 'The last thing I remember is a stone hitting my foot and then I slipped and fell. 'I’d just got back from Plymouth and I was going into town to catch up with some friends. He was walking with a friend in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, when the pair noticed they were being followed. 'There were three of them. I got anxious and I said we should move, but they carried on following us. 'It was then I heard one of them shout, ""There they are - let’s get them"". 'There were more boys coming from the weir and I started to feel paranoid.' Joshua said he decided to climb the steel supports of the bridge over the River Taff to try to get away from the gang. Joshua said he decided to climb the steel supports of the bridge over the River Taff to try to get away from the gang . 'We started climbing and it did not seem that high,' he said. 'But as we climbed, they started throwing stones at us. 'The last thing I remember is one of the stones hitting my shoulder and then another hit my foot and I slipped and fell.' The teenager’s family believe he was unconscious for a few minutes, while his friend called an ambulance. 'The next thing I remember is lying on the floor with my legs in the water and my back on the rocks,” he recalled. 'I tried to move my legs, but I couldn’t and I got scared.' The ambulance arrived around 3.30pm and he was taken to the University Hospital of Wales. Joshua pictured before the incident. A month after his accident, Joshua is still recovering in hospital, where he has undergone three operations and will not be able to sit up for another few weeks . 'The next thing I knew, I was being put on a spinal board and after that, everything is a massive blur until after the first operation,' he said. A month after his accident, Joshua is still recovering in hospital, where he has undergone three operations and will not be able to sit up for another few weeks. He will then move to Rookwood Hospital in Fairwater, where he is expected to spend the next six months. Despite his injuries, the teenager remains upbeat and looks forward to visits from his sisters - two-year-old Alana-May and 10-year-old Rachel. His brothers Michael, 13, Cameron, 16, and Kyle, 21, have also been paying him regular visits, along with mother Cheryl and step-father Michael. 'My family are coming to see me a lot, which is great, because otherwise the days can seem long,' he said. 'But I am feeling a lot better and I am trying not to let anything bring me down.' Cheryl Morgan, 44, who is a full-time carer for her 13-year-old son Michael, admits she is worried for her family following Joshua’s fall. She said: 'I am scared for my children, especially Michael, who has autism too. I know people pick on him already.' Michael was diagnosed with autism when he was eight months old, which prompted the family to get Joshua checked. He was subsequently diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at 14. His stepfather Michael said: 'He has been forced to avoid certain areas, which has made him a prisoner in his own community. He has felt threatened and been constantly on edge - all because he is an easy target.' Joshua added: 'It made me frightened to leave the house.' Three youths - two aged 15 and one aged 16 - were arrested following the incident and remain on police bail while inquiries continue. South Wales Police have urged anyone with information to contact them on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.","Joshua Davies fell 50ft on to dry riverbed after being chased by yobs .

"Thousands of California residents have been forced to flee their homes as dozens of wildfires tear across forests, neighborhoods and a lakeside resort - charring at least 9,000 acres of land. This year's wildfire season - which usually stretches from May to October - is set to be the most destructive on record, with hundreds of structures and vehicles already destroyed and thousands of acres burned, authorities have said. One blaze, dubbed the King Fire, is roaring through the El Dorado National Forest, which is about 60 miles east of Sacramento. It alone has burned more than 8,600 acres in El Dorado County, threatening 600 structures and forcing 400 people to flee. It is just five per cent contained, authorities said. A separate, smaller inferno about 250 miles north has forced authorities to evacuate residents from more than 1,500 homes. By Monday night, flames from this blaze, the Boles Fire, had charred 350 acres and destroyed 100 homes - and was just 15 per cent contained. The fires come after three years of droughts have left the land covered with bone-dry brush. As temperatures soar to 100 F (38 C), this arid land duels the flames. Scroll down for video .

Another fire, the Courtney Fire, has charred 320 acres east of Yosemite. Around 30 homes have been destroyed and 1,000 residents have been evacuated. It is 35 per cent contained, authorities said on Monday. The Fresno Bee reported that one neighborhood near Bass Lake was hit especially hard, with several homes turned to ash and smoldering embers. The fire began at 1.30pm on Sunday off a road outside of Oakhurst, just south of the entrance of Yosemite National Park, before tearing across forests to the edge of Bass Lake. Stoked by winds, it quickly charred at least 320 acres, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. By Monday evening, the fire had burned 320 acres and was 35 per cent contained, authorities said.

He had been visiting them when they spotted the fire and had just 20 minutes to grab whatever belongings they could. 'It's like a war zone,' Sidman, 46, told the Fresno Bee. Cal Fire Captain Frank Bigelow Jr. told the Fresno Bee that the cause of the fire is still under investigation and said claims of arson were so far 'just rumors'. 'I know people want answers and I think with this one you'll see an answer more quickly than not, but I think it will still be a couple of days before we put it out,' he said.

In Southern California, evacuation orders for 200 homes in Orange County's Silverado Canyon were lifted late Sunday as firefighters contained 50 percent of a wildfire. The residents were evacuated after the fire broke out Friday. The U.S. Forest Service downgraded the fire's size from 2 ½ square miles to 1 ½ square miles due to better mapping of the blaze. Six firefighters have suffered minor injuries, many of them heat-related as the region baked under triple-digit temperatures. A heat wave was expected to last through Tuesday in Southern California, and a smoke advisory was in effect for parts of Riverside and Orange counties. Berlant said crews were making progress on two wildfires that broke out Saturday in Northern California. A wildfire in the Sierra Nevada foothills about halfway between Sacramento and Reno burned 250 acres, destroyed two homes and three outbuildings. The burned homes were in Alta Sierra, a community of some 6,000 people about five miles south of Grass Valley. A 417-acre blaze in Mendocino County destroyed five structures and five outbuildings, according to CalFire. It was 50 percent contained.

"South Korean war veterans were burning Japanese flags and images of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today, after a top Japanese politician defended the use of Korean women as sex slaves during World War II. Former soldiers rallied outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to denounce comments made by Toru Hashimoto, mayor of Osaka, that ‘comfort women’ were necessary to ‘maintain discipline’ in the Japanese Army. The women, mainly from the Korean peninsula and China, were taken from their homes and made to work in military brothels to ‘comfort’ soldiers with sex. Fury: Veterans burn flags with of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, top, and Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto during a rally denouncing Japan in front of Japanese embassy in Seoul . Violence: A man is helped by fellow veterans after they clash with police during the rally in support of the thousands of 'comfort women' forced to prostitute themselves to the Japanese army during WWII . Anti-Japan: Vietnam War veterans chant slogans in front of the Japanese embassy as they demand an official apology for Japan's war crimes . The protest, which saw a large group . of former South Korean soldiers gather in front of the embassy, came . after Mr Abe's December pledge to take back an apology to ‘comfort women’. Soldiers held up banners with . anti-Japanese slogans, punched pictures of Mr Hashimoto and burned and . stamped flags with portraits of Shinzo Abe and the Osaka mayor. South Korean police stepped in to calm the group of elderly men and several were injured in the scuffle that followed. Mr Hashimoto’s comments came amid . mounting criticism at the prospect of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's . conservative government revising Japan's past apologies for wartime . atrocities. Before he took office in December, Mr . Abe had advocated revising a 1993 statement by then-Prime Minister Yohei . Kono acknowledging and expressing remorse for the suffering caused to . the sexual slaves of Japanese troops. Anger: Protesting veterans try to tear and burn a Japanese flag outside the embassy during today's rally . Target: A former soldier sets fire to portraits of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, and Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto during the rally . Point made: A former soldier punches a portrait of Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, who called the Japanese military brothels during World War Two 'necessary' Stomping ground: As the protest escalated, portraits of Shinzo Abe and Toru Hashimoto were thrown on the ground for angry part-takers to tread on to mark their disdain . The remarks hit particularly hard in . China, which was occupied by Japan during the war, and South Korea, a . colony under Japan from 1910-1945. Japan says the matter of compensation . to the ‘comfort women’ was settled under a 1965 treaty establishing . diplomatic ties. In 1995, Japan set up a fund to make payments to the . women from private contributions, but South Korea says that was not . official and so not enough. Earlier today a 91-year-old Japanese . veteran spoke out against the injustice served to the estimated 200,000 . Asian ‘comfort women’. Calm before the storm: The protest began with Vietnam War veterans holding banners with anit-Japan messages and shouting slogans outside the embassy . Not sorry: Both Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto, left, and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, right, has recently made comments disregarding the pain caused to the 'comfort women' of the Japanese Army . In honour: Veterans stand beside a 'comfort woman' statue where they laid flowers before the protest . Masayoshi Matsumoto joined the . Japanese army in 1943 and was sent to occupied China as a medic to help . examine Korean ‘comfort women’. ‘I feel like a war criminal. It is . painful to speak of such things and I would rather cover it up. It is . painful, but I must speak,’ Mr Matsumoto said. Speaking from his daughter's home 25 . miles from Tokyo, the retired Christian pastor said the ‘comfort . women’ had no means of escape from the walled town where his military . unit was stationed. ‘No matter if they wanted to flee, there was no way to escape.’ Atrocities: Japanese war veteran Masayoshi Matsumoto, 91, denounces the use of 'comfort women' by his country . Recalling the conditions in which the . women lived, Matsumoto said soldiers lining up for sex would unfasten . their leg wrappings and lower their trousers so as to waste no time when . their turns came. ‘It was like they were going to the toilet,’ he said. ‘When I think of it now, it was monstrous, but I didn't think so then.’ The Japanese Government has tried to . distance itself from Mr Hashimoto’s remarks, saying its position on . ‘comfort women’ is different. ‘The stance of the government on this . issue is that, as we stated previously, we are deeply pained when . thinking of the women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering. On this point, the Abe cabinet has the . same position as prior cabinets,’ Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide . Suga told a news conference last week, although he declined direct . comment on Hashimoto's remarks.","War veterans protested against Japan revising apology to 'comfort women'

"Ben Crane finished three over par in the final round at the St Jude Classic on Sunday but still managed to hold on to seal his first PGA Tour victory since 2011. Crane failed to shoot a single birdie on the last day at TPC Southwind in Memphis but the American’s 73 saw him card 10 under par for the tournament to finish one shot clear of second-placed Troy Merritt. Crane had led the standings since day one having scored an impressive seven-under 63 in the opening round and followed that up with 65 and 69 in rounds two and three respectively. Winner: Ben Crane holds the St Jude Classic trophy aloft after his victory at TPC Southwind course in Memphis . Recovery: Crane chips out of a bunker in a difficult three over par final round that saw him record no birdies . Form: England's Ian Poulter had the round of the day as he scored a 64 to finish tied sixth . The victory is the fifth of Crane’s professional career. Three players tied for third, one shot behind Merritt, as former US Open champion Webb Simpson hit 66 in the final round to join Matt Every and Sweden’s Carl Pettersson on eight-under. England’s Ian Poulter enjoyed an excellent final day as he shot the lowest score of the round, 64, which included seven birdies. Poulter’s display saw him climb 29 spots to joint sixth alongside James Hahn, Andrew Svoboda, Brian Harman and Billy Horschel all on seven under. Crane started the final day four shots clear but rain delays meant he still had 30 holes to overcome before the close of play. Finishing off the 12 remaining holes of his third round, the 38-year-old carded a three-under 69 and saw his lead cut to three by Merritt who scored 67. Crane’s consistency seemed to desert him at the start of the final round as bogeys at the sixth and ninth gave his rivals plenty of room for encouragement.

The tide swung firmly back in Crane’s favour when Merritt hit a bogey on the 15th to open up a two-shot gap which the leader maintained until the final hole. Landing in a bunker by the green on the 18th, Crane managed to dig himself out before two-putting for bogey and sealing a hard-earned victory.","Crane held on to his lead to win his first PGA Tour event since 2011 .

"A jealous boyfriend beat his 25-year-old girlfriend with a brick, bit her nose and threw a knife at her face because she wanted to go out without him, a court heard. Kieron Hardy, 22, subjected Tammy Armstrong to a shocking 90-minute ordeal in Newcastle-upon- Tyne on Valentine’s Day - tearing off her dress, biting her eyebrow and throwing a laptop at her. Mother Miss Armstrong managed to escape by clambering through a kitchen window, but Hardy followed her, picked up a brick and threw it at her head as she cowered on the ground. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Kieron Hardy (right), 22, subjected Tammy Armstrong (left; and with Hardy, right) to a shocking 90-minute ordeal on Valentine’s Day - tearing off her dress, biting her eyebrow and throwing a computer at her . Now Hardy, who also stabbed Miss Armstrong’s friend in the stomach on Christmas Day, has been jailed for seven years. After the hearing, Miss Armstrong said she feared she would die in the attack. She said: ‘If I hadn’t got away I think he would have killed me. The blood was pouring out of my lip. He said he was going to kill me and I thought he would. I really thought I would be dead. ‘He bit my nose and tried to bite my eyebrow off. He said ""if I can’t have you no one will"". If that’s what he does to someone he’s supposed to love, I dread to think what he would do to someone he hates.’ Hardy’s crime career began at 13 when he and a notorious group of young men known as the ‘Scotswood Hoodies’ brought terror to the streets of the Scotswood area of Newcastle. He has been in and out of prison most of his adult life and Miss Armstrong was aware of his reputation. But despite his criminal record, he had not been convicted of violence against a partner. She said: ‘I knew what he had done in the past but I had never known him to hit women. I wouldn’t have got involved if I had. He was lovely when we first got together and it got serious quite quickly. Horrific: Miss Armstrong (left) said she feared she would die in the attack, which saw Hardy (right) jailed . ‘He said he wanted to settle down and have bairns. I never thought he would hurt me.’  But he went on a horrific campaign of violence when she told him she wanted to go to a rave on February 14. Scary: Miss Armstrong managed to escape by clambering through a kitchen window, but Hardy followed her, picked up a brick and threw it at her . He was on a court curfew and was . wearing an electronic tag, meaning he could not join her, and became . furious - ripping off her dress and leaving her standing in . her underwear. He . then lunged at her and bit her left eyebrow, causing it to bleed. Miss . Armstrong ran to the kitchen to try to escape but the door was locked . and Hardy followed her, shouting. He then picked up an 8in knife and threw it at her from about 7ft. The blade hit her in the upper lip and she fell to the floor. She ran into the living room but was followed by Hardy, who threw a plastic bottle, a laptop and music decks at her, backing her into a corner. Newcastle Crown Court heard he then bit the end of her nose and also sank his teeth into her arm. He then said: ‘Oh God, look what I’ve done to you’. When he went upstairs, she took her chance to get out through the kitchen window, and tried to raise the alarm with a neighbour. But Hardy saw her and followed her out, grabbing her by the hair and pulling it. He picked up a brick and threw it at her, hitting her behind the ear. Miss Armstrong was left with cuts to her head, eyebrow, cheek and arm and bruising to her legs, ribcage, arm and other areas of her body. She also lost a tooth, is scarred for life and is being assessed for nerve damage to her lip. Miss Armstrong said: ‘I was locked in the house for about an hour and a half. At first I wasn’t that scared, I just thought he didn’t want me to go out. But then he punched me all over and ripped my dress off my back. 'Then he came back with a massive kitchen knife. When I saw the knife I knew what he was going to do. And then I got really scared. I just couldn’t believe it was happening. I still don’t believe it now. All I was thinking about was my kids. It didn’t feel real.’ After seeing him sentenced, Miss Armstrong is struggling to believe how she stayed with Hardy. She said: ‘He kept saying sorry and I believed him. I thought things would get better. But I think he was like a ticking time bomb. ‘He said I was his first proper girlfriend and I don’t think he had ever been out of jail long enough to have a proper relationship. He always wanted to know where I was and what I was doing.’ Hardy had already attacked Miss Armstrong’s friend Caitlin Crawford last Christmas, when he stabbed her in the stomach with a screwdriver. Hardy, who has 49 previous convictions, admitted wounding with intent on Miss Armstrong and assault on Miss Crawford. Jailing him, Judge Paul Sloan QC said pictures of Miss Armstrong’s injuries made ‘horrific viewing’. Paul Caulfield, defending, said he was ashamed and embarrassed.","Kieron Hardy subjected Tammy Armstrong to shocking 90-minute ordeal .

"Hundreds of empty iPad Mini boxes were discarded at the European Parliament, prompting fears that bureaucrats are frittering thousands of pounds worth of taxpayers' money. More than 106 boxes were pictured in a corridor at the Brussels parliament last week – with a total cost of £for all the tablets. West Midlands Ukip MEP James Carver posted a picture to his Twitter page, saying: 'Pile of IPAD empty boxes on corridor in EP Brussels yesterday - No doubt, taxpayer funded -Eurocrats can't be subtle.' West Midlands Ukip MEP James Carver posted a picture to his Twitter page, saying: 'Pile of IPAD empty boxes on corridor in EP Brussels yesterday - No doubt, taxpayer funded -Eurocrats can't be subtle' Speaking today he said: 'I walked past and I first thought it was piles of paper, but when I saw it was hundreds of iPad boxes I was appalled. 'It is an astonishing waste of taxpayers' money. I was absolutely flabbergasted that they thought it was necessary to spend more than £25,000 on tablets which are not needed for the job. 'I was headed off to a meeting and I just thought good heavens, I have to take a picture and show people this. 'Countries in the EU are in dire financial straits and this is being allowed to happen. It's a 'let them eat cake' attitude. Mr Carver said: 'I was absolutely appalled. It is an astonishing waste of taxpayers' money' The empty iPad Mini boxes were found in the European Parliament building, Brussels, (pictured) on Wednesday . 'This sort of needless indulgence has to stop. The Brussels parliament is already seen as a money pit and this sort of flagrant waste only serves to underline it. 'Thousands of pounds have been frittered away on luxury gadgets for staff who already work in a building stocked with computers.' The iPad Minis would cost at least £250 each. The TaxPayers' Alliance said these 'extravagant' purchases show how out of touch political elites and bureaucrats have become. Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another example of how little regard Brussels has for taxpayers' money. iPads are a premium product which come with a price tag to match. 'When hard-pressed families across the country, and indeed the continent, are struggling with their everyday bills, these extravagant purchases show how out of touch our political elites and bureaucrats have become. 'Taxpayers deserve better value for their money.' The European Parliament was not available for a comment.

Mr Hodge, who runs fishing and boat trips with his Cornish Fishing business, was fishing when he spotted the enormous creature, which he estimated at more than 12ft long, circling his boat. He said: 'I was fishing on the starboard side and went to the port side to get the deck hose when I saw it.' Mr Hodge said he didn't want to suggest what he thought, but common consensus on his Cornish Fishing Facebook page, where he posted the footage, was that it was either a great white or an oceanic great. David Turner, a shark specialist and author of The Shark Fisherman, said: 'If the fish was was 14ft long, it probably was a great white - it wouldn't be the first off Falmouth.' He said a similar sized shark was seen off Falmouth last year, and said it was most likely swimming around looking for food. Shark aficionado Roger Bowring wrote: 'Looks like a small great white', before adding: 'The more I look at it, the more it looks like a great white.' Other shark watchers suggested it might be an even more deadly oceanic whitetip, a species described by oceanographer Jacques Cousteau as 'the most dangerous of all sharks'.  Four years ago an oceanic whitetip terrorised guests at the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, killing one woman and attacking four others. A source at Falmouth coastguard told MailOnline they hadn't had any reported sightings of a great white . 'We do get sharks of various types off the coast of Cornwall, it's not unusual, but they're primarily the large basking sharks.' Terrifying man-eater: The great white shark has rows of serrated teeth and can smell blood a mile away . Experts said it was a basking shark because of its shape and its fins, and also ruled out other species such as mako, porbeagle, bull shark or thresher. Great whites, made famous by the 1975 film Jaws, weigh 2,000lbs and are feared as man-eaters. They have razor-sharp serrated teeth and can smell a single drop of blood from a mile away. They usually prefer warmer waters than those around Britain, but scientists have warned they may be tempted to the southern British coastline as sea temperatures rise, particularly after a hot summer. Earlier this year a great white named Lydia was spotted 1,000 miles off the south west, having swum 19,000 miles across the Atlantic from America.  Marine biologists said it appeared to be heading for Britain, where the mild weather had left the sea teeming with smaller fish to eat. This afternoon the UK-based Shark Trust played down fears of a killer circling our shores, saying it was most likely a young basking shark. Ali Hood, director of conservation, said: 'We’re yet to have a verified sighting of a white sharks in our waters. We do have an environment that is suitable.' Warm blooded great white sharks live in coastal temperate waters around the world, preferring areas that have lots of seals for them to eat. They have been found in water as shallow as 300metres deep, and waters going down 1,200metres, in locations including Australia, New Zealand, America's west and east coasts, Sout Africa, South America, and off Japan and Korea. Great whites have also been spotted in the Mediterranean. They don't like water that is too warm, so are rarely spotted in tropical waters, and they either swim right at the bottom near the sea bed or up at the top. Where the sharks roam: Great whites live in coastal temperate waters around the world (marked in red) All attempts to keep a great white in captivity have failed because marine biologists have failed to work out the ideal conditions to keep them in.  One great white in Australia had to be released because it kept banging its head against the aquarium wall. As a result, those who wish to see great whites close up have to go diving in shark cages. Last week British expat Paul Wilcox, 50, was mauled to death by a great white in Australia's Byron Bay.  The businessman was doing his regular one-kilometre swim when the shark bit into his leg, leaving him to bleed to death in the water.","Enormous shark was spotted roaming 20 miles off the coast of Falmouth .

"A schoolgirl rape victim is to hire a private detective to track down her attacker, who has been on the run abroad for more than a year after being granted bail. The young Midlands victim was left distraught after Portuguese national Antonio Pedro de Alves, 41, fled the UK just days before his trial last May. He was convicted of raping the then 12-year-old in his absence and sentenced to 11 years. But more than a year on and de Alves has not been traced, despite an international arrest warrant being issued. Antonio Pedro De Alves was convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl in his absence and sentenced to 11 years' jail . Now the girl's mother has revealed that her determined daughter plans to hire a private detective to track down de Alves because of the apparent lack of progress in the case by Staffordshire Police. The victim, now 15, plans to fund the hunt from money due to be awarded to her by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Her mother said: 'We do not know if police have any leads, any sightings, or even if they have spoken lately to police in Portugal, where we believe he is probably living. For my daughter, her life is in limbo. 'She cannot move on while the man who abused her is walking free. 'She is due to receive money ... early next year. She plans to use some of that to hire a private detective to see if they can trace her rapist. 'I am disgusted that she feels she has to do this, but she thinks this could help bring him to justice.' De Alves was living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, when he first contacted his victim via the social website Bebo, claiming to be a sports-loving 15-year-old. Skipped bail: De Alves, 41, was due to stand trial for rape at Stafford Crown Court but was granted bail . Over months he groomed the youngster online and eventually convinced her to meet in a supermarket car park in Cannock. But when the schoolgirl arrived de Alves claimed that he was a relative of the 15-year-old boy, who he said had asked him to meet her because he was running late. The youngster was suspicious and tried to flee, but de Alves pulled her into his car where the attack took place. The schoolgirl reported the attack to police in December 2011 and de Alves was arrested the following January and his computers seized. He was charged in January 2013, but was inexplicably granted bail. He fled abroad shortly before his trial last May. The mother said: 'The police investigation from the very beginning seemed slow and it has all been such a long, drawn out process. We couldn't believe he was allowed bail after being charged, as he was a foreign national who could easily slip abroad. 'My daughter has been so brave, and is now slowly rebuilding her life and hopes to eventually start a university course. We are all so proud of her but she deserves justice.' De Alves was living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, when he first contacted his victim via the social website Bebo, claiming to be a sports-loving 15-year-old . Staffordshire Police issued a statement last night: 'A warrant was issued by the courts after de Alves failed to appear and officers from a specialist investigation team began inquiries to locate de Alves using a variety of tactics. Inquiries are ongoing and Staffordshire officers are in continuous contact with foreign authorities via the National Crime Agency and Interpol. 'While we are making inquiries to locate de Alves we do not have jurisdiction, or power in law, to go to another country until their law enforcement officers have detained the wanted individual. Our officers have supplied the relevant authorities with a significant amount of information and our work with them is ongoing.' The police also insisted the family were 'happy' at the updates they are receiving from the force. 'After hearing of the victim's family's initial dissatisfaction at lack of contact after the court date we agreed a communication method with a single point of contact and remain committed to updating them with any investigative developments. They understand and are happy that this will only be when there is significant news.' But the mother said: 'The police family liaison officers have been wonderful, but there is only so much they can tell us. 'Since de Alves's conviction we have had very little feedback from police about their search for him and have heard nothing substantial about the investigation for months. We have been left in the dark.' The West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that following Alves's conviction and sentencing, an international warrant had been issued for his arrest and passed on to police.","Antonio Pedro de Alves, 41, fled the UK just days before his trial last May .

"A beautician lived a luxury lifestyle after her boxer boyfriend turned to drug dealing to pay for her dream wedding, a court heard today. Natasha Hugh, 27, is accused of spending almost £40,000 of illegal drug money on her lavish lifestyle - buying a pre-wedding holiday in Barbados to get a tan, luxury bridal wear and dental work. Hugh is facing the jail for allegedly using her husband's crime fortune to fund the opulent wedding ceremony with chocolate fountains and casino tables. Scroll down for video . Natasha Hugh, left, is accused of using the proceeds of her husband's drug dealing to fund her luxury lifestyle. Justyn Hugh, right, was jailed for 11 years for running a £500,000 international cocaine ring earlier this year . But her extravagant life came to an end when her 29-year-old husband Justyn - a former light-heavyweight champion boxer - was jailed for running an international cocaine ring. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'This is money laundering. 'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh.' Pretty Hugh splashed thousands of pounds in her home town of Newport, South Wales, during a four year spending spree. A court heard she had a £10,477 wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury four star golf, spa and leisure hotel near Cardiff. The court heard how Hugh allegedly spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,435 on bridal accessories ahead of the ceremony. Hugh, pictured, is accused of spending almost £40,000 between December 2009 and September 2013 . The events manager at the hotel saw her as she got ready for her reception - paying her hairdresser in cash taken out of a 'blue gym bag' bulging with notes. Hugh is also accused of paying for a £3,900 holiday to Barbados using cash, staying at the Almond Causarina hotel on the Caribbean island. Hugh, pictured, denies converting or possession of any criminal material . The mum-of-one allegedly bought a Mini Sytner with almost £5,000 paid in cash - she later exchanged the car for a £19,570 Mini Countryman. She allegedly spent £4,000 on hairdressing equipment for a beauty salon she set up called Glamorous U. Cardiff Crown Court heard how she also spent £13,000 putting her child in nursery. Mr Griffiths added: 'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash instalments. 'She knew or should have known the money had come from crime.' Ex Welsh light-heavyweight champion Justyn was jailed earlier this year after running a £500,000 operation to bring cocaine into South Wales. He was jailed for 11 years for heading up a drugs gang which had links to Albania and the Netherlands. A court heard he worked at a car valet business earning up to £11,964 a year - although he made extra money from his boxing. His wife worked at Admiral Insurance before opening her beauty salon where the court heard her income at it's highest was £12,154 a year. In police interview beautician Hugh repeatedly denied that her husband was involved in illegality. Hugh told officers: 'He doesn't make money dealing drugs - I don't know anything about him dealing drugs.' Natasha Hugh, left, is accused of spending the cash on luxury goods and services, pictured here alongside Natalee Harris, right, from the Sky reality television programme 'The Valleys' Cardiff Crown Court heard mother-of-one Hugh told officers she didn't pay for her lavish wedding in cash - but then changed her story. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths told the court: 'She said none of the reception was paid for in cash. 'She said didn't remember how much the reception cost, she couldn't remember where she bought her wedding dress from or how much it cost. 'And she said she did her own hair for the wedding because she was a hair dresser.' Hugh changed her story in later police interviews to claim the wedding and honeymoon were paid for in cash - but by her father after he sold his house. But Mr Griffiths told the jury her father didn't receive any money for the sale of his house until after the wedding date. She is accused of spending £39,490.08 between December 1, 2009 and September 1, 2013. She denies possessing and converting criminal property. The trial continues. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Hugh's maximum earnings before opening her salon was less than £13,000.

"A mother-of-two has died after being knocked off her bike during a charity cycle ride from Land's End to John O'Groats. Sally Preece was a week into the nine-day challenge when she was struck by a car on the A85 near Loch Earn close to Crieff, Perthshire, on Friday. The endurance athlete, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire was then taken to hospital but died from her injuries the next day. Mother-of-two Sally Preece, who was knocked off her bike during a charity cycle and later died . Now her distraught family have paid tribute to the 49-year-old, who was raising money for the Alzheimer's Society, describing her 'dedicated and cheerful'. Her sister-in-law Suzette Pennell said: 'Sally was absolutely dedicated to anything she turned her mind to. Her family, her work and her cycling. 'She had put in hours of training for the cycle ride and was raising money for the Alzheimer's Society. 'She had run several marathons before, and did really well in the London Marathon. 'She gave that up becayse of arthritis in her feet and started cycling instead.' Mrs Pennell added: 'She was completely dedicated to her family and her two children. 'If there was anything going on in the family she was always at the heart of it, always organising something. 'She never had a bad word to say about anyone, and it’s impossible to say a bad word about her. She was just so nice and lively and cheerful.' Mrs Preece was taking part in the 969-mile organised ride with colleagues from Lloyds Bank when she was involved in the accident on the A85 at around 11am on Friday. She was taken to Forth Valley Royal hospital in Larbert, near Falkirk, where was was joined by family, but she died from her injuries on Saturday. She had hoped to raise £4,000 for the Alzheimer’s Society, but since her death donations have flooded her charity page and today the total amount raised stood at more than £6,000. The incident happened on the A85 near Loch Earn in Crieff on Friday, a week into the nine day challenge . Writing on her own page, Mrs Preece said she was taking part in the ride because she wanted to challenge herself. She wrote: 'As I’ve got older I’ve got worse for accepting challenges! 'Perhaps call it my perpetual mid-life crisis. 'I suppose it started with black belt in karate, then running the London marathon, and finally because all of the above caused arthritis in my feet, I’ve switched properly to cycling. 'This epic ride is going to be harder than all previous madcap ideas! 'Cycling for 9 days averaging 106 miles per day, and then crashing out in a tent, is not everyone’s idea of a “holiday!"" Being bonkers certainly helps. 'But this is nothing compared with dementia and what it can do to sufferers and their families/friends. It is a horrible scary thing and nobody is immune.' A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group said: 'We are shocked and saddened by this devastating news and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Sally at this very difficult time. 'She was a delight and pleasure to work with and passionate about fundraising for charities. She will be missed by everyone that knew her.'

"A couple who hanged their pet dog because they did not want to pay £100 to have it put down have been spared jail. Veronica Reid, 42, and Jon Allen, 27, hatched a gruesome plan to kill pet collie dog, Shandy, with friend Paul Brown, 52. Brown punched the animal in the face as he died after Reid ordered her partner and his friend to 'do anything, shoot him, just get rid of him.' Veronica Reid and boyfriend Jon Allen - who is 15 years her junior - hatched a plot to hang their collie dog, Shandy, to avoid having to pay £100 to a vet . Salisbury Magistrates' Court heard how Allen and Brown inquired about having the dog put down at a vet's practice near their home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire in January over claims it was 'too aggressive'. They were told the animal would have to be assessed and the procedure would cost more than £100. Matthew Knight, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the vet noted the pair seemed concerned about the cost. The next day, the three defendants hanged the dog from a loft hatch at Reid's home in Trowbridge. 'Miss Reid said they discussed how they were going to kill the dog. She said ""Do anything, shoot him, just get rid of him"",' Mr Knight said. The court heard that as the dog died, Reid - who had been left the pet by a previous partner - shut herself in a bedroom so she did not have to watch. The court heard Shandy was punched in the face during his final moments 'to put him out of his misery' Neither Allen nor Brown would admit who climbed into the loft to hoist the dog up and both blamed the other. But Brown did  admit to punching Shandy in the face to 'put it out of its misery' as the dog struggled for life. Mr Knight told the court: 'I would suggest it is a joint enterprise and it makes little difference who actually went into the loft. 'A judicial hanging is from a short drop and breaks the neck. The X-rays showed no fracture - the dog was pulled slowly up.' He added: 'A veterinary report found the dog died as a result of a significant period of pain and distress lasting several minutes. Shandy suffered an unnecessary and painful death as a result.' Magistrates in Salisbury heard Reid told Allen and his friend Paul Brown to 'do anything, shoot him, just get rid of him' before the pet dog was killed . The dog's body was buried in Reid's garden. The RSPCA began investigating in March following a conversation with a neighbour. Allen, who is in a relationship with Reid, told investigators that his girlfriend had 'wanted rid of the dog for a long time'. All three defendants pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to the offence of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Allen and his friend Brown both claimed each other carried out the shocking execution, but the court heard the killing was a 'joint enterprise' Brown, of Exeter, Devon, failed to attend court today for sentencing and magistrates issued a warrant for his arrest. Reid and Allen, both of Trowbridge, did attend and their solicitors told the court they have suffered 'vilification' in the local community. Nick Redhead, for Reid, said she was the sole carer for her disabled 20-year-old daughter and her sick mother. 'She accepts that she knew what was going to happen to the dog,' Mr Redhead said. 'Had the three defendants not co-operated with the RSPCA it is very unlikely it would be a court case at all. 'She is in no doubt as to the gravity of the position she finds herself in today. She has suffered a degree of vilification in her community has a consequence.' Esther Bisgrove, for Allen, said he suffered from learning difficulties. 'He is a man who is greatly ashamed,' she said. 'Mr Allen is appalled by his actions. He has suffered abuse by vigilantes in the community and through social media.' Sylvia Aitken-Sykes, chair of the bench, sentenced Reid to 18 weeks' imprisonment and Allen to 23 weeks' custody - both suspended for 18 months. She told Reid: 'This was a particularly nasty and revolting act. 'The reasons we have suspended your sentence is that you care for two family members and you have shown remorse for what you have done and you co-operated with the RSPCA in their inquiries.' Mrs Aitken-Sykes told Allen: 'It was a particularly nasty thing to do, as I know you are aware of. It was a joint enterprise and pre-planned and resulted in the death of a dog.' Reid was also placed on a tagged curfew, from 9pm to 7am, for six months while Allen was given 300 hours of unpaid work. The collie dog was killed in the attic of the couple's home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire in January . Both were banned from keeping animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £100 towards prosecution costs of £2,845 and the £80 victim surcharge. Inspector Miranda Albinson, of the RSPCA, said she was disappointed with the sentences. 'We were hoping for a lifetime ban on keeping animals but we also respect the court's decision in explaining the reasoning for the sentences,' she said. 'Hanging a dog is a horrific thing to do. Why would you even think it was a suitable way to euthanise an animal? 'There are other options, such as help from charities or payment plans from vets which could have been discussed the next day.' Pictures taken by the RSPCA show the litter-strewn garden where the dog was buried after his death .","Pair were put off at £100 fee for having collie, Shandy, killed humanely .

"Sex for violence? Tarek Mehanna, now jailed, may have written a recruitment poem that promised jihadist recruits an afterlife filled with big-bosomed virgins . A poem purportedly penned by a now-imprisoned American-born jihadist has re-emerged and reveals a decidedly sexual slant to radical Islamist propaganda tactics. According to the New York Post, Pittsburgh-born Tarek Mehanna wrote the sexually charged verses to his friend Ahmad Abousamra, a man now believed to be the ISIS public relations man after he fled the US with the FBI on his tail in 2006. The poem titled Make Martyrdom What You Seek promises 'the Ultimate Prize' for taking a bullet to the heart: 72 untouched virgins. 'Your bargain with your Lord,' Mehanna supposedly wrote, 'is finally complete.' If Mehanna is still writing his poetry, it's from a jail cell. However, the friend he may have helped inspire to become a major threat to the United States remains at large. Abousamra was indicted in 2009 after taking multiple trips to Pakistan and Yemen, where he attempted to obtain military training for the purpose of killing American soldiers overseas, the FBI said. He also traveled to Iraq in the hope of joining forces fighting against the United States, but the exact nature of his activities there is unknown, the FBI said. Now, the FBI believes the American-citizen has joined with ISIS to use his computer skills to spread the extremist group's dangerous propaganda. Propaganda that no doubt makes promises similar to the ones in his old friend Mehanna's poem. Scroll down for video . Inspired?

Because you are all martyrs without fear or grief . Who gave all you had for your precious belief, . You promised Him your souls and He promised you much more . Now you can enjoy what He’s kept in store, . An endless reward for those who stood by . The covenant they made that towards death they would fly, . While graves burn the sinners and squeeze them so tight . You’re shown your places in the Garden, so spacious and bright, . On the Day when Great Terror shall steal all their words . Your souls will rest in the hearts of green birds, . Under the Great Throne with beauty beyond measure . At you ar-Rahmaan laughs, expressing His Pleasure, . Sufficient is this as a heavenly prize . But prepared for you is that never before seen by the eyes, . On your head is placed a crown, one jewel of which is worth . More than all of the jewels contained in this Earth, . You are brought to a gathering with companions so beautiful . The Prophets, the righteous and those who were truthful, . Al-Firdaws, where those of the Right Hand shall meet . Where the soil is white musk, so smooth and so sweet, . You scoop up a handful and throw it in the air . You are relaxed by the rivers flowing everywhere, .

"Labour MP Dr Alan Whitehead, pictured, claimed more than £500 in motoring expenses despite writing an article contemplating a ban on private motoring . A Labour MP who wrote an article contemplating a ban on private ownership of all cars submitted a mileage claim of £1.20 for a three-mile trip in his constituency. Dr Alan Whitehead, who is the MP for Southampton Test outlined his anti-car vision claiming Britain would be gridlocked by 2040. However, Dr Whitehead has submitted mileage and parking claims for £516.60 between 2008 and 2014 which were paid for by the taxpayer. Dr Whitehead was reimbursed sums of between £1.20 and £34 according to figures released by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. On February 18, 2011 Dr Whitehead traveled three miles from his home to his constituency office and submitted a mileage claim for £1.20. Twice in January 2011 Dr Whitehead took his own private car from his Southampton home to his London residence claiming £34 for each of the 85-mile trips. On a journey to the Hampshire Fire Service in Eastleigh, Dr Whitehead received £4 for 'own vehicle mileage' for the ten-mile trip. On August 25, 2010 Dr Whitehead made a three-mile home visit where he also claimed £1.20 for 'own vehicle mileage'. Dr Whitehead sits on the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee and the Energy and Clime Change Committee, and regularly blogs about 'green' issues on his website. In his article for The Guardian, Dr Whitehead said something urgent was required to deal with the country's ongoing traffic problems. He said: 'We need to consider doing something serious. What we need is a considerable expansion of public transport over the next period and a shift from car to bus, train, bike or even feet. The big problem is how to do it. ‘What if the Government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present (hopefully with an increasing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles) but outlawed individual ownership? ‘People would then lease cars individually or as part of a club and the running costs would be included in the lease arrangements. No one would be prohibited from using a car, but the playing field of choice would instantly be leveled.’ Dr Whitehead claimed that unless something drastic is done, Britain would be gridlocked by 2040 . During the 2010/2011 financial year Dr Whitehead claimed £126 in mileage for using his car. Many of the journeys around his constituency were for less than ten miles in distance. In many cases the amount submitted was for less than £2. In 2011/12 his mileage claims increased to £250.60 while in 2012/13 Dr Whitehead did not seek any money for driving his car although he received £126 for parking. During the 2013/14 tax year Dr Whitehead submitted a single parking claim for £14. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill described Dr Whitehead's plan as 'bonkers', adding that the Labour Party had waged a '13-year war' against motorists. Dr Whitehead was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. A Labour spokeswoman said: 'This is not and will not be Labour Party policy.'","Dr Alan Whitehead wrote an article contemplating a ban on private car ownership .

Remembering: The Lord Mayor of Belfast Cllr Nichola Mallon (centre) with other Belfast councillors as they sign a book of condolence at Belfast City Hall for Dr Paisley . ‘Ian Paisley was a remarkable man whose long career in public life has left an indelible mark on all of us who knew him,’ the First Minister said. Ex-first minister and unionist leader Ian Paisley was a firebrand fundamentalist Protestant preacher. The polarising figure’s vehement opposition to dealing with the IRA and extreme anti-Catholic rhetoric was well-known. The bellicose symbol of unionist defiance was famous for bellowing ‘never, never, never’ during a mass protest against Irish government involvement in Northern Ireland affairs in the 1980s. He helped wreck earlier attempts at political accord, became the ultimate protest figure and promised to smash Sinn Fein. But, in a potent symbol of the ground covered by negotiations which largely ended violence, he entered government with republicans in 2007 as Stormont's first minister after republicans lent their support to the police. Eventually his partnership with the former IRA commander and current Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at the head of government led to them being dubbed the Chuckle Brothers. ‘The “Big Man”, as he was known, provided firm and decisive leadership when unionism lacked it most and needed it most.’ Mr . Robinson said the task of remembering and paying lasting tributes to Dr . Paisley was daunting and that no words could properly do it justice. A public memorial service will be held later in the year. Books of condolences were opened today in the City Hall in Belfast and also at Stormont. Dr Paisley died last Friday at the age of 88. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said his professional relationship and friendship with Dr Paisley - the source of much irritation in some sections of unionism and republicanism - should provide food for thought with the Stormont Executive dogged by political stalemate. The Sinn Fein chief said he would leave history to determine Dr Paisley's legacy. ‘I can only talk about my own experience with him,’ Mr McGuinness said. ‘From the word go for some reason we hit it off. ‘We grew to like each other and that, incredible for people undoubtedly who for many decades intensely disliked each other. ‘But we genuinely grew to like each other and in doing so we confounded the world. He certainly made a huge effort.’ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams signed the book of condolence at the City Hall. ‘Many families who suffered the worst excesses of sectarianism may take issue with this, but Ian Paisley is due recognition for reaching agreement with Irish republicans on a peaceful future for all of our people and for the way he fulfilled his role as first minister, alongside Martin McGuinness,’ Mr Adams said. ‘Together they proved that politics can work and that unionists and republicans working together could make political progress and overcome significant political difficulties.’ Mr Adams said Dr Paisley's legacy is a huge challenge for all politicians in Northern Ireland and the current unionist leadership.","Lone piper leads handful of close family mourners today at church graveyard today in Ballygowan, County Down .

"The Massachusetts mother who was found with the dead bodies of infants in her home may have feared her boyfriend, who she said didn't want any more children after their first two, according to her lawyer. Erika Murray, 31, was charged Friday with fetal death concealment and other counts after authorities found bodies in her vermin-infested home in Blackstone, near the Rhode Island border. Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, told The Boston Globe that Murray's boyfriend had told her he didn't want anymore children after their first two. Disturbed: The lawyer for Erika Murray, 31, said that his client 'couldn't figure out how to get out of the prison she created for herself' and was afraid after her boyfriend said he didn't want anymore kids . She secretly gave birth to the two, and in an effort to conceal that the children were hers, told her boyfriend she was babysitting them. 'Try to imagine the kind of fear and sort of loss of control over your life that would lead a woman to give birth to a child alone on the floor of her bathroom. That's was she was going through,' Halpern said. 'This terror just controlled her. She couldn't figure out how to get out of the prison she created for herself,' he added . Halpern said it's wasn't clear to him how much of the fear was attributable to the mental illness he believes Murray has and how much was due to real-life concerns. 'She is clearly mentally ill,' he said, 'because the lengths to which she went to try to hide these children...no one in their right mind would have done this.' Two weeks ago, state officials took custody of Murray's four children, ages 6 months to 13 years, after discovering the dirty conditions of the home. Confined: Investigators found the bodies of three infants in the home, after first finding a neglected infant covered in feces . Condemned: Police say soiled diapers were piled two feet high and in addition to the human infant bodies, there were remains of several animals . Prosecutors and neighbors said included soiled diapers piled up two feet high and the remains of several animals. A medical examiner is currently running tests to determine whether the infants died as newborns or fetuses, and how they died. Halpern says he's optimistic that testing will show the infants were stillborn, and that his client wasn't responsible for harming or killing them. 'I...am eager to see whether the forensic testing confirms that in fact the children that are deceased...were never born alive,' Halpern said. Halpern declined to discuss Murray's relationship with her boyfriend and whether she was scared because she believed he would harm her. He also declined to comment when asked what Murray told him about the three dead babies. The boyfriend hasn't been charged in connection with the dead infants or the conditions in the home, where he also lived. The children first came to the attention of police two weeks ago when a 10-year-old boy who lived in the house went to a neighbor and asked, 'How do you get a baby to stop crying?' said Tim Connolly, a spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. The neighbor went with the boy and found the crying baby covered in feces, but no adults around. Police were called and notified the state Department of Children and Families, which removed the four children — ages 13, 10, 3 and 6 months — from the home. Murray was then charged with two counts of reckless endangerment, and the house was condemned. Based on interviews with the two older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house. That's when they found the remains of three babies, one in a closet on Wednesday and two others on Thursday. Community members planned a vigil for Sunday evening to show support for Murray's children.","Erika Murray, 31, was charged Friday with fetal death concealment after officials found bodies in her bug- and rat-infested home in Blackstone .

"Ashwell Prince has insisted he does not consider Andrew Gale’s curse-laden tirade against him during the recent Roses match to have been racist. Gale, the Yorkshire captain, is alleged to have told Lancashire’s Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country, you Kolpak f*****’ – a reference to the South African’s status as a non-overseas player – and has since been charged with using racist language by the ECB. But Prince, who denied provoking the altercation on the third evening of the match earlier this month, said he was offended only at the manner in which Gale spoke to him. He added that Gale was reported to the ECB by the umpires – and not by him. Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale has become the first county cricketer to be accused of using racial language . Andrew Gale's celebrations were cut short by accusations that he had racially abused Ashwell Prince . Prince’s comments – which were made in answer to a question about whether he considered ‘Kolpak’ to be a term of racial abuse – will be welcomed by Yorkshire, who have stood by their captain following the incident. Prince said: ‘I took offence to the way he spoke to me, that’s the bottom line,’ Prince told Ballz Radio in South Africa. ‘The way the guy approached me and spoke to me – that’s what I took offence to. I didn’t stand there and think, “That may be a racial slur”. ‘What happened was the guy walked towards me and had a go at me and I defended myself. If the ECB feels there’s racial connotations to it, that’s up to them to do whatever they want to do. It’s gone all out of control at the moment. ‘People are calling me a cry baby, but at the end of the day I want to clear it up. I didn’t report this guy to the ECB, the umpires did.’ The newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain Gale .","Andrew Gale accused of abusing Ashwell Prince earlier this month .

"Body found: Police said they found a body they think is Anna Marie Smith, 18, who disappeared earlier this month . Police are confirming the body found outside of Appalachian State University is that of Anna Marie Smith, a student who disappeared after telling her parents she'd been attacked. The remains of Smith, an 18-year-old student at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, were found in a woodland near where she was last seen on the night of September 2. Police in Boone confirmed the discovery today, saying: 'Initial evidence indicates the deceased person found today is Anna Marie Smith'. They had been led to the inaccessible point, surrounded by trees and bushes, after a local reported a suspicious stench, according to the Charlotte Observer. Officers said they found a driver's license and university ID by the body, though they did not comment on how she might have died. During the early stages of the 10-day manhunt it emerged that Miss Smith had told her parents that she had been attacked days before her disappearance. She told her family that she had been at a party with around five other students on August 27, and had been attacked later that evening. She said she could not remember the incident well - and also could not think of a reason for the assault. Dan and Laurie Smith, Miss Smith's parents, mentioned the incident but did not provide full details because they said it may harm the police investigation. Officers added there was 'no evidence' for a sexual element to the attack. Miss Smith was last spotted by the driver of a free transit service which moves students around the town after dark. Manhunt: The body was reportedly tracked down after a local noticed an unusual smell coming from a densely wooded area near the Appalachian State university campus . Family: Laurie and Dan Smith, pictured above at a press conference, said that their daughter had told them about an assault just days before she disappeared . A woman called the Mountaineer SafeRide van from an events venue in the town to Mountaineer Hall, a student housing block on campus. She and friends then took the journey - though the bus driver reportedly told police she could not be certain the woman who got on board was Miss Smith. Mr Smith had headed to Appalachian State to visit his daughter that evening to bring her a laptop and cell phone which she had left at home in High Point, about 200 miles from Boone. Identification: Police say initial evidence suggests that the woman's body is that of Miss SMith . Crime scene: Police cordoned off an area in Boone near where the body was discovered this morning . He arrived at her dorm room on the evening of September 3, almost exactly as she was officially declared missing. She was reported missing the following day, sparking a huge search. Police, including dog units, and volunteers combed the area around the campus, but nothing had been found until this evening. The discovery was also confirmed by Sheri Everts, the chancellor of Appalachian State. She wrote: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with Anna’s family and loved ones during this very difficult time. Having one of our own missing struck the Appalachian community very hard, and this very sad news is heartbreaking for us all. 'The loss of Anna will continue to weigh heavy on our hearts... We had hoped so much that this search would end differently, yet all of these efforts underscore our belief in just how integral each of us is to this community.' Disappeared: Miss Smith had called for a bus to get her across campus on the evening of September 2, and had not been seen since . Discovery: Police said they found a university ID card and a driver's license with Miss Smith's name along with the body . Searches: Police, including dog units, as well as volunteers from campus and beyond had joined the 11-day search . 'Struck us hard': Sheri Everts, the Chancellor of Appalachian State, posted a message to students telling of their collective grief . There are plans for a memorial book to be set up on campus for students to share their memories of Miss Smith. Mourners began posting tributes and messages of condolence to a Facebook page set up to help co-ordinate her search. One said: 'There are no words to express the sadness that I felt when I read that she had been found. May God wrap his arms around you and hold you close during this difficult time.' Another added: 'Praying for your family during this very devastating time.'","Anna Marie Smith, 18, went missing from Boone, North Carolina, on September 2 .

"A doctor could spent the rest of her life in prison if found guilty of poisoning the co-worker with whom she was having an affair. The trial for breast cancer doctor Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo began today in Houston, Texas. The 43-year-old stands accused of spiking her ex-lover Dr George Blumenschein's coffee with antifreeze. The two met working at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and started a casual sexual relationship in 2011, while Blumenschein was living with his long-term girlfriend, Evette Toney. In their opening statements on Monday, prosecutors argued that Gonzalez-Angulo had a 'fatal attraction' to Blumenschein, and poisoned him when she found out that his girlfriend had suffered a miscarriage. Scroll down for video . Obsessed: The trial for Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo began Monday in Houston, Texas. The cancer doctor stands accused of poisoning her ex-lover and co-worker with antifreeze. Gonzalez-Angulo pictured in court on Monday . 'This case is about a woman who was totally obsessed,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney Justin Keiter said. Blumenschein told his lover about the miscarriage last year, at which point Gonzalez-Angula allegedly started to make strange claims. She told her co-worker that she had been getting anonymous and threatening phone calls and that she had been attacked by a man and woman outside her home. On the morning of January 27, 2013, Blumenschein left his home to go to Gonzalez-Angula's house, where they drank a shot of vodka and engaged in oral sex before work. Fatal attraction: Dr George Blumenschein (left) survived kidney poisoning in January 2013. It is believed Gonzalez-Angulo (right) spiked his coffee with a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze . Sickening: Traces of the chemical ethylene glycol were found in Blumenschein's system. The chemical is a common ingredient in automotive antifreeze . Afterwards, Gonzalez-Angula made Blumenschein a cup of special Colombian coffee allegedly laced with ethylene glycol, a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze. Blumenschein drank one cup at his girlfriend's house, and one cup once they got to work, after Gonzalez-Angula packed it in a travel mug. He reportedly complained about the coffee being too sweet, and thought it was strange since his girlfriend knew he preferred black coffee. She reportedly insisted that he drink it, even though it wasn't made to his liking. Serious charges: Above, pictures of Gonzalez-Angulo in Houston, Texas court on Monday. If convicted, the 43-year-old could face a maximum of life in prison . Co-workers: Blumenschein met Gonzalez-Angulo at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas where they both worked . Hours later, Blumenschein began to feel tipsy at work and that evening, he cut himself while making a snack. Knowing something was wrong, Blumenschein drove himself back to work at the hospital where doctors discovered he was suffering kidney failure. Thanks to his quick thinking, Blumenschein survived the poisoning. Gonzalez-Angulo was charged with aggravated assault five months later. However, her defense says there is no conclusive proof that  the coffee was poisoned, and that the prosecution has dramatized the relationship 'to fit a theory that just doesn't match the facts'. 'This man is a distinguished physician who is frankly a committed life-long bachelor,' defense attorney Andy Drumheller said. ' He is going to come in here...all 6-foot-3 inches of him and try to suggest to you that that woman forced herself on him. That suggestion is laughable.' Jurors will also get the opportunity to see surveillance footage of Gonzalez-Angulo in the emergency room with Blumenschein after the poisoning, which the defense believes will prove her innocence. 'That video doesn't point to her guilt,' Drumheller said. 'It points decidedly to her innocence.' It is also alleged that Blumenschein could have ingested the lethal chemicals on a business trip a few days before he got sick. The trial is expected to last two weeks.","Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo stands accused of poisoning her co-worker and ex-lover Dr George Blumenschein with antifreeze .

"The Nationalists are running an offensive misogynistic campaign against female unionists such as J K Rowling, one of Labour's big beasts said today. John Reid, the former Defence Secretary, accused the Yes side of employing the 'language of abuse' at women who speak up for the maintenance of the 300-year Union. And he criticised Alex Salmond's supporters of organising mass rallies and 'street mobs' to intimidate No campaigners. Scroll down for video . Former Defence Secretary John Reid accused nationalists of using the 'language of abuse' to target women who came out against independence . JK Rowling (left) and Michelle Mone (right) have both been targeted by nationalists for offering support to the Better Together campaign . It comes a day after Lord Reid accused the Yes campaign of being anti-English for dubbing MPs who travelled to Scotland last week as Team Westminster. Harry Potter author J K Rowling was subjected to obscene online abuse from so-called 'cybernats' earlier this year after donating £1million to the No campaign. She was labelled a 'specky b******', a 'Union cow bag' and a 'disgrace' by fervent nationalists. Businesswoman Michelle Mone has also been attacked for warning of the dangers of Scottish independence. Lord Reid also criticised Nationalists for their rallies accusing the BBC of bias after its political editor Nick Robinson posed tough questions to Mr Salmond. The former Labour Cabinet minister said: 'The language that I worry about is the language of abuse towards not only men, but women in particular - J K Rowling, Michelle Mone, the opponents of separatism. 'The online abuse, the fact they are now demanding that reporters doing their jobs are sacked, the mass rallies, the street mobs - that's what worries me. 'Thankfully I don't think that is anything that is anywhere near the heart of the vast majority of Scottish people. 'I think we should conduct our arguments in a robust fashion but be careful in the language we use.' Lord Reid was speaking at a rally in Glasgow to highlight how independence would put thousands of shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde at risk. He described Mr Salmond as a 'used car salesman' who would not be straight with workers on the Clyde that their jobs could be at risk if the Union is broken. Mr Reid, pictured on the campaign trail in Scotland, also criticised the SNP for organising mass rallies and 'street mobs' to intimidate No voters . Mr Reid also criticised SNP supporters for calling for BBC journalist Nick Robinson to be sacked . 'The interesting thing is that among the people who come to see the workers here in the west of Scotland there has been one notable absence - the First Minister of Scotland,' he said. 'He will not come and look the workers in the eye despite repeated requests. 'I've got a simple message. What would you say to a used car salesman who would not look you in the eye when selling you a car? You would no thanks - thanks, but no thanks. 'And that's the simple message to people in Scotland over the next few days. A No vote is one to protect jobs, to create more jobs in the future, for our children and our grandchildren.' Lord Reid said jobs would be under threat because the UK would no longer commission warships from a foreign country - and because an independent Scotland would not need them. 'The amount of money that Alex Salmond is going to spend on defence is going to come nowhere near what the UK puts in,' he said. 'The United Kingdom has never built a warship in its life outside the UK - why would it suddenly do that to please Alex Salmond?' Yesterday, Lord Reid attacked the Yes campaign for describing dozens of English and Welsh MPs who travelled up to Scotland last week to support 'No' as 'Team Westminster'. 'We know what they meant by Team Westminster, don't we? They meant English. 'You cannot build a decent, prosperous Scottish society on the basis of resentment.'","Former Defence Secretary is concerned by the abuse aimed at women .

"A 29-year-old Australian man has plummeted more than 300m to his death while climbing a glacier without a helmet in Canada. Local police identified the man who fell to his death at Stadium Glacier on Sky Pilot Mountain in Squamish - north of Vancouver - as Australian Michael Taylor living in Victoria, the capital of British Columbia. Mr Taylor's family has been notified of his death, the British Columbia coroner's office confirmed. A witness reported seeing an injured man on the mountain to police about 11.30am on Saturday. Police have identified an Australian mountaineer who died in Canada while climbing a glacier as Michael Taylor . It is believed Mr Taylor slipped while not wearing a helmet and was not an experienced mountaineer, Search and Rescue manager Katy Chambers told Pique. It was also believed to be the first time he had climbed with crampons - metal plates with spikes climbers attach to their shoes. Mr Taylor suffered 'massive trauma' to his head. A doctor at the scene conducted CPR until rescue crews arrived 45 minutes later, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The Australian was hiking with another man, Ms Chambers said. 'They were active individuals but I wouldn't call them experienced mountaineers or anything,' Chambers said. The accident happened about a three-hour hike from Squamish's popular Sea to the Sky Gondola. Mr Taylor fell more than 300m off a glacier on Sky Pilot Mountain - north of Vancouver . The coroner's office and the Royal Canadian Mountain Police will continue to investigate Mr Taylor's death. The Australian's death is the second fatal fall on Sky Pilot Mountain this year. In July, Vancouver man Owen Hosford fell to his death after entering an advanced climbing area via the Sea to Sky Gondola. Mr Taylor and his friend were climbing Sky Pilot Mountain with the aim of reaching the summit of the 2,025-metre peak, which is located between Vancouver and Whistler, in British Columbia. A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they were providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian who died in Canada.","The mountaineer has been identified as Australian Michael Taylor, 29 .

"Facing the axe: Jon Reynard had been appointed to run the school after it was put in special measures . A talented headmaster parachuted in to save a failing school is facing the axe - because he is not a Roman Catholic. The rule - laid down by Catholic bishops – means Jon Reynard cannot stay on after turning around the fortunes of Annecy Catholic Primary School in Seaford, East Sussex. He had been appointed to run the school after Ofsted placed it in special measures last year. One parent of a child at the school, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It’s completely contradictory and unfair. The school is the only one in the catchment area not full to capacity. 'Children are allowed to attend if they are not Catholic. Mr Reynard has been fantastic for the school. Our children are happy under his leadership and are progressing well.’ The school had been rated ‘inadequate’ in all but two categories while under the leadership of former headmistress Fiona McGonigle, who left after a damning Ofsted report last October. Mr Reynard was called in to mirror the success he had achieved as headmaster at nearby Seaford Primary School, and was made executive headteacher of both schools last year. Reports by Ofsted said progress is being made at Annecy under his leadership, and it is anticipated that it will receive a good reception from inspectors due to visit in the coming weeks. But he now faces the axe after school governors said a Catholic headteacher needs to be installed. Troubled in the past: Annecy Catholic Primary School (pictured) in Seaford, East Sussex, had been rated 'inadequate' in all but two categories while under the leadership of its former headmistress . A spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton said: ‘To maintain the clear Catholic character of Catholic schools, the Bishops of England and Wales have stated that the posts of headteacher, deputy headteacher and head of religious education are to be filled by baptised and practising Catholics. The Diocese expects all Catholic schools in the diocese to follow this policy.’ Mr Reynard has insisted that he knew the conditions of the post from the start, adding that he had not been asked to leave the school yet, and would remain in his post for now. He said: ‘I’ve come in to help the school improve, which it is, and hopefully get it up to a good standard at its next Ofsted inspection in September or October. We don’t know exactly when.’ But another parent said: ‘We would rather have an outstanding headteacher who is not Catholic, than a Catholic one who is rubbish. This is about our kids’ future at the end of the day, not religion.’","Jon Reynard told he cannot stay on at Annecy Catholic Primary School .

Forty schools are to face lightning Ofsted inspections as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on extremism, declining standards and classroom indiscipline. Inspectors are planning ‘no notice’ visits to prevent schools trying to hastily cover up weaknesses to fool watchdogs. About 40 schools across the country will be targeted in the next two weeks, in the wake of the alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools in Birmingham. Heads are currently given around half a day’s notice of an inspection, but the Prime Minister called for Ofsted to consider scrapping this warning. Sir Michael Wilshaw, head of Ofsted, said he was still considering the feasibility of stopping notice for all school inspections. But in the meantime, he ordered regional chiefs to make more use of current powers, which mean schools over which there is ‘concern’ can face snap inspections. Some schools being targeted are due for an Ofsted check anyway, but others are suspected of having problems including poor behaviour or leadership. Teaching unions last night criticised the plans. Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said zero notice inspections ‘demonstrate a profound lack of trust in school leaders’. Sir Michael also disclosed that Ofsted inspectors had returned to the five schools put in special measures following its Trojan Horse probe. Sir Michael himself last week joined the inspection team at one of these schools, Park View Academy, where he met the acting executive principal and the trustees to check on its progress. The outcome of the visits will be published shortly. The Park View Academy in Birmingham, which was investigated as part of allegations into the Trojan Horse plot . Four separate probes were conducted into the so-called Trojan Horse allegations following the publication of a mystery letter purporting to outline a plot by radicals to seize control of schools. Schools placed in special measures following Ofsted’s inquiry – one of the four probes - were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust, and Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. A sixth, Alston Primary, was already in special measures.","Inspectors are planning 'no notice' visits to prevent schools preparing .

"A music teacher has lost a staggering 11st over the past year, after being inspired by his mother. When his mother and father both lost weight as part of their recovery from life threatening illnesses, Simon Router, 38, from Luton, was inspired to address his own size. At his worst eating upwards of six takeaways a week, Simon’s weight had reached 28st by the time his father Trevor, 67, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012. Simon at his heaviest weight of 28st (pictured) would often eat up to six takeaways a week . Simon, who used to eat three sandwiches for lunch alone, split several pairs of trousers at his largest . Simon was ultimately inspired to lose weight after seeing his mother Valerie not only survive cervical cancer but also lose 7st (Simon and Valerie before their weight loss, left, and today, right) As he underwent radiotherapy to shrink the tumour, Simon’s mother Valerie, 62, discovered she had cervical cancer and began chemotherapy. During his recovery Trevor began to exercise with a trainer suggested to his through the Stroke Association, and as well as aiding his recovery, saw him lose 2st. Valerie, who has now been given the all-clear, also began to use the personal trainer allocated to Trevor during his rehabilitation process, dropping an incredible 7st. Seeing his parents, who had been overweight for years, turn their fight for life into an opportunity to improve their overall health and lose the excess weight, gave Simon the inspiration he needed to tackle his own eating issues. ‘I had known for years my weight was a problem. I’d split a few pairs of trousers over the years but was very very lucky I hadn’t had any major health problems from my size. ‘I had a really tough summer, with both my mum and dad becoming ill. It was one thing after another and I finally though enough is enough. Simon, having completed the swimming portion of a triathlon, lost the weight through a rigorous exercise regime and by totally overhauling his diet . ‘Watching my mum’s amazing recovery was so inspirational for me, and I was soon booking up her trainer to help me with my weight loss. Simon’s personal trainer quickly put him onto a high protein, low carbohydrate diet which alongside his rigorous exercise regime helped him to lose such a substantial amount of weight. In total Simon has now lost 11st, dropping from 28st to 17st. ‘My health and fitness are through the roof. I just completed the HSBC relay triathlon and I’m doing a sprint triathlon in two weeks. In total Simon has now lost 11st, dropping from 28st to 17st (pictured) and hopes to lose more as he continues his training . ‘With all the extra training for that I’m guessing I’m going to lose another few kilos. The weight is just falling off me. A key factor in helping Simon with his new diet and weight loss programme was his use of protein supplements. ‘My personal trainer recommended I try out the PhD Nutrition whey protein shake range which helped me to re-build my protein levels after a hard training session,’ he explains. Breakfast: Big bowl of cereal, typically crunchy nut cornflakes . Snacks: Several sausage rolls . Lunch: Two or three Tesco sandwich meal deals consisting of a sandwich, crisps or chocolate bar, and drink . Dinner: A takeaway like fish and chips . Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs, 2 rashers grilled bacon, 2 grilled tomatoes, grilled mushroom, banana, apple, pint of water and a green tea . Snacks: PHD Diet Whey protein shake . Lunch: Grilled chicken breast, peas, carrots . Snack: Nuts and fruit . Dinner: Grilled chicken and veg. Plus another shake after training . ‘The shakes also worked as the perfect alternative to snacks; where I would usually grab a chocolate bar, or a bag of crisps, I instead made a PhD Belgium chocolate shake which, staved off my hunger and gave me the chocolate kick I was craving.’ Simon’s mother and father –whose tumours growth has been successfully stopped by radiotherapy- are continuing their own new healthy lease on life. ‘They are incredibly proud of what I have achieved,’ Simon says.","Simon used to eat 6 takeaways a week and weighed over 28st .

"Hull have released centre Ben Crooks to enable him to take up a contract with NRL side Parramatta. The 21-year-old was named in the Super League Dream Team just 12 months ago after a sensational first full season in the top flight but he struggled to maintain his form this year and spent the second half of the season playing on a dual-registration with Doncaster. Crooks had a year left on his contract but sought a release so that he could follow in the footsteps of his father Lee, who had a successful spell in Australia with Western Suburbs and Balmain in the 1980s.

"An off-duty New York narcotics agent went on a week-long drinking rampage — and went on to allegedly shoot two friends during yet another boozy night, a report claims. Victor Zambrano Jr., 49, had just left a bar on Manhattan's Upper West Side about 9 pm Friday when one of his two pals — who was concerned about his level of intoxication — asked to see his gun, the New York Daily News reported. Zambrano, an enforcement agent at the New York State Bureau of Narcotics, handed over the .40-caliber weapon to 31-year-old friend Nichola Davidson — but quickly demanded it back, according to the Daily News. The two allegedly began to struggle and the weapon fired off, striking Davidson on the foot and her 42-year-old boyfriend, Sydney Bernard-Whitehead, on his right calf, according to the Daily News.

Plainclothes officers quickly surrounded Zambrano and had a minutes-long standoff before one of the cops knocked the gun out of his hand and tackled him, the Daily News reported. The shooting victims were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries and released shortly after.

'I saw him drunk on Wednesday. He was walking by the church on 82nd Street, and I said ""Hi.""' 'He’s been drinking every day,' another neighbor told the Post. Zambrano was briefly taken to a local hospital complaining of chest pains on Saturday before being arraigned  on charges of assault, criminal possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and reckless endangerment, according to CBS New York. Police are still investigating if the shooting was accidental. 'He got drunk and did something stupid,' son Vic Zambrano III, 22, told the Daily News. 'It just escalated. It could easily have been prevented.'

"A nurse who admitted falling asleep three times during an 'end of life' care meeting with the family of a terminally ill patient has been allowed to continue working. Abosede Sanusi was also found to have incorrectly stated a patient was ready to be discharged and inaccurately completed two patient assessments during a three-month spell in 2012 as a staff nurse at Southend University Hospital, where she failed two medication assessments. She was cleared of a charge of falsifying records in which it was claimed she scribbled out two incorrect entries stating a dead patient was sleeping. Staff nurse Abosede Sanusi admitted falling asleep three times during an 'end of life' meeting at Southend University Hospital in 2012 . The charges came to light while Sanusi was being supervised through a mentorship programme at the hospital. Following a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing at the Old Bailey, Sanusi was only handed an 18-month conditions of practice order, allowing her to continue to work as a nurse while being closely monitored by the NMC. An NMC panel described the nurse's actions as 'deplorable' stating they had brought the profession in to disrepute. Panel chairman Tim Skelton said: 'Your falling asleep during a very sensitive meeting held to discuss the 'end of life' care with a patient's relatives was unacceptable. 'The panel acknowledged that you made an early admission in this respect. 'However it noted that you have not demonstrated a full understanding of the implications of your actions upon the reputation of the profession. 'The panel concluded that your actions in falling asleep three times during such a sensitive meeting were serious and brought the profession into disrepute. 'Similarly ... your inappropriate behaviour by raising your voice on a ward and in front of patients, visitors and colleagues was deplorable.' The staff nurse has since left Southend University Hospital, although the organisation has refused to confirm if she was sacked or resigned. Sue Hardy, chief nurse at the hospital, said: 'We note the findings of the NMC hearing and can confirm that Ms Sanusi no longer works for the trust.'

"A five-year-old boy went missing from school to go and buy a toy - and when his mother discovered he had disappeared, teachers asked her not to call the police. Alfie Quest was allowed to walk out of an open door and through three unlocked gates because staff thought he was being picked up by his mother Kylie at the end of the day. But when she arrived and he was nowhere to be seen, teachers at Ramsden Infant and Nursery School in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria pleaded with her to phone 999, insisting they could find him by themselves. Ms Quest ignored them and asked officers to search for her son, who was found safe 45 minutes later. Plea: Mother Kylie Quest was asked by teachers not to call the police when her son Alfie went missing . 'When I arrived at the school gates to collect Alfie the teachers looked shocked to see me,' the 25-year-old mother said. 'They said he had gone and thought I had already picked him up. They started looking under desks and chairs, and when I said I was going to call the police they asked me not to. 'They were just covering their own backs. I called the police straight away anyway, and officers scoured the area and finally found him.' Alfie crossed a busy road and walked for nearly half a mile to try and buy a toy alien that he wanted. Ms Quest said school workers told her 'we will find him' and urged her not to get the authorities involved. Anger: Ms Quest ignored the workers' pleas and asked officers to search for the five-year-old . Safe: The young boy was found after about 45 minutes and has now left the school . 'I ignored them and phoned the police anyway,' she said. 'It was the right thing to do. 'Anything could have happened to Alfie. I was beside myself. I kept thinking, what if a paedophile had snatched him? 'It was terrifying. The relief was overwhelming when we found him. I started crying, and then he started crying because I was.

"Over the past decade, we women have gone to great pains to avoid the cardinal sin of looking too ‘matchy-matchy’. Confidently clashing colours and patterns, skilfully contrasting wool with leather — there is an art to stylishly mixing and layering clothes. This season, forget all of that, as designers fill stores with perfectly matching separates: top-and-skirt sets and top-and-trouser combos. The head-to-toe effect is that of a layered dress, or a jumpsuit. Experts are calling it an update on the twinset. And we’re not just talking about toning colours, co-ordinates, or smart suits; we’re talking former fashion no-nos, from double denim at Whistles (where the Hana utility trousers, £195, are teamed with a matching shirt for £145), to a monochrome set at LK Bennett (top, £165, trousers, £165), and a bright print top, £18, and trousers, £22, by Ax Paris at over-50s clothing website Isme.com. This Jigsaw skirt and top is a more subtle and sophisticated take on the new twosie trend . Retailers are saying these ‘twosies’ will be this season’s biggest trend, following the recent success of onesies. ‘Matching separates are a really strong trend for autumn and winter,’ says top fashion stylist Catriona Stirling, who works with brands including Burberry, Marks & Spencer and Asos. ‘On the catwalks, at Celine and Kenzo especially, they looked very polished.’ Of course, what you immediately notice about these outfits is that the cost quickly adds up. The Isme set comes in at £40, whereas a jumpsuit from the same range is £30. Jigsaw has a subtly printed blue dress for £129, but the top and skirt come to £196 — though, in this case, the top, at least, is silk. And while a Hana jumpsuit from Whistles is £245, the top-and-trousers set costs £340. Neoprene top, £79, and A-line midi skirt, £89, by Reiss, one of the 'twosies' hitting the high street . Whether it’s catwalk or high street, the story is the same: Erdem’s beautiful brocade top and skirt come to £1,535, while a dress in a similar jacquard is £1,050. So, is this the reason we’re being sold what is, after all, a Seventies throwback? Are retailers trying to get us to spend twice as much? Fashion experts insist it isn’t as calculated as that. ‘It’s not a conspiracy on the part of the fashion industry to try to get everyone to stop buying single pieces such as dresses,’ says Sandra Halliday, editor-in-chief of trends analyst Stylus Fashion. ‘often, as trend cycles go, you’ll have a dress period, and then a separates period — that’s just how it goes. And, don’t forget, even if you buy matching separates, you don’t have to wear them together.’ A range of twosies are already available from patterned tops to subtle skirt combos . Indeed, while retailers may benefit from multiple buys, the customer wins, too, in a number of ways. First, of course, there is only one way to wear a dress or jumpsuit — while separates offer a multitude of options. Even a distinctive set, such as the floral cotton shell top, £59, and full skirt, £89, from Collection by John Lewis, together create a charmingly autumnal ensemble, but can easily be mixed and matched with other items of clothing. Second, if you are one of the millions of women who find it difficult to shop for dresses and jumpsuits as you take different sizes on the upper and lower parts of your body, you can get the look more easily using separates. Take Phase Eight’s Marcie shell top, £59, and A-line skirt, £69, which together look every bit the party dress. Simply match a pair of black, silk evening trousers with a top in the same fabric for an instant jumpsuit that fits perfectly. ‘Twiggy has designed a great black trousersuit with matching jewelled top for her M&S winter collection that would work perfectly for Christmas drinks parties — a great alternative to the classic cocktail dress,’ says Stirling. ‘This combination offers the consumer brilliant value for money, working as a total look, or by teaming the top with jeans and the trousers with a classic, white shirt.’ Perhaps the greatest strength of this trend, though, is that it so neatly straddles both formal and casual styles. Reiss’s neoprene top, £79, and midi skirt, £89, are a perfect example. Individually, they are relaxed, sporty styles; but, together, and co-ordinated with a jacket and smart shoes, they look polished enough for the office. With designers such as Michael Kors showing matching separates for Spring 2015 collections, it’s clearly not a trend that’s going anywhere any time soon.","Retailers are saying these ‘twosies’ will be this season’s biggest trend, following the recent success of onesies .

'These are groups and people who wage war on everything that does not conform to their particular view of the world,' he said. 'These are ideologues of a new and hideous variety who don't just do evil but they exalt in doing evil. 'If they are killed in conflict, they know the risks, they took their chances, they broke Australian law, they are doing something which is a very serious offence under Australian law. The PM says if the likes of Australian citizens and self-proclaimed jihadists like Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar (right) are gunned down by Australian jets targeting militant groups in the Middle East,  'they took their chances' 'I say again to any Australian who might be thinking of travelling to the Middle East to join in terrorist activity - don't. It is very dangerous, it is wrong.' There are up to 60 Australians who have been identified as fighting with terrorist groups in the Middle East. Intelligence agencies believe at least another 100 Australians are supporting terrorist groups in the region also. Mr Abbott also refused to extend an olive branch to any militant who might be having second thoughts, saying 'if you have involved yourself in terrorism you will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time'.","SAS team flies from northwest Sydney to an operating base in the United Arab Emirates .

"It seems almost every day we are treated to another amazing image taken by astronauts on board the International Space Station. But keeping track of all these images of Earth can be a challenge, especially when it comes to finding one observing a specific location. Thankfully, an interactive map has the solution by lets you explore all the images taken at specific points across the world by astronauts on board the ISS. Dave Maclean of the Centre of Geographic Sciences in Nova Scotia has made an interactive space image map (interactive module above). The map compiles images from tweets sent by astronauts and cosmonauts on board the ISS. Each image is given a location tag and can be searched on the map by scrolling around the world Clicking on an image will take you to the original tweet to see what they astronaut said, and it also shows the position of the ISS . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,600 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The map was created by Dave MacLean, GIS Faculty at the Centre of Geographic Sciences of the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC). It includes images posted to Twitter by two astronauts and two cosmonauts currently on the space station during the Expedition 40/41 mission: Alex Gerst, Reid Wiseman, Макс Сураев and Oleg Artemyev. And it also includes contributions from the general public, such as time-lapse videos and more, posted online. The map was created using mapping software ArcGIS Online by Esri. Clicking on a location tag reveals the picture taken at that spot, in addition to providing a link to the original tweet. Each location tag also contains the letter of the first name of the astronaut or cosmonaut who took the image for easy identification. On the map the current location of the ISS is also shown. MacLean tells MailOnline he wanted to create the map ‘to enable lots of people to see the world from ISS perspective over time - and not let a tweet slip by.’ He added that it is also ‘an example of mapping pictures and videos for my students - so they can build similar maps with their topic areas.’ There are many different images to view on the map. This image over Algeria was taken by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev on 23 August 2014 . American astronaut Reid Wiseman took this picture of Karman vortices on a volcano around Fogo Island of Cape Verde in June 2014 . The astronauts are continuing their groundbreaking research on the ISS, with a new crew set to travel to the station next month, while Russian cosmonauts also completed a spacewalk last week. And recently German Alexander Gerst took part in a live Facebook Q&A to answer questions from people on Earth. One included Sir Richard Branson, who asked: ‘What do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years’ time? Pioneers? Guides? Or the norm?’ Gerst responded: ‘My hope would be that in 50 years from now, space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts, but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience I am having right now. ‘Anyway, I hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away.’ Construction of the ISS (shown) began on 20 November 1998.

"A Western Australia primary school teacher has written a letter to his students about a controversial schooling test. The NAPLAN (National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy) is sat by children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9, between the ages of eight to fifteen. The exam tests numeracy, writing, and language conventions such as grammar and spelling. NAPLAN was criticised this year for having an overly challenging writing section, which saw students marks drop considerably lower than in previous years. Len Christie wrote a message to his students after they received the results for the NAPLAN test, a controversial examination of numeracy and literacy . Len Christie has been a principal at Beechboro Primary School for 20 years, and he was nominated for Western Australian principal of the year in 2001 . Beechboro Primary School principal Len Christie included a letter to his students in the weekly newsletter last Wednesday, after they received their NAPLAN results. Christie has been a principal at Beechboro for 20 years, and was nominated for WA principal of the year in 2001. Mr Christie told Nine News the test did not test all of the attributes needed in life. 'I was inspired by reading something similar published by a school in the UK and I thought it was lovely to recognise the fact that you need so many more attributes than literacy and numeracy.' 'While they're fundamentals, they're not the entire picture,' he said. 'In the hearts of family and friends (the students) are very special people. In the school setting, we also value all sorts of other things they do and achieve. 'There's so much more to them than just these aspects'. Mr Christie also said that that 40 per cent of students speak languages other than English at home, and that they speak 35 different languages in total. He does believe NAPLAN is a valuable resource, but that teachers should consider the results within the broader picture. 'What we endeavour to do is make sure it's not taken out of context,' Mr Christie said. 'We use the results as a diagnosis tool so that we can identify areas that we can improve on our learning and teaching program,' The NAPSAN test is sat by children in years 3, 5, 7. It tests numeracy, writing, and language conventions such as grammar and spelling . Mr Christie said the test is not a far measure of literacy since 40 per cent of his students speak languages other than English at home . A copy of the letter Mr Christie sent his students in the school newsletter last Thursday . A copy of the letter is included below: . A Letter to all Students who sat NAPLAN this year . This week you would have received your NAPLAN test results. We are pleased that you tried your very best in these challenging tests and during the weeks and months leading up to them. I'd like you, your family, friends and teachers to remember that these tests are unable to measure all of what it is that makes you the valued person who you are. The people who have created these tests and those that mark them don't know you as well as your teachers know you, to the extent to which I know you and certainly not the way your family and friends know you. They don't know that many children at Beechboro Primary School speak one or more languages other than English. They also don't know that you may be a great singer and dancer or that you can play a musical instrument really well. They also don't know how well you can draw beautiful pictures. They don't know that you have a sense of humour which can bring a smile to your friend's faces and make them laugh or that they can rely upon you to support them when they need a kind and encouraging word. They wouldn't know that you can write poetry and stories, play all types of different sports and have interesting and enjoyable hobbies. They also don't know that you probably accept responsibility for taking care of your brothers or sisters from time to time. They don't know that you have travelled to or come from fascinating places and had amazing experiences. They don't know how much you love spending time with your family and your close friends and they won't know how much you are appreciated and loved by them. You are trustworthy, kind and thoughtful and you try to do your best every day. Do they know that? The NAPLAN test results give you some very specific information about yourself but it can't say everything about who you are and what you have achieved. I hope you are happy with your results and that they inspire you to do even better in literacy and numeracy. Just remember that there is so much more to describe who you are that can't be shown in these scores. Len Christie .

"The largest predator to walk - and swim - the Earth was a terrifying cross between Tyrannosaurus rex, a crocodile and a whale. The discovery was made from fossils dug up in the Moroccan Sahara, which show that the Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur to have adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Weighing 20 tonnes and measuring almost 50ft (15m), the swimming dinosaur was 9ft (2.7m) longer than the largest T. rex specimen known. Spinosaurus had jaws filled with vicious slanted teeth and a snout like that of a massive crocodile. The creature also had powerful forelimbs with curved, blade-like claws ideal for hooking into or slicing prey . It had jaws filled with vicious slanted teeth and a snout like that of a massive crocodile, while its short muscular hind legs were equipped for paddling and resembled those seen in early limbed whales. The creature also had powerful forelimbs with curved, blade-like claws ideal for hooking into or slicing prey. While other dinosaurs, such as T. rex, hunted on land, Spinosaurus pursued sharks and other large fish in the deep river system it inhabited. Plesiosaurs, a family of giant marine reptiles, lived alongside Spinosaurus 97 million years ago, but were not dinosaurs.

Its most distinctive feature was a row of spines that created an enormous sail down the middle of its back. Scientists think it was used for display purposes rather than to trap heat or store fat. Spinosaurus waded and swam after prey like sharks, car-size fish and crocodilians. Until now, all dinosaurs were thought to have been confined to the land. Lead researcher Dr Nizar Ibrahim, from the University of Chicago, said: 'Working on this animal was like studying an alien from outer space; it's unlike any other dinosaur I have ever seen.' The scientists based their findings on new fossils from the Moroccan Sahara as well as specimens in museum collections. Unlike other predators, Spinosaurus had feet similar to some shorebirds that stand on or move across soft surfaces rather than perch. Its feet may even have been webbed.

Pictured is a model in Washington . The 3D digital reconstruction was made possible after a local fossil hunter unearthed a partial skeleton in southeastern Morocco in 2008 near the Sahara oasis town of Erfoud . Spinosaurus's existence has been known for a century since fragmentary remains were found in Egypt by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer. But those were destroyed in a British bombing raid on Munich in 1944. Other partial remains offered mere glimpses of its anatomy. Everything changed when a local fossil hunter unearthed a partial skeleton in southeastern Morocco in 2008 near the Sahara oasis town of Erfoud. Combined with fossils held in various museums and drawings of Stromer's finds, an accurate reconstruction of Spinosaurus finally evolved. But nothing was simple. The remains found by the fossil hunter were spirited out of Morocco, depriving scientists of vital information. They needed to locate him but did not know his identity beyond being 'the mystery man with the mustache.' He was finally found in 2013 and led the scientists to the excavation site. More fossils were dug up there and the missing partial skeleton turned up in the basement of a Milan museum. Dr Ibrahim described Spinosaurus's environment as 'the most dangerous place in the history of our planet.' Its unusual body  resembles mammalian whale ancestors that appeared 45 million years later.

"When you're getting up to no good at work, it's best to avoid having your picture taken - as this Spanish gravedigger recently discovered. The man, identified only as Clemente, posed for a creepy photo while propping up the corpse of a man who had been dead for 23 years. The other man grinning in the picture is  thought to be the deceased's nephew-in-law, while the dead man's niece took the picture on her phone. Digging a hole: The gravedigger, named only as Clemente, has been suspended after posing for a photo with the corpse of man who died 23 years ago. The man's body had been exhumed as his grave was being extended so his recently deceased wife could be added to the tomb, reports The Local. Clemente was pictured wearing his official blue polo shirt emblazoned with the town's coat-of-arms - a fact which will have infuriated officials at the town hall in Guardamar del Segura, near Alicante. After taking the spooky photo, the niece sent it to other family members, who then posted it to social media. Unsurprisingly, it was shared numerous times and seen by thousands of people, leading to an investigation by the town's civil guard, who suspended the gravedigger from his duties. A municipal representative said: 'It was silliness with no justification whatsoever and we will have to take a decision'. Felipe Aldeguer, an elected official from the town, told ABC that the incident was 'unpleasant, miserable', but he added that the digger 'had not acted in bad faith'. Clemente must now wait to see whether he will be allowed to continue his job.","Gravedigger, Clemente, pictured with corpse of man who died 23 years ago .

"Officials at a Massachusetts college are investigating anonymous Facebook postings in which female students claimed they experienced abusive behavior at the hands of fraternity members. Three women attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute wrote online that while they were having sex with a members of a fraternity, other members burst into the room and poured water on them or threw ice and pudding at them. The serious incidents were reported onto a Facebook page called WPI Confessions which allows past and present students to reveal secrets online without fear of identification. Scroll Down for Video . Allegations: Anonymous claims made by women that they were abused by fraternity brothers while having sex are being investigated by WPI in Massachusetts . While the posts have not been verified and do not even reveal where or at which fraternity they occurred at - college officials have said they are taking them very seriously. 'Such posts are deeply disturbing — not only because they allege that such vile acts may have taken place at the hands of some of our own community members, but because these posts offer a warped reflection of the values of this university and the vast majority of its citizens,' the college’s interim president, Philip B. Ryan, said in a letter to the campus community last week and reported in the Boston Globe. The accusatory posts have been removed from the page, but the school of 4,000 students has launched an investigation as they seek to find out which fraternity was involved. The president of the campus Interfraternity Council, Elliott Wiegman said if true, this behavior 'does not have a place in the WPI fraternity community.' The school has also urged anyone with any details to come forward and to contact campus police, or the dean of students. Some who commented on the postings questioned whether WPI 'condoned a culture of violence' - which the school rejected. Facebook page: This is the profile picture of the WPI Confessions page which has caused such a stir on the campus of the Massachusetts college . Investigation: WPI's Dean of Students Philip Clay told FOX 25 that the administration was contacted by students that were so concerned about the anonymous posts and the comments that followed, they felt something had to be done . 'The message is not only inaccurate, but is dangerously wrong to send to anyone who may feel threatened, or worse, violated.' Confession pages are common at many college campuses and many have caused controversy. In October a Boston College student went through disciplinary procedures after he wrote on a Web page that he raped three women while attending the school. He turned himself in and admitted his claim was a terrible lie - which was later confirmed. However, Clay said that regardless of whether these allegations were true - a culture must exist at WPI where students can come forward. 'If you’re going to change the campus culture, you need to have an open dialogue,' Clay said.","Official investigation launched at Worcester Polytechnic Institute after female students made allegations of abuse online .

"Ever spent ages swapping batteries in and out of remote controls to find out which ones still have power in them? Next time, just try dropping them on a hard surface and see if they bounce. This is because spent alkaline batteries are more likely to bounce than fresh ones, according to an American electrical engineer whose video demonstrating the phenomenon is becoming an internet sensation. Scroll down for video . When you bounce a dead, or bad, alkaline battery on a solid surface it bounces, while a good battery falls over (pictured). Electrical engineer Lee Hite has created a video to test two theories - outgassing and the anti-bounce theory - to explain why this phenomenon occurs . When you bounce a dead, or bad, alkaline battery on a solid surface it bounces, while a good battery falls over. In a good battery, there is a gel-like substance, while in a bad battery this substance is solid. Mr Hite believes the gel in a good battery works in a similar way to the buckshot in the anti-bounce hammer. A regular hammer will bounce when hit against a surface, but an anti-bounce hammer is fitted with a cylinder full of buckshot. As the hammer hits the surface, the buckshot lags behind the movement, and when the hammer hits the base, the buckshot catches up with it and as the hammer starts to bounce, the buckshot forces it down again. This equalises the force. As the battery hits the surface, the gel catches up and creates a downward force to counteract the upward trajectory in a similar way. In his YouTube video, Lee Hite tests a series of batteries that have expired against a set which have not been used. He demonstrates that a used battery bounces far higher than one that has only just been taken out of the packet. A good battery, he explains, contains a gel-like substance which solidifies as the battery discharges its electricity. While the gel is in a semi-liquid form, it absorbs the energy when the battery hits the surface. An anti-bounce hammer, which contains an internal core of moving buckshot, works in the same way.When . the gel in the battery has solidified it cannot move and the whole . battery bounces, the same way that a solid hammer bounces off a nail. The . theory was greeted with  caution by academics in Britain last night, as . chemistry and  physics departments across  the country tried to test . the idea for themselves. Many said the theory made sense – but few were able to replicate Mr Hite’s results. A . spokesman for the Institute of Physics said there was ‘sound thinking . behind the idea’ but added: ‘Experiments need to be reproducible for . results to be reliable. We’re struggling to replicate the experiment . over here.’ Dr Lee Banting, a . senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Portsmouth, said the . video had convinced him. ‘If the gel in the battery is in a liquid state . it absorbs that kinetic energy – all the energy is gone and the battery . does not bounce back,’ he said. ‘But if it turns into a solid state the kinetic energy pushes it back away from the surface and it bounces.' To test outgassing, Mr Hite dropped a weight on the battery. If there was a build up of pressure, a weight should bounce higher on one than the other. He also drilled holes in the batteries to release this pressure. There was not a 'convincing' difference in the first test, and the bad battery still bounced in the second . In terms of the anti-bounce theory, Mr Hite used hammers to demonstrate. A regular hammer will bounce when hit against a surface, but an anti-bounce hammer (pictured) is fitted with buckshot. As the hammer hits the surface, the buckshot lags behind, and when the hammer hits the base, the buckshot catches up with it . Mr Hite then cut the batteries open to see how the electrolyte in a good and bad battery differs. In a good battery, it has a gel-like substance (left), while in a bad battery it is solid (right). Mr Hite believes the gel in a good battery works in a similar way to the buckshot in the anti-bounce hammer and causes a downward force . Dr . Fred Davis, a chemist at the University of Reading, said: ‘This video . has prompted me and my colleagues to dig out dud batteries from all over . the place to try it out for ourselves.’ He added: ‘The energy output of a battery arises from chemical changes, . which means the material in the battery at the start will be chemically . different from that when discharged. ‘It may be that these changes would influence how it behaves when dropped on to a desk. But I remain to be convinced.’ A spokesman for battery maker Duracell said: ‘This bounce test is certainly not an accurate way to measure battery life.’ He added: ‘While the density of the materials does change as the battery is discharged, it is not indicative to power delivery. ‘As . batteries are discharged, the internal volume increases due to the . expansion of materials. This often makes the battery swell and can play . an important role in how it will balance when dropped.’","Electrical engineer Lee Hite put the bouncing battery theories to the test .

Mr Hite began by bouncing good and bad batteries through a tube .

"A driver has admitted to mowing down and killing his heavily pregnant girlfriend just three weeks before she was due to give birth to their daughter. Daniel Dutfield, 24, today pleaded guilty to running over his girlfriend of six years, Jessica Fenner, 22, near his family home in Morden, Surrey, in July. Miss Fenner, who was just 24 days away from giving birth, was rushed to hospital but casualty doctors were unable to save her and her unborn baby and they died hours later.

Miss Fenner, from Wallington, south west London, was due to give birth to a girl on July 30 . Dutfield mowed down heavily pregnant Miss Fenner on Glastonbury Road, Morden, Surrey (pictured) The couple are believed to have been together since 2008 and had recently moved into a flat when she was killed. She had posted a string of messages on Facebook saying how excited she was about her life with Dutfield. In one message, written on June 26, she wrote: 'So happy with my new flat can't wait to start moving stuff in - feeling excited.' The 21-year-old also posted on June 9 this year saying she felt her life was 'finally' coming together after she found a new flat to live in with Dutfield ahead of the birth of their baby girl. On July 4 last year she told friends that her boyfriend had passed his driving test first time, writing: 'Well done dan for passing his driving test first time so proud of you love u loads x.' The mother-to-be, who worked at hardware store Wilkinsons, also asked for suggestions for the name of her baby girl and posted ultrasound scans showing the baby to friends. Friends struggled to come to terms with the news of Miss Fenner's death. Jenny Meadows said: 'I sincerely cannot believe that such a lovely young women such as Jessica Fenner is gone so soon. 'I used to work with Jessica and every time I was in a bad mood or needed help she was always there for me. 'I will always miss her lovely personality.' Tom Edwards, who went to Stanley Park High School with Miss Fenner, added: 'She was a very nice young lady. She was attractive and friendly and had a lot of friends. I was very sad and upset when I heard the news.' Others took to Facebook to express their sadness. Ally Bee-Bowley said: 'Poor poor Jess... Her whole life ahead of her. RIP Hun.'

"A porn star who was savagely beaten by her MMA fighter ex-boyfriend posted a photo on social media on Sunday showing the stages of her painful, ongoing recovery. Christy Mack was allegedly beaten by her ex Jonathan Koppenhaver - who legally changed his name to 'War Machine' - and sustained a blowout fracture to her left eye, had her nose broken in two places, smashed teeth and internal injuries including a lacerated liver. Miss Mack said she escaped the August 8 attack by running naked out of her back door, climbed the fence and began banging on her neighbor's doors in Las Vegas for help. Scroll down for video . Porn star Christy Mack posted this photo on social media on Saturday to show the progress of her recovery after she was attacked on August 8 by her ex-boyfriend, an MMA fighter . Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, appeared in court this month in Las Vegas. Koppenhaver was arraigned on battery, lewdness, assault and coercion charges in the August 8 attack on Christy Mack and her male friend at a Las Vegas home, but prosecutors charged him with additional felonies including kidnapping and assault . The four-frame picture, posted on Twitter and Instagram, shows Miss Mack two days, two weeks and four weeks after the attack. The last picture is the porn star attending a charity ball for domestic abuse victims on Saturday, smiling and wearing a glamorous dress and flamboyant fascinator. She wrote: '2 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and last night. I’ve had several dentist visits to make eating more comfortable and make my smile look more normal. 'I still have a few more dental visits to go. I’ve had my eyes checked out and made aware that I’m very lucky to have my vision where it is, since the muscle is tethered by the fragments from the blowout fracture in my left eye. 'My multiple nose fractures will be fixed in the next couple of months.' Miss Mack went on to say that doctors told her she will regain movement in her top lip in the next six months and her liver appeared to be healing without surgery. She said that the swelling in her face was slowly going down and she was getting used to the changes in her appearance. She has lost 15lb during her recovery and cut off what was left of her long hair after Koppenhaver took a knife to her locks during the attack. Miss Mack posted the shocking pictures of her bruised and swollen face online just three days after the attack in August . The mixed martial arts fighter known as 'War Machine' pleaded 'not guilty' on September 3 to 32 felony charges including attempted murder in a Las Vegas courtroom. Prosecutors, who originally charged  Koppenhaven with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013. The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaven held without bail, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating Miss Mack so severely she feared for her life. Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Ms Mack (pictured when the couple were together) posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11 . She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Ms Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. Face Forward hosts star-studded gala supporting victims of domestic abuse at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Calfornia on Saturday. Christy Mack attended in a glamorous dress and hat . 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.' Ms Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","Christy Mack was 'beaten by her ex' last month at her Las Vegas home and sustained a blowout fracture to her left eye .

"A teenager who raped a six-year-old schoolboy has been jailed for five years. The 16-year-old from South Tyneside was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of two charges of rape, relating to one incident last year. The teenage attacker, who cannot be named, denied his guilt, which meant the young victim had to give evidence at a trial. Hearing: Jurors at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) convicted the 16-year-old boy of two charges of rape . Judge Brian Forster QC said the youth . must sign the sex offenders register for life and abide by the terms of a . sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years. The court heard that, just months after the sickening rape attack, the boy was convicted of having sex with an underage girl. Judge Forster said the sex attacker, who was just 15 at the time of the offence, knew exactly what he was doing when he attacked the young boy. The judge said: ‘The circumstances were fully considered by the jury during the course of the trial. I had the opportunity to assess you during the course of the trial and I am quite sure you knew what you were doing was very wrong. 'You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction' Judge Brian Forster QC . ‘You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that the long-term impact of this type of offending on a young victim is unknown. 'I noted the way which you answered questions and it is clear to me you knew that what you were doing was very wrong.’ David Callan, defending, said the attacker - who has poor school attendance - has become a hate target and was recently in hospital after an assault.

"The days of unreliable forecasts could be over - as the Met Office has started using a computer programme so powerful it can foretell the weather across every mile of the country. It is hoped the ENDGame model will be able to accurately predict the thunderstorms, black ice, and flash floods which are caused by weather systems too severe or small to be seen by current programmes. The breakthrough comes after the Met Office was criticised for its ‘pitiful’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since Michael Fish’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in October 1987. The Met Office has started using a computer programme that can foretell the weather across every mile of the country. It was criticised for its 'pitiful' forecasts which predicted a dry winter, only for the country to experience some of the worst flooding since records began - including in Somerset (pictured) ENDGame will . work by building a virtual model of the UK. The technology will then . enable meteorologists to pinpoint the weather at 100 metre points on the . ground and up to 11 miles above ground. Last winter forecasters predicted a large area of the country which includes the Somerset Levels – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average. Instead it was confirmed the UK had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began. The Met Office stopped publishing its long-range forecasts for the public to see in 2010, after its disastrous prediction of a ‘barbeque summer’ in 2009 – which ended in washouts throughout July and August. The three-month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners, such as councils,  government departments, and insurance companies. Until now, even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long-term weather conditions. But the latest model, which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale, was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data. Dramatic: A stormy winter this year followed wrongly-placed reassurances from the Met Office . And scientists at the Met Office claim the reliability will improve, estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent. The breakthrough is due to stronger computing power, allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and Arctic sea ice coverage, which impact on the British climate. Dr David Walters, manager of the Global Atmospheric Model Development group, said: This development took 10 years and in the past two years staff from across the Met Office have tested and evaluated its impact and prepared our operational systems for its implementation. Stuff of legend: Michael Fish famously failed to predict the 1987 hurricane - but he relied on others' data . 'In global models, ENDGame's improved accuracy and reduced damping produces more detail in synoptic features such as cyclones, fronts and jet stream winds. The last of these is particularly important for the aviation industry, which relies on accurate forecasts of the jet streams for planning intercontinental flights. 'ENDGame's improved scalability means that we can produce a global weather prediction as quickly as our current operational system, but with its resolution increased from 25 km to 17 km. This enhanced resolution (or higher definition) provides additional improvements to forecast accuracy. Better scalability means that we will be able to further increase the model's resolution on delivery of our next supercomputer.' The programme was designed by Professor John Thuburn from the University of Exeter .

"Two sisters in Philadelphia who learned they would be mothers within a day of one another gave both gave birth to sons with the same synchronicity. Brigid Bink, a marketing manager at Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, went into labor first earlier this week. When her sister, Emily Whitaker, visited her in the hospital, she was prepared to follow her sister's lead. They shared a due date of September 15. Emily Whitaker, left, gave birth to her son Owen on Thursday morning, about 22 hours after her sister Brigid Bink had Jack. Over the preceding nine months, they shared the joys of becoming moms as their bellies slowly ballooned . Born Philadelphia Eagles fans, Owen and Jack will be very close first persons, their parents say, from playing sports together to visiting the shore . 'I brought my hospital bag thinking, ""Okay this will be it,""' Whitaker told KGO-TV. Bink gave birth to her son Jack on Wednesday morning at 7:34am at Abington Memorial Hospital. He weighed seven pounds and six ounces. Whitaker, a middle school teacher, was sent home but went into labor soon after and about 22 hours later gave birth to her own son, Owen, who weighed eight pounds and nine ounces. 'When she called me this morning and told me she had a boy too, I just started bawling,' Bink said. . Colin Whitaker records the first moments of his son Owen, who was born weighing at eight pounds, nine ounces . 'It's still just so surreal - the whole thing is surreal,' she added. 'I can't believe I am a mom. I can't believe my little sister is a mom.' The sisters said they have big plans for the first cousins, who they expect to be very close. 'I see them playing sports together - going to school together,' Whitaker said. 'We got the starting shortstop and the second baseman for the Phillies in 2034 now,' said Lee Bink, Brigid's husband. It wasn't only their births that were in sync. Last winter, Bink found out she and she and her husband were going to have their first child. Whitaker and her husband Colin learned she was pregnant with their first the very next day. The sisters spent the next nine months learning how to be moms together as their bellies slowly ballooned.

"A tourist has seriously injured his back and spine after 'tombstoning' 30ft off a pleasure pier into just 2ft of water. Witnesses said the man in his early 20s was unaware the tide had been going out when he jumped from the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. He was dragged to the beach by friends and taken to hospital as police issued fresh warnings over the craze, which has led to several deaths. Scroll down for video . Injured: Paramedics rescue a man who leaped from the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, yesterday into 2ft of water. He suffered serious spinal injuries after reportedly thinking the water was deeper . Toll: Horrified onlookers watched as the man was stretchered off the beach and into a waiting ambulance . It is not yet known whether the man suffered lasting injuries. The incident happened just before 11.30am yesterday, around an hour after high tide. Paramedics and the Great Western Air Ambulance were called to the pier, which is one of Britain's most popular and had a £39million refit four years ago following a major fire. A South Western Ambulance service spokesperson said: 'It was reported a man in his 20s had jumped from the pier. 'A bystander reported that he thought the man had jumped thinking the water was deeper than it was. Popular: The pier in Weston-super-Mare was rebuilt at a cost of £39million in 2010 following a major fire . As the tourist was taken to hospital, a police spokesman said: 'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters. It is just not worth it' 'The man sustained serious leg and back injuries. We sent a fast response vehicle, an ambulance and the Great Western air ambulance. 'He has been taken by land ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol.' A witness added: 'The guy was with some friends who were on holiday and he jumped off the pier, but he didn't know the tide was going out. 'The water is very still at the minute and it's hard to tell the tide is moving but underneath it's like somebody has pulled a plug. 'He must have jumped 30ft and landed in 2ft of water. He was badly hurt and they had him on a stretcher giving him oxygen.' Closed off: Air ambulance crews were called but the victim was taken to hospital in an ordinary ambulance . Injury: The craze of tombstoning has lead to several deaths. It is not known if the man suffered lasting injuries . Tombstoning is not illegal but police have branded it a 'potentially lethal pursuit'. The craze of tombstoning has lead to a number of deaths in Britain. The UK's first known fatality was Stephen Royston, 24, who jumped 100ft into a water-filled quarry at Kit Hill, Cornwall, in 2003. Last month 18-year-old Cameron Lancaster was found in Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, after reportedly jumping into the deep water in a new take on the 'ice bucket challenge'. And last year 15-year-old Dan Mccullagh drowned after he jumped into the River Nene, Northamptonshire, while ‘tombstoning’ with friends on the hottest day of the year. A police spokesman said: 'This is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous. 'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it. 'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters.

Scroll down for video . A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object, or objects, travelling through the air faster than the speed of sound. They generate enormous amounts of sound energy and sound like a large explosion - as can be heard in the minute-long video. The video of Mount Tavurvur was shot by 58-year-old taxi driver Phil McNamara aboard a small boat on August 29, when he was on holiday. The volcano is located off the coast of Papua New Guinea (marked). It continued to erupt for several days after the eruption was filmed. The volcano explodes every few years .

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is set to spend his second night sleeping under the stars in Arnhem Land on Monday evening as part of his week-long stay in the Indigenous region. A village of tents has been erected as the base from which the country will be run for the week as Mr Abbott and his ministers settle in to their new temporary office in remote Australia. Mr Abbott arrived in the Northern Territory's north-east on Sunday after announcing hundreds of troops would be deployed to the Middle East to join the fight against Islamic State militants. Scroll down for video . A village of tents for Mr Abbott and his ministers has been erected as the base from which the country will be run for the week . Prime Minister Tony Abbott arrived in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory on Sunday . He will spend a week sleeping in a tent running the country from Nhulunbuy . Despite the fact Australia's terror rating has just been increased to high, the Prime Minister maintained he would run the country from Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory for the planned week. It is the same site where the annual Garma Festival is hosted, on the Yolngu ceremonial ground. This stay was an election promise made by Mr Abbott, in which he said he would - along with ministers and parliamentary secretaries - spend time in remote Indigenous communities. He was greeted on Sunday with a traditional Welcome to Country ceremony by the Yirrkala community on the Gove Peninsula in North East Arnhem Land by young and old community members. The Prime Minister was greeted upon arrival with a Welcome to Country cermony . Young and old took part in the tradition, dancing in body paint and cultural dress . The ceremony was by the Yirrkala community on the Gove Peninsula in North East Arnhem Land . The ceremony included traditional dance performed by Indigenous Australians adorned in body paint and playing didgeridoos. Later that afternoon the Prime Minister had tea with Indigenous leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who he also had dinner with on Monday night. Mr Abbott's second day in Arnhem Land was spent visiting local employers at a potential bauxite mine site, a timber mill and a cattle station. Those projects are run by the Gumatj Corporation, chaired by Mr Yunupingu, and designed to get Yolngu people off welfare and into work. Mr Abbott is staying at the same site where the annual Garma Festival is hosted, on the Yolngu ceremonial ground . Later on Sunday Mr Abbott had tea with Indigenous leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu . The region was dealt a blow recently when Rio Tinto suspended work at its alumina refinery - costing about 1000 jobs, which is about a quarter of the town's population. In the coming days Mr Abbott will be joined by his entire Indigenous advisory council and Aboriginal Australia lawyer and land rights advocate Noel Pearson for a dinner on Wednesday evening. Constitutional recognition is sure to be discussed at the dinner and at other stages during Mr Abbott's stay in Arnhem Land, and while it's a priority for Indigenous leaders it's not often discussed among local workers. 'For the Yolngu on the ground they concentrate on their lives,' Gumatj Corporation chief executive Klaus Helms told AAP. On Monday the Prime Minister visited local employers at a potential bauxite mine site, a timber mill and a cattle station . The projects are run by the Gumatj Corporation and designed to get Yolngu people off welfare and into work . The region was dealt a blow recently when Rio Tinto suspended work at its alumina refinery costing the region about 1000 jobs . 'They focus on getting a house, on getting less than 15 people under their roof and being able to buy a car.' Despite this, a time frame for a vote on the recognition could be revealed in coming weeks, though it is unlikely this announcement will be made while Mr Abbott is visiting. 'I think it's important that everyone know where our country is hoping to go,' he told reporters from his Arnhem Land campsite. 'There does need to be a clear process in place with an end point for our consideration.' In the coming days Mr Abbott will be joined by his entire Indigenous advisory council . Constitutional recognition will be discussed during the Prime Minister's stay . Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion says 2017 is the likely date for a referendum, which would fall outside the Abbott government's first term. It would also mark 50 years since 90 per cent of Australians voted to remove indigenous discrimination from the constitution. The original intention of this trip was for Mr Abbott to be completely immersed in Indigenous communities for the entire week, but the crisis overseas is said to have altered that. The Prime Minister will be in regular contact with Canberra and other world leaders for the duration of his stay via secure connections provided by the Australian Defence Force, SBS reported.","The Prime Minister will spend the next week in Arnhem Land .

"A majority of voters say the quality of public services has been maintained or improved – despite government cuts. A survey commissioned by the BBC showed that most voters believe schools, bus services, parks, libraries and bin collections have improved in the past five years, even as budgets have been reduced. Overall, six out of ten people think public services have maintained or improved their quality.The Tories welcomed the poll’s findings, but accused the BBC of failing to give its own poll due prominence in its news bulletins. Glee: David Cameron expressed his delight at the BBC being forced to admit services had got better . Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the corporation had been among the first to scaremonger about the impact of the Government’s austerity measures to reduce Britain’s budget deficit, and accused it of downplaying its own findings that voters do not agree. ‘Their survey obviously didn’t produce the results they expected. It didn’t fit their agenda.

A Tory minister has lashed out at the BBC over its coverage of climate change, claiming it gives too much prominence to sceptics. The Climate Change Minister complained that the publicly-funded BBC still focused on the 'sterile' debate over whether global warming existed when most scientists are firmly in one camp. He told the Science and Technology committee: 'In the case of the BBC they have a very clear statutory responsibility. It's in the original charter to inform. 'I think we need the BBC to look very hard, particularly at whether or not they are getting the balance right. I don't think they are.'He added: 'I think there is too much focus on trying to stimulate an increasingly sterile debate on the science, given the overwhelming body of opinion that there is now in favour of the science, and perhaps if they are wanting to have an active debate they should be talking about the policy responses to that science, rather than the science itself.

"If you're going to pick a fight in New York City, it's probably best to avoid the man known for striking terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. Especially if said man is accompanied by a superhero pal with phenomenal strength, perfect balance and a superhuman speed and agility. But try telling that to Thomas Rorke, 22, who fancied his chances in a fight with Batman and Spider-Man in Times Square on Saturday night. A drunk man fancied his chances in a fight with Batman and Spider-Man in Times Square (file picture) Three men were arrested following the scuffle, including two costumed characters, one of whom was the Caped Crusader (File picture) According to the New York Daily News, Rorke, of Queens, was arrested after becoming involved in an altercation with two men dressed as the popular superheroes. The faux Batman and Spider-Man - Jose  Escalona, 41, and Abdel  Elkshezai, 35 - didn't fare much better in the scuffle and were also arrested. All three men were cuffed at the scene and charged with assault, police said. But other caped crusaders leapt to the defence of their fellow superheroes and blamed a drunk Rorke for the fight. 'He was intoxicated and messing with Batman and they got into it,' said Paul Smith, 50, who also dons the red mask as Spider-Man in New York's Times Square. 'Everybody, no matter what costume they are wearing, has the right to protect themselves. It's like Stand Your Ground in Florida,' he added. Meanwhile, a man dressed as Captain America was quick to defend Spider-man. 'He's one of the best guys, honest, religious,' he said. 'One of the first guys out here.' Police said it was not immediately clear who started the fight. Saturday's scuffle is part of a wider problem of costumed characters getting into trouble while performing in Times Square. In 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for allegedly launching into an anti-Semitic tirade in Times Square, according to CBS New York . In June, the president of the Times Square Alliance called for regulations on costumed characters, saying they have gotten out of control. 'In the last 10 days alone, we've seen two Statues of Liberty arrested, a Spider-Man convicted of harassing a tourist, and now a third character arrested for groping a woman in Times Square,' Tim Tompkins said at the time. 'The situation is out of control and a licensing and regulatory scheme must be put in place,' he added. In April 2013, a man dressed as the Cookie Monster was charged with endangering the welfare of a child after allegedly shoving a two-year-old boy, according to CBS New York. And  in 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for allegedly launching into an anti-Semitic tirade in Times Square. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct following the incident.","Thomas Rorke, 22, fancied his chances in a scuffle with the superheroes .

The coalition of cheetahs played with their mother who allowed her cubs to clamber all over her as they honed their agility skills . This leaping cheetah cub is practicing an aerial assault on one of its siblings, pouncing in a manner which it will use to great effect in later life . Mr Ali first tried to photograph cheetah cubs in 2007 on an earlier visit to Kenya but was unable to find any. He said: 'My first safari was in 2007 and I was quite unsuccessful with regards to capturing cubs,' said Mr Ali, who has been a professional photography since 2006. 'I have tried photographing cheetah cubs since then but still never got the chance. To then have six cubs to shoot was amazing. It was even better having the chance to have all six in one frame.' As part of the set of photographs, Mr Ali captured the cheetah mother interacting with her cubs, allowing them to use her as a climbing frame. Although, even though the cubs were only two months old it was clearly evident that they are skilled predators. According to Mr Ali, unfortunately one of the cubs died the night after he took this wonderful set of photographs . This cub is finishing off the last of its lunch which had just been caught by its mother on the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya . This cub is being licked clean by his mother after finishing some lunch while being observed by Mr Ali through his telephoto lens . He said: 'As it is the first time I have seen a cheetah with her cubs, I really feel like this is my first safari, I couldn't stop taking photos of every action of these cubs. 'I really liked the photo where one of the cubs jumps over one of the others. The first time I saw them they were shy but the longer I spent with them, they started coming closer to us.' As Mr Ali continued photographing the family, they began devouring their dinner. He said photographing the cheetahs from such a long distance was quite tricky as he needed to predict the cubs' next move. One of the cubs seeks an unusual hiding place as it observes its siblings playing from the wheel arch of Toyota Land Cruiser used by the safari organisers . These two cubs are using its mother as a form of step ladder who keeps a watching eye out for any potential danger from lurking predators hiding in the long grass . Even though they are among the most effective killing machines on the African plains, sometimes even a cheetah needs some love . He added: 'The cubs are only about two weeks old. Unfortunately, one of the cubs died but I was not told the reason behind its death other than it may have been killed by a lion or hyena.' 'If you want to freeze a frame or you want to make a motion effect like panning, you should always be ready for any action and take several shots so that you will not skip any frame. 'Understanding the behaviour of the animal also helps you to expect what the animal may do by reading its body language. This cheetah cub instantly betrays the fact that it is in reality a highly skilled hunter, suited to tracking its prey across the Masai Mara game reserve . These two cheetah cubs show why they have the reputation as one of the fastest animals on the planet after they race across the grass at high speed . These three cheetah cubs looked primed to pounce on each other as they develop the techniques needed to become a successful predator like their mother . Sometimes a busy cheetah cub needs to take some time out of its schedule to lean against a section of three and watch the world go by .","The six cheetah cubs and their mother were playing in the Masai Mara when spotted by a wildlife photographer .

"A horrified Vanessa Feltz has spoken of her shock after being subjected to a torrent of online abuse - including being called a c*** and a whore - after going public about being molested live on TV by Rolf Harris. During an appearance on This Morning, the veteran presenter said the abuse had made her 'question my faith in human nature' and added it could dissuade victims from coming forward. 'The response has been so . appalling,' she told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. 'It makes you question your faith in human nature, really. Scroll down for video . Angry: Vanessa Feltz made an angry appearance on This Morning where she told of a week of Twitter abuse . 'I've . been called absolutely everything from a C-word to . a whore. People have said they can't believe it could be true, they've . lost all faith in Rolf Harris' judgement that he could dream of . molesting someone as physically repulsive as [me], said how ugly and . revolting I am. 'It's just horrid and I'm so lucky . that I don't actually go online which has protected me from at least some of it, because I certainly . didn't anticipate [the abuse] and I'm shocked by it really.' Feltz, 52, spoke out about being molested by Harris on Sunday, revealing how the disgraced groped her during a TV appearance 18 years ago. Since then, she has been bombarded with cruel comments, with some even accusing her of telling her tale for cash - much to her fury. 'I didn't sell the story - I wouldn't have . dreamt of it,' she insists. 'I haven't made a penny and why would you want to make . money out of something as horrible as that? Cruel: Feltz revealed how she has been bombarded with malicious comments since speaking out . Cruel: A Twitter user named Jack was among the trolls to write abusive messages directed at the presenter . Nasty: One of the unpleasant tweets posted on Twitter following Vanessa Feltz' revelations . Vile: Feltz told of being 'upset' by the messages, among them the abusive example pictured . 'That's completely untrue and . the only motivation I had was that someone suggested to me that it . would be a good thing to do and that was it.' On Twitter, many of the nasty comments can still be seen, with one, written by a Twitter user named Jack, saying: 'Vanessa Feltz claims Rolf Harris groped her. Surely even Rolf Harris has standards?' Another, Jo Hoskinson, wrote: 'Apparently #RolfHarris groped #vanessafeltz. Really Vanessa? Does someone need some publicity? #jumponthebandwagon' One Twitter user, Rob, wrote: 'If #RolfHarris has touched up #vanessafeltz he deserves another 5 years for p***poor taste.' Another, referred to as Belcher, added: 'Vanessa Feltz, though? You've really let your fans down this time, Rolf.' Adam Tonner remarked: 'Vanessa Feltz is just a stupid b**** that noone likes #doone' Although Feltz says she's tough enough to take the abuse, she admitted to being worried about the impact it might have on other victims of sexual abuse. 'One of the greatest fears that people . who have been abused sexually is is that someone won't believe them or . they'll be castigated,' she revealed. Disgusting: Feltz was groped by the paedophile presenter during this TV appearance in 1996 . Convicted: Rolf Harris, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court,was found guilty of 12 sex charges last week . 'I'm . fine. I'm a grown-up. I'm 52 years old, I haven't read too much . of it and I can take it. I've had quite a few years in the press being . roundly castigated for being fat or being unattractive or whatever it . happened to be. 'Of course you shouldn't have to take it but I'm fine. A . little bit upset, as you can see, my feathers have been ruffled, but . I'll be fine. 'But imagine if I was 17. Imagine if it had been my first . day as a make-up artist on that programme [The Big Breakfast] or imagine if it had one of . the other people who suffered from all the terrible things he did. 'I . think it's a terrible shame, really, that I tell a story about a . convicted abuser and I'm met with a torrent of abuse. I just don't . understand what people who tweet that kind of thing are thinking of.' Harris, 84, was jailed for five years . and nine months at Southwark Crown Court last Friday for 12 indecent . assaults on four victims including his daughter’s best friend and an . eight-year-old. Other victims to come forward this week include singer Linda Nolan who alleged the paedophile molested her when she was 15.

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon. There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs. Since last November, Minecraft has become one of publishing's most successful franchises with a series of compact, illustrated books, too. This includes three guides - Minecraft: Essential Handbook, Minecraft: Redstone Handbook and Minecraft: Construction Handbook - that have already sold more than 6 million copies combined, according to publisher Scholastic. In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured).

"With just two days until the historic vote on Scottish independence, campaigners on both sides are doing everything they can to drum up crucial last-minute support. But when a trio of celebrities egged-on crowds at an anti-independence campaign in London, critics were quick to question their motives - as none of the three speakers was Scottish. Bob Geldof, Eddie Izzard and Al Murray pleaded with a packed Trafalgar Square last night to remain part of the 307-year-old union at a Let's Stay Together rally. Twitter users were quick to express their bemusement, however, with one saying of Irish-born Geldof's involvement: 'I thought it was impossible for my mind to be anymore set.' The campaign came as David Cameron flew to Aberdeen to beg Scots not to rip the United Kingdom apart, with opinion polls continuing to show the vote was far too close to call. Scroll down for video . Bob Geldof appeared at the Better Together rally in Trafalgar Square, London, to the bemusement of many critics . The musician was joined by comedian Eddie Izzard who sported a Union Jack manicure as he told Scots: 'We care' Comedian Al Murray told the crowds which had gathered in London that he liked Britain as it was 'vague' Mr Cameron appeared teary-eyed as he . issued his most emotional plea yet to voters ahead of Thursday's vote: . 'Please don't break this family apart.' Born in Ireland, Geldof said he had an 'immigrant's gratitude' to the union to which he owed 'everything'. ‘I . keep hearing that one of the main reasons we’re having this argument is . that the Scots are fed up with Westminster,' he told crowds. ‘I’d like to tell them we’re all f******* fed up of Westminster.’ He added: ‘If I was Scottish I’d say why not, but I’m Irish so I say why? No is not always negative. 'Before . there was a United States, before there was a United Nations, before . there was a united this, that and the other there was a United Kingdom . and it was an extraordinary meeting of very different minds of two . extremely close cousins.

'This is our time to show Scotland that we care. Today’s the day and they’re going to vote on Thursday. 'To anyone in the United Kingdom the breaking up of the UK family is going to be a huge emotional wrench. 'It’s . for the Scottish people to decide, but I don’t know if they know how . much the rest if the UK cares, so that’s why I think it’s a great thing . to have at Trafalgar Square — otherwise how can they sense that?' Presenter Dan Snow wore a 'let's stay together' t-shirt as he answered questions alongside Izzard at the rally . Critics were quick to point out that neither Izzard, Geldof or Murray were born in Scotland . Thousands of people turned out at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square this evening for the event . A woman dressed in a red suit with a Union Jack tie and 'I love Scotland' hat was among supporters . Meanwhile comedian Al Murray said what he liked most about Britain was that 'it's vague'. 'I like being British, it's so vague. The clue is in the name Brit-ish. We're ish'. Critics in the Yes camp took to Twitter to express confusion at the line-up of non-Scottish speakers, however. 'What is . Bob Geldof doing in Trafalgar Square? Is there anything this man won' get involved in?' one user wrote, while another said: 'You're missing . the point. This isn't about you.'

"Olive Garden has defended its practice of giving customers as many breadsticks as they want, saying the policy conveys 'Italian generosity.' The remark is part of a response by the chain's parent company, Darden Restaurants Inc., to a nearly 300-page criticism released by hedge fund Starboard Value last week. Starboard took Olive Garden and its management to task for a litany of issues, including its liberal distribution of breadsticks, its failure to salt the water used to boil its pasta and even the length of the asparagus it serves. Olive Garden has defended its practice of giving customers as many breadsticks as they want, saying the policy conveys 'Italian generosity' after criticism from its new hedge fund owners . Darden's 24-page response doesn't specifically address each of Starboard's criticisms, but states that the company is already implementing a variety of strategies to improve Olive Garden's performance. The company says it has introduced new menu items to underscore value, for instance, and is testing ordering technologies using table-top tablets. Starboard is lobbying to gain control of Darden's board of directors at the company's annual meeting Oct. 10. Darden, which is based in Orlando, Florida, has struggled to boost sales at Olive Garden with the growing popularity of chains such as Chipotle, where people feel they can get food similar in quality to a sit-down restaurant for less money. Under pressure to boost results, Darden recently sold off Red Lobster, which was doing even worse than Olive Garden. But Starboard and others took issue with the sale and wanted the company's breakup structured differently. Starboard also took Olive Garden to task for a litany of issues, including its failure to salt the water used to boil its pasta and even the length of the asparagus it serves . As for its breadsticks, Starboard said last week that Olive Garden was being wasteful because servers weren't sticking to the policy of providing one breadstick per customer, plus an extra for the table. The investor said servers lacked 'training and discipline' and were bringing out too many breadsticks at a time, which also led to cold breadsticks. Starboard noted that it wasn't calling for Olive Garden to stop giving away unlimited breadsticks, but simply exercise more control in how they're distributed. Starboard also said servers were overfilling salad bowls and using too much dressing, which it said drives up costs. In its response on Monday, Darden said that 'Olive Garden's salad and breadsticks have been an icon of brand equity since 1982.' The company didn't say whether it would change the way salad and breadsticks are brought out, however.","Hedge fund Starboard Value has taken the chain to task over a litany of issues in a 300-page criticism .

Several bodies were left lying among the wreckage for nine days after the disaster last month. Local villagers were among some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage, which stretches across kilometres of farming villages. Mr Rutte said the international recovery team has learned that the recovery effort undertaken by local authorities immediately after the crash was more thorough than initially thought. The international team of Dutch, Australian and Malaysian recovery workers was unable to reach the site until July 31 because of fighting in the area between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatist rebels. A separate investigation into the cause of the crash is continuing, Rutte said. A spokesman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is overseeing that investigation, yesterday said preliminary findings due on August 17 won't be ready until several weeks after that date.","18 Dutch, two Malaysians, a Canadian, a German and a Briton were identified .

'These games have been about seeing guys sprinting for the finish line and then turning round to clap the last man in. 'They have been about team-mates choosing to cross the line together; not wanting to come second, but not wanting the other guys to either. 'These games have shown the very best of the human spirit.' 'Many of us here this evening have friends who paid the ultimate sacrifice and are no longer with us; we should take a moment to remember them. ‘And then there are others, perhaps watching at home, at an earlier stage in their recovery or for whom the challenges ahead still seem insurmountable.‘ .

'Many of those injured are young men and women, with their whole lives ahead of them. For those no longer able to serve in the Armed Forces, the future is often uncertain. ‘However, we should be there, ready to support them, if or when they need it. For a few this may mean long term physical and mental support, but for the majority this means fulfilling employment. 'Not special treatment, but to be treated as they were before injury, with respect, admiration and recognition of their considerable talent. ‘As the focus inevitably moves elsewhere; through the work of our Foundation, William and I will continue to draw attention to the challenges facing all those leaving the armed forces, whether wounded or not, to ensure they can do so with purpose, with hope and with confidence.

"Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places by neighbour Andrew Chamberlain (pictured) on their busy terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales . A man broke his neighbour's arm in three places with a four-foot scaffolding pole after a long-running parking feud reached a head. Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places by neighbour Andrew Chamberlain on their busy terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales. Chamberlain, 50, used the metal pole as a weapon on Mr Morgan after the pair argued over him leaving his car outside their homes. A court heard parking was a 'contentious issue' on the street and residents had agreed to only park outside their own homes in Greenfield Terrace. But when Mr Morgan parked outside Chamberlain's home, he became 'abusive and threatening', Cardiff Crown Court was told. He took the large metal pole from his garden, allegedly raised it above his head and tried to batter Mr Morgan - who blocked the blow with his arm. Mr Morgan told the court the impact made a 'hell of a thud'. He said: 'It was excruciating pain as I am sure you can imagine. 'He then brought the bar back as if he was going to hit me again.' Chamberlain told the court he had been threatened by Mr Morgan and used to pole to protect himself. Chamberlain told the jury: 'He was looking for ways to punch me. 'When I lifted the pole up he punched out at me with his left hand. 'As I was bringing the pole down, it made contact with the side of his arm.' But he was found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent. Chamberlain lives wiith his 82-year-old mother who suffers from arthritis and says he needed regular access to assist her.

"Bookmakers have agreed to restrict the advertising of betting machines - dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ - amid growing public unease about their impact. Four major high street betting chains signed an open letter yesterday saying they understood the need to protect young and vulnerable people from the roulette-style games. But anti-gambling campaigners slammed the initiative as ‘window dressing’ and called on the industry to slash the stake on the machines – on which customers can bet £100 a minute – to £2. Bookmakers have agreed to restrict the advertising of betting machines  amid growing public unease about their impact . In a full-page advert in national newspapers, the firms – William Hill, Ladbrokes, Gala Coral and Paddy Power – acknowledged that concerns about the effects of gambling have ‘grown’. They said this is ‘particularly because of the tone of some of the advertising of betting on TV at times when children may be watching’. From October 1, they promised to curb television adverts offering free bets and free money before the 9pm watershed. There will be a total ban on advertising of Fixed Odds Betting machines (FOBTs) in betting shop windows, with a fifth of the space to be taken up with ‘responsible gambling messages’. A new watchdog, the Senet Group, will be set up to police the rules and ‘name and shame’ those who do not comply. Other major bookmakers such as Betfred, the fourth largest bookmaker, and Bet365 one of largest online betting sites, have been invited to sign up. In a full-page advert in national newspapers, the firms – William Hill, Ladbrokes, Gala Coral and Paddy Power – acknowledged that concerns about the effects of gambling have ‘grown' Carl Leaver, chief executive of Gala Coral, said it was a ‘very significant announcement.’ He said the Senet Group would be given the ‘independence, budget and purpose to hold the betting industry to account’. Clive Efford, Labour’s sport spokesman, said the creation of a watchdog was a ‘welcome step’ but added that it had to cover ‘the whole industry’ and ‘must be completely independent of any influence from within the industry’. Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said the industry was offering the ‘bare minimum’ in response to growing political pressure. He said: ‘These measures look like a PR exercise rather than an attempt to help young and vulnerable people, because the central issue of the high stakes on FOBT machines isn’t being addressed.","Four high street bookmakers to restrict advertising of free bets .

"House prices could fall by more than £30,000 if Scotland breaks away from the UK, it was claimed today. Property website Zoopla suggested that a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum could cause as bad a shock to the markets as the financial crisis - while one estate agent predicted that 'every area of the market' would be damaged. Uncertainty over Scotland's economic future and the potential loss of skilled jobs as businesses relocate to England would reduce demand for housing and depress prices, the company said. The comments came as David Cameron flew in to Scotland in a final attempt to shore up support for the Union with just three days to go before the vote. Scroll down for video . Fall: According to property website Zoopla, house prices in Scotland could tumble by as much as £31,000 . Warning: Alex Salmond has faced an assault from big business over his plans for an independent Scotland . Polls are currently on a knife-edge, with most surveys suggesting a slim lead for No but some saying that Yes could pull off a last-minute triumph. The average home in Scotland currently costs £177,599, having risen by 8.3 per cent in the past two years, according to Zoopla. However, a vote for independence would usher in a period of uncertainty over Scotland's future currency and tax rates, which could reduce market confidence and make it harder to get a mortgage. The website points out that house prices are driven by demand, meaning that if top businesses move jobs out of Scotland there would be fewer workers looking to buy and prices would fall. Financial firms such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life have pledged to move to England in the event of a Yes vote, although it is not yet known how this will affect Scottish-based employees. Zoopla said: 'If the economic impact on Scotland is as severe as some recent market commentary has suggested, a Yes vote could potentially create a market shock on a par with the recent financial crisis when house prices in Scotland fell by 17.5 per cent, which would wipe over £31,000 off the value of the average Scottish home and £85billion off the value of the total housing stock in Scotland. 'Uncertainty is never good for markets. It is possible that after all the efforts to create a sustainable recovery a Yes vote could reverse the recent gains and dampen future house price growth for Scottish homeowners. A No vote would remove uncertainty from the market and likely allow the recovery to continue.' Support: But the value of financial assets could be seriously affected by a Yes vote . Spokesman Lawrence Hall added: 'While the impact of the referendum on the Scottish and wider UK economy long-term is hard to predict and there are opposing views, a Yes vote would almost certainly have a detrimental effect on Scottish house prices in the short to medium-term. 'The uncertainties on employment, tax, currency, EU membership and interest rates will all play their part and if big business does head south with a Yes vote, Scotland will lose a significant piece of their service economy with nothing to replace it, leading to a greater supply and reduced demand for housing, and a resultant drop in house prices.' Mark Coulter, an Edinburgh-based estate agent, said that Scottish independence would do 'a lot of damage' due to the uncertainty caused by the negotiations which would have to follow a Yes vote. He told MailOnline: 'Markets don't like uncertainty - if you don't know which government you've got coming, if you don't know what currency you're using.' Mr Coulter - who is currently working on £5million of deals which will collapse in the event of a Yes vote - predicted that the upper end of the property market would be the worst affected, but added: 'Every area of the market is going to suffer.' The disruption could last for longer than the 18 months which the Scottish government has set out as a timetable for independence, he claimed. Many estate agents have declined to comment on the market's prospects, but Mr Coulter said he had 'a moral obligation to speak out'. Opposition: Supporters of the Union have repeatedly pointed out the dangers of independence . Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said that house prices had been rising thanks to the UK's economic recovery and the policies of the Westminster Government. 'Homeowners in Scotland will be deeply worried by this news,' he said. 'Millions of Scots have worked hard to own their home, and many more aspire to do so. 'This is yet another example of how Salmond's reckless drive to a separate Scotland would hit our pockets and household budgets.' In a separate report, Rightmove said today that Scottish independence would jeopardise house prices across the UK due to the uncertainty about how Britain's assets would be divided. 'Even the very debate around Scottish independence and possible implications for the economic outlook for the rest of the UK could cause uncertainty in the minds of potential home-movers contemplating a large long-term financial commitment,' an analyst said. The house price predictions are the latest bad news for Alex Salmond to emanate from the financial world, after a think-tank warned that the government of an independent Scotland would face a £14billion black hole in its public finances. Last week, Deutsche Bank compared the prospect of independence to the Great Depression, while the governor of the Bank of England predicted that Scotland would have to build up huge capital reserves, which would to a period of swingeing austerity.","Property website Zoopla warns of shock as bad as the financial crisis .

"A man who groped an 18-year-old girl's leg on a train was caught after she covertly snapped him on her mobile phone.

He was arrested by the British Transport Police and taken to court after the photograph was released. Scroll down for video . Raja Hussain, 39, from Rotherham, who sexually assaulted an 18-year-old girl on a train from Sheffield, was caught after she took this picture of him . The 18-year-old student was waiting for a train at Sheffield Midland station on October 29 last year when Hussain started 'grinning' at her, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Catherine Duffy, prosecuting, said that the victim felt 'intimidated' after Hussain sat down next to her and started looking at pictures of naked women on his mobile phone. She said: 'The defendant was looking at pictures of naked women on his mobile phone. He moved closer to the complainant and began to take off his jacket. As he did so he touched her.' The student edged away but his body remained in contact with hers and he touched her leg while 'grinning'. Hussain got off the train at Rotherham station (pictured), South Yorkshire, after assaulting the teenager . She pretended to text a boyfriend to get Hussain to stop and also sent messages to her mother. One read: 'I think this man is trying to stalk me, I actually feel sick.' Miss Duffy added: 'As he got off the train in Rotherham she managed to take a picture of the defendant on her mobile phone.' Police issued an appeal with the picture of Hussain and he was arrested. Sarah Smith, defending, said there was no premeditation and Hussain was suffering from poor mental health at the time. He had lost his 'highly respectable' job due to his mental health problems which included depression with psychotic features, hallucinations and delusional beliefs. Judge Paul Watson QC, said: 'She is to be commended for the fact that she stuck to her guns and brought this to the attention of the authorities. 'People who randomly sexually assault members of the public must expect custodial sentences. 'What makes it serious is the element of fear this causes others. 'She was brave enough and alert enough to report you and give the police information which eventually led to your arrest and eventual plea of guilty.' Hussain was also given an Asbo, banning him from trains for three years. The train was travelling between Sheffield and Doncaster.

Photo opportunity: The Most Reverend Justin Welby, 58, paid an official visit to Bristol last weekend . Talking: The Archbishop chatted to drinkers outside bars, posed for selfies and spoke to police officers . Speaking of Bristol, the head of the Church of England said: ‘There seems to be a strong sense of community. There is a real sense of direction in terms of the Church. ‘I am not just trying to butter up Bishop Mike (the Bishop of Bristol, Mike Hill) - this feels like a place that knows where it’s going in church terms.’ He added: ‘When you have all that diversity going on and it’s got a real sense of direction, you can’t help but think that ideas that the Church of England are on the way out is so much claptrap.’ The married father-of-six, who took up the role as the CofE head last year after a high-flying career in the oil industry, denied his ‘real world’ experience meant he ‘got it’ more than his predecessors.

Formal attire: Dr Welby (file picture) swapped his mitre for a baseball hat when he joined the street pastors . The former Bishop of Durham said: ‘My predecessors got it - you play the cards you have got in your hand. In 20 years Rowan Williams will be seen as one of the greatest Archbishops we've ever had.’ Dr Welby added: ‘I am inheriting what he built. I have had a better hand of cards given to me.’ Street Pastors is an inter-denominational organisation which aims to provide a Christian presence on the streets of local communities through volunteers who 'care, listen and help'. It was pioneered in Brixton, south London, in January 2003 by Reverend Les Isaac, director of the Ascension Trust - and now 9,000 volunteers work in more than 225 locations around Britain.","Most Rev Justin Welby wears baseball hat and high-visibility jacket .

"A self-portrait taken by pioneering photographer Oscar Rjelander - believed to be the world's first selfie - sold at auction for £70,000. The important photograph, which dates from the 1850s, predates the modern craze by almost 200 years. It was discovered in a leather-bound book of 70 albumen prints by the renowned Swedish artist. This self-photograph of Oscar Rejlander  taken in the 1850s is believed to be the world's first ever 'selfie' When the owner approached Morphets auctioneers in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, they said they had no idea of the real value of the book. Liz Pepper Darling of Morphets said:  'The vendor brought the album into the office, and asked for it to be sold with a reserve of £100. 'We quickly realised it was quite an important album of early photographs, when the art was really in its infancy.' Among the sitters in the album are Rejlander's wife, Hallam Tennyson - the son of poet Lord Alfred Tennyson, and Rejlander himself. The first photographs were developed by French inventor Nicéphore Niépce who in 1824 creates the first permanent photograph. However the word photography was only first used in 1839 by Sir John Herschel after he created the first glass negative. The first Kodak camera was produced in 1888 allowing 'ordinary people to take photographs . Rejlander, who started out as a portrait painter before moving into photography, became well known for his photomontage print 'The Two Ways of Life'- made up of 32 negatives - which caused a scandal because of the partially nude subjects, although respectability came again when Queen Victoria bought a copy of the print for Prince Albert. Rejlander sold the album of 70 prints to 19th century naval hydrographer Captain George Browing, and it was passed down through the family to most recent owner, who the auctioneers said had no inkling of its significance. Although individual prints have come to market in the past, the album is thought to be the first work by Rjelander ever sold in public. Queen Victoria purchased a copy one of Rejlander's photomontage prints for her husband Prince Albert .","Pioneering Swedish photographer took this 'selfie' and placed it in an album .

"The notorious killer who murdered and raped model Sally Ann Bowman has been directly linked to three violent sexual attacks in Spain - for which a Dutch citizen has so far served 11 years in prison. Chef Mark Dixie was jailed for 34 years after killing the 18-year-old model in London in 2005 and having sex with her while she lay 'dead or dying'. Following his conviction, Interpol circulated his DNA and it was matched to samples taken by Spanish police over three attempted rapes which took place in Fuengirola, on the Costa del Sol, all between 4.30am and 6am on August 10, 2003. Model Sally Ann Bowman (left) was murdered and raped by killer Mark Dixie in September 2005 . Despite the match, Dutch citizen Romano van der Dussen, was jailed for the attacks after two of the victims and a witness watching from a window, who called the police, all identified him as the culprit. He told the court that he had been in Torremolinos, more than 12 miles away, at the time of the attacks but could not produce any evidence of his claim. He was convicted in May 2005, after spending a year and seven months in prison on remand. He was jailed for 15 and a half years for sexual assault, attempted rape, causing injuries and robbery with violence. But van der Dussen's DNA was never matched to the DNA found at the scene and his lawyer, Silverio Garcia Sierra, is demanding his release. He told Spanish daily newspaper El Pais: 'It is a disgrace that Romano van der Dussen continues to be in prison without hardly any judicial procedures being carried-out. Miss Bowman was just 18 when she was murdered by chef, Dixie . 'It should not be possible that there could be negligence when there has been an erroneous conviction. An innocent person in jail should be a priority, but no-one cares.' When Spanish police initially made the DNA match they immediately told the courts but nothing was done and and van der Dussen remained in prison. They even ran checks on Dixie and found that he had been living on the popular southern Spanish holiday coast between the end of 2002 and October, 2003 - two months after the three women were attacked. Analysis of the match made in March, 2007, showed that the samples taken in Fuengirola were 54,000 times more likely to be a mixture of Dixie's DNA and that of one of the victims than of any other two people. That information was also sent by the police to the courts. But neither the investigating judge in Fuengirola, who first handled van der Dussen's case, nor the court which condemned him in Malaga followed the police recommendation to seek further forensic evidence from Britain. Now, a judge at a court in the popular resort of Fuengirola has finally decided to re-open the case for which Romano van der Dussen has spent eleven years behind bars. The El Pais report added that Australia is also seeking Dixie as an alleged murderer and serial rapist.","Chef Mark Dixie jailed for murdering and raping Sally Ann Bowman in 2005 .

"Jaguar will go retro when it unveils its 'new' model tomorrow - a revived E-Type race car which will cost wealthy collectors $1.7million. The legendary E-Type from the 1960s is the Jaguar's best-known car and the Lightweight model is its most sought-after. Only 12 of the 18 planned cars were ever built between 1963 and 1964 - and earlier this year Jaguar stunned the auto industry by announcing they were to build the remaining six. Scroll down for video . Jaguar will unveil the revived E-Type Lighweight model race car in Pebble Beach, California, tomorrow which will cost wealthy collectors $1.7million . Between 1963 and 1964, just 12 of the 18 planned E-Type Lightweight model race cars were ever built - with Jaguar stunning the auto industry this year by announcing plans to build the remaining six . The manufacturer, fresh from announcing profits of $16million per day will unveil the beautiful new model in Pebble Beach, California tomorrow. Each of the six cars will be built to a specification originated from the last Lightweight E-type produced in 1964. The cars, which won't be road legal, will be hand-crafted at the original home of the E-type, Jaguar's Browns Lane plant in Coventry, England, as part of Jaguar Heritage's first recreation project. Under the aluminium body is a 3.8-litre engine which will develop around 340bhp. With the right gearing, the E-Type will be capable of more than 160mph.

The cars, thought to cost around $1.7million, will be sold as period competition vehicles and all will be suitable for historic motorsport purposes . Each new E-Type will be powered by a recreated version of the original XK-based straight-six engine, with an aluminium block, a ‘wide angle’ aluminium cylinder head, and a dry sump lubrication system . The cars, thought to cost around $1.7million, will be sold as period competition vehicles and all will be suitable for historic motorsport purposes. John Edwards, managing director, Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations which runs the Heritage side, described the E-Type as 'an incredibly exciting project'. He said: 'Special Operations' remit is to indulge our most discerning and enthusiastic customers' passion for our cars - including those from our past. 'This is why our Jaguar Heritage division exists. The E-type is an iconic car, and the Lightweight E-type the most desirable of all. 'To be able to complete the intended production run of 18, some 50 years after the last Lightweight was completed, was an opportunity we couldn't miss.' Between 1961 and 1975, Jaguar built around 72,500 E-types with the stylish motor regarded as one of the prettiest cars ever built. For the recreation, Jaguar used state-of-the-art scanning technology to digitally remap the inner and outer surfaces of a Lightweight bodyshell . All of the new E-Types will be built by hand at Jaguar’s new Heritage customer workshop facility, at Browns Lane factory, Coventry, England and all will feature the aluminium body panels that made the lightweight so special at the time . The car's body has 230 individual components and to accurately reproduce the car, Jaguar recorded dimensions and shape down to a fraction of a millimetre . Between 1961 and 1975, Jaguar built around 72,500 E-types with the stylish motor regarded as one of the prettiest cars ever built. The new models will be able to reach speeds of 160mph . The Lightweight E-Type was raced by the likes of likes of Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart and Roy Salvadori and now command a $6.6million-plus price-tag. It was around 114kg lighter than a standard E-type, thanks to its all-aluminium body and engine block, lack of interior trim and exterior chrome work and a host of further weight-saving features including lightweight, hand-operated side windows.

The car's body has 230 individual components and to accurately reproduce the car, Jaguar recorded dimensions and shape down to a fraction of a millimetre. Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar, said: 'With the Lightweight E-type, our focus as a design team has been to ensure justice was done to the original work of Sir William Lyons and Malcolm Sayer. 'Meticulous attention to detail has been everything to us in re-creating this car, just as it is in our contemporary Jaguars. 'I believe the result is a new Lightweight E-type that is as stunning now as the originals would have been when they were new.' Each new E-Type will be powered by a recreated version of the original XK-based straight-six engine, with an aluminium block, a ‘wide angle’ aluminium cylinder head, and a dry sump lubrication system. Two fuel injection options will be offered with the new cars and three Weber carburetors will be fitted as standard. But a Lucas fuel injection system will be available as a cost option. Both variants have been homologated for FIA historic motorsport, and Jaguar says that no matter which fuel injection is chosen, power output will be 'well over 300' bhp. All six vehicles will be built as perfect reproductions and to the exact specifications of the original 12 cars first produced in 1963. Customers will also be able to specify a range of bespoke options for their individual cars.","The revived Jaguar E-Type Lightweight model race cars will be unveiled tomorrow in Pebble Beach, California .

"Bloggers who want to grow their online popularity can now purchase followers - at the risk of potentially ruining their credibility. Services like Buzzoid, Hypez and Buy Instagram Followers charge as little as $3 per every 100 new followers, a tempting way for social media users to get a jump start and set themselves apart from competitors. But some say that purchasing a following is equivalent to cheating in the social media world. 'There's respect that comes... with letting your blog get big on its own, the organic way,' LA-based blogger Dale Janee told Racked.com. A large price to pay: Bloggers who want to grow their online popularity can now purchase followers - at the potential cost of ruining their credibility . 'If people would ever find out, you would lose all credibility and that is not worth it,' she added. Fashion blogger Jessica Quirk, who runs What I Wore, and Song of Style's Aimee Song are just some of the popular Instagram users of late who have been accused of buying followers to grow their presence. Even political figures are jumping on the bandwagon; just last week Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and his party, Vision Vancouver, experienced a sudden spike in Twitter followers - a red flag to savvy internet users who suspected him of buying followers. In the end, a spokesperson for the Mayor claimed that the increase of more than 40,000 followers within just a few days was due to a spam attack - not a bid to make the Mayor appear more popular. Still, people often point to such sudden increases in likes, follows and comments as proof that a blogger's following is not 100per cent genuine. 'It's kind of depressing,' lifestyle blogger Siel Devos said of the growing trend. 'You think these bloggers are famous because they work for it until you realize that it's all bought.' Popularity: Services like Buzzoid let you grow your following for as little as $3 per every 100 new followers, a tempting way for bloggers to get a jump start and set themselves apart from competitors . Even more depressing, however, is that it tends to work; Instagram accounts gain more exposure when they have more followers, so buying followers inevitably leads to more actual followers. Indeed, a marketing associate from Buy Instagram Followers - where 1,000 active Instagram followers costs just $90 - explained that most of their clients come back for more on a regular basis. 'The more active followers you have, the more exposure you are going to get,' said the employee. But a blogger who buys followers can do significant damage when they are associated with big name brands. 'Those fake numbers are used by bloggers to make real money they don't deserve - income that's based on what amounts to falsified data,' Alice Wright, who founded blogger forum GOMI, explains. Ethical grey area: 'If that sort of practice came to light in the real world, people would probably be getting sued, but since it's blogland, they seem to get away with anything,' said GOMI founder Alice Right . Since companies pay bloggers based on how much influence they appear to have, a lot of money can be lost if some of the bloggers' followers don't actually exist . 'If that sort of practice came to light in the real world, people would probably be getting sued, but since it's blogland, they seem to get away with anything,' she said. However, companies have begun to combat these fake followeings with algorithms that show a blogger's actual influence - disregarding their number of followers. Outrigger Media, for instance, ranks the top beauty bloggers on YouTube according to their consistency, influence and momentum.","Services like Buzzoid, Hypez and Buy Instagram Followers charge as little as $3 per every 100 new followers ."
"A 17-year-old girl and three men have managed to escape alive after a light plane narrowly missed a luxury condominium, hit a tree and crashed landed in a park nearby. Four people were on board the single-engine aircraft when it started to experience mechanical difficulties as it flew over down town St. Petersburg, Florida, this morning. Two of the passengers, who are said to be from Ireland, were seen sitting next to the wrecked single-engine aircraft after it went down in Vinoy Park. Aftermath: A female passenger is stretchered away from the plane after it crashed in Vinoy Park, down town St Petersburg, Florida. It narrowly missed a luxury condominium and hit a tree on its way down . The pilot, Grant Jordon, 57, and passenger, Aloysius Ryan, 52, were reportedly in a serious but stable condition in Bayfront Health, officials said. According to the Tampa Bay Times the other two occupants, Eamonn Harnell, 48, and an unidentified 17-year-old girl, suffered minor injuries. Reports from the scene suggested that the plane had left Tallahassee Regional Airport earlier in the day and was flying south over the city towards Albert Whitted Airport when it started to experience mechanical difficulties. Witnesses said it narrowly avoided the Vinoy condominium towers before striking a tree. The impact tore the left wing and landing gear from the plane and caused it to spin towards the ground. Members of the St Petersburg fire crew, who were training at the nearby North Shore Aquatic Center, heard 'sputtering' and rushed to the crash site. They found the plane rested in an upright position facing the bay. No one on the ground was hurt. Sheri Jarvie, 50, who was staying at the nearby Vinoy Renaissance, told the paper: 'The noise was just awful, it was a loud bag.'

"He isn't exactly famous for sitting still - so when unsuspecting fans approached a wax figure of Jeremy Lin for a photo, they didn't suspect a thing. But they were given a fright - which soon turned to joy - when the still figure jumped up to surprise them, revealing himself as the LA Lakes star player.

But when the moment was right, Lin leaped up, made a noise, or met the gaze of the fans stood right next to him, some of whom jumped out of their skins. At one point, Lin pulled off a combo with the actual waxwork, which is suspended next to a basket in a slam dunk pose, by running in from the side and scoring two points himself. Two points! At one point Lin managed to upstage the dramatic slam-dunking waxwork of himself (background) by running in from the sidelines to nab a real basket of his own .

Shirley Lin was also seen approaching her 'waxwork' son, but escaped being fooled and gave Lin and affectionate squeeze on the shoulder, breaking the illusion.

"On the surface, they appear to be nerveless gamblers who don't bat an eyelid at placing hundreds of thousands of dollars on the spin of a roulette wheel or the turn of a card. They are known in the gambling world by the 'whales' moniker, courted by the biggest casinos and weighted on hand and foot by junket operators and gaming hosts. But the glamorous side can often hide the seedy underworld driving their big bets - organised crime, often dangerous, sometimes deadly. Tonight, the ABC's Four Corners program will turn the spotlight on the Chinese gangs who have a sinister  hold on gambling. More than $1 trillion is wagered each year inside the VIP lounges at Macau casinos . Reporter Linton Besser focuses on the wagering hotspot of Macau - where one analyst estimates more than $1 trillion is wagered each year inside the gambling den's VIP lounges. Casinos in Australia currently dine on a piece of the punting pie worth $5 billion. But chasing the big bucks will bring greater risks. 'We've found that this is an abundantly murky world, the world of Chinese high-rollers and junket operators,' Linton Besser says. 'In Macau, the junket operators provide Chinese high-rollers with a complete gambling service' that includes providing loans sometimes in the millions of dollars . With Australia readying itself for two new state-of-the-art venues in Brisbane and Sydney in the next few years, he says 'it's in the public interest that we should have a conversation about the extent to which targeting these Chinese high-rollers leaves us open to organised crime'. 'It’s a staggering amount of money we are talking about and security officials overseas insist Australian casinos should be prepared for what comes with it.' The role of 'junket operators' vary from place to place. If a gambler loses their loaned money and don't pay it back 'there have there has been cases where organised crime gangs have used actual violence, or threats, to ensure they get their money'. 'But in Macau these people provide Chinese high-rollers with a complete gambling service,' he said. 'Yes, they provide transport, food and wine and a good time, all of that but they can be logistics organisers too and perhaps, the most interesting part is that they provide loans.' There are restrictions on taking hard currency into Macau of about $3000. And that's where the hold of 'junket operators' and their gang bosses comes into play. They will loan the high-roller Chinese gamblers the money to play, sometimes in the millions - but it's when the punter loses and does not pay back what is owed, where the real trouble starts. 'We were told that you can't sue them to have a debt paid and there really is no other legal way for them to do it, so they find other ways,' he said. Four Corners reporter Linton Besser (right) reports on how Australian casino operators have been warned to be vigilant against the role of 'junket operators with links to organised crime' 'There have there has been cases that have been reported, we were told by a security expert we spoke to, where organised crime gangs have used actual violence, or threats, to ensure they get their money.' Reporter Linton Besser says he met one person who took other means to retrieve his cash 'by creating a website, where the debtors are named and shamed'. 'In the modern world there are a variety of ways to expose someone.' Macau 2014 is a world away from its humble origins of 50 years ago, now considered a gambling mecca to rival Las Vegas . The program charts the amazing transformation of the one-time Portuguese colony in the past few decades, to now a gambling hub to rival Vegas with total revenue at $45 billion. The note of caution to Australia from those charged with overseeing the gambling mecca is also examined. 'Australian casino operators like Crown and Echo are doing their absolute utmost but recognised that they have to be very careful,” Besser said. A patchwork of regulations provides a real challenge for Australian casinos . Part of the problem is the 'extensive patchwork' of regulations governing casinos in this country from states to territories. 'They all have to do their due diligence and make their own assessments but how these people are examined in different across every jurisdiction,' he added. Australian gambling interests like Crown have a variety of measures they insist have been assessed and passed by international gaming regulators . 'Anti money-laundering laws are governed by the Commonwealth and those groups like Crown and Echo must do their proper due diligence to that end and have a variety of measures. The desire for Australian casino owners to attract the biggest gamblers perfectly illustrated the recent announcement that the international high rollers will soon be delivered in complete comfort, escorted to and from James Packer's Melbourne and Perth Crown resorts in new private jets worth more than $100 million. Mr Packer's company was also recently cleared to run its new Sydney casino, in just three months, by the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority. It's believed it to be one of the fastest ever assessments of a casino applicant. James Packer's interests in gaming continues to grow with his company recently cleared to run its new Sydney casino, in just three months and now looking at extending into the Las Vegas strip . Crown Resorts was granted a licence to operate a VIP-only restricted gaming facility, without poker machines, at Barangaroo - Sydney's inner city - from November 15, 2019 after the NSW Government backed its proposal. Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups, also owns casinos in Macau and London. And the company could be expanding further, with eyes on a vacant Las Vegas Strip site of the former New Frontier casino, thanks to a partnership with former Wynn Las Vegas President Andrew Pascal.","Fears organised crime will enter Australian casinos in the battle for gambling's biggest spenders .

The NFL Players Association hasn't yet finalized its basis for the appeal and is considering multiple ideas, ESPN reporting, citing unidentified sources. Ray Rice holds hands with his wife, Janay, as they arrive at Atlantic County Criminal Courthouse in May in Mays Landing, New Jersey. Media reports say Rice plans to appeal the indefinite suspension handed down by the NFL after a video surfaced of him punching Palmer in an elevator . Rice and his wife attend a New Rochelle High School Football game in their first public appearance since the video surfaced last Monday . The league had in July suspended Rice for just two games but extended it after the video came to light and the Ravens acted. Criticism over the two-day suspension led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with commissioner Roger Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. The release of the video, which showed Rice punching his now-wife Janay Palmer, caused widespread public outrage, leading the NFL to issue the harsher punishment for Rice. After the blow, Palmer hit her head on a railing inside the elevator and was knocked unconscious. Though the NFL and the Ravens both insist they didn't see the video footage until last Monday, an anonymous law enforcement officer told the AP that he personally sent the tape to an NFL executive in April. A social media campaign has since emerged aimed at forcing Goodell to resign over his handling of domestic violence cases. Even the president has apparently waded into the issue, with his chief of staff saying Barack Obama was 'shocked by what he saw' and considers the indefinite suspension appropriate. These images, taken from a video obtained by TMZ, show Rice punching Janay and then her lying on the floor unconscious after she hit a railing . Rice on Saturday made his first appearance in public since the video was released by attending a football game at his high school in a New York City suburb. His wife and their daughter were at the game with him. New Rochelle High School has removed Rice's jersey from its wall of fame and took down a placard honoring him. The school's superintendent said in a letter emailed on Thursday that 'our community stands united in the belief that physical violence to settle differences cannot be condoned'. But the coach indicated ties would remain. 'The New Rochelle football program is a very strong program, and once you're a member of that program, you're a member of that program for life,' Lou DiRienzo said, according to The Journal News. 'Ray is a part of our family and a part of this program, and that's why I'm very happy that he's here today. He made a mistake — and he made a very terrible mistake — but I know the character of the man, and he will rise from this.'

"Child sex offences: Paediatric haematologist Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell, Suffolk . A married children’s doctor today pleaded guilty to a string of sexual offences against cancer sufferers in his care aged as young as eight. Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child. He also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The 41-year-old was a paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. He abused young patients to carry out examinations purely for his own sexual gratification and with no medical justification whatsoever. Police later revealed that Bradbury had filmed one of his young victims as he examined him for his sexual gratification. And police officers warned today that there were likely to be more victims - as the mother of a young leukaemia patient treated by Bradbury who has since died said she will never know if he was also abused. As well as Addenbrooke's, he has worked in other cities, including Birmingham, police said. Bradbury’s 18 known victims were aged between eight to 17 - and he carried out the abuse between 2009 and last year. Wearing a dark suit and blue tie in court today, Bradbury also pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism, one of making 16,629 indecent images and another of making 20 indecent films of children. The offences involved 18 complainants, prosecutor John Farmer said.  They date back to 2009. Bradbury - who lived in a four-bedroom detached house worth £370,000 - was bailed at Cambridge Crown Court and told he would have to sign the sex offenders register. He pleaded not guilty to a count of sexual activity with a child and a count of sexual assault. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth said these two offences will probably remain on file. No date for sentencing was given but the judge told Bradbury to expect a 'substantial' jail sentence. As he left court, Bradbury told reporters: 'I'm so sorry.' He refused to answer further questions. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said the devious medic 'groomed' colleagues to keep his abuse secret. He said: 'This man worked very hard to cultivate the environment to abuse young people. 'I think he groomed his colleagues. I make no criticism of his colleagues at all for not knowing what was happening. 'This is a person who went the extra mile to see young people outside his consultation hours. 'I believe he deliberately cultivated an air of being helpful, caring and someone who if he said to you, do you mind stepping out of the room you wouldn’t question it, you just think of course doctor. 'Over the years I’ve dealt with a lot of health professionals who have been in a position of trust and abused it but in this case some of the victims were extremely ill and they were vulnerable young people. 'I think the thought that someone who’s taken advantage of that is extremely distressing for people.' Det Supt Ridgway added that there may be other victims who have yet to come forward, and a helpline has been set up. It is understood that Bradbury worked in Birmingham before moving to Addenbrooke’s Hospital. Det . Sup Ridgeway said: 'He’s worked in a number of places and we have . spoken to a number of other health institutions including Birmingham. 'As far as we know all the offences happened in Addenbrooke’s. Workplace: Bradbury was a paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge . 'But . we’re certainly open to the possibility that there are other victims . and we would advise them to contact the hospital or health provider and . ask for some reassurance or support that the examinations your child had . was the right examination.' Dr . Keith McNeil, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS . Trust, which runs Addenbrooke's, said: ‘It is hard to put into words . just how saddened we are that this situation has occurred, and our most . abject and sincere apologies go out to any and all of our patients and . their families who are affected by this in any way. ‘As . chief executive of the trust, I am so deeply sorry these incidents have . happened and I am also deeply saddened, as a doctor, that one of my own . profession has placed himself and his patients in this position. 'There is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients and, quite frankly, it sickens me to think that trust has been breached.’ Ann-Marie Ingle, the trust's chief . nurse said: ‘I cannot begin to express how sorry I and all of my . colleagues are for the distress that Myles Bradbury's abuse caused to . patients and their families. The mother of a leukaemia patient who was treated by Bradbury today said she will never know if he was also abused. Claire Yeoman's son Declan, who was treated for 14 months at Addenbrooke’s before his death, was not one of Bradbury’s victims named in court. But his mother told BBC Look East: ‘It made me feel physically ill. 'Obviously you think “was your child involved?” Could you have noticed anything? Was there anything you missed? ‘So you go through every single day of his treatment and basically relive the whole memory of 18 months.’ 'Our thoughts, and ongoing support, are with the families and children who are affected by these charges. ‘His . cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all, . including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable . and sick children. 'As . soon as we were alerted, we took immediate action to suspend him from . clinical practice and we have worked closely with the police and the . NSPCC over these past months. ‘The . actions of one individual should not taint the public's trust in the . NHS and the care it provides. 'I would like to reassure patients and . families that our staff working in children's services here at Cambridge University Hospital continue to provide the care which our patients expect and can rely on.’ Detective Sergeant Shane Fasey said Bradbury had been interviewed three times but refused to say anything. He . said: ‘Bradbury's offences were an appalling breach of trust committed . against vulnerable victims who had been placed in his care. 'His cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all' Ann-Marie Ingle, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust chief nurse . ‘The . families believed the boys were in his safe hands but they were . actually being abused by Bradbury, who carried out examinations purely . for his own sexual gratification and with no medical justification . whatsoever. ‘I would . like to praise the victims and their families who have shown the bravery . to come forward and help bring Bradbury to account. ‘This . has been a complex and challenging investigation, which involved . working closely with Cambridge University Hospitals to gather the . evidence to bring a case to court.’ A helpline can be called on 0800 389 8625 if parents, patients or former patients have any concerns.","Dr Myles Bradbury, of Suffolk, pleads guilty to 7 counts of sexual assault .

"A professional fisherman is presumed dead after his boat was found abandoned with the motor still running three days ago off the coast of northern NSW. The search for Lismore resident Mick Endres began on Saturday morning after the fisherman failed to return to port about 30 hours after his last radio contact, but the search was called off on Tuesday morning after police gave up hope of any chance of survival. His 7m aluminium runabout, Julie, was found still running by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter off Evans head shortly after 10am on Saturday but there was no sign of Mr Endres. Fisherman Mick Endres is presumed dead after vanishing from his running boat at least three days ago . His 7m aluminium runabout, Julie, was found by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter off Evans head shortly after 10am on Saturday but there was no sign of Mr Endres . It is believed he fell overboard while fishing and attempted to climb back on board by using a steering cable as a handle . Coffs Harbour water police coordinator Don Stewart said the major search was suspended at 10am on Monday for the professional line and trap fisherman who is believed to have fallen overboard while on the fishing expedition. ‘The possibility of survival during this time is virtually non–existent,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Every area that has needed to be covered had been covered on a number of occasions by surface craft and also by aircraft.’ The extensive search included three additional helicopters, one fixed wing aircraft and numerous coast guard vessels covering from Ballina heading south to North Solitary Island taking in 30 miles of sea. A police spokeswoman said the search would continue by foot patrols along the beach but the major search would not continue unless new information came to light. Sergeant Stewart said it was a possibility that Mr Endres was not wearing a life jacket at the time he disappeared out at sea. ‘We can’t confirm whether he was wearing a life jacket but it is common practice that they don’t wear them while fishing,’ he said. Pilot Tom Hulse and crewman Mark Sewell winched fellow crew Tom Burns onto the bobbing deck of the tinny and found the boat vacant, The Northern Star reported. A rope was suspended over Julie's stern quarter anchoring the boat to the bottom, in more than 91 metres of water 16 nautical miles (29km) east of the Evans River bar. It is believed a spanner crab trap was anchoring the boat in place which could have been when Mr Endres fell overboard. A hydraulic steering cable attached to one of its two outboard motors was damaged suggesting Mr Endres may have tried to re-board the boat using it as a handle.

"She made headlines earlier this week after revealing her double life as a high-class escort and a mother. Now Amanda Goff has hit back at her critics through a lengthy article in which she claims her life remains boring and normal after the media storm. The 40-year-old dismissed criticism that her children were negatively affected by her career choice, writing in the Herald Sun: 'Professions do not define our parenting skills'. Scroll down for video . Amanda Goff has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen . Ms Goff has two children under the age of seven who she shares custody with her former partner . 'So far, the only thing we had to deal with at school this week was my son getting hit on the head with a soccer ball, which caused a few tears. 'So, while I appreciate your concern, my kids are fine, thank you very much. How are yours?' The mother-of-two described her initial anxiety on her way to her casual job at her children's canteen, where she feared she would be faced with criticism from mothers and children. Instead the former journalist, who formerly worked as a news editor for New Idea, a beauty director for InStyle and as a freelance producer for Seven's Today Tonight, said she was faced with another ordinary day within a casually boring week. 'Yep, when I think about the endless cups of tea I've drunk, the track suit pants I've lived in and the cat I had to take to the vet; life has been prrretty boring,' she wrote of the last week. The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle .

She also defended her decision to go public with her real name in a tell-all-interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night - after publishing her book under the name 'Samantha X' - claiming she preferred to have control rather than fearing being ousted by another reporter. The article was published only two days after Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity.

'I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.'

"The huge $111 million budget cut to Australia's national science agency announced in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's May budget has led to top scientists being forced to refill photocopiers, a report has claimed. A senior CSIRO scientist has exposed the menial tasks they and their colleagues are now being forced to carry out because of the axing of 100 support staff. The scientist, who is paid $150,000 a year, told the Sydney Morning Herald he is spending half a day a week washing glassware. 'They're doing their best to keep the money in the science, but the consequence is that high-level scientists do a lot of menial tasks because there is no one else to do them,' he said. The man, who did not want to be named, said staff are being distracted from research because they have to clean laboratories, handle post and check chemical stocks. Scroll down for video . Australia's top scientists have been forced to collect and distribute mail, impacting on the time they have for vital research . CSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski confirmed he has received feedback from staff about this problem. 'Most recently it has been around scientists collecting and distributing mail,' Mr Popovski told Daily Mail Australia. 'There is limited staff in a reception capacity also in storerooms, scientists are now picking up dangerous chemicals and coordinating the administrative part of that,' he said. Mr Popovski explained that 100 support staff were cut earlier this year as part of the three hundred job losses in a CSIRO restructure. He warned that there have also been cuts to support areas in previous years and it has been a cumulative trend rather than a one off. 'It's really important to hire people to do the work that needs to be done rather than having highly skilled scientists doing support staff work. CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, has been heavily impacted by government cuts . 'Scientists immensely value the support staff as it allows them to get on and do their job,' Mr Popovski added. CSIRO has three national research facilities, including the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, Victoria and more than 30 other research facilities around the country. In August it was announced CSIRO is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs, due to the budget cuts forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between June 2013 and June 2015. 'It's not a throwaway line about making CSIRO more efficient, these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research, and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that,' Mr Popovski said. 'You're essentially down to the bare bones, there's not a lot left to cut. We want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result.' CSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski said 'scientists are now picking up dangerous chemicals' Due to funding cuts last year, there were 513 redundancies at CSIRO, reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent, to 5,964 in June 2013. It is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year, meaning CSIRO will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years. Bowel Cancer Australia CEO Julien Wiggins said the closure of CSIRO's bowel and rectal cancer research program was 'a step backwards', especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Australia. 'Any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern. 15,000 people are diagnosed each year, and funding to bowel cancer research currently doesn't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country,' he told Daily Mail Australia. He stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis, research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease, receiving between 7 and 10 percent of NHMRC funding for cancer research and treatment. While there are other government, not-for-profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research, Mr Wiggins pointed to CSIRO's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the Blue Mountains for people who cannot or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test. 'It's really a sad day for bowel cancer.' The areas of CSIRO that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced, but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas, and eight full-time researchers from Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals.

"A 16-year-old schoolgirl who was violently assaulted by a gang just yards from her home has posted pictures of her horrific facial injuries on Facebook in a bid to catch the attackers. Amy Maddison, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was walking home late last Thursday when three men smashed her face against a wall - leaving her with a swollen lip and a bloody nose. She decided to post a photo of the wounds they inflicted on social media and they have now been shared by almost 1,000 people. Campaign:  Amy Maddison (left) posted pictures of her injuries (right) on Facebook in the hope that people can help bring her attackers to justice . The teenager hopes that by raising awareness of her ordeal, she will help police to bring the gang to justice, as members of the public might offer information on the thugs' identities. Shockingly, the picture she used was taken after her mother had cleaned her face and wiped away all of the blood. The part-time waitress had to delete photos taken before she received treatment, as it made her too upset to look at them. She said: 'I'm angry and confused, but I'm also sympathetic as anybody who does something like this must have nothing in their life.' The sixth-former was walking home from a restaurant last Thursday just after 10pm when the three men began to hurl insults at her as she passed them. She tried to ignore them and sped up - but suddenly felt hands grabbing at her waist. Her face was smashed against a wall in the struggle that ensued, sending her crashing to the ground. The gang then kicked her as she lay motionless on the pavement. Yards from home: Amy was assaulted by three men as she was walked along Woodlands Ravine (above) When they finally relented and left her alone, Amy desperately called her mother, Wendy, and begged her to pick her up. Speaking about the terrifying incident, Amy added: 'When I saw my blood, I thought it was going to be worse. 'They started to kick me. I burst into tears when I realised I was just going to have to take it.' After seeing her distraught daughter, Wendy called the police, and also took pictures of her injuries - now seen by around 3,000 people. Wendy said: 'I had no idea that it would get the response it has. 'This shouldn't happen to anyone, never mind a young girl. She's 16, and as a parent you want to give her some independence, but I just don't feel like I can let her walk home now. 'The police haven't done anything other than take her coat away, and they're still doing DNA on that. They haven't found anything yet.' 'We're still waiting to hear back from them about the investigation but I just hope that they will be brought to justice, because this wasn't young lads, it was fully grown men.' The first is around 6ft 2in tall with a slim build. He wore an orange and yellow hooded top and black tracksuit bottoms with stripes on the lower half of the leg and white trainers. The second man is also around 6ft 2in tall, with a slim build and was dressed in dark trousers and a hooded top with white trainers. The third is shorter with a slim build and was wearing a purple and blue hooded top and black Adidas bottoms with stripes down the leg.","Amy Maddison, of North Yorkshire, was attacked by three men on way home .

"America's most infamous receipt is now up on the auction block. A copy of a receipt signed by Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy with only a 20 cent tip went up on eBay Saturday morning. The bidding started at, you guessed it, 20 cents. The owner of Philadelphia burger joint PYT publicly called out McCoy on September 8, sharing a receipt online showing what was described as McCoy's paltry tip. Public shaming: Philadelphia-based DJ Jake Weaver posted a photo of the infamous receipt to Instagram on Saturday morning, the eBay listing was live within a couple of hours . Unsatisfied customer: PYT owner Tommy Up (left) called out LeSean McCoy (right) and posted a receipt showing a meager tip earlier in the week . 'The twenty cent tip that the Eagles' LeSean McCoy just left our server on his $60 check is going to come in really handy for that new official NFL McCoy jersey he had his heart set on,' Up wrote on Instagram. 'That is a .03% tip. New record!' In the second day of bidding, the auction had already topped $700.Signed jerseys with a certificate of authenticity can run between $499 and $599 online. Up told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the auctioneer's name is Jake. 'He DJs at PYT,' Up added. Jake Weaver, a Philadelphia-based DJ, posted a photo of the receipt stuck to a refrigerator on Instagram, saying he was going to sell it on eBay, adding the hashtag #tipshame. In the description of the auction on eBay, the poster says: 'My good friend Tommy Up has left this receipt in my possession in order to ensure something positive comes out of this somewhat negative action that has recently taken place.' The auction says the funds from the auction will be given to the PYT staff, along with a 'personalized note or card' written by the winning bidder. According to the receipt, McCoy and three guests patronized PYT on North Hancock Street at around 3pm Monday, ordering $57 worth of food, plus $4.56 in taxes. McCoy paid the tab with his Visa credit card, writing in by hand a '$00.20' tip for a grand total of $61.76. McCoy's party of four was served that day by a waiter named Rob, identified later in an NJ.com article as Rob Knelly. The PYT staffer revealed to the paper that McCoy and his guests were being loud and rude from the moment they sat down at the table. ‘I kept my cool for as long as I could, where you just don’t want them yelling and cursing you,’ Knelly, who is a Baltimore Raves fan, said. ‘I asked some questions; they weren't really responsive. They were cursing, making derogatory comments. I put their order in and forgot one of their appetizers, which I apologized for. They ordered things and, once they got it, said “We ain't eating this s***. We don't want it.""’ After giving the patrons’ drink orders to the bartender, Knelly said McCoy and his party continued to call for him. ‘They didn’t know my name,’ Knelly told NBC Philadelphia. ‘They just said, “you’re my server right?” They were being rude so after I gave them their food I didn’t go back to them until they were done. I just avoided their rudeness.’ Paltry tip: The owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint shared this receipt from Monday showing the 20-cent tip that Eagles star LeSean McCoy left for a server on a $61.56 tab . Fast-food landmark: Tommy Up, the owner of the popular eatery, wrote on Facebook that everyone at PYT was excited to see McCoy, but he responded by making derogatory comments and mistreating the staff . When a Philadelphia Daily News reporter reached out to McCoy for comment, the NFL player said, 'It's bull****, man,' but he declined to further elaborate on the tip controversy. In 2012, LeSean McCoy signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million. The image of the receipt posted on PYT’s Facebook by the owner has been shared more than 2,800 times, drawing sharp criticism from many commenters for calling out McCoy as a bad tipper. User Taryn Woods wrote: ‘This is very distasteful and unprofessional of PYT. So what if the man left a .20 cent tip? It’s his right to be cheap or more than likely disappointed with the service.’ Another Facebook commenter Phil Penny wondered: ‘is there a minimum we should tip to avoid you posting receipts online?’ In response to the firestorm, the proprietor of the burger joint, Tommy Up, penned a lengthy status update Tuesday afternoon offering his side of the story. Up opened his letter by taking full responsibility for sharing the receipt online and saying that he stands firmly by his staff. He then went on to describe how ‘pumped’ his employees – many of them loyal Eagles fans – were to see the famed running back walk through the doors of their establishment. ‘Mr McCoy and his friend sat inside at a booth next to my management and next to me. They were given excellent service. Impeccable service. If anything, our server was a little nervous as was our food runner, because they are big, big fans,’ the owner wrote. Millionaire's response: The running back, who signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million in 2012, responded to the tip-gate by saying the eatery's claims were 'bull****' ‘He and his group, from the moment they sat down, were verbally abusive to our staff in the most insulting ways. The derogatory statements about women and their sheer contempt for the staff serving them wasn't the end, however. ‘After Mr McCoy and his group left I looked over and saw their server, my friend, with his head bowed down and with a very confused look on his face. I took the receipt out of his hand and I couldn't believe that anyone could be so callous. Mr McCoy had left a .03% tip for our staff. ‘Our staff that was beyond excited to see him walk into our burger joint and was excited to serve him. That's twenty cents on a tab of over $60. Twenty cents that our server has to split with the food runner and the bartender. Two dimes from an insulting multimillionaire. The owner went on to dismiss reports the McCoy and his party received poor service as ‘a complete slanderous lie.’ ‘At the end of the day, I did what I felt my heart told me to do. And I don't want anything from Mr McCoy, but...maybe an apology to his server who gave him excellent service would be cool,’ Mr Up summed up, before directing all hate mail to his email address.","Auction began Saturday morning, with the opening bid set at 20 cents, topping $700 by Sunday night .

"Manchester City striker John Guidetti may yet join Celtic on loan after the Scottish FA confirmed it will appeal to FIFA on the club's behalf to get the loan move ratified. Guidetti travelled to Glasgow on Monday for talks as Celtic moved to complete their second striker signing of Deadline Day following the capture of Stefan Scepovic from Sporting Gijon on a four-year deal. The 22-year-old Swede's move was initiated but was unable to be completed before Monday's 11pm deadline. Scroll down for video . Disappointment: John Guidetti travelled to Celtic for talks but the paperwork failed to arrive at SFA . A Scottish FA spokesman said: 'We will be contacting FIFA on Celtic's behalf to request an ""exception"" in order for the transfer to be concluded.' 'It was chaos yesterday. I don't think I ate all day,' Guidetti told newspaper Sportbladet as he arrived on Sweden's west coast for duty with the Under 21 side. 'It was just wait, wait, wait. Hundreds of fans stood outside the stadium and waited in the middle of the night,' said Guidetti, who had been told that he was surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium. It looked like the wait was in vain, for him and the fans, but media in Scotland reported on Tuesday that the Scottish FA had accepted the transfer paperwork and it was now up to world governing body FIFA to judge if the move could be approved. 'I hope that it sorts itself out with Celtic, otherwise I'll have to stay at City and that's not the worst thing that could happen,' Guidetti said. 'Unfortunately, the papers weren't finished in time and now it's up to FIFA to decide.' Limited chances: Guidetti (left) has failed to break into the first team at Manchester City . Celtic needed to register Guidetti with UEFA last night in order for him to be eligible for the Europa League group stages. Guidetti, who joined City from Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna in 2008, spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring. He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances. Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic became the only transfer fee paid in the Scottish window when his second u-turn in 24 hours teed up a £2.2million move from Sporting Gijon. The deal for No 1 target Scepovic ended a rollercoaster pursuit when Celtic declared themselves 'disgusted' by his decision to sign for Spanish club Getafe instead. By mid-afternoon, however, Spanish league Financial Fair Play regulations had wrecked that deal - forcing the striker's agents to go cap in hand to Celtic begging for a reprieve.

"Universities were yesterday accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘lads’ culture’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace. Student leaders warned that harassment was ‘rife’ on campus after a survey found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault. One university was forced to cancel a ‘safer sex ball’ after students were handed free condoms on arrival and footage emerged of two revellers having sex at the party. Universities have been accused of ignoring a 'laddish' culture of sexual harassment as a survey has revealed that a third of female students have suffered 'unwelcome advances' on nights out (picture posed by models) Another was left embarrassed over a . student night promotional T-shirt featuring the phrase ‘I was raping a . woman last night and she cried’, while reports have emerged of student . publications inviting readers to send in pictures of ‘top student totty’ and running ‘best bum’ competitions. The National Union of Students . accused universities of failing to do enough to combat the problem and . adopting a ‘not on my campus’ attitude. NUS president Toni Pearce said: . ‘Harassment is rife on campus but we still keep hearing from . universities that there is no fear, no intimidation, no problem – well . this new research says otherwise. Now I say to universities everywhere – . the passing the buck approach of “not on my campus” is completely . unacceptable. Students unions and universities must work together to . create campuses that are welcoming, safe and supportive to all.’ NUS president Toni Pearce has called for an end to the 'lad culture' on UK campuses as many of the Britain's universities prepare to celebrate Freshers' Week (file picture) The survey of 2,156 students shows . that 37 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men have been subjected to . inappropriate groping or touching. Almost two thirds said they had heard . jokes about rape or sexual assault being made around the campus. The survey also revealed a lack of . awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle . inappropriate behaviour, with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of . any codes of conduct written by their university or their students’ union. Laura Bates, from the Everyday Sexism campaign, said: ‘Students . are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the . university environment. ‘It is worth mentioning that one . category of such experiences “inappropriate touching and groping” actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law. ‘Though many students would not label it as such, this normalisation and lack of awareness is a major part of the problem.’ However Nicola Dandridge, chief . executive of Universities UK, said: ‘Where students require support, . there are a variety of services on hand to listen to students. ‘These include welfare officers, advice centres and university counselling services.’ She added: ‘If alleged criminal . behaviour is involved, all universities would support any students . reporting such incidents to the police. It is important to remember that . this is an issue for society generally, not just one confined to . university students.’ - Website UniLad published an article which was called ‘Sexual Mathematics’ in 2012. The piece stated: ‘Think about this mathematical statistic: 85 per cent of rape cases go unreported. That seems to be fairly good odds.’ - Exeter University Students’ Guild’s ‘Safer Sex Ball’ caused controversy when two students were filmed having sex near the bar. In 2011, its leaflets had a ‘joke’ about how many calories a man could burn by forcibly undressing a girl. - A poster for a club night at Cardiff Metropolitan University showed a T-shirt with the words: ‘I was raping a woman last night and she cried.’ - Events company Tequila UK ran a night called ‘Freshers’ Violation’ in Leeds last year.

"A key piece of evidence, hundreds of oral testimonies and new artifacts were unveiled Monday at the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum dedicated to the deadly 1995 bombing. The additions are part of a nearly $8 million project that aims to attract a new generation of visitors to the structure, including those too young to remember the attack by Timothy McVeigh on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. Detailed information about the investigation of the attack has been added to the museum for the first time.

A police mug shot of Timothy McVeigh is displayed June 12, 2001 at the Oklahoma National Memorial museum . Among the evidence now on display is the 1977 Mercury Grand Marquis that McVeigh was driving when he was pulled over and arrested north of Oklahoma City the day of the bombing. 'People get to see from beginning to end what did happen here in Oklahoma City,' said Susan Winchester, the chairwoman of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, who lost her sister in the blast. Winchester said victims' family members visited the museum on Sunday and were overwhelmed with the new artifacts and enhanced exhibits. Patrick Gallagher of Gallagher and Associates, the company planning and implementing the improvements, echoed Winchester, saying the additions will help visitors see the story 'come full circle to a justice-served perspective.'

He was executed for the crime, while co-conspirator Terry Nichols is serving life in prison. The enhancements include more than 1,100 new pieces of exhibits, new interactive stations, and video and newspaper coverage. In one installation, a large map of the United States shows how the bombing reached beyond state lines. One example shows how, before the attack, McVeigh was attending a gun show in Akron, Ohio, while Nichols was committing a robbery in Arkansas.

Emma Dorn, 13, was among a group of seventh-graders touring the revamped museum on Monday. Dorn, who was born six years after the bombing occurred, said she enjoyed watching the videos, looking at the memorabilia and seeing what the building looked like. The enhancement project, which is 75 per cent complete, is expected to be finished by the end of the year.","New exhibits include key piece of evidence and hundreds of oral testimonies .

"A church which had lead stolen from its roof has been refused an insurance payout – because it had scaffolding up. Holy Trinity’s insurer says it is not covered as the poles ‘helped’ the thieves. Burglars climbed the scaffolding, erected for a £220,000 restoration project, before stealing lead from a lightning conductor and a hatch at the top of its 100ft tower. The insurer said it did not cover properties when scaffolding is up as it 'helps thieves' (file image) The vicar of the church in Hartlepool believed the building was covered during the repair work as he had paid an extra £800 on top of its annual £1,500 premium. But insurer Ecclesiastical says the policy contains a ‘standard’ clause stating it will not cover thefts while scaffolding is in use. Church members have to foot the £2,000 to £3,000 replacement bill themselves. The vicar, Father Paul Allinson, said: ‘It does seem rather odd and unfair and makes us wonder why we were actually paying for the extra cover. Maybe it is something people need to be aware of.’ The Association of British Insurers said most home insurance policies have no specific caveat regarding scaffolding. But if it was found a scaffold had aided thieves, a policy could be invalidated because of the owner’s lack of ‘due care or attention’. A spokesman for Ecclesiastical said the church knew theft was not covered while scaffolding was up. She added: ‘It is a standard exclusion applied by Ecclesiastical on all church policies.’","Holy Trinity church in Hartlepool told scaffolding 'helped' thieves .

"Four inmates were killed by gunfire  and another 11 wounded, mostly with knives, at a prison in central Bolivia after a party exploded into gang violence. Among the injured were two women, one of them pregnant, police said. The foetus didn't survive because a bullet perforated her womb, said Dr Eduardo Amaya. Families often live together in Latin American prisons. The fight broke out after drunken partying that began on Sunday in the El Abra prison, which is just outside the city of Cochabamba. Scroll down for video . Violence: Security officials during an operation to secure the El Abra Penitentiary in Cochabamba, Bolivia,  An armed clash between foreign and Bolivian prisoners in the jail has left at least four dead and 11 injured . Grief: A relative of one of the inmates cries after hearing he was killed in the clashes . Authorities remove a body after the clampdown. It has emerged guns were smuggled into the prison . The four dead were all Bolivian and included a prison gang boss named Ariel Tancara, whose throat was reportedly slit. Rivalry between Bolivian and foreign prison gangs was to blame, according to the regional police commander, Alberto Suarez. 'Because of these power struggles, fighting has broken out in which unfortunately people have been wounded by knives and firearms,' Suarez told Radio Fides. He did not say where the foreign inmates were from, but Bolivian media reports said they were Colombians jailed for drug trafficking. Witnesses said the inmates held a party Sunday night that included alcohol and live music. Inmates' family members condemned prison officials for allowing alcohol into the prison, accusing them of corruption. Authorities periodically confiscate weapons and drugs in Bolivia's overcrowded prisons but, just as in other nations in the region, inmates bribe prison guards to smuggle them in . Security officials stand guard next to inmates after an operation to secure the El Abra prison . Local ombudsman Edgar Julio Flores added: 'The authorities need to explain how people got guns into the prison.' Authorities periodically confiscate weapons and drugs in Bolivia's overcrowded prisons but, just as in other nations in the region, inmates bribe prison guards to smuggle them in. Amaya said most of the wounded had knife wounds. In August 2013, a battle among rival gangs in the Palmasola prison in the eastern city of Santa Cruz claimed 35 lives, including an 18-month-old. Many of them were burned to death by homemade flamethrowers. Bolivian media reports said the foreign inmates were Colombians jailed for drug trafficking . Three of the instigators were sentenced last week to 30 years in prison each. According to official figures, 1,500 Bolivian children live with a parent behind bars . Bolivia's prisons are the most crowded in Latin America after El Salvador's, according to the Organization of American States.

"A seven-year-old in North Carolina protected her family from a house fire not once but twice in one day. Sage helped evacuate her family from their Winterville home after a fire started on Thursday evening, then alerted them again when the blaze reignited later that night. She first realized a grease fire that began on the stove around 6:30 p.m. Under pressure: Seven-year-old Sage says, 'It's really fun to be a hero,' after evacuating her family from their burning home twice . 'I looked over when I heard the alarm and there was a fire on the stove,' she told WCTI. Sage then led her family to safety, having practiced fire drills the day before. The family went back in after the blaze was under control, but the fire rekindled later on, leading Sage to ask her mother to unlock the door so she could go ask for help from the neighbors. Though Sage led her family to safety, the house couldn't be saved the second time. Sage's grandfather Jack Weathersby had called the home his 'castle,' but he was hopeful about moving on without it. 'There's memories that were made in this home, but we can make some more,' Weathersby said. Winterville Fire Chief Johnathan Heltzel said he was impressed by the young girl's readiness. His castle: Jack Weathersby, Sage's grandfather, called his home his castle, but said the family 'can make more' memories after the fire destroyed the home .

"Christopher Copeland, 52, recruited workers to set up donation stations at supermarkets around the country . A conman who used teams of 'charity collectors' to pocket £300,000 of donations meant for the Help for Heroes charity, has been jailed today. Over an 18-month period, Christopher Copeland, 52, recruited workers to set up donation stations at supermarkets around the country. Unaware they were being used in the elaborate scam, the teams, clad in uniforms with Help for Heroes branding, encouraged shoppers to put money into charity buckets. He even decorated his fleet of ex-military vehicles in the charity's livery. The workers then paid the donations into bank accounts held by Copeland, who used the money as an 'income stream' to support his ailing garage business. Father-of-one Copeland, of mid Devon, was only arrested when a worker reported his suspicions about the donations to police and an investigation was launched. It later transpired Help for Heroes had not known about and did not authorise Copeland’s collections and the money had never reached the charity. The fundraising buckets used had belonged to a separate charity and Copeland had used Help for Heroes branding to illustrate his equipment without permission. Copeland later admitted a charge of fraud and one of money laundering between February 1 2010 and September 17 2011. Judge Philip Wassall, during a two-hour hearing at Exeter Crown Court, sentenced Copeland to a total of four years and six months in prison for his offending. 'When the cause behind the charity is so worthy the potential for huge losses is so large and the difficulty in detecting and quantifying fraud is so profound,' the judge said. 'I also take into account that offences such as this dent public confidence in the charity affected. 'The point has been made that this likely effect has been very damaging for Help for Heroes and the public are likely to question how safe their donation are and whether they should be made at all.' The judge ordered a charge of fraud relating to the sales of Land Rovers through auction website eBay to lie on file. Copeland was made subject of a Serious Crime Prevention Order, banning him from registering as a charity collector and collecting donations for five years. Judge Philip Wassall, during a two-hour hearing at Exeter Crown Court, sentenced Copeland to a total of four years and six months in prison for his offending . Prosecuting, David Sapiecha said Copeland began to raise money for Help for Heroes in October 2009 and initially did so legitimately. Copeland raised £20,000 for the charity through selling merchandise and a further £3,000 in donations before he arranged the professional collections. Mr Sapiecha said Copeland, who has no previous convictions, owned a military Bedford truck and a Land Rover, which were decked out in Help for Heroes livery. 'He employed people who he sent to various sites around the country along with these vehicles to collect money for the public,' the prosecutor said. 'The public believed they were paying money to the charity. It was emblazoned on all the equipment. 'It was a weekly event that these vehicles would be sent out to mostly supermarket car parks. They would stay there for three or four days. 'The employees either stayed in the vehicle overnight or stayed fairly cheaply in a hotel. They were given money for food. 'They would then bank the money on the direction of the defendant, either daily at the beginning or hourly at the end as things became more desperate.' Expenses for the trip were taken from donations on the final day of collecting, Mr Sapiecha added. The donations were paid into Copeland’s personal accounts and then used to prop up his ailing businesses. 'The defendant was using the donations as an income stream,' Mr Sapiecha said. 'The businesses were having funds injected into them and they were being improved.' Father-of-one Copeland, of mid Devon, was arrested when a worker reported his suspicions about the donations to police and an investigation was launched. It later transpired Help for Heroes had not known about and did not authorise Copeland's collections and the money had never reached the charity . Police who raided Copeland’s premises in September 2011 discovered Apple products including iMac computers, he added. They also found paperwork to show Copeland had registered as a collector for another charity, Afghan Heroes. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Jo Brookes, income protection officer for Help for Heroes, said Copeland’s acts could have caused public trust in the charity to be 'eroded'. 'To have that trust betrayed means that our legitimate fundraisers have to work even harder to keep the public’s trust,' she said. '£300,000 is a very significant amount of money for the public to have donated and the charity to not receive.' She said the money could have funded the running costs of Plymouth Recovery Centre for a year, or the entire Band of Brothers programme for 14 months. Representing Copeland, Roseleen Collins said his business had gone into liquidation in 2011, at the same time as the fraud was investigated. Miss Collins said Copeland set up the collections after deciding it was a “brilliant idea” to combine his interest in ex-military vehicles with Help for Heroes. However, the vehicles were difficult to maintain and required expensive maintenance, which Copeland had to do himself, she said. Miss Collins added: 'It has been very hard for him to come to terms with that for which he has been accused. 'He knows he is demonised in the eyes of the public and that will continue for some time. All he can do is express extreme regret at the whole enterprise.' Miss Collins said Copeland and his family had not enjoyed an “extravagant lifestyle” from the donations, as the money went into the failing businesses. Copeland will be subject to Proceeds of Crime proceedings to recover money taken during the fraud. Speaking outside court, Jo Brookes added: 'Copeland deceived the public into thinking they were making donations which would help our wounded. 'Instead he was stealing from them and using the money for his own personal gain through a deceptive web of fraud which took detectives three years to untangle. 'We have been astonished by the response of the public. Many of those defrauded by him have contacted us to express shock that someone would use organised and criminal tactics to prevent money supporting the wounded.'","Christopher Copeland, 52, recruited workers to collect at supermarkets .

"General Motors Co will pay compensation for 19 deaths linked to a faulty ignition switch, according to the lawyer overseeing the compensation process, more than the 13 deaths the automaker had previously admitted were caused by the now recalled part. The death toll tied to faulty ignition switches in GM's small cars has risen to 19 people - and that number is likely to go higher. Kenneth Feinberg said today that he has determined that 19 wrongful death claims are eligible for payments from GM. General Motors' estimate of deaths has stood at 13 for months although the automaker acknowledged the possibility of a higher count. Feinberg received 125 death claims due to the faulty switches in older-model small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt. The rest remain under review or require further documentation, he said in a report issued on Monday. Kenneth Feinberg (pictured in June) is the independent claims administrator for the General Motors Ignition Compensation Program. He announced today that 19 wrongful death claims are eligible for GM payments . 'The public report is simply reporting on those eligible to date,' Feinberg spokeswoman Camille Biros said in an email. 'There will certainly be others.' GM has admitted knowing about the ignition switch problem for more than a decade. Yet it didn't begin recalling the switches in 2.6 million small cars until earlier this year. Feinberg is still reviewing claims of death and injury that occurred due to the risk that an ignition switch could slip out of the 'run' position, stalling the vehicles and disabling the cars' airbags. The automaker hired Feinberg to compensate victims of crashes caused by the switches, and Feinberg has said GM has not limited the total amount he can pay. Some lawmakers have estimated the death toll is close to 100. Biros, citing confidentiality agreements, said Feinberg will not identify any of those eligible for payments, nor will he say if the 19 deemed eligible so far include the 13 deaths that GM has documented. GM has not identified the 13 victims. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has not tallied the total number of deaths. Biros said no claims have been rejected yet, although Feinberg is in the process of turning down a few because they don't meet the requirements for compensation. Feinberg will issue reports each Monday on how many claims have been granted, she said. The compensation expert received 125 death claims due to the faulty switches in older-model small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt (the 2005 model is shown) Feinberg also has received 320 claims for compensation due to injuries. Of those, 12 have been deemed eligible for payments so far. Of the injury claims, 58 were in the most serious category, seeking compensation for injuries resulting in loss of use of limbs, amputation, permanent brain damage or pervasive burns, the Feinberg statement said. Another 262 claims are for less-serious injuries that required hospital stays or outpatient medical treatment within 48 hours of the crash. Attorney Bob Hilliard, who said he represents 11 of the approved death claims, expects his clients to receive compensation offers within 10 days. The offers are expected to be high in order to persuade beneficiaries from filing lawsuits against GM. The deadline for filing a claim is December 31. Feinberg will follow formulas to determine how much people will get, and they can demonstrate circumstances to him that would bring more money. Claimants can wait until he comes up with an amount before deciding whether to sue GM or take the money. General Motors CEO Mary Barra says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' led to a long-delayed recall of faulty ignitions in their Chevy Cobalt . GM has estimated the cost of compensating victims at $400 million, but says it could rise to $600 million. The faulty ignition switches can slip out of the 'run' position into 'accessory' or 'off,' cutting off power to the engine. That can knock out power steering or brakes and disable the air bags if there's a crash. The ignition switch problem triggered a company-wide safety review that has resulted in 29 million GM vehicles being recalled through August. Despite persistent bad publicity for much of the year, GM's sales haven't been significantly harmed by the spate of recalls. GM's U.S. sales are up 2.8 per cent through August. U.S. auto sales overall have risen 5.1 per cent during the same time. GM dealers have been able to convert customers who come in for recall repairs into new-car buyers when they see renovated dealerships and the company's new vehicles, GM North American President Alan Batey said Monday in an interview. Many customers are first-time GM buyers, having bought used cars in the past, he said. General Motors shares rose 43 cents to $33.70 per share in afternoon trading.","Compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg received 125 death claims due to the faulty switches in older-model small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt .

"She claimed to be a Saudi princess whose pocket money of £100,000 a week arrived in London in suitcases. So when ‘Princess’ Sara Al Amoudi, 30, befriended property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton, they were keen for her to invest in their business. After she said she had millions in Dubai bank accounts poised to spend on a property venture, they transferred the ownership of six luxury London flats, now worth £14million, into her name. Court: Sarah Al Amoudi (pictured) was driven away from court in a Rolls Royce with a number plate HRH . Yet the pair told the High Court in . London yesterday that Miss Al Amoudi’s investment never materialised and . that far from being a wealthy princess, she was a fraudster. She is also alleged to have swindled banks including the HSBC. Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton are . demanding she pay them £14million for the flats and say the entire case . hinges on whether there is any  evidence that she is who she says she . is. Covered in a head to toe burka, she . arrived at court in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce with an ‘HRH’ number . plate, accompanied by three burly minders, one of whom carried her . handbag. Miss Al Amoudi – once nicknamed ‘the . vamp in the veil’ – had a previous brush with the law three years ago . when her Swedish ex-boyfriend Patrick Ribbsaeter went on trial for . assaulting her chauffeur after a weekend-long drink and drugs binge. Identity: Ms Al Amoudi, 30, is being sued for £14m by two London property developers who say she tricked them into handing over properties . Giving evidence in Southwark Crown Court then, she also wore a full-face . Islamic veil. In her real life, said Ribbsaeter, who was eventually . cleared, she wore tight jeans and basques, and drank until she could . barely walk. According to the latest case, she . first convinced banks that she was Saudi royalty, the daughter of . billionaire sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, in order to obtain huge . loans. Wrangle: Property tycoon Amanda Clutterbuck, pictured, and her partner Ian Paton say they transferred six properties worth millions of pounds to Sarah Al Amoudi, 30, for a nominal fee . She is then accused of using the cash . to create the impression of fabulous wealth when she was introduced to . Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton by a mutual friend. They entered into a number of . property deals with her without problems before they were persuaded to . transfer six luxury properties into her name, said their counsel, Stuart . Cakebread. The properties included flats in Knightsbridge and Belgravia. Mr Cakebread told judge Mrs Justice Asplin: ‘The identity of Miss Al Amoudi is a key issue in this action. ‘Her claim to be a Saudi princess and . the daughter of Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi was a key factor . which induced the claimants to trust her.’ However Miss Al Amoudi’s barrister, . Jonathan Seitler, yesterday claimed that property developer Mr Paton . kept secret from his partner Miss Clutterbuck his dealings with the . alleged princess because he was having an affair with her. Mr Paton replied: ‘That’s absolutely false, that’s absolute nonsense.’ The case continues.

He is an eminent figure in the Australian rock scene, releasing nine albums that made the Australian top ten throughout his career. He recorded 14 Top 40 Albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums in Australia. Barnes explained he had had undergone back surgery, and then offerred the bag of his spinal fluid as a gesture of good will. 'Here's a bit of spinal fluid if you want some.' Barnes was spotted by Daily Mail with his wife Jane and a friend. He was believed to be chatting to his daughter Susie on the phone, when he looked up and said: .

"Palmer United Party member Jacqui Lambie has declared she will take a DNA test in order to prove her Indigenous Australia heritage to naysayers. During her first speech to parliament the outspoken senator claimed she was a descendant of a prominent Aboriginal leader in Tasmania, where she is originally from. However Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council (TALC) chairman Clyde Mansell has called her claim 'absolutely outrageous and scandalous', the ABC reported. Scroll down for video . Outspoken senator Jacqui Lambie has said she will take a DNA test in order to prove her Indigenous heritage . Mr Mansell is a community elder and known descendant of Mannalargenna. This was no deterrent for Senator Lambie, who told reporters in Hobart on Monday: 'I know what's in my blood'. Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council chairman Clyde Mansell has disputed that Senator Lambie has Aboriginal heritage . 'If Mansell wants to take me on, I guess I'll meet him up at the hospital and both have a DNA test and see how we go once and for all,' she said. In the maiden speech, Senator Lambie acknowledged Australia's traditional Aboriginal owners and revealed she had Aboriginal blood on her mother's side of the family. She said: 'We trace our history over six generations to celebrated Aboriginal chieftain of the Tasmania east coast, Mannalargenna.' However Mr Mansell hit back at the outspoken senator and said she had 'no right' to make the 'ridiculous' assertion, and said she pronounced Mannalargenna incorrectly, according to the ABC. He also said DNA tests are not necessarily conclusive in proving one has Indigenous heritage, and dismissed her claims as completely false. Last week Senator Lambie called for an Indigenous quota in parliament to reflect Australian society, saying they needed a bigger representation in the decision making of the country. She cited Maori seats in New Zealand's parliament as evidence the policy would work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion is not ruling out dedicated indigenous seats in federal parliament and said he is prepared to discuss the issue with Senator Lambie. However he pointed out that it was more important to have the discussion with Indigenous Australians rather than with politicians. 'My opinion means very little. My important responsibility is to reflect the opinions and feelings of my mob,' he told reporters in northeast Arnhem Land on Monday.

Taking a break : Rhys Lawrey jumps into the Croatia Sea for a bit of relaxation and cooling off on his massive double world record ride . Watch out for the locals : 23 year old Rhys Lawrey (pictured) from London is attempting to navigate the world by motorbike. He recently completed his Australia leg and has now arrived in New Zealand. He has travelled more than 30,000 kilometres and visited over 21 countries in 133 days all for charity. On the third of May, Rhys left London with the goal of travelling 80,000 kilometres, visiting 73 countries, 52 consecutive capital cities, and crossing six continents by June next year. And he's well on his way, already at country number 22 - although still has 52 more countries to go and another 50,000 kilometres. 'It's quite mind blowing, I experience so much every day, today in the morning I went from crystal blue skies to jumping off a bridge,' said Rhys. And the 23 year old is a thrillseeker indeed, having just completed one of New Zealand's famous bungie jumps. 'I'm pretty keen for thrilling things,' he said, 'I screamed quite loud, it made good footage.' While he admits to having a ball, the motorbike lover says his big adventure can get a little tiring although now in western countries it's a little bit easier. He has just arrived in New Zealand and says there's been a few dramas with registering his bike on the road but he says that's now been sorted. Taking a camel ride : Rhys takes on a number of other adventures on his motorbike trip around the globe. He also went bungie jumping in New Zealand . 23 year old Londoner Rhys Lawrey (pictured) is getting friendly with the wildlife in Australia on his mammoth adventure. He is now in New Zealand . 'Every country has it's difficulties.' Reminiscing on his ride so far Rhys, who actually lived and worked in Brisbane back in 2013, said his most memorable moments are the people that he meets, particularly in Asia. 'It's quite amazing travelling and China is absolutely an amazing place beyond belief, everybody is friendly, even the military guards,' he said. Rhys is on a double world record attempt to circumnavigate the globe by motorcycle and visit the most capital cities. He'll travel around New Zealand until November where he'll be off the Los Angeles . Getting into a muddy situation in China : 'It's quite amazing travelling and China is absolutely an amazing place beyond belief, everybody is friendly, even the military guards,' he said. The climate is a big factor in his rides, going from one extreme to the next . He also says the most interesting thing about his trip is how the cultures work and how cultures lives their lives. 'We all live a very different life, it's funny to see it, i.e. in Asia seeing a family on a scooter is considered normal but in Australia those parents would be hung up for bad parenting. I had to sit back and laugh . One of his not so memorable moments was when he crashed in Turk Ministan. The 23 year old came off, but fortunately only suffered a few bruises. 'It was four to five in the afternoon, my water bottle was boiling hot, I was tired and then I came off and the bike landed on my right leg.' 'I was wearing proper gear though so the boots saved my leg, just a bruise,' he said.

Rhys Lawrey, 23, (pictured here in Australia) is onto his 22nd country in New Zealand on a motorcycle around the world. He's trying to become the youngster to do it and visit the most capital cities . He also described the country as not the most welcoming place to be. Staying overnight at the border he had to sleep on a table and got hassled by local police. 'In the capital Ashgabat I was with a couple of riders, one rider got told off from hotel security because he had his legs on the couch, they're just very strict and they don't like foreigners,' said Rhys. The climate was also a big factor in his rides, going from one extreme to the next. 'There's nothing you can do about it but just get on with it. It's part of the motorcycling adventure, you have to live and breath it,' he said. Rhys has also tried a number of interesting delicacies on his adventures from brains to ducks gums and neck and says he's probably even eaten a whole bunch of other foods but didn't even know what they were. Rhys made plenty of friends in Asia : the 23 year old said China was one of the most friendliest countries . Ahhh the serenity : Rhys checks out some rolling hills beside a local dog. Rhys is trying to raise money for British charity, The Prince Trust who are a youth charity. He wants to raise as much as possible . The whole adventure is also raising money for British charity, The Prince Trust, chosen by Rhys because being a young person himself, he wanted to interlink with a youth charity. He says fundraising is going OK at the moment but he would love a bit more, although hasn't had the time going through countries like Asia because he's been concentrating on surviving. 'I want to raise as much as possible, there's no goal because of the large scale of the project,' he said. 2moroRider is partnered up with The Prince Trust Charity - to help raise funds which can also be donated through the JustGiving website and JustTextGiving by Vodafone. Hey I'm in Georgia : Rhys has to deal with some not so great quality roads and of course the weather which he says has been one extreme to the next .

The 23 year old also hasn't suffered any flat tyres and says his bike is still in top condition and just keeps going and going. After four months on the road, he's still got plenty more to go and once he's finished in New Zealand in November he'll be bound for Los Angeles. Rhys is hoping he'll reach the end of his massive adventure by June next year. 'I will finish, guaranteed, I'm determined.'

"Sydney's skies were full of whales, sharks, fish and other colourful characters as they flew over Sydney's famous Bondi Beach for the annual Festival of the Winds. The festival was accompanied by warmer weather, attracting families who enjoyed the bright and colourful entertainment at Bondi Pavilion. There was not a cloud in the sky as kite enthusiasts from around the world gathered at 11am showing off their kite-flying skills to the crowds. Young children were full of excitement as they watched the hand-made kites of all shapes and sizes flying high in the sky. Organisers said the annual event was a 'huge success' as record crowds flocked to the beach pavilion in the 23C sunshine. But the entertainment did not stop there; international food stalls, free dance workshops, children's rides, puppet shows and art exhibitions made up a full day of entertainment for the Bondi festival-goers. The 36th annual festival was presented by the Bondi Pavilion in association with The Australian Kiteflyers Society.

"The £10 million Iraq War inquiry is set to be delayed until after the election because of continued Whitehall wrangling over what it will be allowed to publish. Whitehall sources said inquiry chief Sir John Chilcot is still making a ‘steady stream’ of requests asking civil servants to declassify documents – suggesting that the report is still not written. It also emerged that legal letters to key figures like Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell, spelling out criticism they may face in the report, have not yet been sent out. The full transcripts of phone calls and letters between George W Bush and Tony Blair will not be published in Chilcot's final report, to the dismay of the families of the 179 British soldiers killed in the conflict . The report is expected to be critical of the actions of key Labour figures in the months before the Iraq War . The revelations are a major blow to hopes that the inquiry, which began work in 2009, would finally publish its report before the election next May. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood is said to have warned the inquiry that the report, which is expected to be critical of Mr Blair and some senior Labour figures, should be published by the end of January to avoid interfering with the election. He is thought to have set an absolute deadline of early March, after which time the report would have to be delayed to prevent it becoming a political football during the election campaign. The development will dismay families of the 179 British soldiers killed in the bloody conflict who have waited years to discover the real reasons their loved ones were sent to war. Some have already branded the inquiry a ‘whitewash’, after it emerged that it will not be allowed to publish full details of 25 letters Mr Blair sent to George W Bush or the transcripts of 130 phone calls between the two men. Sir John Chilcot's inquiry began work in 2009, but is still thought to be months away from being published . In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President unconditional support for the war, telling him: ‘You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I’m with you.’ Sir Jeremy ruled in May this year that only the ‘gist’ of these conversations could be published. The deal, which followed two-and-a-half years of wrangling, was seen as a breakthrough that might finally allow the report to be published. But, to the dismay of some in Whitehall, Sir John has continued to make fresh requests to publicise sensitive information, each of which takes weeks to consider. There is also mounting speculation that Sir John is struggling to balance the views of the inquiry panel on some key issues, suggesting that his report may not be completed for months. A spokesman for the inquiry confirmed that the legal process in which figures like Mr Blair will be given the chance to respond to criticism has not yet started. This process is expected to take at least two months and must be completed before the report can be released. Sir Jeremy acknowledged last week that there had been a ‘delay of sorts’ while thousands of requests to declassify documents were considered. But he insisted there would not be a cover-up. Giving evidence to MPs he said: ‘I am absolutely confident that the report will be as transparent as it needs to be. ‘I can understand people’s frustration but I think the report will be more transparent than you are expecting, and I don’t think in any shape or form it can be called a cover-up . June 15, 2009: Prime Minister Gordon Brown announces inquiry led by Sir John Chilcot ‘to consider the period from the summer of 2001 to the end of July 2009, embracing the run-up to the conflict in Iraq, the military action and its aftermath’. November 24, 2009: First public hearings. January 29, 2010: Tony Blair gives evidence. Says he has no regrets about removing Saddam. Booed as he leaves. February 2, 2011: Final public hearing. Former foreign secretary Jack Straw says UK never had a policy of regime change. November 16, 2011: Report’s release put back until at least the summer of 2012 following a dispute with the Cabinet Office over the use of classified documents, including Mr Blair’s private messages to President Bush in the run-up to the war. July 16, 2012: Sir John says the report will not be published before the middle of 2013 because no decision had been reached on which documents should be released. November 7, 2013: Sir John suggests publication could be delayed indefinitely by row over over 130 new transcripts of conversations between Brown, Blair and Bush. May 16, 2014: David Cameron says he hopes for publication by end of the year. May 27, 2014: Mr Blair insists he is not the reason for the hold-up, saying he wants to hear the findings so he can defend himself. May 29, 2014: Deal reached for extracts of exchanges between Blair and Bush to be published – but full texts will remain secret. September 14, 2014: Whitehall sources say Sir John is still requesting classified documents from civil servants, as it emerges legal letters to key Labour figures are yet to be sent. It is now unlikely the report will be published before the 2015 General Election.","Legal letters to Labour figures, such as Tony Blair, are yet to be sent out .

"The lawyer for a mother arrested after the bodies of three infants were found in her home said today he believed a basement boarder was the woman's boyfriend and fathered all the children - before rubbishing claims that the man was unaware of the horrific conditions upstairs. Lawyer Keith Halpern also said that he's optimistic forensic testing will show the babies weren't born alive, and therefore weren't harmed or killed by his client. Erika Murray, 31, was charged on Friday with fetal death concealment and other counts after authorities found the bodies in her squalid, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, a town near the Rhode Island border and about 50 miles southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. A medical examiner is determining whether the remains were newborns or fetuses, and how they died. One body still had the placenta attached. The lawyer for Erika Murray, 31, (pictured on Friday) said that he's optimistic that forensic testing will prove the three dead babies found at her Massachusetts home last week were not harmed or killed . Her alleged boyfriend, who has not been named, told investigators that he was unaware of the horrific circumstances throughout the rest of the home. Mr Halpern told the Boston Herald: 'He lived in the house — they shared a bedroom... He did not live exclusively in the basement. ... I think the notion that he barricaded himself in the basement and did not know what the rest of the house looked like is absurd.' Two weeks ago, state officials took custody of Murray's four children, aged six months to 13 years, after discovering the dirty conditions of the home - which prosecutors and neighbors said included soiled diapers piled up 2 feet high and the remains of a cat and a dog. One wall had to be knocked down due to feces contamination. Authorities found the bodies of the babies last week after getting a search warrant. Mr Halpern said he's hopeful the tests will show the dead infants were stillborn. He also expects DNA testing to show that Murray and her longtime boyfriend were the parents of the infants. A worker throws a bag of debris from the squalid home on Sunday after it was condemned following the discovery of three dead babies inside . 'I … am eager to see whether the forensic testing confirms that in fact the children that are deceased … were never born alive,' Halpern said. Halpern told The Boston Globe in an earlier interview that Murray secretly gave birth to her two youngest children because she was scared, after her boyfriend told her he didn't want any more children after their first two. He told the newspaper Murray tried to conceal from her boyfriend the fact that the two youngest children were hers, and apparently told him she was babysitting them. Halpern said Murray was fearful during the five pregnancies, including the ones of her two youngest children and the dead infants. He said it's wasn't clear to him how much of the fear was attributable to the mental illness he believes Murray has and how much was due to real-life concerns. 'Try to imagine the kind of fear and sort of loss of control over your life that would lead a woman to give birth to a child alone on the floor of her bathroom. That's was she was going through,' Halpern said, but didn't elaborate on which child or children he was referring to. 'This terror just controlled her. She couldn't figure out how to get out of the prison she created for herself. 'She is clearly mentally ill,' he said, 'because the lengths to which she went to try to hide these children … no one in their right mind would have done this.' A Blackstone Police officer guards a home after the remains of three infants were discovered inside last week. Cleaning crews have been brought in to gut the condemned house which was filled with bugs and trash . Halpern declined to discuss Murray's relationship with her boyfriend and whether she was scared because she believed he would harm her. He also declined to comment when asked what Murray told him about the three dead babies. The boyfriend hasn't been charged in connection with the dead infants or the conditions in the home, where he also lived. The children first came to the attention of police two weeks ago when a ten-year-old boy who lived in the house went to a neighbor and asked, 'How do you get a baby to stop crying?' said Tim Connolly, a spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. The neighbor went with the boy and found the crying baby covered in feces, but no adults around. Police were called and notified the state Department of Children and Families, which removed the four children - ages 13, ten, three and six months - from the home. Murray was then charged with two counts of reckless endangerment, and the house was condemned. Based on interviews with the two older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house. Officers found the remains of three babies, one in a closet on Wednesday and two others on Thursday. Community members planned a vigil for Sunday evening to show support for Murray's children. Prosecutors said the home was piled with two-feet stacks of soiled diapers and the remains of several animals were also found.","Erika Murray, 31, was charged Friday with fetal death concealment after officials found bodies in her bug and rat-infested home in Blackstone .

"Oscar Pistorius is set to cash in on his notoriety as the killer of Reeva Steenkamp by writing a book about the night he shot her and the sensational murder trial that followed, his manager has confirmed. News that the fallen South African hero is planning his own memoir of the Valentine's Day tragedy will undoubtedly heap fresh anguish on the dead model's already-tortured family. The book – which would almost certainly bring film offers in its wake – is thought to be the easiest way in which the Paralympic gold medalist can raise much-needed funds to settle his legal costs. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius plans to write a book about the night he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp, his manager said . Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide after shooting Reeva (left) through a bathroom door. He will be sentenced on October 13 . With his sentencing hearing still a month away, Pistorius, 27, is understood to have a shortfall in meeting bills submitted by his formidable legal team, even after liquidising his assets. And if the state go ahead with an appeal against conviction or sentence – which seems increasingly likely given the growing backlash since Pistorius was cleared of murder – he is under pressure to build 'a war chest' to fund many more months or even years of legal battles. His manager and close confidant Peet van Zyl told The Observer that he and the track star had spent the months leading up to his murder trial fleshing out a book proposal. 'He will write his own book,' Mr van Zyl confirmed. 'We've discussed it. We've talked about ideas and concepts. 'I will sit down with him once everything is done and decide what we are going to do. We have to wait until 13 October before we can think about anything. After that we will tell the world what we are going to do.' There has been a massive international reaction to Pistorius' shock acquittal of the murder of his 29-year-old girlfriend, who died when he fired four bullets at her through the locked door of a tiny lavatory cubicle. Peet van Zyl, Pistorius' manager, confirmed that they had sat down and discussed plans for the double-amputee to write a book about the night he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp . Judge Thokozile Masipa accepted Pistorius' story that he fired repeatedly at the door, suspecting an intruder was behind it, and cleared him of murder . Judge Thokozile Masipa accepted Pistorius' story that he fired repeatedly at the door, suspecting an intruder was behind it. He was cleared of murdering Miss Steenkamp but convicted of culpable homicide. He has been bailed until his sentencing, which was adjourned until October 13, with many experts saying a jail sentence is unlikely. At the weekend, the sister of Nicole Brown - the wife of American football star OJ Simpson who was also dramatically cleared of her murder - drew her own painful parallels. Simpson wrote the book If I Did It after he was acquitted of the murders of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, who were killed in 1994. Denise Brown wrote in Time magazine: 'The Oscar Pistorius case reminds me so much of what happened to Nicole. 'We are seeing the same crimes, just different names, over and over again.' Miss Steenkamp's parents, June and Barry Steenkamp, were visibly emotional during the  hearing on Friday. June Steenkamp condemned the handling of the trial, saying she did not believe Pistorius' version of events . Following Pistorius' sentence, Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, condemned the handling of the trial in an interview with NBC Today. She said: 'I just don't feel that this is the right sentence. They believe his story - and I don't believe that story. 'There were so many mistakes made. It didn't add up. 'It was disbelief on our minds, it was disbelief on everyone in the world who has been following the case. 'I really don't what happens to Oscar. It's not going to change anything because my daughter's never coming back. 'He's still living and breathing. And she's gone forever.'","Pistorius' manager Peet van Zyl confirms double-amputee's book plans .

"It is not the most scientific way of predicting the result of a vote, but supporters of Scottish independence will be hoping the result of this two horse race bodes well for Thursday's referendum. Two evenly matched horses – called Yes We Can and Neigh Thanks – took part in a specially staged race at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh. And despite the bookmakers having each equally handicapped runner at 5/6, Yes We Can won easily, beating its rival by four lengths. Yes We Can beat rival Neigh Thanks by four lengths in a specially staged independence-themed race . Jockeys Rachael Grant (left) rode Yes We Can horse and Carol Bartley (right) rode Neigh Thanks . Both horses were provided by Scottish trainer Jim Goldie, 58, who said: 'Somebody put it to me and wondered whether I would supply the horses for such a race. ''Yes' went straight ahead. Two or three weeks ago it was definitely Better Together. I would be surprised if the Yes campaign win by four lengths like their horse did today. 'The horses were handicapped. The one that was second, Neigh Thanks, was stronger, but we gave her more weight to slow down. 'I don't think it will make a difference to the referendum, but if it gets more people out to vote that's democracy. 'Folk should go out and vote cause it's obviously going to determine Scottish future. Ms Grant said: 'It's amazing to be a part of something this historic for Scotland' The specially-staged race took place at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh . 'What will be will be. It's a horse race and there will always be winners and losers. It was always going to be a good crack. That's the main thing.' Winning jockey Rachel Grant said: 'It was brilliant. I am obviously very pleased. It's amazing to be a part of something this historic for Scotland. 'It was really quite something.' Neigh Thanks - real name Midnight Dynamo - was ridden by Carol Bartley, a three-times champion amateur lady jockey. After the race, which was organised by Ladbrokes, both jockey strips were put up for auction, with the 'Yes' shirt making £500 and the 'No' shirt making £300 for the Cash for Kids charity. Winning the independence referendum will be no piece of cake, but the No campaign might have found the recipe for success, according to an unusual poll. An Edinburgh bakery has been monitoring sales of its Union flag and Saltire-iced cupcakes since March to try to predict the outcome of Scotland's referendum. Cuckoo's revealed today that the No cake has outsold its rival in the run-up to the historic vote. The Dundas Street bakery said that of the thousands of its opinion poll cupcakes consumed, 47.7% were No cakes and 43.5% were Yes. The undecideds - who opted for a cake with an iced question mark - made up the remaining 8.8%. Co-founder Graham Savage said: 'We have seen an increase in sales generally and some big orders have come in from both sides. 'Our poll has been conducted professionally throughout the campaign and we are delighted that the results have shown to be so similar to the official results. 'We have calculated that since the campaign was launched, we have sold 80,000 cupcakes from our full range, including the Opinion Poll cupcake.' Official polls released at the weekend put the Yes and No camps neck and neck. Three put the No campaign in the lead while one put the independence movement ahead. The opinion poll cakes are raspberry and white chocolate flavoured and cost £2.50 to take away or £3 to eat in.","Two evenly matched horses, Yes We Can and Neigh Thanks, took part in specially staged race .

"Hundreds of people turned out for an emotional memorial service held for up to 60 dogs that died in a suspected arson attack on Manchester Dogs' Home. Staff from the home, many of them dressed in uniform, joined around 300 members of the public and wept at Christ Church in Hapurhey, near the gutted dogs' home, as Reverend Mike McGurk led a service paying tribute to the animals who burned to death. Meanwhile donations to a fund set up to help rebuild the home soared to nearly £1.5million, boosted by a pledge of £25,000 from X Factor guru Simon Cowell. Scroll down for video .

Hundreds of people flocked to Christ Church where the Reverend Mike McGurk paid tribute to the animals . Members of the public brought their own pets to the service at Christ Church, Harpurhey, near the dogs' home . Cowell, a renowned dog lover, not only promised to write a large cheque for the appeal, but also vowed to take the three men who rescued the surviving dogs from the blaze on a luxury holiday. Jason Dyer, his son Danny Vere, and Dean Rostock risked their own lives by running into the flames and pulling dogs out as fire raged through the home on Thursday night. Cowell said he would pay for the three of them to go on an all expenses-paid holiday after a Twitter user suggested it to him. After learning of the fire, Cowell wrote on Twitter: 'Unbelieveable!  Donation on its way.' Asked if he would give the men a holiday, he replied straight away: 'Yes I will.' Today it emerged that the family of the boy suspected of starting the blaze may be moved by police over fears of violent reprisals from animals lovers.

Meanwhile Coronation Street actor Jack P Shepherd had to issue an apology after joking about the fire on Twitter. Shepherd, 26, who plays David Platt in the soap, caused uproar on Twitter when he posted 'I have a million 'hot dog' jokes'. When people responded in anger he added: 'You guys need to lighten up. £GetItLightenUp.' This morning the total pledged to the charity fund was more than £1.4m as dog-lovers rushed to help . 'Sorry': Coronation Street actor Jack P Shepherd, left, had to apologise after tweeting jokes about 'hot dogs' It led to outrage on the social networking website. Some even called on people to boycott the soap. Later, Shepherd tweeted an apology and said he had made a donation to the dogs' home. He wrote: 'I sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. This was not intended to be a malicious tweet and I didn't consider the offence it would cause. 'At the time I didn't realise the scale of the tragedy but that doesn't excuse my behaviour. I now realise how insensitive I have been. I have made a donation to the MCR dogs home and I'm very sorry for my behaviour.'","Reverend Mike McGurk led emotional service at Christ Church, Harpurhey .

"A leading medical expert who has defended parents accused of killing their children in ‘shaken baby’ cases has been accused of being dishonest and misleading the courts. Dr Waney Squier – a renowned authority on infant brains who has given evidence in dozens of cases where parents have been accused of killing their children - appeared before a fitness to practise panel yesterday charged with ‘bringing the profession into disrepute’. Dr Waney Squier – a renowned authority on infant brains who has given evidence in dozens of cases where parents have been accused of killing their children . She is accused of giving evidence beyond her expertise and of failing to be objective and unbiased in her role as an expert witness in six court cases between 2007 and 2010. The charges could see her struck off if a full tribunal hearing, due to be held in March, finds against her. And they could have far-reaching consequences for past and future cases of people accused of inflicting serious and fatal brain injuries on babies. But supporters of Dr Squier, 66, believe she has been the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ by the police, who allegedly want to stop her from giving evidence for the defence in court cases. For decades the pathologist, who works at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, appeared as a prosecution witness against accused parents. She supported mainstream opinion that a combination of three brain injuries – known as the ‘triad’ – was sufficient to prove the baby had been violently shaken. However, more than ten years ago she was influenced by new research into having a change of heart. She became convinced shaken baby syndrome may not exist and the triad signs could occur naturally in a baby. Her subsequent expert witness evidence in the defence of parents in court for killing their babies has led to her being controversially brought before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester. Dr Squier said she denies all the charges and has promised to ‘put up a very robust defence’. Around 250 cases a year in the UK involve shaken baby syndrome and if she is cleared by the panel the findings of hundreds of cases may be open to question. The fitness to practise hearing focuses on six civil and criminal cases in which Dr Squier gave expert testimony. ‘This whole case revolves around expert evidence given in cases of alleged baby shaking,’ said Tom Kark, QC, for the General Medical Council. There will be two weeks of legal argument before a full public hearing next year. Details of the charges could be changed before the case is heard in March. Sir Robert Francis, QC, defending Dr Squier, told the panel yesterday: ‘This is a case of considerable substance, great public importance and considerable complexity. The Lorraine Harris case reported in the Mail in 2005 . For decades Dr Squier, who works at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (above), appeared as a prosecution witness against accused parents . Dr Waney Squier is accused of giving evidence beyond her expertise and of failing to be objective and unbiased in her role as an expert witness in six court cases between 2007 and 2010 . Dr Squier has previously spoken about the continuing battle with the authorities for her opinion to be accepted. Her view that bleeding in the brain can occur naturally in young babies is shared by a minority of pathologists. In 2011 she said: ‘If I am blocked from giving evidence in court, defendants already having to cope with the tragic death of a baby will not get the benefit of the new science. Equally, if the courts fail to accept that the mainstream view of 30 years ago can no longer be relied upon, there will be serious miscarriages of justice.’ In 2000 Lorraine Harris from Derbyshire was jailed for three years for the manslaughter of her four-month-old baby by shaking. Dr Squier gave evidence for the prosecution at Nottingham Crown Court, but by the time the appeal was heard in 2005 the expert had made an about-turn about the medical evidence. She appeared for the defence this time and the conviction was quashed. Three paediatric consultants were criticised by a judge yesterday for suggesting that a baby had been repeatedly shaken by its parents – without giving evidence to back their theory up. In a case in which a couple faced seeing their three infant daughters being taken into care, the experts said the baby could have been injured after being shaken several times. But Judge Heather Swindells said: ‘There was not an iota of evidence to support such a possibility.’ The judge ordered that the children should stay with their 30-year-old mother and 23-year-old father, whom she described as ‘loving, caring parents’, and she cleared them of having harmed their daughters. Lincolnshire social workers had applied for the girls – one aged two and twins almost a year old – to be taken into care after doctors claimed one of the twins had received a head injury after being shaken. The girl became limp and floppy while in her father’s arms last November. The family dialled 999, and the child was found in hospital to have fluid on the brain. There were no other injuries. At the Family Court in Lincoln, the three consultants gave evidence to back up the theory that the baby had been shaken. Dr Stephen Chapman of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Jayaratnam Jayamohan, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Dr George Rylance, who has retired from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, cited a 2005 statistical study that found 86 per cent of similar cases were caused by the baby being shaken. But all suggested the baby may have been injured after being shaken several times. Judge Swindells said: ‘The universal evidence of health visitors was that the parents are loving, caring parents with good interaction with their children.’ She said the cause of the injury was unknown, and she ‘totally exonerated’ the children’s parents.","Dr Waney Squier has given evidence in dozens of cases where parents have been accused of killing their children .

A female driver was taken to hospital suffering shock after the crash in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah at 11.30 am, police told Daily Mail Australia. The crash occurred at the same spot  as where a 20-year-old student was killed by a car in 2007. The driver, an unlicensed 26-year-old woman, was arrested on Monday night and was being questioned by police. Ms Patel, who studied at Kogarah High School, was hit while waiting for a bus and trapped under the vehicle in the chemist next to an ANZ bank. She suffered critical injuries and died at the scene.

"Lewis Hamilton admitted he 'enjoyed the ride' as he won and extended his championship lead at a wet Suzuka -  but it was a serious injury to Marussia's Jules Bianchi which overshadowed the Japanese Grand Prix. Rain had long-threatened the running of a grand prix which could yet prove pivotal in Hamilton's title battle with Mercedes team-mate and pole sitter Nico Rosberg as the Brit outpaced his nearest rival to finish the shortened race in front. A red flag had stopped the action after just two laps as - despite starting the race behind the safety car - the heavy rain being pushed over Suzuka by Typhoon Phanfone continued to fall. Lewis Hamilton said he and his F1 colleagues are praying for Jules Bianchi who was injured on Sunday . Once the race had restarted there followed a prolonged dry spell during which time Hamilton caught and passed Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance. The race would not be completed, however, as the rain returned and saw driving conditions deteriorate, with Bianchi crashing out late on to see the red flags return. The 25-year-old Frenchman aquaplaned and left the track in the same place where Sauber's Adrian Sutil had suffered a similar fate on the previous lap. Bianchi was understood to have crashed into the recovery vehicle that was in the process of removing Sutil's car and, with an ambulance deployed, the race was halted after 44 laps and Hamilton declared the winner. Jules Bianchi was taken to hospital after crashing in wet conditions at the Japanese Grand Prix . Medics rush to the aid of French driver Jules Bianchi after an accident during the Japanese Grand Prix - his Marussia car spun off the track and hit a recovery vehicle . The victory moves the 2008 champion 10 points ahead of Rosberg with four races remaining but Hamilton, as well as all of his fellow drivers, was subdued in the aftermath of Bianchi's incident which had seen the Marussia driver knocked unconscious and taken to hospital. 'It's been an interesting weekend,' said Hamilton. 'Our first thoughts go to Jules - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him. Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all. 'Generally the car was absolutely fantastic through the race and once I passed Nico I was able to really manage the gap and enjoy the ride. Obviously it didn't finish the way we would have hoped but really, my prayers are with Bianchi and his family.' Rosberg, who could not convert an eighth pole position of the season into the win which would have put him top of the standings, conceded Hamilton had been better than him on the day. 'Congratulations to Lewis for winning today,' he said. 'Of course my thoughts at the moment are with our colleague Jules because it seems quite serious, so I really wish him all the best. 'All in all, Lewis just did a better job than me today and deserves to win. Second place is damage limitation and taking everything into consideration, it was very difficult conditions...so seven points lost to Lewis, there is worse than that.' Sebastian Vettel completed the podium on the weekend the four-time world champion revealed he would be leaving Red Bull at the end of the season. He edged out team-mate Daniel Ricciardo who finished fourth ahead of the McLaren of Jenson Button, who had profited from an early pit-stop onto the quicker intermediate tyre. Bianchi's father told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he is undergoing surgery for head injuries. The 25-year-old is pictured doing a lap of the rain soaked track before the race . The Williams pair of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa finished sixth and seventh respectively, whilst Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez also scored points - with the Toro Rosso of Jean-Eric Vergne sandwiched between the Force India duo in ninth, despite having taken a 10-place grid penalty for a new power unit. Daniil Kvyat has been announced as Vettel's replacement for 2015 and the sister Toro Rosso came home 11th ahead of the sole-remaining Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen as Fernando Alonso retired early on with an electrical fault. Esteban Gutierrez came home a respectable 13th for Sauber, with the second McLaren of Kevin Magnussen also finishing ahead of the Lotus' of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Marcus Ericsson took 17th place for Caterham, with Bianchi's team-mate Max Chilton 18th and home favourite Kamui Kobayashi bringing up the rear.","Lewis Hamilton admits he 'enjoyed the ride as he won Japanese Grand Prix .

"Pranging your boyfriend's car is always going to cause a bit of tension in a relationship. But when your beau is a successful Nascar driver and you've sent his vehicle spinning across the track, it's just that bit more awkward. So  Danica Patrick will no doubt have some making up to do after she was involved in an on-track incident with fellow driver - and boyfriend - Ricky Stenhouse Jr. in the closing laps of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race. Patrick was running 18th with 10 laps to go in the opening race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois, when she made contact with Stenhouse's car. Ricky Stenhouse spun across the track and received left front damage to his race car. Danica Patrick hit the outside retaining wall, suffering damage to the right front end of her vehicle . Patrick was running 18th   at Chicagoland Speedway when she made contact with her boyfriend's car . Danica Patrick and Ricky Stenhouse in LA earlier this year. The couple have been dating for about two years . Her car turned and hit the outside retaining wall, suffering damage to its right front end. Meanwhile, Stenhouse spun across the track and received left front damage to his race car. Patrick, who has been dating Stenhouse for the past two years, radioed her crew with the words: 'The 17 hit me' She then made it back to the pits and received brief repairs by her crew, before heading back to the racetrack to finish 19th. Patrick, 32, is well-known both on and off the racetrack. As well as being the first woman to race full-time on Nascar’s senior circuit in 36 years, the race car driver - who now lives in Phoenix, Arizona - has graced the cover of a number of magazines, including Sports Illustrated. 'I heard my spotter (Brandon Benesch) say that the 14 (Patrick's team mate, Tony Stewart) was below me on track, and I didn't know the 17 (Stenhouse) was there on the high side of the track,' she said after the incident. 'My spotter took the blame on that one. Patrick, who has been dating Stenhouse for the past two years, radioed her crew : 'The 17 hit me' 'I just didn't know Ricky was up there, and I obviously don't want to hit his car or anyone else with 10 laps to go. I talked with Ricky afterward, and we're fine. It's just a tough deal. We finished 19th even with the damage, so it was a decent run.' After pulling into the garage area after the race, Patrick quickly climbed out of her banged-up car and headed straight to the drivers' motorhome lot without speaking to the press. Stenhouse finished 17th and didn't release any statement on the incident after the race.

"The stepdaughter of a war veteran was banned from wearing a T-shirt paying tribute to the lives lost on September 11, 2001 because it violated her school's dress code. The sixth-grader, who has not been named, was told by administrators in the Orangevale, California, school system that she was to instead wear her school uniform as normal. The 11-year-old's stepfather, Tim Foster, said his family wear the shirt every year to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Twin Towers. The shirt displays the names of those who lost their lives and says: 'In Darkness We Shine Brightest'.

"As Eileen Brown and her dog stand on a bluff at Santa Monica's Palisades Park and survey endless miles of sparkling blue ocean, clear skies and shimmering sandy beaches, she ponders how life could possibly get any better in this corner of paradise. 'Really, it seems just about perfect,' the Los Angeles woman concludes. There's a picturesque pier off in the distance with an old-fashioned merry-go-round that stands nearly side-by-side with the world's first solar-powered Ferris wheel. The sun is shining brightly, the temperature is a pleasant 79 degrees and a light sea breeze makes everything feel just right. Not happy enough? Sunny, well-off Santa Monica, California fought off 300 other cities for a million dollar grant...and they're using it to gauge their own happiness . But there's also loads of traffic and a high cost of living, two things that recently prompted the real estate blog Movoto to rate Santa Monica No. 2 on its Top 10 list of America's Most Stressed-Out Suburbs. To do something about that, the city of 92,000 applied last year for a Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge grant, proposing that it create a 'Wellbeing Project' to determine just how much people in this picture-postcard town really like living here. Santa Monica beat out 300 other U.S. cities in securing $1 million. This week, officials will begin asking residents how involved they are in community activities, if they know who to turn to in times of crisis, if they know their neighbors, how healthy they are, how lonely they might be and how good an education they believe their kids are receiving. Then they'll examine what changes are needed to make life better. 'It's really about trying to get a much clearer understanding of who the people of Santa Monica are, what they are doing and what we can do on a local government level to help ensure people are thriving,' said Julie Rusk, assistant director of community and cultural services. Loosen up: The breezy beach town was called one of America's most stressed out suburbs despite its laid-back reputation, so officials are trying to find out why . Some of the other four cities that won grants are going the more traditional route. Houston, for example, plans on building a better trash-collection system. Rusk says Santa Monica came up with The Wellbeing Project after the launch of its Cradle to Career Initiative in 2011. That effort, to learn how students felt about themselves, began after a tragic period that included a teenager committing suicide by throwing himself off a high-rise hotel. 'What we found out was only a third of kindergarteners were really ready socially, emotionally, physically, cognitively, for kindergarten,' Rusk said. In a community where more than three quarters of adults have college degrees, that was a stunning discovery. About that same time, the city learned its efforts to promote health and fitness might have gotten out of hand when residents complained that commercial trainers had turned Palisades Park into an open-air gymnasium, making it difficult to do anything else there. After months of debate, the city restricted who could use parks for commercial purposes. And on a recent weekday, there wasn't a weight machine or yoga mat in sight at Palisades Park. Instead, it was filled with people having picnics, jugglers, skateboarders, strollers, dog walkers, musicians and someone operating a bubble-making machine. Some of the other four cities that won grants are going the more traditional route. Houston, for example, plans on building a better trash-collection system . If The Wellbeing Project works as they hope, city officials could tweak other public services. Brown, who loads her dog into the car a couple times a month and travels to the park to unwind, couldn't see too many things to improve. The site of numerous homeless people sprawled out in the shadow of beach-front condominiums did trouble her, however. Brown said she avoids the city's notoriously traffic-choked freeway by taking surface streets from downtown LA. The locals cite the traffic jams, the homelessness and the cost of living as problems that make Santa Monica not quite as pleasant as outsiders think. 'We're choking on gridlock from overdevelopment,' says 30-year resident Tricia Crane, who complained of watching the city transform from a quiet beach town of cottage-style homes and modest two-story apartments to one of high-rise condos and apartments with high mortgages and rents. The median price of a home is $992,000. Soon, says street musician Charles Baker Jr., paradise could become the province of just the rich. 'The way it's going, nobody is going to be able to afford to live here anymore,' he said as he sat in the park with his keyboard.","Other recipients have used the money for practical purposes like improving trash collection .

"Lamar Hawkins, 14, was found dead with a bullet wound to his head at Seminole County school . The family of a 14-year-old boy who shot himself dead in a school bathroom have claimed he endured years of bullying at school. Lamar Hawkins III was found dead with a bullet wound to his head at a Seminole County middle school on September 11, just hours after being reported missing by his mother. Today at a news conference his mother, Shaniqua Hawkins, fought back tears and said she felt powerless to help her son against the bullies. 'It was a feeling I hope no other parent has to fear,' she said. 'They won, because he took his life as a result,' she said reported the Orlando Sentinel. 'We called him Shaq because despite his size, he had a larger than life personality and attitude towards life,' said Shaniqua Hawkins, Lamar's mother. 'Shaq was physically and emotionally abused while at school. Many students would be just down right cruel to him,' she said reported WFTV. She claimed he was pushed down the stairs, knocked out of his chair and mocked at lunch. 'The child was a relatively small child for his age due to complications early in life,' attorney Matt Morgan said Friday. 'As a result, he became a very easy target for mean-spirited bullies. According to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, Lamar's mother drove to Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 5pm, but could not find him. The boy's family then set out scouring the neighborhood for him, but to no avail.

Many students would be just down right cruel to him' Two hours later, the 14-year-old was reported missing to police. Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Greenwood Lakes Middle School to search the campus, where they eventually came upon the missing boy, who was found in a men's room stall with a bullet wound to the head. Police said Lamar shot himself with a gun that belonged to his father, Lamar Hawkins Sr., 34. According to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, the child's mother drove to Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 5pm, but could not find him. He was found dead two hours later . Police said Lamar shot himself with a gun that belonged to his father, Lamar Hawkins Sr., 34 . 'We are still investigating the facts leading up to this tragedy and I can tell you that Mr. Hawkins' firearm was stored with full compliance of Florida law,' said Matt Morgan, attorney for the Hawkins family. Police are still investigating how he managed to get hold of the gun.  No charges have been announced.

The suicide prompted hundreds of mourners to gather for a vigil across the street from the Lake Mary school late Friday. Pictured: Balloons were released to remember Lamar . Friends and family gather to pay their respects to the teenager who was allegedly bullied . 'He was tortured by mean-spirited children at his school and ultimately took his own life as a result,' said Matt Morgan, of Morgan and Morgan Law Firm. 'It was physical, it was mental, it was emotional. It was repeated attacks by individuals at this school that ultimately led him to make the final decision to end his life,' he said. He said that the family even moved from New York to Florida to help their son, but his call for help allegedly went largely ignored. One student told the Orlando Sentinel: 'This one girl was beating him up since sixth grade and he was in eighth grade and no one knew it really bothered him.' Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Cannaday told the Orlando Sentinel that investigators are still trying to determine why the boy killed himself and whether bullying was a factor. 'It's really unclear whether that played a role in this,' Cannaday said. 'We're still trying to determine the events that led up to this tragedy.' Also at today's news conference was Tricia Norman, whose 12-year-old daughter, Rebecca Sedwick, (both pictured) jumped to her death in September 2013 after months of alleged cyber-bullying .

"A tremendous late scoring burst gave South Africa victory over Australia in Cape Town and took them second in the Rugby Championship. Marcell Coetzee's try gave South Africa a 13th-minute lead and, although Australia led 10-5 at half-time - Bernard Foley with a penalty and Adam Ashley-Cooper quickly adding a converted try - they were held scoreless in the second half. The home side finally edged ahead again with Pat Lambie's drop goal 10 minutes from time and his try was sandwiched by two from Jean de Villiers as South Africa recorded not just a 28-10 victory, but a bonus point too. Captain Jean de Villiers (left) scored two late tries to help South Africa defeat Australia 28-10 . The centre's two late tries turned around what looked like a defeat for the Boks into a comprehensive win . A delighted De Villiers posed with his children and the Nelson Mandela trophy after the bonus-point victory . The opening try came when the Boks pack powered over off a line-out, flanker Coetzee in possession and claiming the score. Handre Pollard dragged his conversion attempt wide and Foley cut the deficit to 5-3 with his 24th-minute penalty after Adriaan Strauss took down Ashley-Cooper illegally. Tevita Kuridrani then burst through and sent Ashley-Cooper in for a superb try which, Foley adding the conversion, gave the Wallabies the half-time advantage. Flanker Marcell Coetzee (left) put the hosts ahead with a 13th minute try, but the Wallabies fought back . Adam Ashley-Cooper crashed over to score a try for the visitors despite being tackled by Francois Hougaard . Pollard slotted a penalty after an infringement at a ruck, but, with defence on top, it remained 10-8 until the 70th minute. That was when replacement half-back Lambie landed the drop goal that took South Africa 11-10 up - and they took full advantage in a dramatic end to the match. A superb break involving Jan Serfontein and Cornal Hendricks sparked the move that led to De Villiers' first score. The wing jinked across one tackle and hurdled another and, although the ball was scrappily recycled, De Villiers was able to crash over in the corner. Replacement Pat Lambie put South Africa 11-10 up in the 70th minute and added a try eight minutes later . Lambie then made the game safe, dummying through for the Springboks' third try a minute from time - and there was still time for De Villiers to clinch a bonus point after the hooter. Cobus Reinach made the break, taking advantage of more shambolic tackling from the visitors, and the ball was worked across the field - including an outlandish through-the-legs scoop by Schalk Burger - for Victor Matfield to send De Villiers inside the left corner post.","South Africa beat Australia 28-10 in the Rugby Championship .

"Seven Colombians accused of involvement in the stabbing death of a U.S. drug agent have been handed over to American authorities. The men were delivered to U.S. officials Tuesday at a police base in the capital city of Bogota. The men have been indicted in the U.S. on charges that they murdered 43-year-old DEA agent James 'Terry' Watson in Bogota in 2013. Scroll down for video . USA-bound: Police present to the press seven Colombians accused in the killing of US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent James Terry Watson, who was stabbed to death during a robbery in June 2013 . The seven men involved in the murder of Watson on June 20 last year in Bogota will be presented before Court of East District Virgina for intentional murder of a protected person and other crimes . Killed: James 'Terry' Watson was murdered by a gang of kidnappers in Bogota in Colombia. Seven men accused of the murder will now stand trial in Virginia after being extradited Tuesday . Authorities say they posed as taxi drivers, and were trying to take Watson on what's called a 'millionaire's ride', in which criminals force victims to remove cash from ATMs. Watson was on assignment in Colombia and had been watching the NBA finals at a bar in Bogota on June 30, 2013. He left and hailed a cab, but the taxi was a fake. Typically robbers drug the victims and take them to different ATM machines to withdraw cash. At a stop light, Watson's cab was approached by another car and two men, who were part of the 'paseo millonario', jumped in, according to CBS. Watson attempted to fight back and was stabbed, authorities said. He ran out of the cab, collapsed and died from his wounds. The crime is also referred to as 'express kidnapping'. U.S. and Colombian officials believe the killing was unrelated to Watson's drug enforcement role. The suspects were identified as Wilson Peralta, Edgar Murillo, Hector Lopez, Edwin Figueroa, Omar Valdes, Julio Ramirez and Andres Oviedo. They are expected to stand trial in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. Sting: The operation known as 'millionaire's ride' involved threatening wealthy tourists in Bogota with violence . Their families are protesting that they did not have an opportunity to say goodbye to the men. However Colombian press reports have linked the group to more than 50 such robberies. Police investigators say they have evidence against the men taken by 40 different video surveillance cameras. Watson can reportedly be seen on the footage running from the cab. There is also said to be footage of the suspects washing blood stains from the cab at a taxi terminal the following day. Colombian police Gen. Ricardo Restrepo said Tuesday that the seven men were among 94 Colombians extradited so far this year to stand trial in foreign countries, Fox News reported. The suspects were eligible for extradition because Watson was living and working in Colombia with diplomatic status, U.S. officials claimed. They said the Vienna convention enabled the transfer.","DEA agent James 'Terry' Watson was on assignment in Bogota, Colombia, when he was murdered in June 2013 .

"It's the cruise vessel that was branded the 'Pandemic Princess' after hundreds of passengers were struck down with the norovirus last week. Now the owners of the troubled Sea Princess cruise ship have been forced to apologise after around 2000 passengers were left stranded in Fremantle, WA, because of engine problems. Disgruntled holidaygoers took to the vessel's Facebook page to express their anger. 'Virus vessel': The Sea Princess' was dubbed the 'Pandemic Princess' by some disgruntled customers after a 'small percentage' of passengers came down with the norovirus, a gastrointestinal virus which causes stomach cramping, vomiting and diarrhoea. 'She is ONE SICK SHIP': One customer expressed her anger over her Sea Princess experience. 'Cruise from hell': Another customer was displeased with some aspects of the cruise. Outrage: One of several posts written by a disgruntled customer. The Sea Princess, dubbed the 'Pandemic Princess' and the 'virus vessel' after passengers came down with the norovirus last week, has been plagued with problems in recent weeks. 'They should have sorted out the engines ages ago,' one customer fumed. 'Feeling very upset like many other people, including the ones who (are) on board now.' On Sunday the Sea Princess was meant to embark on a 14 day cruise to Brisbane, via the Kimberley, Darwin and Papua New Guinea. The troubled cruise liner arrived in Fremantle via Singapore on Saturday, in a voyage that was marred by the outbreak of the norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness which causes diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramping. The ship had been travelling at reduced speeds for a number of weeks due to a mechanical issue. Engineers in Fremantle discovered an 'additional technical issue' while conducting repairs. Carnival Cruises spokesman David Jones said: 'On this basis, and with the deepest of regret, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Sea Princess' current cruise and proceed to dry dock where all the repairs can take place.' He said the company was 'profoundly sorry' to guests left stranded in Fremantle. Carnival Cruises has sent a team to Fremantle to help its stranded guests make alternative holiday arrangements, including arranging flights. Customers will also receive a full refund as well as 'cruise credit'. One angry passenger, who said she had been on board the vessel's previous trip, wrote on the company's Facebook page: 'Better off that the cruise has been cancelled. Disembarked yesterday... she is ONE SICK SHIP.' '(We) missed 3 ports that were on the itinerary, as well as many ill passengers as well as crew'. A trip to Bali was cancelled because the ship could not travel quickly enough. Voyager: The Sea Princess was scheduled to take around 2000 passengers on a trip around Australia's north coast to Brisbane. 'Knew they should have sorted out the engines ages ago': The vessel has been beset with engine difficulties in recent weeks. One traveller described their trip on the Sea Princess as the 'cruise from hell'. 'We didn't get sick thank god the ship is falling apart  lots blocked toilets,rooms getting flooded, dirty water from room tap wont say what it was, people and staff getting sick and the list goes on (sic).' Another tourist said her husband was bedridden for days with the illness. 'We are just off the 26 night cruise, sickness (was) horrible, my husband in cabin for 4 days,' she said. There were conflicting reports about the number of passengers who fell ill. One passenger told The West Australian newspaper as many as 200 guests came down with the virus. Mr Jones would only tell Daily Mail Australia 'a small percentage of guests' were affected by the 'stomach bug'. The ship remains docked in Fremantle and passengers have been allowed to stay on board. Concerned: This passenger said .

"Netflix, the American media giant that streams blockbuster movies and TV series over the internet, is to launch on this side of the Atlantic. Netflix will offer tens of thousands of films in the UK - including exclusive early access to new films. The move comes after a series of hiccups for the company in the U.S., including price hikes and a disastrous attempt to split off its DVD rental business into a new company called Qwikster. Neftlix lost 800,000 U.S. subscribers in the last quarter. In the UK, it will offer video streamed to PCs, TVs and consoles, rather than DVD rentals. Coming over to the UK. Netflix has signed a number of deals with leading film studios to have the first rights to offer blockbuster movies once they have finished their cinema run . Robert Downey Junior in Iron Man. In the USA, the company¿s 'watch Instantly' service holds first-run rights to films from Paramount Pictures, MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment. Paramount titles include Iron Man, Star Trek and Captain America. Netflix has 25 million users worldwide. It is said to be the biggest single source of North American web traffic, accounting for 24.71 per cent of use. North American customers typically pay around $7.99-$9.99 a month to stream Netflix films to electronics such as connected TVs, PCs and games consoles. In the UK, though, it's up against serious competition in the form of it Lovefilm, a UK on-demand service owned by Amazon which is integrated into electronics such as connected TVs and Sony's PlayStation 3. Netflix is pulling out the stops to try and ensure it offers a unique service. It has signed a number of deals with leading film studios to have the first rights to offer blockbuster movies once they have finished their cinema run. The company said the price details will be announced closer to the date of the launch of the service, which will go live in Britain and Ireland early next year. Rapid expansion: Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, already has 25million subscribers worldwide . The TechRadar website said: ‘This is pretty exciting news for fans of streaming content.’ Netflix was founded in California in 1997 initially as a DVD rental business where discs were posted to customers across the USA. It subsequently developed into the world’s largest supplier of web downloads of films and TV with 24.6million users in the US alone. The company has now embarked on a major international expansion. It began operating in Canada last year and recently added  43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. A spokesman said: ‘Netflix has revolutionised entertainment across the Americas by giving its members a huge selection of films and TV shows to enjoy when and where they want.’ ‘Upon launch, Netflix members from the UK and Ireland will be able to instantly watch a wide array of TV shows and films right on their TVs via a range of consumer electronics devices capable of streaming from Netflix, as well as on PCs, Macs and mobile tablets and phones.’ In the USA, the company’s ‘watch Instantly’ service holds first-run rights to films from Paramount Pictures, MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment. Paramount titles include Iron Man, Star Trek and Captain America. There are also deals with Sony Pictures, Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, and Anchor Bay Entertainment, together with US TV shows offered by NBC Universal and 20th Century Fox. Netflix is locked into complex negotiations with these companies to have the right to show all its output in the UK and Ireland. In Britain, the business will face competition from LoveFilm, which is owned by Amazon and offers packages that combine DVD postal rentals with access to streaming. Lovefilm deals start at £5.99 a month, which includes three DVD rentals a month and two hours of streaming.

"Perfect pitch may be part of the genetic programming of certain individuals, a study suggests. Scientists believe nature as well as nurture can help gifted singers hit the right note. People with perfect pitch have the ability to sing any note at precisely the right frequency without a reference tone to guide them. God-given gift? A new study suggests the ability to sing in perfect pitch may be part of the genetic programming of certain individuals . Perfect, or absolute, pitch is extremely rare, but more common among speakers of tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, who have musical training. Although a link has been seen between learning music and perfect pitch, most people lack the ability even with musical training. To investigate it is acquired or innate, U.S. scientists studied 27 English-speaking adults including seven with the gift. All began extensive musical training before the age of six. Absolute pitch, widely referred to as perfect pitch, is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of an external reference like a notes from a piano keyboard. People who possess absolute pitch have it in varying degrees. Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities: . Participants were given a standard memory test which involved recalling a series of numbers in correct order. In two versions of the 'digit test', numbers were either presented visually or spoken over headphones. Individuals with perfect pitch far outperformed the others in the audio test, while the two groups were evenly matched when recalling numbers on a screen. The finding is significant because previous research has shown there is a genetic component to speech memory. Study leader Professor Diana Deutsch, from the University of California at San Diego, said: 'We have wondered if perfect pitch is as much about nature or nurture. 'What is clear is that musically trained individuals who speak a non-tone language can acquire absolute pitch, but it is still a remarkably rare talent. 'What has been less clear is why most others with equivalent musical training do not. 'Our finding therefore shows that perfect pitch is associated with an unusually large memory span for speech sounds, which in turn could facilitate the development of associations between pitches and their spoken languages early in life.' The research was presented today at the annual meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Kansas City, Missouri.",U.S. scientists' findings show perfect pitch is associated with unusually large memory span for speech sounds .
"Wigan and Huddersfield kick off the Super League play-offs on Thursday, just as they launched the regular season more than seven months earlier, and the Giants are confident of obtaining a similar result. Paul Anderson's men stunned the 2013 champions by pulling off a 24-8 victory at the DW Stadium in early February, just before the Warriors set off for Australia to play in the World Club Challenge. Wigan lost just once more at home in Super League as they went on to secure a second-place finish thanks to impressive back-to-back wins over Leeds and Warrington - but Huddersfield will have no fears about travelling to the DW Stadium, where they have won on seven of their last 10 visits. Wigan Warriors captain Sean O'Loughlin is determined to end his team's hoodoo over Huddersfield, with Giants' forward Brett Ferres is hoping his side can improve on a disappointing season last term . Warriors captain Sean O'Loughlin said: 'They've been a bogey team for us over the last couple of years. 'They play well against us and we know we'll have to play as well as we did in the last couple of games if we want to get a win. 'The last two games have both been like play-off games, where both sides wanted the result. They were both tough, physical games which are what the play-offs are going to be like.' Huddersfield, who topped the league in 2013 for the first time for 81 years, ended the regular season as the form team with six wins and a draw from their last seven matches, including a nailbiting triumph over leaders St Helens last Friday. It meant they finished level on points with Wigan, although with an inferior points difference. However, the Giants have a woeful record in play-off rugby, with nine defeats from 11 ties so far, including one to Wigan in the 2013 play-offs at the John Smith's Stadium. 'We were disappointed what we dished up last year but it's a new squad, it's a new season and we've been able to put a lot of things right that we maybe did wrong last year,' said Huddersfield's England forward Brett Ferres. 'We're looking forward to it. It's play-off time and everyone gets excited at this time of year. This is what we've played all year for and it's the time to shine. 'It's nice to have a bit of form and we've certainly some confidence from last week. It was a must-win game and we came through the first test. O'Loughlin knows his Wigan Warriors side are in for a stiff test against Huddersfield on Thursday night . 'We're battle hardened and I think we're ready for play-off football. 'I think it's the norm now at Huddersfield, we're expected to be in the play-offs. I think we've crept under the radar this year but we've knocked off some decent teams.' While Wigan are virtually at full-strength, Huddersfield are still without their inspirational captain Danny Brough, who has failed to recover from a groin injury sustained in the win over Hull a fortnight ago. However, Ferres, who shares the responsibility of captaincy with Luke Robinson in the absence of Brough, believes the win over Saints demonstrated that the Giants are no one-man team. 'We don't believe it in house but everyone keeps telling us we can't win a game without Danny Brough and that Huddersfield Giants are nothing without Danny Brough,' Ferres said. 'But I think the younger lads and people who have stepped up to play in the halves have certainly proved that we can play without Danny Brough and we can beat a very good side without Danny Brough.' Anderson has the services of full-back or stand-off Scott Grix, who missed the last match with a groin injury, but Ferres will have every confidence in teenager Jake Connor if he is asked to once more take on a playmaking role. Ferres said: 'He's been a very good player for a couple of seasons in the academy and he's gradually worked his way into the first team. 'He's had a couple of shots now and proved what a good player he is. He's one of the most talented and gifted lads you'll see playing. 'He's got an unbelievable skill set and now it's just about maturing and kicking on.'","The Giants are hopeful of pulling off another shock on Thursday night .

"Wiltshire chief constable Patrick Geenty is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse . A chief constable is being investigated by the police watchdog over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse, it emerged today. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Wiltshire Police chief constable Patrick Geenty, as well as an inspector and detective constable from the force, which last week was criticised for letting sex offenders off if they apologised to their victims. It is alleged they witheld information from complainants about the extent of the force's failings in dealing with the sexual abuse claims. The IPCC investigation relates to the way the force dealt with complaints about a sexual abuse investigation in 2008-20010. Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, Angus Macpherson, confirmed the matter was referred to the IPCC after he was sent a letter of complaint. He said: 'This letter was with regard to the way in which a previous complaint had been dealt with by the force between 2008-10. 'That complaint was in relation to the way a case of historic sexual abuse had been managed. 'Following an initial meeting with IPCC investigators, my office is now in consultation with the IPCC on the matter.' He added: 'Deputy Chief Constable Mike Veale has made referrals to the IPCC in relation to the conduct of two other officers who were also involved in the handling of the 2008 complaint.' It is also alleged that Mr Geenty, who was then assistant chief constable, also withheld information and misled the complainants. Sarah Green, IPCC deputy chairman, added: 'It is vital that the public are confident that police forces will take their complaints seriously and act with honesty and integrity. 'Our investigation will seek to establish whether information was knowingly withheld and whether these complainants were knowingly and dishonestly misled.' Mr Geenty, a former secondary school teacher who joined the police service in 1982, said: 'I am shocked by the allegation that I attempted to mislead a complainant. 'I welcome an open and transparent investigation and the public deserve no less.' Last week Wiltshire Police was criticised by victims charities for failing to send a clear message to sex offenders after it emerged that rapists and child abusers were being allowed to walk free if they apologised to their victims. Police headquarters: Last week Wiltshire Police was criticised for letting sex offenders off if they said sorry . New figures showed that some criminals accused of sexual offences, including rapists, were being handed community resolution orders rather than custodial sentences. The orders are often used to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record and usually involve the offender making a verbal or written apology to their victim.","Wiltshire Police chief constable Patrick Geenty under investigation by IPCC .

The results have prompted a campaign aimed at assisting people in financial stress and helping them avoid money struggles  till pay-day and subsequently becoming pay-day lenders, news.com.au reports. Young people have been found most likely to be victims of pay-day lending and then end up  facing high interest rates as high as 160 per cent. Only one in 200 people aged 50 and over have admitted to using a pay-day lender, while one in 20 people aged 18 to 24 turn to a lender in times of financial stress. Money struggles is also higher in country people, compared to city slickers. NAB, who conducted the polling, will be working with Good Shepherd Microfinance on the campaign in attempt to sweep out quick fixes and find a longer solution to help financial stress. 'People who find themselves in difficult financial situations often seek quick fixes such as selling their possessions or getting a high cost pay-day loan,' said Adam Mooney, chief executive of Good Sheperd Microfinance. 'While satisfying the immediate need, these solutions can lead to bigger problems down the track.' He said illness and divorce are the two biggest triggers for financial worries. But new NAB boss Andrew Thorburn believes his bank does not close doors on those in financial troubles. 'As Australians, we pride ourselves on giving people a fair go and at NAB we think that includes having access to fair and affordable finance when you need it,' Mr Thorburn said.

"The last decade has seen a huge rise in the popularity of Dress Down Fridays and Casual Work Environments, where people ditch suits in favour of comfier clothing. But this new clothing trend could be damaging your career. New research shows that almost half of the population still judge their colleagues based on the smartness of their work attire. A new poll has shown that 40 per cent of office workers look down on a colleague that wears short skirts (left), while 70 per cent of people judge an employee for wearing ripped jeans in the workplace . The decision about whether to wear a tie or a shift dress also matters far more in different areas. In a survey of 2000 people, Welsh office workers were the most critical in the UK, with 50 per cent of those polled admitting that they judged people on their work wardrobe. Meanwhile, people from the East Midlands were much more laid back in their attitude to office attire, with only 37.7 per cent of people polled having any interest in how their colleagues dressed for work. The South West and Northern Ireland were similarly disinterested, with roughly 38 per cent of both areas admitting they judged people on their appearance. But while there was a big gap between opinions on general work clothing between different areas, one element most people managed to agree on were the biggest fashion no-go's for an office. Sir Alan Sugar was voted as the British celebrity who dresses most appropriately for the office, while interior designer Kelly Hoppen came a close second . The research, commissioned by the Business is GREAT campaign showed 70 per cent of people would look down on a colleague if they wore ripped jeans to work, while 51 per cent of people are critical of people who would wear a branded T-shirt. And it's bad news for the mini-skirt - 40 per cent of people believe a woman wearing a mini-skirt is less effective at her job. Anyone struggling to decide on a style that would secure them a promotion are advised to look towards Sir Alan Sugar - The Apprentice star was named as the most appropriately dressed office worker, with the interior designer Kelly Hoppen and Dragons Den star Peter Jones coming a close second and third.","40 per cent of people in UK survey disapprove of shorts skirts in workplace .

Murray, ranked 11th in the ATP world rankings and also in the Race standings, took a wildcard to compete in Shenzen and it could prove a fruitful decision seeing as he is now clear favourite to land the indoor title. Should he win the title he would move to 10th in the standings but would still need to overhaul the likes of Canadian Milos Raonic and Czech Tomas Berdych, as well as Ferrer, to make sure of appearing at the year-ender.

"Rory McIlroy confessed to mixed emotions after pulling off an incredible victory in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday. It was the first triumph on European soil for the 25-year-old and followed a fabulous final-round 66 that saw him overcome a seven-shot final-day deficit to Thomas Bjorn. McIlroy sprayed the champagne to mark his success but there were no wild celebrations later, and McIlroy admitted that was partly due to his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki on the eve of the event.

'Somebody asked me how I feel and the truth is I don't exactly know. I mean, I'm thrilled I've won obviously but it's been a weird week.' Asked to explain how he had managed to put his personal turmoil to one side and pull off the win, McIlroy added: 'When I got inside the ropes this week I used it like a release. I was on my own and doing what I do best, and that sort of gave me five hours of serenity.

"Drunk at work: Richard Pease, 50, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty to being a master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol . A hovercraft pilot was today facing the sack after admitting to being nearly three times over the drink-drive limit while in charge of a vessel carrying 36 people. Richard Pease, 50, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty to being a master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol. The experienced pilot was responsible for driving the vessel during a five-mile journey across the Solent from Portsmouth to Ryde on June 22. But a colleague had to step in and take over the controls when Pease fell ill at the controls of the 127-seater Hovertravel Freedom 90 vehicle. Tests revealed he had been drinking and had 96 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal drink-drive limit is 35 micrograms. The case has been adjourned for sentencing at Isle of Wight Crown Court on October 10 and Peace has been released on unconditional bail. Pease, wearing a navy suit and blue tie, pleaded not guilty to two further charges of driving a vehicle while his alcohol level was above the limit and not complying with requirements of the International Safety Management Code. Sunyana Sharma, prosecuting, told Honorary Judge Linda Sullivan QC the pleas were acceptable as the initial two charges were put in place because it was thought the Railways and Transport Safety Act did not include hovercrafts. She said at an earlier hearing: 'The defendant was the master and pilot of the Hovercraft Freedom 90. He is an experienced driver. On the day in question... he was the individual in sole control of the hovercraft and driving.' Neil Fitzgibben, defending, said: ‘Mr Pease has an unblemished character. He has been a hovercraft pilot for nearly 20 years. I will present some character references in due course.’ Hovertravel provides the fastest way to cross the Solent with a journey time of less than ten minutes. It operates two hovercrafts and has carried more than 26million passengers since opening in 1965.

The steering of the craft is controlled by rudders, which are located in the slipstream behind each propeller. The captain can also use the propellers to change the direction of the craft.

"A controversial mosque planned for the Gold Coast has been rejected due to a fiery backlash from the city's residents. Police and extra security were posted outside the city's council chambers on Wednesday as councillors deliberated on a motion to reject the Islamic mosque - which had been the subject of a social media hate campaign directed at councillor Chris Robbins. After a morning of high-drama outside the chambers, the council voted to reject the Currumbin-based hall of worship  10 votes to five. Scroll down for video . A protester taunts a police officer during a fiery protest on the Gold Coast . Protesters gather at the Gold Coast council chambers on Tuesday to decry the controversial mosque planned for the city . Protesters waived banners and signs opposing the mosque before council voted it down 10 to five . The plans for the 4768 square metre site triggered several protests from residents with some waving anti-Islamic signs throughout the approvals process. A week earlier the plan triggered a hate-filled Facebook page directed at councillor Chris Robbins, which she alleged was riddled with death and rape threats levelled against her. Prior to Tuesday's decision the council received a record 3867 submissions and eight petitions containing 5511 signatures against the proposal. Ms Robbins claimed she was subjected to 'horrific vilification' on Facebook when damming comments were posted about her in relation to the mosque, which she voted against on Wednesday.

Ms Robbins said the page was defamatory and called for all comments directed toward her to also be removed. 'Horrific vilification, threatening all kinds of nastiness directed at me because I'd basically gone to the meeting and said council's got an application for a mosque and we will be assessing it as we're obliged to by law,' she said. 'That essentially peeved some people who wanted me to stand up and say that at the end of the day this wouldn't happen.' She said the lack of accountability for the Facebook page's authors is despicable and highlights how easily people can target victims through social media with little fear of consequences. Ms Robbins led the calls against the mosque on Tuesday saying the council had let down the community by not fully assessing the impact it would have on them. About 30 opponents cheered and booed from the public gallery with about 10 officers on standby in case violence erupted. Councillors from both sides of the debate expressed concern that the decision to refuse the application would result in a court appeal which could be costly for ratepayers.","Gold Coast council rejected a controversial mosque planned for the city .

"Lucia Ruiz, a 6th grader from Deerfield, Illinois, was traveling with her Aunt and Uncle in Spain last month when tragedy struck as the high speed train she was in derailed, killing 79 near Santiago de Compostela. Lucia was sitting in one of the rear carriages of the train, hit hardest with the highest number of casualties and was tossed around like a rag doll fracturing her legs, hip, pelvis, tail bone, her skull and suffered internal bleeding. Spending almost a week in the ICU in Spain, Lucia and her family are struggling to deal with the crisis brought on by her medical bills as they battle to get her the care she needs to return home. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Lucia Ruiz (right with Spain's Princess Letizia) is now recovering in hospital near to the scene of the horrific Santiago de Compostela train crash which killed 79 in July . 'She was basically thrown … they were kind of bounced around within the wagon and then they were thrown out of the wagon somehow,' said Ismael Ruiz, the girl’s father to CBS Chicago. Almost 80 people died and near 200 injured when the commuter train sped through a curve and derailed, sending train carriages flying off the tracks into flaming piles of rubble. Lucia, 11, is now recovering in hospital just two miles from the crash scene and she has already had one bout of surgery to save her left leg and another on her knee. She survived the horrific crash but it is not known when she may be able to return home due to the severity of her injuries.

Her mother Paloma is confident her little girl will recover, but her father told CBS Chicago that his daughter is worried for the future. 'She is starting to wonder about what are the implications, school, sports, friends,' said Ismael Ruiz. The family has set up a website to help with her medical bills and their neighbors back in Deerfield are also remembering them in their prayers.

"Harlequins got back to winning ways in emphatic style following some recent poor performances with a 52-0 thrashing of London Welsh at The Stoop. Quins, who lost 36-13 by Exeter last time out having also been heavily beaten by Saracens last month, ran in seven tries with Mike Brown, Danny Care, Marland Yarde (two), Matt Hopper and Karl Dickson the men on the scoresheet. There was also a penalty try for the hosts, with Nick Evans converting all seven scores as well as kicking a penalty to push Harlequins past the half-century mark. Marland Yarde scored two tries in Harlequins devastating 52-0 win against London Welsh . For parts of the game, it was not a vintage performance from the home side but Chris Robshaw led from the front with an impressive display, while behind the scrum Brown and Care both sparkled. Promoted London Welsh battled hard but once again they fell away badly in the second half. It was their fifth heavy defeat and it already appears likely that they must win next Saturday's home game against fellow strugglers Newcastle if they are to have any chance of avoiding relegation from the Premiership. Harlequins made four changes from last week's defeat to Exeter with one of them seeing Evans return at fly-half while Tom Casson made his first appearance of the season. London Welsh had the three changes from their home defeat to Gloucester with former Quins, Seb Stegmann and Peter Browne, both included in the starting line-up. They replaced Rhys Crane and the injured Richard Thorpe. Chris Hala'ufia was on the bench for the Exiles, having been loaned out by the Scarlets. England captain Chris Robshaw (right) starred for the hosts as they swept aside Welsh on Saturday . It took Quins just three minutes to take the lead with an superbly created try. From a line-out and drive, Care and Evans combined skilfully in a pre-planned move, which gave Brown an easy run for the try. Even at that early stage, it was evident it was going to be a long afternoon for the Welsh and it came as no surprise when the home side extended their lead in the 11th minute. Robshaw drove forward to set up a ruck from which Aseli Tikoirotuma burst clear to provide Care with a simple try. Welsh then suffered two further blows with full-back Seb Jewell limping off to be replaced by Crane before Evans kicked a penalty after Brown was late tackled by Ollie Stedman. That made it 17-0 after 22 minutes but the visitors were much more competitive in the remainder of the half and Quins could not make any more additions to the scoreboard. Mike Brown (left) put Quins ahead on three minutes in what turned out to be a comfortable afternoon . During that period Welsh matched their opponents in terms of territory and possession, but were unable to take any advantage. The concession of penalties at almost every scrum and frequent handling errors proved to be their downfall. Their effort deserved points and they would have had some, had they not declined a number of kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options, which came to nothing. After that, it was pretty much all one-way traffic as Harlequins moved up through the gears in the second half to add five more tries. They notched their third of the afternoon within seconds of the restart when Brown evaded three defenders on a 30-metre run before providing the scoring pass for Yarde. Evans continued his 100 per cent record with the conversion and also slotted over the extras three minutes later after Hopper went over for try number four. Scrum-half Danny Care was also on the scoresheet for the hosts who returned to winning ways in the league . Skipper Joe Marler and Care were both replaced with half an hour to go as Quins temporarily relaxed with the match already won. The game then became disjointed and was further disrupted by a lengthy delay as Welsh's replacement prop, Eddie Aholelei, was carried off on a stretcher. Quins got the scoreboard moving again with a penalty try after replacement Dickson was high-tacked by Stegmann as the scrum-half raced for the line. Evans converted as Stegmann made his way to the sin-bin. Dickson was not to be denied his score for long, though, as he latched on to a chip ahead from Brown to add Quins' sixth try before Yarde powered over to complete the rout. Evans again converted both for a match tally of 17 points.","Marland Yarde scored two tries as Harlequins thrashed London Welsh .

"The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters, leaving him hospitalized in a critical condition . A 17-year-old boy is in a critical condition after being Tasered by a police officer during a traffic stop. The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun. Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own.

"It isn't what Freddie Burns would have hoped for when he imagined today's return to Kingsholm — a place on the bench, the grim predicament he thought he had left behind. The 24-year-old fly-half will be on the other side of the halfway line and no longer in the cherry and white of Gloucester, but his seat among Leicester's replacements will bring back sombre memories. Burns spent a prolonged period watching games unfold from that vantage point last season, biding his time, trying gamely to suppress his frustration. He faces the same challenge this afternoon. The England No 10 contender has been dropped from the Tigers' starting XV for the Aviva Premiership clash against his former club and the demotion couldn't have come at a worse time. He would have desperately craved a leading role in his first encounter with so many familiar faces and also a chance to enhance his Test case. Freddie Burns was recently dropped from the Leicester XV but wants to be considered for England . Instead, he has been usurped by Welshman Owen Williams, for a fixture which comes 18 days before England coach Stuart Lancaster names his senior squad for the autumn internationals. Competition for the playmaker places is especially fierce at present and all the candidates will be determined to avoid disruption to their momentum. Owen Farrell is the preferred stand-off, but he remains unavailable to Saracens as he recovers from a hamstring strain. In his absence, Burns is vying with three other men for a possible two places in the England squad. He has the benefit of being the incumbent at No 10, but that last Test came in Hamilton where the national team were crushed by the All Blacks, so involvement there is not a feather in the cap. FREDDIE BURNS (Leicester) Strengths: Unpredictable creative threat, with vision and all the tricks. Weaknesses: Dropped by his club and recovering from form slump. DANNY CIPRIANI (Sale) Strengths: Clever runner armed with a glorious attacking repertoire. Weaknesses: Less established in England set-up than rivals. OWEN FARRELL (Saracens) Strengths: Competitive streak and composure in DNA. Supreme kicker. Weaknesses: Injuries, and doubts persist about all-round ability. GEORGE FORD (Bath) Strengths: Major talent who can stand flat or deep to torment teams. Weaknesses: Relatively small frame makes him a target. STEPHEN MYLER (Northampton) Strengths: Calm playmaker and kicker with layer of off-loading class. Weaknesses: Understated qualities are sometimes overlooked. Last season, once he had decided to leave Gloucester, Burns was marginalised by the then director of rugby, Nigel Davies. His form collapsed, as did his confidence. Starting for England against New Zealand at Eden Park — armed with Lancaster's endorsements — brought the belief and conviction back, but he must strive to overcome this latest setback quickly. The new campaign began brightly, with four starts and a particularly impressive display in the win over Exeter at Sandy Park. But when Leicester were smashed 45-0 at Bath, Burns was on that sinking ship and he was unable to prevent another defeat last weekend, at home to London Irish. Individual ambitions are intrinsically linked to collective fortunes, as the Tigers' recruit appreciates. Asked to assess his England prospects, he said poignantly: 'Hopefully, if Leicester are winning and I'm playing well I will be there or thereabouts. It's all I can do.' Stuart Lancaster picks his squad for the Autumn internationals in 18 days and Burns is in the running for no 10 . Thus, Burns needs to play some part in a revival today. His hope must be he comes off the bench to help the Tigers arrest their mini-slump with a win. While he bides his time, in the back of his mind will be the realisation his England rivals have a chance to force him out of the autumn reckoning. Last night's Bath-Saracens match presented George Ford with another high-profile stage to advance his own burgeoning international claims, after missing the summer tour following surgery. Today, Northampton's Stephen Myler will aim to catch the eye at London Irish, while Danny Cipriani will be determined to lower the colours of his former club, Wasps, in Salford tomorrow.Jonny Wilkinson yesterday gave his backing to Farrell to continue in the conductor's role, but also suggested the challengers need game-time. Speaking in Newcastle in his role as a 2015 World Cup ambassador, he told Sky Sports News: 'I think Owen Farrell has done a fantastic job and deserves to be leading the team. George Ford, Freddie Burns and Danny Cipriani are doing all they can — showing they deserve a shot. 'World Cup squads don't include just one No 10. You can't have one 10 who's played all the games and one who hasn't touched the ball.' Lancaster and his coaches await further medial bulletins after a damaging week.

"Two humpback whales have washed up on beaches in New South Wales in the last week. The first animal appeared between Saltwater beach and Diamond Beach, Northern Sydney, on Sunday morning. The juvenile animal was found washed up on the shore. The second animal appeared the following morning, when a larger male humpback was spotted on the rocks at Wallabi Point, on the mid north coast of Sydney. Scroll down for video . The large humpback whale appeared on the rocks at Wallabi Point, on the mid northern coast of Sydney, on Monday morning . The giant mammal was said too large to be buried locally, and was thus and transported another location . Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals: It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as heavy sea conditions . Rob Harcourt, a professor at Macquarie University, told Sydney Morning Herald 'I wouldn't swim next to a dead whale. It's a shark magnet.' Investigations are currently under way to determine what killed the giant mammals. It is believed that a ship collision could be responsible, as well as recent heavy seas. The burial of washed up whales can prove  challenging for local authorities. The whale at Saltwater beach was buried in the sand, while the animal on Wallabi point was determined to be  too large to for a local burial, needing to be dissected and transported to another location. Rob Harcourt, an environmental professor at Macquarie University, warns that waters around whale bodies can be 'a shark magnet' Larger whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities hoping to dispose of their bodies . Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year . Geoffrey Ross, a wildlife management officer with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that 8-10 stranded whales will appear on beaches in New South Wales in an average year. Mr Ross said the procedure to deal with whale bodies has changed in recent years, with wildlife authorities no longer taking them out to sea any more. Burying the animals on the beach is only viable with smaller whales. Larger humpback whales can weigh up to 60 tonnes, posing a serious challenge to authorities looking to bury the animals.","First whale appeared on Saltwater beach, north Sydney, on Sunday .

"Rapper R. Kelly could be facing jail time after allegedly falling behind on child support payments. The Ignition hitmaker is accused in court papers filed Thursday by his ex-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support he owes. The singer’s lawyer says  the R&B star, who has gone underground, could face jail time, according to New York Post gossip column Page Six. The Ignition hitmaker is accused in court papers filed Thursday by his ex-wife Andrea Kelly of failing to pay $20,833 a month in child support he owes . Last year he fell more than $100,000 behind in payments but managed to pay the debt off. Kelly previously has owed millions in unpaid taxes and even had to auction off one of his homes. Kelly — whose latest album, Black Panties, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in December, is his biggest success since 2009. One of Kelly’s lawyers has told his team that if the singer doesn’t appear at a March 27 hearing in his child-custody battle in Chicago, a judge could give him 30 days to six months behind bars because Kelly didn’t show up at a November hearing. The singer¿s lawyer says  the R&B star, who has gone underground, could face jail time, according to New York Post gossip column Page Six . 'The judge was clear in November that he wasn’t happy R. Kelly didn’t show up,' said a source. 'His lawyer is worried the judge could lock Kelly up if he doesn’t show this time, but he can’t reach his client.' Despite his troubles, Kelly is 'in a bunker' and 'unreachable' 'There’s a line of people Kelly owes money to who worked really hard on his last album,' another source said. 'Who knows what Kelly and Devyne are doing, but burying your head in the sand isn’t the answer.' Kelly previously has owed millions in unpaid taxes and even had to auction off one of his homes .","Kelly owes $21,000 to his ex-wife Andrea Kelly .

"Sam Burgess, who will switch codes to try to play for England in the rugby union World Cup next year, will get the chance to bow out of rugby league on a high after helping South Sydney reach Australia’s NRL Grand Final for the first time for 43 years. The Rabbitohs came from 12-0 down to beat reigning champions Sydney Roosters 32-22 in front of a crowd of 52,592 in Sydney, where they will face either Canterbury Bulldogs or Penrith next Sunday.

"Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's World Cup bid as he makes the first moves in his coaching career. The 35-year-old former fly-half, who retired during the summer after a glittering 17-year career, has been invited to cast an eye over Stuart Lancaster's squad as they prepare for next year's tournament on home soil. Wilkinson, who is currently coaching for one week a month at former club Toulon, insists that just because he could play the game, it does not necessarily mean he can tell others how to do so, but he admits he may take up the invitation. Jonny Wilkinson pictured with the Rugby World Cup in Newcastle on Friday . Speaking at Newcastle racecourse at an event to recruit World Cup volunteers, the England Rugby 2015 ambassador said: 'I have spoken to the guys a bit, just because they were saying feel free to come along and have a little chat and see what you think and if there's anything you can add. 'I have got plenty of time - and I need plenty of time - to understand where I go next. I'd love to go down there and see what they're doing because whatever they are doing is very, very good. 'I may pop down there and spend a little time at Pennyhill on the sidelines and watch the guys doing what they are doing and enjoy that.' Wilkinson's coaching aspirations are currently no more extensive than his role at Toulon, and thoughts of greater involvement are far from his mind. He said: 'At the moment, it's great to know the guys I am working with, and I can grab them. I know them already from playing with them and I can say, 'Look, let's work on this'. I know what they need and I know their personalities, so I am already a step ahead. 'But it's a tough world and the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that just because you played the game, you know what you are doing.' England's Jonny Wilkinson kicks a penalty during extra time in the 2003 World Cup final . Lancaster, of course, has far greater responsibilities as he attempts to emulate the feat of Sir Clive Woodward, the coach who led Wilkinson and his team-mates to World Cup glory in 2003. He and his coaching staff were this week awarded six-year contracts by the RFU, prompting Woodward to suggest that could diminish the hunger and fear factor within the camp. However, Wilkinson does not believe that will be the case. He said: 'I don't think these guys would want to be there if it's not working. They are proud professional people and if they are there, the pride and hunger and expectation of themselves is going to be greater than anyone else. 'That's what Mike Catt does, that's what Andy Farrell does, what Graham Rowntree does, and Stuart. They don't accept 'Okay' just because they have now got the right to say, 'Maybe I can guarantee that much money now', or 'I can buy that car' or whatever.' Lancaster's players will go through the sternest of tests in their autumn programme, which kicks off on November 8 with a daunting clash with reigning champions New Zealand at Twickenham. Jonny Wilkinson could lend his expertise to England's World Cup bid in some form . South Africa, Samoa and Australia will also visit headquarters before the month is out, and Wilkinson believes the opening two fixtures against the All Black and the Springboks will provide a benchmark of just where England are in their preparations. He said: 'New Zealand, what they do is they just do things very, very well over and over again and they wait for you to break, and all teams break. 'It's the team that has suddenly found a way of saying, 'Well actually, we are going to do this back to you, and you are the ones that need to worry about breaking'. They don't worry about breaking because they are the ones who are doing the pressure side. 'South Africa is the other one. I know England haven't really beaten South Africa - that would be a nice monkey to get off the back. 'They have got wingers who attack rucks like madmen, they have got centres who are bigger than back-rowers, and it's that challenge that you face. 'As much as New Zealand have that as well, with South Africa it's in your face and you have got to front up to that. Those two would be big victories.' Wilkinson scores the crucial drop goal as England win the World Cup in Australia in 2003 .","Jonny Wilkinson is currently coaching for one week a month at  Toulon .

"Trainer Richard Hannon says his flying two-year-old Tiggy Wiggy is now ‘unlikely’ to run in Sunday’s Group One Prix de L’Abbaye at Longchamp. Initial enthusiasm for the cross-Channel raid after Tiggy Wiggy won Saturday’s Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket has quickly evaporated. Hannon said: ‘We haven’t completely made up our minds but I am not keen and would say it is unlikely she will run. Tiggy Wiggy ridden by Richard Hughes wins the Connolly's Red Mills Cheveley Park Stakes . The two-year-old 'unlikely' to run in Sunday’s Group One Prix de L’Abbaye according to Richard Hannon . ‘She has done plenty this season and won her Group One. I think enough might be enough for her.’ Tiggy Wiggy is 7-2 favourite to become the first two-year-old to win the Abbaye since Sigy in 1978. If she is scratched, jockey Richard Hughes will be free to maintain his partnership with Eddie Lynam’s Sole Power on whom he was won both the Group One King’s Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes this summer. Rain fell in Paris on Monday, a positive for the much diminished Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe claims of 2013 winner Treve but not for trainer Charlie Hills who wants dry conditions to persuade him to add his juvenile Cotai Glory to the Abbaye. Meanwhile, Hannon could make another dent in the £150,000 he trails John Gosden in the trainers’ championship this weekend. Jockey Richard Hughes will be free to maintain his partnership with Eddie Lynam’s Sole Power . He is still considering whether to run top juvenile colt Ivawood in the £500,000 Tattersalls Millions Trophy at Newmarket where he hopes his 2013 1,000 Guineas winner Sky Lantern can recapture her form in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes. A poor run from Sky Lantern is likely to see her retired. In two runs this season, the four-time Group One winner has been unplaced behind Integral in the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Falmouth Stakes at the Newmarket July course. Sir Michael Stoute’s Integral will be in opposition again while Andre Fabre is poised to be three-handed with Esoterique, Fintry and Miss France, this season’ s Guineas winner, intended starters. Hannon said: ‘Sky Lantern is working better and has had a nice rest. We knew she wasn’t fit enough at Royal Ascot and then it was soft ground at Newmarket. ‘We are disappointed she hasn’t won so far and if she doesn’t run well she will probably be off to the paddocks.’ Tiggy Wiggy is 7-2 favourite to become the first two-year-old to win the Abbaye since Sigy in 1978 .","Two-year-old 'unlikely' to run in Sunday’s Group One Prix de L’Abbaye .
