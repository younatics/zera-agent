The 33-year-old striker will sign a new one-year contract at Loftus Road and play a part in their forthcoming Premier League season under Harry Redknapp. It was Zamora's winning goal against Derby in May which secured Rangers' promotion which could be worth around £134million for the club. £134million goal: Zamora scored the winner at Wembley against Derby to send QPR up .

"By . Dan Ripley . Follow @@Ripley_77 . So when did you think Brazil would crumble on home territory at this World Cup? Was it when Croatia took a shock lead in Sao Paulo to stun the hosts on their big opening night? What about when Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa kept everything fired at him out, or even when Cameroon equalised in the final group game? There was of course when Chile hit the crossbar with victory in sight during the dying stages of Brazil’s last 16 clash, while local nerves were shredded after Colombia pulled a goal back late on in the quarter-finals. Brazil, of course, pulled through – they always do. No one should be surprised because keeping the Selecao pinned in their own back yard when it matters most is something no team has done for an incredible 39 years. Scroll down for videos . Still going strong: David Luiz celebrates after Brazil extended their unbeaten run with victory against Colombia . So close: Chile forward Mauricio Pinilla almost knocked Brazil out of the World Cup but hit the bar late in extra-time . Bad start: Marcelo (left) put Croatia in front during Brazil's opening game but the hosts roared back to win . Luiz Felipe Scolari’s outfit line up against Germany in a World Cup semi-final on Tuesday and aside from looking for a place in the Rio final, Brazil will be hoping to protect a streak which has seen no team beat them at home in a competitive international since 1975. That long lasting run which spans 63 games is surely facing one of its biggest threats when Germany turn up for battle. Brazil will be without star forward Neymar through injury, while captain Thiago Silva is suspended for the clash with Joachim Low’s outfit – who in Belo Horizonte will surely prove to be one of the biggest credible threats to the streak during those 39 years. As fate has it, it’s Belo Horizonte where this particular story starts. In the very same Estadio Mineirao (albeit with a bit of revamp work these days) where Germany will look to upset the locals, Peru did the very same back on September 30, 1975. Two goals in the final eight minutes helped them see off Brazil 3-1 in a first-leg Copa America semi-final, a tie they would eventually win before going on to lift the trophy. It was a Brazil team in transition – still a good side – but missing key men from the 1970 World Cup winning team as well as proving slightly too early for the class of 1982. VIDEO Brazil will raise their game - Loew . Star man: Brazil are looking to continue their amazing unbeaten record without injured talisman Neymar . Expectation: Brazil expect their national team to emerge victorious on home soil and lift the World Cup . The likes of Pele, Carlos Alberto and Jairzinho had all moved on, while the crop of Socrates, Zico and Falcao had yet to come through. Typically Brazil remained competitive during this period. The 1974 and 1978 World Cups rewarded fourth and third place finishes respectively, while Selecao also recorded two semi-final appearances in the Copa America. For all their undoubted improvement in class, even the stars of ’82 failed to match any of the 1970s performances, while the 1986 side fared little better as beaten quarter-finalists in Mexico. A year later, the Copa America format changed to allow a host nation to stage all the games, but Brazil were soon under pressure on home soil again when they hosted the tournament in 1989.

A less than vintage team stormed to victory unbeaten during the campaign and conceded just one goal in the process. Home soil seemed to get the very best out of them because a last 16 exit at Italia ‘90 a year later was their worst World Cup performance since a group stage exit in 1966. The build up to the 1994 World Cup provided another setback, but only away from home as Brazil lost their first ever World Cup qualifier when Bolivia scored twice in the final two minutes to record a famous 2-0 win in 1993. Losing the odd qualifier then became regular for Brazil but none were on their territory. Even the side that limped into the 2002 World Cup that suffered a record six defeats were bullet proof on home turf. Last year’s Confederations Cup was another home obstacle easily overcome with five straight victories. These are not poor teams that Brazil are playing against neither. Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay are for instance regular visitors but simply cannot get the job done in Brazil’s backyard, while European champions Italy and world champions Spain also offered little resistance. In an even bigger sign of what’s to come, it’s not just competitive games where Brazil are so strong at home. VIDEO Team Profile: Brazil highlights . Easy does it: Fred celebrates scoring the opening goal in last year's Confederations Cup final win against Spain . Sealed with a kiss: Luiz kisses the Confederations Cup trophy after Brazil recorded five straight wins . The South Americans are unbeaten in their last 42 international matches on home soil in all games, since losing 1-0 in a friendly match in Fortaleza against Paraguay in August 2002. Germany’s chances of ending this formidable home streak are arguably higher for them than it has been for any other team during this 39-year period. But they will need to find something extra in the tank to slay a Brazil side who somehow, someway, always stop their opponents from leaving their country with all the glory.

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . Deprived of talisman Neymar, there is an apprehension consuming Brazil as they approach the momentous World Cup semi-final against Germany on Tuesday evening. Utterly dependent on the flair and inspiration of Neymar so far in the competition, the onus will now be on the misfiring Hulk and Fred to offer the creative spark to carry the host nation to a date with destiny at the Maracana on Sunday evening. However, as the Brazilians step out in Belo Horizonte, it will be a peculiar feeling as Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side emerge without Neymar for the first time in over two years and 38 international games at the Estadio Mineirao. Indeed, not since a 3-1 victory over Denmark in May 2012 have Brazil entered the field without Neymar at their disposal. Hero: Neymar has carried the hopes of a nation on his shoulders during the World Cup in his homeland . Perfect timing: Neymar (right) scores for Brazil against Cameroon in the opening game of this World Cup . Rest on his shoulders: Neymar offers Dani Alves a hug before the last-16 clash against Chile . Zero: The stricken forward lies in agony after breaking a bone in his back against Colombia . Brazil have been defeated just four times over the course of the 38-game period – the equivalent of an entire Premier League season – and the tension that has paralysed the host nation since Jonathan Zuniga crashed into the back of Neymar on Friday evening appears to have tangible foundation. * Neymar has started Brazil’s last 38 matches, a run stretching back to May 2012. * Brazil have played just six of the their last 60 matches (including friendlies) without Neymar since 2010 World Cup. * Last game Brazil played without Neymar was a 3-1 victory over Denmark, May 26, 2012. * They have won five of those six matches without him, none of which were competitive. * Six matches Brazil played without Neymar since WC 2010…. 2-0 v Ukraine (2010) 3-0 win v Iran (2010) 2-0 win v Egypt (2011) 2-0 win v Gabon (2011) 3-1 win v Denmark (May 2012) 1-0 loss v France (Feb 2011) Neymar is the flame-haired poster boy of this World Cup and the Brazilians, who have struggled to inspire even with the Barcelona superstar, will have to tap into their reserves of determination to ride a tidal wave of emotion and reach the final. The dependency on Neymar has been well-documented, the Brazilian scoring four goals, committing opponents and making things happen almost single-handedly for his team. This reliance is nothing new, though, for Brazil have gradually become increasingly dependent on Neymar since they restructured their team around him following the disappointing quarter-final exit at the 2010 World Cup. In the 60 matches that Brazil have played since the defeat by the Netherlands in South Africa four years ago, Neymar has played 54, as he has emerged as the golden boy of the country under the guidance of Scolari. The 22-year-old has represented his nation in every competitive game over the last four years, missing only six friendly games in that time. Spot on: Neymar scores during the shootout after Brazil and Chile drew their last-16 clash in Belo Horizonte . Been there before: Neymar scores a penalty against Team GB  in Middlesbrough during the 2012 Olympics . Golden boy: The totemic forward celebrates another goal against Belarus at Old Trafford . Lots of heart: The 22-year-old star had lit up the World Cup, despite the intense pressure, before his injury . As it transpires, Brazil have fared relatively well in his absence, winning five of those six friendlies and losing one against France. Admittedly, though, the competition in those games was not the most arduous, as Brazil defeated relatively accommodating opposition in the shape of Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, Gabon and Denmark without the services of Neymar, which rather skews the 83 per cent success rate without him in the side. Suffice to say that Tuesday evening against Germany will offer a rather more stern appraisal of this Brazil team’s credentials without their brilliant forward.

"By . David Kent . Jan Vertonghen has no doubt Belgium can stop Lionel Messi and make it through to only their second World Cup semi-final in history. Such has been Messi's form in Brazil that Argentina have faced accusations of being over-reliant on the Barcelona star, who has scored four of his nation's seven goals. Twenty-eight years ago Argentina were heavily reliant on Diego Maradona, who scored five goals to help the South American nation to World Cup glory in Mexico '86. VIDEO Scroll down to see Vertonghen say Belgium can stop Lionel Messi . Unstoppable? Jan Vertonghen believes that Belgium can stop Lionel Messi . Belief: Belgium are aiming for their first World Cup semi-final in 32 years . Four years earlier Belgium successfully shackled Maradona by surrounding the diminutive dribbler whenever he had the ball at his feet. A picture taken of six Belgians surrounding Maradona is one of the abiding memories of that World Cup in Spain. Belgium do not plan to do the same with Messi on Saturday in Brasilia - coach Marc Wilmots prefers to mark zonally - but defender Vertonghen is sure the Red Devils will be strong enough to repel the heir to Maradona's throne. 'I think Messi has been outstanding so far in this tournament. He has been their main man,' Vertonghen told a press conference in Brasilia. 'But if we defend like we did in our previous matches we will stop him, (Sergio) Aguero, (Angel) Di Maria and (Gonzalo) Higuain. I'm convinced of that.' The plan to stifle Maradona in Barcelona worked that night as Belgium recorded a historic 1-0 win.Wilmots has had no urge at all to remind his players of the events of '82 though. 'We have never spoken about it to any of the players. It's history,' Wilmots said. Iconic: Six Belgian defenders work to crowd out Diego Maradona at the 1982 World Cup in Spain . Teamwork: Vincent Kompany, Daniel Van Buyten and Vertonghen work to stop Jermaine Jones from shooting . Belgium's recent history has been full of excitement thanks to the emergence of the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Vertonghen, who operates as a dynamic left-back for his country. Belgium stormed through their qualifying group, dropping just four points in the process. But there were question marks as to whether Wilmots could take the individual stars at his disposal and mould them into a united and effective unit at a major tournament. So far the Belgium coach has passed the test with reasonable success. Belgium won every one of their group games and had it not been for a superhuman effort by Tim Howard in Salvador, the Red Devils would have hammered the United States in the last round. Belgium have only made it to the last four once before - in 1986 when Maradona got his revenge in Mexico - and Vertonghen is desperate for the current team to make history on Saturday. 'We don't want things to stop,' Vertonghen added. 'We are ready for the rest. We want to play even better. 'We have been working hard over the last few years and this is the reward for that hard work.' Top start: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots has led his side to four wins from four so far . Step up: Despite his country's good run, Eden Hazard has had a mixed campaign so far . Back: Thomas Vermaelen is set to return for the game against Argentina . Although Vertonghen sat alongside Wilmots at the pre-match press conference in Brasilia, the Tottenham defender appears to be a doubt for the quarter-final. Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Mousa Dembele were all lacking fitness, according to Wilmots, although it remains to be seen whether he was just trying to sell the Argentians a dummy. 'We are not sure (about those three), but we will train today (on Friday) and see. We hope everyone will be fit and ready to go.' One thing that seems certain is the return of Thomas Vermaelen, who is available after recovering from the hamstring injury that kept him out of the Switzerland game. For all Hazard's talents, meanwhile, the Chelsea midfielder has not been at his best in Brazil. Wilmots hopes a pep talk he gave him on Thursday night will kick the talented 23-year-old into gear though. 'I have followed Eden for a long time and in the last 18 months he has improved,' Wilmots said. 'I talked to him last night and told him how he could improve even more. 'You will hopefully see a result on the pitch. He is eager.'","Argentina set to play Belgium in World Cup quarter-final on Saturday .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Financial advisor David Low last night revealed he is heading up a consortium bidding to seize control of troubled Hibs in a £3.5million deal. Majority shareholder Sir Tom Farmer has authorised under-fire chairman Rod Petrie to find a buyer for the club’s parent company HFC Holdings Ltd. And Low, one of the leading figures in Fergus McCann’s Celtic takeover, is believed to have joined forces with former Easter Road chairman Malcolm McPherson and Frank Lynch - former owner of Celtic Nation - to make an offer for the club. Green machine: Hibs fans are hoping they can take control of the club after last year's relegation . A rainbow alliance of supporters groups are also interested in establishing community ownership at the club and have held talks with Petrie, who was the subject of fierce protests over his stewardship of the club following last season’s relegation to the Championship. Insisting he has already spoken to influential supporters groups about joining forces, however, Low told Sportsmail last night: ‘I have made an offer for Hibernian Football Club on behalf of a group of investors. ‘We were encouraged to make an offer by Mr Petrie, we made an offer to Mr Petrie and we have met his nominated advisors for discussions. Beyond that, the ball is now in their court.’ Low has financial backing from the UK and America and believes he can deliver the legacy guarantees on the club’s welfare being sought by Sir Tom Farmer. Leaving: Chairman Sir Tom Farmer is looking to sell the club following criticism of his stewardship . Sportsmail has also learned, however, that Supporters Direct Scotland have been contacted by several groups of supporters and are formulating plans for a community-ownership proposal after former Hibs midfielder Paul Kane led a series of fan protests over Petrie’s stewardship in the summer. Hibs face Livingston in their Championship curtain raiser at Easter Road on Saturday afternoon - and the West Lothian club have also become embroiled in boardroom strife after being hit with several SFA charges relating to key shareholder Neil Rankine. Livingston have been accused of failing to disclose that Rankine, described by the SFA as shareholder of parent company Livingston 5 Ltd, also holds interests in Championship rivals Dumbarton along with East Fife. Looking forward: Stubbs is trying to prepare his team for the new season against the backdrop of uncertainty . Charges include failure to act in good faith to the SFA; providing false, misleading and/or inaccurate information on their official return; failing to specify Rankine on official returns; not acting in the best interests of football by their non-disclosure of Rankine’s other interests; and of holding power to influence the management or administration of two other clubs. The SFA statement added: ‘Please note that neither East Fife nor Dumbarton are under investigation and there is no suggestion of improper conduct on their part at this stage.” A hearing date has been pencilled in for September 10. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs has raided his former club Everton to sign 19-year-old winger Matthew Kennedy on an initial six-month loan deal. The Scotland under-21 international becomes Hibernian’s fifth recruit of the summer and they hope he can be cleared in time to make his debut against Livingston today.","Financial advisor Low was part of Fergus McCann's Celtic takeover .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Amongst Celtic supporters, an air of simmering discontent currently festers. In Perth on Wednesday night, there is every chance they will make it public. Ronny Deila’s first SPFL match as manager against St Johnstone is unlikely to be a flag-waving, championship jamboree. Thanks to a breach of UEFA rules by Legia Warsaw, the recent 6-1 Champions League qualifying defeat may not prove fatal. But it has exposed a growing disconnect between Celtic supporters and their board of directors. A crack the dual arrivals of Jason Denayer and Aleksander Tonev on 12-month loan deals have done little to patch up. Pressure: Ronny Deila has not had the easiest start to life at Celtic . Bluntly, Celtic fans believe their club are guilty of arch-parsimony. Of taking the season-ticket cash and Champions League profits and failing to reinvest them in the team on the pitch. Of the four signings made so far this summer, three have been year-long loans and the other, Craig Gordon, was a free transfer. In a week when Fergus McCann returns to Glasgow to unfurl the league flag, there is irony in the timing of all this. According to Deila, the failure to pay a transfer fee has not been for the want to trying. Supporters are weary of sob stories and excuses in these situations, but the Norwegian claims the club were close to spending £1.7million on Haiti midfielder Jeff Louis before he opted for Belgium, instead. ‘We were very close to signing Jeff Louis from Nancy,’ said Deila. ‘We were offering more money than Standard Liege - but he want to go there instead of us. ‘It has to be something about not wanting to come to Scotland and preferring to be in Belgium. ‘It is very important that we understand the language, what is happening here. It is different. ‘We are not in the English Premier League, we are playing in Scotland and that is why a talented player can be easier to get than the “big” player. And the big players have salaries that are three, four five times, bigger than you can get here. That is the main issue and you know that. ‘But I understand that because it is very hard to see the big club and then see finances that are not even close to how big the club actually is.’ Sealed deal: Jason Denayer poses with Deila following his arrival on a season-long loan . One former Parkhead player put it to Sportsmail in the following terms the other day: In their transfer dealings this summer, the Scottish champions have been Doctor Who’s Tardis in reverse. Big on the outside, small on the inside. Asked if Celtic supporters now have to accept the reality of their geographical boundaries and minuscule broadcasting revenue, Deila shrugs. ‘I don’t know, I can’t tell them that — but, in the last few years, I don’t know if I can remember some very big signings,’ he said. ‘It’s been players coming in that you have to develop. ‘So I think if we start the crazy business then you will ruin the club, that’s how it is.’ For Celtic figures the accepted practice now is to point across the city at Rangers and say, ‘Look what happened there…’ Supporters argue there is a middle ground. There are few who expect their signings from Harrods but feel right now as if their favourites are shopping from Aldi whilst demanding a gift receipt. Deila agrees that they could pay some substantial fees, but points out that £4m players want £4m player wages. The decision to sell Gary Hooper rather than pay him £28,000 a week has largely backfired, but the Norwegian sees the footballing logic in maintaining a dressing room on level salaries. Arrival: As has Aleksander Tonev from Aston Villa . ‘If you start getting one, two, three or four players who are on much higher salaries, then the others have to come after you and you will never resign the players,’ Deila continued. ‘This creates a bad situation for the club. ‘So I think it (the salary cap) is important. I don’t think it’s so important if you have a lot of money because then everybody’s just having what they want. ‘But when you know you’re playing at a club and you can see the club is treating you well, they have a good system, the players who have been there a long time get good salaries.’ For Celtic, overtures to prospective signings usually come into two categories. Those who won’t look at lowering themselves to playing in Scottish football. And those who will – if the money is right. But Deila says the process has to be about more than mere cash, adding: ‘We have to see it in their eyes they want to come. Moved on: Whilst Celtic's goalkeeper Fraser Forster has signed for Southampton . ‘Of course, when you start talking about the club and you talk about money at once, the business is tough. You see how many agents there is for one player. ‘When you get into things, there are so many involved in the business. I laugh when I see Peter (Lawwell) doing this and people come from all over the place and they want a piece of it. That’s the deal now. ‘But Scottish players abroad they sometimes want to come back because they are from here and they come back and they don’t expect that salary. ‘That’s what we need to do with Celtic and Scottish football, we need to get the players out and when they are experienced, we need to get them back again and we have to build the club from there.’ Bringing back unsettled, homesick Scots will be a key tenet of Deila’s transfer strategy. After watching Fraser Forster leave for Southampton for £10m, selling defender Virgil van Dijk this transfer window won’t be. ‘I think we are done selling in this window but again, you never know in football — it’s about money,’ he said. ‘But so far there has been no interest and he is important for us in the Champions League and in the league, as well.’ Legia Warsaw have lodged their appeal with UEFA and will go all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if need be. Despite some emotive, emotional blackmail this week, however, Deila declines to add to the verbiage surrounding the saga. ‘I’ve said all I can about that case. Now they are appealing and that has to be arranged by UEFA. ‘I have to keep my focus on winning games and being a football manager, not a politician.’","Air of discontent currently festering around Celtic supporters .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Henning Berg has vowed to fight UEFA all the way after describing Legia Warsaw’s expulsion from the Champions League as ‘devastating’. In a brief spell as a Rangers defender the Norwegian suffered five straight defeats in Old Firm games. Wednesday’s 3-0 loss to Celtic – the goals scored by UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary body - was by far the hardest to accept. Legia Warsaw’s misfortune is difficult to overstate. A catalogue of painful ‘ifs': If Callum McGregor fails to score an away goal Celtic are out. If their captain Ivica Vrdoljac scores one of two penalties Celtic are out. If they leave Bartosz Bereszynski on the bench for the last three minutes of a 6-1 aggregate victory Celtic are out. If they name the defender in their squad for the last round clash with St Pats and if UEFA’s match delegate fails to spot the discrepancy Celtic’s final chance is gone. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ronny Delia following Celtic's defeat on Wednesday . Fighting talk: Legia Warsaw boss Henning Berg has promised to challenge UEFA's decision . Reprieve? UEFA have launched an investigation into Celtic's Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw . Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing  Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players. Compounding Legia’s anguish is the discomfort of a Europa League trip to Kazakhstan to face Aktobe. UEFA will tolerate no ritualistic slaughter of sheep which overshadowed Celtic’s visit last year. But the Parkhead side have been spared a trip back. And for that, the Legia official responsible for the most catastrophic admin error in Champions League history will do well to escape the cut. 'We will definitely appeal,' said Berg of the verdict. 'We will appeal it all the way. 'How far? As far as we can because we don’t think this is the right decision.' Legia argue the punishment does not fit the crime. Club official Dominik Ebebenge blamed human error for failing to register Beresznyski for the previous qualifying games against St Pats - meaning those didn’t count toward his three-game suspension imposed last season. 'The proportion between the error and the consequences is unimaginable,' Ebebenge told reporters after getting UEFA’s verdict. 'The spirits of the players are broken.' Legia have five days to request written reasons for the decision and another three days from the receipt of those reasons to register an appeal. If the appeal fails they then have the option of taking the matter to Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. But UEFA have been consistent in their punishment of clubs fielding suspended players, imposing 3-0 defeats on the perpetrators as standard. Suspended: Defender Bartosz Bereszynski came of for the final few minutes of the game . Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda gave a scathing assessment of Celtic's performance after the first leg, he said: 'St Patrick's playerd a lot tougher against us than Celtic. They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw. 'With Celtic, we didn't know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.' Berg cites an instance from 2010 when the governing body fined Debrecen £15,000 but rejected an attempt by opponents Litex Lovech to have them kicked out of the tournament. Debrecen stressed that they had fielded Peter Mate in good faith as a substitute in Bulgaria when they were already leading 4-1 on aggregate. Crucially, Mate was ineligible, not suspended. Through UEFA eyes there is a difference. Not through Berg’s. 'We worked so hard to get to this position with two fantastic games against Celtic. 'And then everything is taken away. 'We acted in good faith. We made a mistake with the papers for the St Patrick’s two games. 'The player knew he was suspended for three games and didn’t play in the two games against St Patricks or the first game against Celtic. 'It’s very, very difficult to take and I think this goes against every intention of fair play and fair competition. 'You look at Debrechen from Hungary also used a player who was ineligible, but UEFA fined them because they claimed they acted in good faith and it did not affect the result. 'So for them to act different this time is really, really very disappointing. 'We think this is against the very intention of football. 'European football should be about fair play and unfortunately a technical error has been made in our administration to not register his name on a piece of paper when he couldn’t play because he was suspended. 'To throw us out of the Champions League for this is difficult to take. 'For us to get this kind of punishment for this kind of mistake in this situation and take away the dream of these players to compete against the best players in the world on this stage is devastating.' In an open letter to fans on Legia Warsaw’s official website, club chairman Dariusz Mioduski expressed his disappointment with the decision, but appeared to accept the UEFA decision, making no mention of an appeal. 'We won two matches with class,' he said. 'But we made a mistake on paper and this year we lost the chance to play in the coveted Champions League. The error that should not happen. 'Although the punishment is disproportionate and it is difficult to reconcile with her, now the more we have to show that this club has great character. Heat is on: Deila (left) sitting beside assistants John Collins and John Kennedy has suffered an horrendous start as Celtic boss following the Hoops failure to reach the group stage . 'We showed that we can play football at a good European level. That change is for the better. Our players and coaching staff did not disappoint. We’re going in the right direction and show it, fighting for the Europa League and defending the Polish championship. 'As an organisation we have a job to support our players and fans. Today we have to apologise and stay together. This team deserves it. 'Although today sport lost behind closed doors we promise that never again will not make that mistake. We fight on. In this year in the Europa League. In the future the Champions League. ' Many in Poland are less accepting of the decision, former national team goalkeeper and Legia Warsaw player Jan Tomaszewski branding the decision ‘a tragedy and scandal’. 'It’s a tragedy. Culpable negligence on the part of Legia,' thundered Tomaszewski. 'But this should be a financial penalty, not a walkover for Celtic. 'Bereszynski came off the bench when it was an aggregate scoreline of 6-1 to Legia. 'His presence had no influence on the result whatsoever. This confirms that the Champions League is only for the rich.' Hopeful: Celtic fans, pictured ahead of Wednesday's night clash at Murrayfield, will be hoping for a reprieve .","Legia Warsaw fielded defender Bartosz Bereszynski was suspended after red card last season .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Callum McGregor claimed his first Celtic goal on his competitive debut on Tuesday night to clinch a valuable victory for the Scottish champions — then described it as a dream come true. And new boss Ronny Deila predicted a bright Parkhead future for the 21-year-old after he marked his return from a season-long loan at Notts County with the decisive strike in the first leg of the second-round Champions League qualifier against KR Reykjavik. The Norwegian was relieved to secure his first competitive win in charge thanks to McGregor’s deflected effort six minutes from time in his first start for the senior team.

Dream debut: Callum McGregor wheels off to celebrate his goal as Reykjavik's players are left dejected . Celtic can now ease their way into the third qualifying round at Murrayfield next Tuesday despite KR coach Runar Kristinsson insisting the tie is not over. ‘I’m just delighted to get the win and to score the winning goal was unbelievable,’ said McGregor. ‘I have to pinch myself to see if it’s real or not. ‘I found out I was playing a few hours before the game and I had a bit of time to get my head around it. I was a bit nervous at the start. But once I was out there, it was fine.’ Determined to claim his Parkhead chance after scoring 14 goals in 35 starts for County in England’s League One, the youngster insisted: ‘I do feel ready for this. Going on loan to Notts County in League One was a big help for me. I feel like I’ve come back a better, stronger player. I feel mentally ready for this challenge. ‘I’m delighted with the goal and I’ll enjoy it, but I need to keep working.

There was a bit of relief but I was delighted. The club is striving to get Champions League football and that might be the goal that puts us through. I’m delighted. ‘The manager has been excellent for me so far. He gives me confidence and has allowed me to be free and go and play. That suits me and he put a lot of faith in me against KR. Hopefully I repaid that with the goal. Hopefully I have made a good first impression.’ Afterwards, Deila told McGregor he has a big future at Celtic if he continues to improve and develop. Thwarted: Callum McGregor (centre) is stopped from scoring by Reykjavik keeper Stefan Magnusson . ‘It was very early in the week I decided to play him because I knew he was the best in that position,’ said the Norwegian. ‘So that was not the hardest decision. People have to develop, that’s what I’ve said all the time. If people get better, they can stay. If they never get better, then they have a problem – and I have a problem. ‘It’s about how you work in training and what you do in matches and so far Callum has been fantastic.’ Relieved to end his first match in charge with a narrow, if laboured, win, Deila insisted he was delighted with the performance, adding: ‘I love to win, I am here to win. But I also need to win in a certain way, as well. Today was a step forward in how we want to play and that’s what I’m most happy for. ‘If we win and play s**t, then I’ll get more irritated. But today, if we’d been 0-0, I’d have been perfectly happy because I know we’re going to score goals in the next leg, as well. Hand it to him: Ronny Deila was delighted to get his Celtic reign off to a winning start . ‘Of course there’s relief to get that first win. We deserved more from this game, but I’m looking forward and I took a lot of energy from this. I liked what I saw of the team in the second half and I want more.’ Disappointed KR coach Kristinsson insisted the tie isn’t over despite his part-time side facing a mountainous task in Edinburgh next week. ‘It’s still alive,’ he said. ‘1-0 is nothing in football and although it is going to be difficult, if we defend well then we will go with a good attitude to Scotland and believe we can do something there. We gave them a game today and not many people expected that. We will give them another game next week.’","McGregor scored 84th-minute winner to give Celtic victory .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Neil Lennon has attributed Celtic’s dismal Champions League defeat in Poland to a lack of investment in the first-team squad. Speaking after a 4-1 first leg loss to Legia Warsaw left Scotland’s champions with a mountain to climb to reach the play-off round, the former Parkhead boss claimed it was an accident waiting to happen. Before leaving his post in May, the Northern Irishman spoke publicly on the dangers of failing to replace key players such as Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama and Joe Ledley. Called it! Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon was not surprised by Celtic's defeat in Champions League qualifying . Crushing: Celtic players leave the field after losing 4-1 to Legia Warsaw in the first leg of third round qualifying . As new . manager Ronny Deila faced questions over his team selection in Wednesday . night’s debacle, his predecessor claimed a heavy defeat in the tricky . qualifiers would have happened sooner or later. ‘I . wouldn’t say it was inevitable, but I think it might have been on the . cards,’ he said. ‘There has been no investment at the minute in the team . and Ronny really hasn’t had much time to bed himself in with John . Collins and get to know the players. ‘Those . qualifiers are always really tricky and it took me a year or two. I . remember Gordon Strachan in his first game losing 5-0 to Artmedia in . Bratislava. He won the second leg 4-0 – but it was too big a gap to . recover. ‘So it can happen. They are not out of the tie, but they are going to have to play supremely well to get through now.’ Tall order: New Parkhead boss Ronny Deila has it all to do to take Celtic into the Champions League proper . Failure . to overcome the deficit would see Celtic drop into a Europa League . play-off clash and lose a potential £15million in European revenues. Lennon . believes the club have insulated themselves against that by storing . away the cash from previous campaigns. But failure could increase the . chances of Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk being sold to plug the gap . and impact on the club’s attendances in the coming season. Admitting . he left the Celtic job because domestic football no longer stirred his . competitive urges, Lennon – who led the club to three successive titles - . added: ‘I think the Champions League is always important. It gives the . fans and players something to look forward to. ‘There . is the money side as well, but the club is financially healthy. They . can maybe take the hit on not making the Champions League this year.  I . don’t think it will be disastrous. Fine start: Celtic's Callum McGregor celebrates after putting his side 1-0 up in Poland . ‘But . in terms of the football angle, it’s imperative to stay in there and . qualify if they can. I was player, coach, manager and it was a huge part . of my life. But in the end we won the league by 30 points last season . and I just thought it was maybe a good time to leave and look for a . different challenge. ‘We . felt, myself and the backroom team, that the challenge wasn’t really . there. We had a great time in the Champions League, but we struggled a . little bit for competition.’ Legia Warsaw’s Ivica Vrdoljak missed two penalties – with Forster saving the second to keep Celtic’s slender hopes alive. But the Polish club’s captain says Henning Berg’s side will finish the job professionally at Murrayfield next Wednesday. ‘I’m . positive we can now finish the job in Scotland,’ said Vrdoljak. ‘We . were comfortable at home and played very well with the goals from Miro . Radovic helping us to settle down. Off the hook? Celtic were lucky not to lose by more after Ivica Vrdoljak  missed two penalties . ‘But . we are aware it is half-time and that Celtic came back against Shakhtar . Karagandy last season. That means we must concentrate for the 90 . minutes. We believed in ourselves and I don’t know what was wrong with . Celtic.’ Vrdoljak apologised to his team-mates for wasting the penalties, but vowed to take another in Edinburgh if it comes. ‘I think in the future I will score – in fact if we get one in Edinburgh t I will take it and this time I will score no problem. ‘This . was just one of those nights, but like the team I have faith in my . ability. Worse things happen in life than missing a penalty and I thank . my team-mates for saving me. ‘I apologised to them afterwards but we were together as a team and were all able to laugh because of the final result.’ Meanwhile, . sources close to Celtic striker Anthony Stokes have played down claims . of a bust-up between the player and manager Deila after he was left on . the bench against Warsaw.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . As Luis Suarez sunk his teeth into the fine detail of his £75million move to Barcelona on Tuesday night he accepted a call. It came – as it often does - from his brother-in-law, a fellow professional footballer in a landscape as far removed from the sun-kissed La Rambla and grandeur of La Sagrada Familia as it’s possible to imagine. Hours before playing for Icelandic champions KR Reykjavik against Celtic in a Champions League second round qualifying tie before a crowd of just 1,700, Gonzalo Balbi lifted the phone to seek the advice and encouragement of his famous – some might say infamous – in-law. On the turn: Gonzalo Balbi (front) featured for 58 minutes in KR Reykjavik's clash with Celtic . Close knit: Balbi's sister Sofia is married to Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, who gave advice to his brother-in-law before the Champions League qualifier with Celtic . The brother of Sofia Suarez, the wife and teenage sweetheart of world football’s most notorious player, Balbi failed to learn much. An anonymous figure against the Scottish champions he was hauled from the pitch after 58 minutes. Meeting the media in a lounge of Reykjavik’s KR-vollur Stadium after a 1-0 first leg defeat which all but ends their Champions League hopes, however, the quietly spoken Uruguayan spoke warmly of his vilified relative. His sister met Suarez as a teenager and had his two children. Despite being separated by the length of Europe, the siblings – the family – remain close. Like others who know the former Liverpool striker, Balbi paints a conflicting picture to that conjured up by the incredible moment Suarez sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez . earned a four-month FIFA suspension for his latest misdemeanour – the . third of its kind – and is banned from going anywhere near the iconic . Nou Camp home of Barcelona. Even for his signing ceremony. ‘I . spoke to Luis before the Celtic match and I talk to him a lot,’ said . the midfielder. ‘I’ve known him since he was 15 years old so we go back a . long way. Family matters: Luis Suarez sits by his wife Sofia during a Liverpool game last season . ‘He couldn’t come to the match in Iceland because he’s back in Barcelona sorting things out.’ Smiling, he adds: ‘I think he has much more important things on his mind right now… ‘But, of course, it’s nice to know I can call him anytime, he helps me a lot. ‘Luis is a great guy. He has a very bad image right now because of what happened in the World Cup - but he’s really not like that at all. ‘If you know him, he’s a really nice guy and would do anything to help you. You have to get close to Luis to really know him and thankfully I am.’ Suarez . famously began dating Sofia in 2001 while working as a teenage street . sweeper. In contrast with the penniless aspiring footballer, Sofia lived . a comfortable middle class existence with her brother and other family . members. They . welcomed Suarez into their home and moved to Spain en masse in 2003 to . offer him the best possible chance to become a professional footballer. Late show: Callum McGregor (42) struck six minutes from time to give Celtic a 1-0 win over KR Reykjavik . Dream start: McGregor's strike came on his Celtic debut in the Champions League qualifier . ‘Luis is a family man and he has a good character,’ adds Balbi. ‘Only the people who are closest to him, like his family and friends, see that. ‘We’ve know each other since we were kids and I’ve watched him grow as a player. He’s now one of the best in the world but, believe me, he’s had to fight for everything he has in his career. ‘He’s been a big influence on me. He’s always giving me advice and trying to help me with my career.’ Balbi was an unlikely addition to an Icelandic side populated by a banker, an architect and students. A part-time outfit, KR signed him at significant expense and the identity of his brother-in-law has brought the club headlines, but no obvious hope of overcoming Celtic after Callum McGregor’s debut goal seven minutes from time. ‘Obviously I’d love to reach the level Luis is at, I want to play at the highest level I can in my career. ‘But I know how tough that is and games like the one against Celtic has shown me how big a step it is to Champions League level.’ KR travel to Murrayfield in Edinburgh next week (with Celtic Park being used for the Commonwealth Games) to face Ronny Deila’s side with an uphill task. ‘Maybe Luis will watch the second game on TV,’ adds Balbi, ‘I hope so. The first leg was a very tough game for us. We had to defend very well for most of the game and we had to run a lot. ‘We thought were going to hold on for a positive result so it was disappointing to lose the goal near the end. ‘Of course, it’s going to be very difficult for us to go through now but we can’ t give up. I was impressed with Celtic, they passed the ball very well and you can see they’re a very good team who have played in the Champions League a lot. ‘We will have to do a lot of running to do again in Scotland but we have to believe we can score and give ourselves a chance.’","Luis Suarez is the brother-in-law of KR Reykjavik star Gonzalo Balbi .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Kris Boyd insists he is returning to Rangers a better and less selfish footballer than before. The Scotland striker ended weeks of speculation by penning a one-year deal with the Ibrox club on Friday. Scorer of 128 goals in 192 appearances between 2006 and 2010, Boyd nonetheless concedes he was a ‘selfish’ player in his first period at Rangers. But the 30-year-old believes spells in Turkey and the United States have been the making of him. Rangers return: Boyd says he is a more rounded player after spells in Turkey and the United States . Champions, again? Rangers are looking to secure their back-to-back-to-back promotions and an SPL return . Boyd said: ‘I’m not going to change. I’m not going to start dropping back 50 yards and taking four or five people on. But I have become more aware of the game. ‘There were times before when I maybe scored one or two goals in the first 10 minutes and you’d feel your job was done. ‘You stop doing things for the team and I was just being pretty selfish probably. ‘Now I feel you need to be a team player because the game has changed so much. You need to help your team-mates on the pitch. That’s a challenge I look forward to now.’ Wanted: Boyd was targeted by Kilmarnock, Dundee United and Aberdeen before returning . He's back: Boyd has signed a one-year deal to play for Rangers as they look for promotion back to the SPL . Aberdeen and Dundee United were keen to sign Boyd while Kilmarnock also wanted to retain the man whose 22 goals saved them from last season’s relegation play-offs. But a call from Ally McCoist 10 days ago convinced him to pledge his future to Rangers. ‘This is a great club with a great fanbase,’ added Boyd. ‘I can’t wait to play in front of that crowd at Ibrox again.’ McCoist agrees Boyd is a more mature player now. ‘Kris is probably still the most natural finisher in the country,’ he said. ‘His goal tally last year at Kilmarnock was sensational and it’s maybe not for me to say but his goals certainly went a way to keeping them in the division. ‘We are bringing back a far more experienced player. ‘He is at a stage where he will be a real benefit to our team with his experience, his goals and the knowledge he has gained from all the places he’s been throughout his career.'

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Stefan Johansen has told his Celtic teammates to ‘man up’ after conceding they simply weren’t good enough in Poland. A feeble, porous 4-1 defeat to Legia Warsaw leaves Scotland’s champions facing a monumental task to reach the group stages for a third successive year. Johansen believes, as he must, that Celtic can still qualify. And he reckons Legia’s players behaved at time up as if they were already through to the play-off round. Rallying cry: Stefan Johansen has told his team-mates to stand up and be counted . Yet a display characterised by dubious team selection, poor defending, weak tackling and self-inflicted errors confirmed fears that the squad inherited by Ronny Deila lacks the depth or investment needed to compete at Europe’s highest level. Insisting there is no time for self pity ahead of a second-leg salvage job, however, Norwegian midfielder Johansen says Celtic have to pick themselves up swiftly and plan a way to score three or more at Murrayfield. All whilst defending in a way which seemed beyond them in Poland. ‘It was really bad,’ said Johansson, Deila’s former lieutenant at Stromsgodset. ‘When you go down to 10 men and you are keeping in the game at 2-1, it’s almost an okay result in the circumstances. Mountain to climb: Efe Ambrose was given his marching orders . ‘But that was the time when we needed to stick together and keep that scoreline until the end of the match. ‘You have to be tight at that time, yet we gave away two more easy goals. We tried to communicate things on the pitch, but we should have been tighter and not allowed Legia to get those goals near the finish of the match. ‘There is no way we should be letting them get their two penalties and their goals. It was bad from us and it is tough to take right now. ‘We need to have a sit down and talk about the game during the next days. What we must do is learn the lessons from Warsaw and learn how to do things better. ‘We need to forget about what happened as soon as possible and man up - because this was just not good enough. We have to accept the facts of what we need to do.’ Early smiles: McGregor celebrates his strike with Celtic team-mates . Questions will inevitably be asked of Deila, who looked haunted and shocked by what transpired in the Pepsi Arena. A risky team selection raised eyebrows even before kick-off and in the first major test of his credibility as Celtic manager, the Norwegian failed to secure pass marks. ‘I can’t say anything about what was said afterwards,’ added Johansen. ‘That always stays in the locker room. ‘I also can’t talk for the manager but obviously he wants to win games just the same as the players do and, of course, he was disappointed with the match. Back on track: Mirslav Radovic (left) celebrates scoring Legia's equaliser . ‘Looking at the Legia players at the end of the match, it looked as though they were through to the next round already. ‘So I am going to be ready for next week because we still have a chance to be the ones celebrating at the end of the second leg.’ It’s far from inconceivable Celtic could win 3-0 in Edinburgh. The club’s history is littered with unlikely comebacks against the likes of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Shakhtar Karangandy last season. Yet the lack of shape and cohesion in the current squad draws closer comparisons with the mess Gordon Strachan inherited in 2005. A 5-0 defeat to Artmedia Bratislava was almost overturned, but the loss of Celtic Park to the Commonwealth Games now comes at a heavy price. When they need their spiritual home most, Celtic must now try to achieve a minor miracle at the home of Scottish Rugby instead. Numbers will increase, but by Wednesday night just 12,000 tickets had been sold. Down but not quite out: Celtic's Kris Commons fight for the ball while down on the turf with Lukasz Broz . Insisting the team need their fanbase more than ever at Murrayfield, a defiant Johansen said: ‘We still have a chance to get through this tie and we have to go for it. ‘Of course I believe this can still be done. If there is ever a chance of doing something, I always believe in it and believe we are going to take that chance. ‘That is the type of person and footballer that I am. Hopefully, everybody around the club still believes because there is still a chance for us. ‘It is going to be tough but we need to make sure we are ready for the second leg.’ If they fail, then a Europa League play-off provides a safety net of sorts. But there will be no cast-iron guarantees of European football this season. ‘I don’t think about Europa League at this stage, I only think about Champions League and being ready for this challenge next Wednesday,’ said Johansen. ‘We still have a chance and I feel we are good enough on a better day than Warsaw to make it through to the next round.’","Midfielder admits Celtic weren't at the races after Poland thrashing .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . For six months, Celtic have thought of little else but this. The fraught process of qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League begins under the low clouds of Iceland on Tuesday evening. Failure is unthinkable. Few expect KR Reykjavik to be the toughest test Scotland’s champions will encounter en route to the rich man’s playground which is worth an annual £15million. Were qualification down to dressing room IQ, however, KR would be favourites. One of their players is a banker, another an architect and most of the others are students. But the capacity of their KR-Vollur Stadium — a  glorified public park — is just 1,700. VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic Manager Deila ahead of Champions League clash . Jetting in: Celtic players arrived in Iceland on Monday ahead of their match against KR Reykjavik . Hard at work: Efe Ambrose leads the way during training ahead of Champions League clash . Coach Runar Kristinsson held his own against Ronny Deila as a player in Norwegian football but gives himself little chance as a coach over the coming two legs. Yet such is the importance of Europe’s blue-riband tournament in terms of prestige, interest and cold, hard cash, the Parkhead side can take nothing for granted. Under Neil Lennon, this Celtic team displayed a knack for defusing awkward, unappealing ties. But Lennon has now gone, European talisman Georgios Samaras has followed suit and the captain, Scott Brown, is out injured until October. As yet, their only new signing has been goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who hasn’t kicked a ball for two years. Facing the press: Kris Commons and Ronny Deila chat to the media ahead of Champions League qualifier . For Celtic, these games are now like a high-stakes round of Russian roulette. And no one can predict if it will blow up in their face. And no one knows yet what Deila can bring to this team, to this club. He will certainly bring his own players after the Reykjavik ties. And his first competitive test could certainly be stiffer. But its  importance and significance is hard to overstate. As domestic football becomes more mundane, the Champions League is now what sustains Celtic. With their home games to be staged at Murrayfield while Parkhead serves as a host venue for the  Commonwealth Games, the Norwegian could use a big statement in the Icelandic capital. KR Reykavik’s English striker Gary Martin claims, with a slightly ridiculous level of mathematical precision, that the Scottish champions are ‘seven per cent’ weaker than last term. Adversaries: Ronny Deila (right) speaks to KR counterpart Runar Kristinsson ahead of Tuesday's match . From Kris Commons, last season’s Celtic player of the year, that prompts a snort of derision. ‘If the Reykjavik player has come out and said we’re weaker this year, then he’s obviously concentrating more on us than his own team,’ said the former Scotland international. ‘He’s probably hoping that we’ll be weaker. But over the course of two games, if we’re at it, we should have more than enough to get through. ‘But they’re like cup finals with everything on the line — so you just never know. ‘The European nights at home are some of the best in the world. That’s what drives you. ‘When you’ve reached the top and you’ve had those nights, it’s not the same just playing every week in the SPFL. You need those Champions League games in between. ‘That gives you the buzz, it’s what brings the fans and the money in. ‘To have that for the last two years, it would be devastating not to have it this time around.’ Focused: Commons is determined to help seal Celtic's qualification to the Champions League group stages . This, for Celtic, is the key. Sometimes, the finances make the headlines as if that’s all that matters. In a domestic environment where broadcasting revenue is derisory, it’s certainly vital but the  Champions League means more to fans of Celtic than filthy lucre. The European nights are what they live for. They know they will never win another European Cup, but being there, mixing with the elite, is what sets the pulse racing. If they inflict the odd bloody nose on a major scalp along the way, all the better. ‘We’re fully focused on the job that needs to be done,’ added Commons. ‘We know what to expect. ‘Everyone knows how vital these games are, not just for the club but for the whole of Scotland — it’s important that we get into the Champions League. ‘We know what we’re carrying on our shoulders. We have to get in there. Reykjavik are 11 games into their season, so they’ll have more match-fitness than us. Last game? Fraser Forster has been linked with a move away from Parkhead this summer . ‘But once the whistle goes, you put your professional head on and get to where you need to be as soon as possible. ‘The players have thought about these qualifiers all summer. They either make or break our season. ‘We can either have a really good campaign up until December,  January time — or we’re going to be toddling through the season. ‘For a club like Celtic, we need to have European football. We need those special nights at Celtic Park to keep everyone interested.’ Last season, the group stage was a fairly joyless experience when the sale of key players came home to roost. Out to impress: Efe Ambrose controls the ball with his shin in front of assistant coach John Collins . Fears remain that Fraser Forster or Virgil van Dijk — or both — could be sold after the Reykjavik ties. That concern was critical to Lennon’s decision to quit  and for Deila poses a significant threat to his hopes of a smooth passage into the job. Yet Commons points to the streetwise players left behind who almost manage themselves these days. What Lennon called his ‘hard core’ of him, Charlie Mulgrew, Brown, Adam Matthews and Emilio Izaguirre. ‘We have a new boss — but, in these games, we almost have to manage it ourselves because we’ve been over the course before,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve proved we can deal with teams like Reykjavik. Recently, we’ve been right on the money apart from the Kazakhstan away game. ‘Over there, we played well and created chances but we didn’t deal with long throws and that cost us two goals. ‘Karagandy was a fright, we almost didn’t make the group stage. Now, you can almost touch it, you can feel it.’ Big job: Celtic fans expect new boss Ronny Deila to secure their passage to the group stages . It remains to be seen if this is a club which has learned anything from that Karagandy experience. A last-minute James Forrest goal pulled them through after key players — Lennon’s ‘crown jewels’ of Gary Hooper, Kelvin Wilson and  Victor Wanyama –— were sold. Deila knows the type of players he needs to play the kind of game he has in mind. Whether he receives the resources to get them will depend to a huge extent on steady progress in these qualifying games. ‘The new manager has been super, I’ve been really impressed,’ added Commons. ‘He’s got a great knowledge. ‘He wants us to be in the  Champions League and to win the title by a country mile, rather than just getting over the line.’ From this vantage point, crawling over the line would do Celtic fine. A confident stride from the blocks on Tuesday evening would help get things moving.","Celtic boss Ronny Deila and his side begin their Champions League qualifiers in Iceland on Tuesday evening .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Kris Commons has told Celtic he is ready to start talks over a deal which would tie him to Parkhead for the rest of his career. Newly-promoted Leicester City are keen on the 30-year-old, the Scottish Football Writers’ Player of the Year last season. But Commons, who scored 32 goals as the SPFL champions streaked to a third straight title last term, says he wants to end his career in Glasgow playing for Celtic. It's good to talk: Commons (right) chats to Celtic team-mate and captain Scott Brown last week . Prolific: The attacking midfielder scores 32 goals in all competitions last season . Entering the final year of his contract, the former Scotland international can talk to other clubs from January. Keen to secure his future as quickly as possible, however, Commons said ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League qualifying first leg with KR Reykavik: ‘The manager and (chief executive) Peter Lawwell are aware of my contract situation and hopefully, sooner rather than later, we’ll sit down and talk about it. ‘When you get four or five months into the last year of your contract, you can start talking to other clubs. Gong: Commons proudly shows off his Scottish Football Writers' Player of the Year Award . James Forrest is out of Celtic's Champions League second-round qualifier against KR Reykjavik in Iceland on Tuesday night. The Hoops' winger will miss the first leg with a groin injury while skipper Scott Brown had previously been ruled out for at least a couple of months with a hamstring injury. Charlie Mulgrew will skipper the Scottish champions in the absence of Brown. Provisional squad: Forster, Lustig, Matthews, Mulgrew, Van Dijk, Ambrose, Izaguirre, Griffiths, Kayal, Commons, Pukki, Stokes, Johansen, Henderson, O'Connell, Zaluska, Gordon. ‘But that’s something I don’t want to do, I want to get my future sorted here. ‘I’d rather get it sorted in the next couple of days, if it was up to me. ‘I hope we’ll get it done soon. I didn’t have a bad year last year so I hope they still want me. ‘I have absolutely no desire to go back to England. For me, I’m playing the peak years of my career at one of the biggest clubs in the world. ‘If we’ve got Champions League football, there’s no better place to be than Celtic.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Henrik Larsson has shown little to suggest he is the man to manage Celtic. Little to indicate he might be the new Jose Mourinho. Three years at modest Swedish second flight club Landskrona ended tamely with a mutual parting of the ways. At Falkenberg, his latest gig, the first ten games of the season have brought three wins, two draws and five defeats. Currently 11th in a league of 16 teams this is a team battling for survival, not trophies. In with a shout: Henrik Larsson could be the next Celtic boss but lacks coaching experience . Legend: Larsson enjoyed a seven-year career at Celtic and won the league title four times . Time to move on: Neil Lennon left Celtic earlier in the week . Larsson, then, has no real coaching record to speak of. Nothing which screams he is the man to lead Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League. But the appeal to Dermot Desmond and the Celtic board is obvious. Larsson is box office, a marquee name. He wants the job desperately. Bluntly, he would put bums on seats. How many of the names on a lengthy list of runners and riders would immediately do that? Jackie McNamara and Malky Mackay probably wouldn’t. Owen Coyle is a sound, solid candidate - a lifelong Celtic fan with just one blip on his CV from Bolton Wanderers and a less than sparkling spell at Wigan. But if Coyle is appointed the Scottish champions won’t be selling season tickets. They will be pulping them. Temptation: Celtic majority shareholder Dermot Desmond knows the appeal of hiring Larsson to replace Lennon . From the perspective of a board of directors wrestling with growing apathy and boredom in the stands, then, Larsson holds obvious appeal. Celtic need an adrenalin shot. Someone to rally the fans and stimulate interest. That Larsson would be a commercial rather than football decision is beyond dispute. People have also described it as an instance of the heart ruling the head. But that’s not quite right.   Because what can be more calculating or planned than choosing a manager more suited to selling season tickets than winning trophies? It’s possible, of course, that Larsson could be an outstanding success on both fronts. BOIS Landskrona was his first gig. Travelling to meet the great man in the Swedish outpost in April 2010 the pitch was brown and bare, the stands the type you’d find at a municipal athletics stadium. Money was scarce and, for a man who played for three of Europe’s biggest clubs, Celtic offer a far more appealing canvas to paint on. With the current squad of players, Larsson is just as likely to win the Scottish Premiership by 20 points as a Malky Mackay or a Paul Lambert. But the problem is this. If Celtic’s only priority is selling tickets they could appoint Billy Connolly. Or Kevin Bridges. What they actually need is the best man to take them back to the Champions League. That’s where the real money is to be found. That’s what sustains this club now. It’s how they define themselves. And whoever they appoint as the next manager has to be able to deliver. Neil Lennon showed that an inexperienced manager can do it. But only after a nine-game trial. This time around Celtic don’t have that luxury. Baptism of fire: Lennon was inexperienced as a manager when he took over at Celtic . Like the Northern Irishman, Larsson knows plenty about life at Parkhead. He spent seven years at the club scoring 242 goals in 315 appearances. He has been fully briefed on why Lennon left and, despite telling his current club he will stay put, wants the job. It could be argued that Celtic’s Champions League qualification hopes would be better with Larsson in the dug-out and 60,000 in the top deck than they would be with Owen Coyle in there and a crowd of 42,000. The Celtic board are entitled to go for someone who will invigorate the place. Someone who will stir the senses. But it’s not Larsson, the iconic player, they would be getting. It’s Larsson the manager. And he no longer scores goals. In private Larsson can be a warm and funny man. Far more so than his public image suggests. But there are aspects of managing Celtic which would grate hugely. Goal machine: Larsson scored 242 times for Celtic during his career at the club . The incessant media demands. The inevitable intrusion into his private life. Even signing autographs – a practice he was prone to avoiding as a player by having his car moved to a sidedoor. Like Lennon he has a strong, determined mind of his own. He’s not the type to be controlled or told who he is signing. He might buy into Celtic’s ‘model’ of buying young players and selling big 100 per cent. He would have to be. But there is an unmistakable irony here and it’s this. Had Henrik Larsson been a Celtic player now he would have hung around one, maybe two seasons, then he would have been sold. He would never have become the Magnificent Seven of yore. This is what a Celtic manager must deal with these days while delivering Champions League football. Is Henrik Larsson up to it? Right now there isn’t a scrap of evidence to suggest that he is.","Former Celtic legend Henrik Larsson is favourite to take over from Neil Lennon as manager .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Martin O’Neill has warned Roy Keane to expect a Champions League baptism of fire should he agree to step into the Celtic hotseat. Dermot Desmond, Celtic’s largest shareholder, has held ‘informal talks’ with the former Manchester United captain concerning the Parkhead job vacated by Neil Lennon. The Scottish champions insisted last night Keane has not been offered the job and released a statement claiming they are still talking to ‘a number’ of candidates. Mentor: Ex-Celtic boss Martin O'Neill has told Roy Keane to expect Celtic Champions League baptism of fire . Boyhood dream: Keane played for Celtic for a few months during the twilight of his career . And O’Neill made it clear he wants his right-hand man to stay. Indeed, with just eight weeks until a crucial Champions League qualifier at Murrayfield, he urged Keane to consider the implications of stepping into a high-pressure situation. ‘Celtic are back so early because they’re involved in those big (European) games,’ said O’Neill. ‘So it is a case of that being only a matter of days away rather than weeks - and I’m sure that’s something to consider. ‘It was only brought home to me the other day when Anthony Stokes was mentioning he would not be coming with us to America because he would have had no break because Celtic are back training very, very quickly because he’s had no break whatsoever. ‘If Roy is actually offered the job then he’ll have things to consider. The very obvious thing to consider is the speed at which he would go into a big football club and have big, big games right on his doorstep.’ A Celtic manager for five years, O’Neill remains an iconic figure at Parkhead and will advise his right-hand man carefully. He admitted: ‘I have spoken to him. I had a call the other day from Dermot Desmond wanting to speak to Roy if it was at all possible, and I mentioned it to Roy, of course. ‘I am sure he was wanting to have chat anyway because a club like Celtic might not come around too often. ‘It was just a really informal chat, I think, but if you are asking me would I be really disappointed? Of course if Roy was to leave us. ‘But I kind of felt that when I took him on in the first place, that over the course of the next 18 months to two years, that this thing was likely to happen. ‘He was coming right back into high profile again. Perhaps I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly, but Celtic is one - he has had a number of offers too from other football clubs as well - so he has obviously a lot to consider.’ Informal chat: Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Keane has spoken with Celtic owner Dermot Desmond . New job: Roy Keane, the Ireland assistant manager, is set to be named as the new Celtic boss . Still got it: Keane on the ball during an Ireland training session ahead of Saturday friendly with Italy in London . Keane endured mixed fortunes in charge of Sunderland and Ipswich and Celtic fans have reacted coolly to news of the talks. He has been out of frontline management since being sacked by Ipswich in January last year. Insisting the Irish stint - brokered by Desmond and funded by his billionaire business crony Denis O’Brien - has rehabilitated the former midfielder, however, O’Neill said: ‘Roy has been great for me, I’ve genuinely enjoyed working with him, he’s sometimes a totally different character to the one you see in front of the TV camera. ‘He’s been excellent, the players have enjoyed him immensely. ‘I can only say that naturally I’d be disappointed if he left because I really think he’s been terrific. ‘I’ve often said here that he’ll be a manager again himself. I just didn’t expect it that quickly. Again, it was only an informal discussion he was having. I don’t know the ins and outs of it, I don’t know, I think they do have a list of people they’re speaking to and, you never know, they might speak to someone else . ‘I just reiterate he wouldn’t take it lightly. He loves it here, genuinely loves it here. It’s been great for him.’ Discussion: Keane talks to manager Martin O'Neill as coaches Steve Guppy and Steve Walford watch on . Pundits: Keane and O'Neill on air for ITV during coverage of a Champions League tie last season . The statement from Celtic last night made it clear Keane is but one of the candidates they are looking at. It read: ‘Following speculation concerning the manager’s position at Celtic the club can confirm that it is currently continuing its discussions with a number of excellent candidates.’ But last night Charlie Mulgrew backed Keane to show the right stuff as Celtic manager and said: ‘I’m sure he’d be a good man for the job. ‘As a player I think the club needs a big character and he definitely fits the bill. ‘He’s a strong character and probably the type of guy that would be good for the job.‘Of course, we want a manager as soon as possible because it gets us prepared for the Champions League qualifiers. ‘But I’m sure the club will take its time to get the right man. As long as it’s a big character. I’m sure the club will look into it and find the right man for the job.’ One player who may not be around to see Keane’s potential takeover is goalkeeper Fraser Forster with Tottenham placing him on a list of potential replacements for Hugo Lloris.","Roy Keane has had 'informal talks' with Dermot Desmond, Celtic's largest shareholder .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Owen Coyle was dismissed by Bolton Wanderers before lasting a mere five months at Wigan. It’s a record which fails to inspire Celtic supporters. Yet Shaun Maloney baulks at the notion that the latest bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Neil Lennon is somehow damaged goods. ‘I wouldn’t describe him as that,’ said the Scotland attacker, an intermittent presence in the Wigan team when Coyle was in charge. Dismissed:Owen Coyle, linked with Celtic, lasted just five months before being sacked by Wigan . ‘I think damaged goods is a harsh phrase to use. I couldn’t tell you the ins and outs - but I think he was close to getting the Celtic job when he was at Burnley and that’s probably the reason why he’s being mentioned again.’ There may be more to it than that. In Ireland – the homeland of Celtic’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond - significant sums are changing hands. Sources close to Coyle dismiss the markets and say talk of a meeting with Desmond is misplaced. More than one candidate who was led to believe he would be granted a meeting with the billionaire has been left gazing at their phone in recent days. Following two spells at Parkhead and one under the former Ireland striker at the DW Stadium, Maloney should be well placed to offer a compatibility assessment of Coyle and Celtic, but admits to being a lousy judge in the past. ‘I worked with a really good man and someone I thought would be a really good Celtic manager - and that was Tony Mowbray,’ grimaced Maloney. ‘So I’m not sure if I could say who would be good for it or not. ‘That didn’t work out pretty quickly. I didn’t play too many times for him but when I did play I liked him as a person and his style of football.’ Former Bhoy: frontman Shaun Maloney insists Coyle is not damaged goods following his Wigan spell . The Wigan star can say the same of Coyle. He liked the Glaswegian greatly, praising the bond he forged with his players. At St Johnstone, then Burnley, Coyle built a reputation as the coming man of British football. But when Celtic came calling in 2009, he opted to remain in England – a decision many Parkhead supporters believe should invalidate his renewed interest this time around. Got on well: Maloney worked under Coyle at Wigan last season . To say the Celtic fanbase shows a lack of enthusiasm for Coyle’s candidature would be understating things. Many are positively vitriolic on the subject. Yet Maloney says that’s unfair on a man who was once one of the hottest managerial properties in the British game. ‘It’s a difficult one with him losing his job at our place and at Bolton,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I can see why there are questions. But it’s harsh to try to judge someone before they even get the job. But that’s just football. ‘It’s the same with players. It’s a results business and that’s fine. You know when you go into management that if you win games you will be fine. ‘He had a brilliant reputation and got the Bolton job and he hasn’t done so well at our club. ‘So he’s on the other side of things at the moment, but that might not last forever. He could get his next job and do very well.’ Maloney may be right. Yet even as he tried his best to provide backing and support for his former boss he also contrived to provide more reasons for caution amongst supporters. ‘I’ve been involved in situations with a change of manager at club level a few times. I wasn’t actually there the last few weeks before Owen lost his job at Wigan because I was in America for treatment. ‘Uwe Rosler came in and there has been a huge turnaround in our fortunes. We weren’t good enough to get past QPR in the play-offs, which was fair, but the change under the new manager has been pretty colossal really.’ As recommendations for Coyle go, it’s hardly ringing. Yet it states a bald truth. Since Coyle left and the German came in, Wigan have thrived and prospered, enjoying a strong second half of the season. Maloney is at a loss as to why Coyle couldn’t emulate Roberto Martinez or Rosler, but suggested it wasn’t for the want of trying. ‘He definitely tried to cultivate a really good relationship with the players, that was his biggest idea. That’s the way he tries to manage the club. ‘His assistant Sandy Stewart did the bulk of the coaching – that’s the way the two worked. ‘In fairness, it was difficult for him when he came in because we had a very different style of manager and style of football before him than the club had been used to for four years. ‘We had just been relegated and lost some of our best players – and I think he had to sign a lot as well, so it wasn’t the easiest start he had. It was a tough job for him.’ Experienced: Coyle has also managed Bolton and Burnley in the Premier League . For many, however, there is a question to be answered. If it was difficult managing a team in a town of 50,000 with modest expectations, how might he cope at Celtic? ‘Wigan don’t really have too many press requirements,’ added Maloney. ‘The Celtic job is at the other end of that scale. ‘You’re dealing with hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of fans worldwide and there’s a new level of expectancy of winning trophies. ‘Wigan are now faced with the expectancy of being in the top six of the Championship - and we don’t feel intensity in the town the way it is in Glasgow. That’s the polar opposite. ‘In Glasgow, particularly with the two bigger teams, that’s just the main focus for people in Glasgow. ‘There are not many jobs down south, apart from the top six or seven, would stand you in good stead for Celtic.’ Back in the Scotland squad to face Nigeria for the first time since he scored the winner against Macedonia in October, Maloney is more focused on his own situation now. He managed just five games for Coyle in a Wigan shirt before going under the surgeon’s knife then managed the same again at the end of the season. In contrast with others in the squad, then, he feels fresh and ready for Tuesday’s clash with the World Cup finalists at Fulham’s Craven Cottage. ‘I’ve not really got too much fatigue going on the at the minute, so I’m just happy to be here, but this is certainly a tougher team to get into than when I was involved last time.’","Shaun Maloney insists Owen Coyle should not be written off as potential Celtic boss .

Although his side need only a draw to stay in the Premiership, Killie boss Allan Johnston warned they will play to win in the do-or-die clash in the capital. ‘We know we have to go out there with a similar type of performance, the same sort of tempo we played with tonight and try to get the three points,’ said Johnston, who will be without veteran midfielder James Fowler after he was harshly sent off in the dying minutes.

I can’t be too down on my lads because they’ve given me everything this season.’ Kris Boyd’s 21st goal of the season earned Killie a lifeline, but boss Johnston knows there’s much more work to be done by his battling players in Saturday’s showdown. ‘Look at the reaction we got from them tonight,’ he said. ‘They gave everything they had and more than merited the win. You could see how much it meant to the players and supporters tonight. ‘We now go into a massive game on Saturday on a bit of a high. We know it’s going to be like a cup final.’ Johnston, though, was upset with Fowler’s dismissal. ‘I thought it was really harsh. I didn’t think his first booking was a foul and the second one didn’t look like a free-kick either. It’s really disappointing to miss someone of his quality for the final game when it’s undeserved.’","Thistle's win at Tynecastle ensures they will play top-flight football next season .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . On a night when they were cheered from the stands at Ibrox by one of the track stars of Glasgow 2014, Rangers finally got their season off-and-running. Yet while the pre-match presence of Lynsey Sharp - a lifelong Rangers fan and Commonwealth Games silver medallist in the 800metres - proved a catalyst for Ally McCoist’s men roaring out of the blocks early, his team ultimately and disappointingly limped over the line against a Hibs side who finished this Petrofac Training Cup tie with 10 men. Indeed, had Alan Stubbs’ frontmen remembered to pack their shooting boots, they could easily have added to McCoist’s roll of dishonour in knockout competitions since he took over from Walter Smith in 2011. Swish! Nicky Law curled in wonderfully as Rangers beat Alan Stubb's Hibernian in extra-time at Ibrox . Pride: Commonwealth Games silver medallist Lynsey Sharp was at the game to cheer the Gers on . After young Danny Handling had cancelled out Lewis Macleod’s fine first-half goal, Sam Stanton missed a sitter before Farid El Alagui squandered two fabulous chances to deny Alan Stubbs what would have been a tremendous start to his new job at Hibs. There was to be further frustration for the visitors when Handling was red-carded for a foul on David Templeton, Nicky Law making sure Rangers’ numerical advantage counted by striking the goal that finally saw off Hibs. It also teed up an intriguing Ibrox date later this month against a Clyde side managed by Ibrox legend Barry Ferguson. Despite an ultimately satisfying scoreline for Rangers, this was another stuttering performance by McCoist’s side on a night when the attendance at Ibrox was a worrying 18,138 for a clash between two teams destined to battle it out with Hearts for the Scottish Championship title. Whether that was down to the lack of allure of the Petrofac Training Cup - the recently re-branded Challenge Cup - or symptomatic of the strained relationship between the rank-and-file Rangers fans and the club’s board remains to be seen. It had all started so promisingly for McCoist, whose returning strike duo of Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd were cheered to the rafters by the home crowd. For Miller, it was 14 years to the day since his very first Rangers goal, the winner in a 3-2 thriller at Rugby Park. Parade: Sharp was shown off to the Ibrox crowd beforehand with a shirt commemorating her 800m silver . There were warm Ibrox welcomes, too, for fellow new signings Marius Zaliukas and Darren McGregor, who joined captain Lee McCulloch at the back in a 3-5-2 formation that the manager had road-tested in North America. Stubbs, meanwhile, gave debuts to goalkeeper Mark Oxley, full back David Gray and striker El Alagui. His fourth summer signing Scott Allan - a previous Rangers target - had to settle for a place on the bench. Boyd nearly made a dream start to his second Ibrox debut when his volley flew into the side netting, causing some within Ibrox to rise in celebration. But the former Kilmarnock striker had been flagged offside. It was to be a recurring theme. Rangers made a deserved breakthrough, however, when Lee Wallace floated a great ball towards Macleod at the far side of the box. The Scotland under-21 midfielder cushioned the ball perfectly before thumping a superb finish low beyond Oxley. Macleod has now clearly recovered from a virus that attacked his internal organs and led him to miss the first six months of the year. On this form, the 20-year-old is going to be a big player for Rangers this season. All smiles: Manager Ally McCoist joins in the celebrations after Law notched the winner . McCoist’s team were comfortable at that point and Boyd thought he had doubled the lead from 18 yards, but this time he was denied by referee John Beaton who ruled he had controlled the ball with his hand in the build-up. It was clear that Stubbs had Hibs playing a more pleasing passing game than under predecessor Terry Butcher but the same old lack of creativity and penetration remained a problem. However, the Edinburgh side were a team transformed after the break. Stubbs should have had his first competitive goal to cheer when Sam Stanton was played in on goal by Liam Craig but he fluffed an excellent chance. His weak shot, straight at Cammy Bell, was as threatening as a pass back. Hibs grabbed the goal their play merited when Zaliukas lost the ball and Handling made Rangers pay for their shambolic defencing by slotting the ball under the outrushing Bell. El Alagui should then have put Hibs ahead but he volleyed a Craig chip over the bar from 16 yards with just Bell to beat. McCoist moved to a regular back four when he sent on winger Templeton for McGregor in a bid to inject creativity into his team. Flased an effort wide: Hibernian's Farid El Alagui fails to convert a chance from close range . But it was El Alagui who missed another fine opportunity when he headed an Alex Harris corner over from close range. Then came the game-changing moment when Handling went in hard on Templeton, drawing a red card from John Beaton that looked, at first glance, questionable. A man to the good and having perked up a little, Rangers saw a penalty claim turned down by Beaton after Gray held Lee Wallace in the box. So into extra time we went, and only 11 minutes had elapsed when the hammer blow came for Hibs. After Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson fell to the ground with cramp, Wallace cleverly capitalised on the extra space - driving into the box before cutting back for Law who curled the ball beautifully into the far corner. Rangers fan Lynsey Sharp would have been relieved to see that Hibs’ race was now run. Despite being given an almighty fright, her beloved Rangers remain in the hunt for silverware and the chance to avenge the hurt of last season’s final defeat to Raith Rovers.","Lewis Macleod had put the hosts into a first half lead .

"By . Mark Wilson . and Stephen Mcgowan . No need to panic: Celtic midfielder Scott Brown pictured whilst on international duty for Scotland . Scott Brown has insisted there is no need for panic over Celtic’s hunt for a new manager as he firmly backed the board to land the right man in the end. Roy Keane’s decision to withdraw from the process on Monday ruled out the leading target of major shareholder Dermot Desmond. The Parkhead hierarchy are now continuing to assess other candidates, with Steve Clarke currently the bookmakers’ favourite ahead of the likes of Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle and Jackie McNamara. Celtic legend Henrik Larsson is also still believed to be under consideration - with fellow Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson also touting him as the ideal man for the job. Despite the rumour mill going into overdrive, Brown is calm about the situation and stressed the players had every faith in those who will make the call on Neil Lennon’s successor. ‘The club will definitely get it right,’ said the Celtic captain. ‘They will find the man they want for the job and put him in place. ‘I know it seems to be dragging on in some people’s eyes, but these things take time when you are looking for the right man. ‘I’ve tried to concentrate on doing my own work, but the lads have been telling me that Roy Keane did not want to be considered for the job. ‘To be fair, he could have been a great manager, but the club know exactly what they are doing and I’m positive they will get it right. ‘The club always take their time to get it right and that is why, as players, we have full trust in them.’ Brown is currently undertaking his B coaching licence with the SFA in Largs before heading off on holiday. Eyes on the ball: After much thought Roy Keane decided not to take the job at Parkhead . Celtic return for pre-season training on June 24, ahead of an opening Champions League qualifying clash on July 15 or 16. And Brown believes the experience within the Parkhead squad – and the remaining coaching staff – will help any new manager hit the ground running. ‘We’ll be coming back for the pre-season and the Champions League qualifiers fit and ready to go,’ he insisted. ‘It is going to be hectic and it is going to be all-on for whoever comes into the club. ‘Celtic need to be in the group stage of the Champions League and the squad knows what is required.’ While Celtic seem no closer to unveiling their new boss, Eriksson has insisted that Larsson is the only man for the Parkhead hotseat. The former England manager, currently coaching Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R&F, has been approached by agents asking if he would put his name forward as a possible replacement for Neil Lennon. Earning . £2million a year in the Far East, however, 66-year-old Eriksson says . Larsson is the outstanding candidate to take the Scottish champions . forward. Currently . coaching Falkenbergs in the Swedish Allsvenskan, Larsson is believed to . have held talks with Celtic’s major shareholder Dermot Desmond over a . week ago, but is believed to be reluctant to break his contract. Ruled out: Roy Keane (left) has pulled out of his role as an ITV pundit for the World Cup . ‘Henrik is Mr Celtic - or was anyway - and has done well in Falkenberg,’ said Eriksson. ‘I think he would be an excellent choice. Absolutely. ‘How long did he play there, almost 10 years? I think it would be a very popular choice among fans. He is still the king in Scotland.’ Meanwhile, Paul Lambert expects to unveil Keane as his No 2 at Aston Villa once the Republic of Ireland assistant returns from two international friendlies in the USA next week. In a clear indication Keane is close to agreeing a shock move to Villa Park, on Tuesday he pulled out of his role as an ITV pundit for the World Cup to concentrate on coaching. He had been expected to be the broadcaster’s lead analyst but will instead not travel to Brazil, meaning he has more time to invest in any potential return to Premier League football. ‘Roy has been a tremendous part of our pundit team in recent years, but we fully understand his decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching,’ an ITV spokesperson said. ‘We wish him every success for the future.’","Brown insists Celtic don't need to panic in search for new manager .

Neymar is out of Tuesday’s semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte after he was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga during Brazil’s 2-1 win.

Silva, who is also out of Tuesday's match through suspension, said: 'It was a coward’s tackle - some people say it was normal, but I don’t think it was... 'That kind of challenge isn’t done. You can’t get the ball from someone by putting your knee into a player’s back, it’s not normal. But there you are.’ FIFA confirmed on Monday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Zuniga, who has received a flurry of abuse for causing the injury even though he has made two public apologies. World football's governing body also confirmed on the eve of the Germany game that Silva's appeal against his second yellow card of the tournament, which came when he blocked Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina, had failed. 'I was trying to avoid making fouls against Colombia. I think it was the only one I committed in the match, so it's difficult not being in this game and I'll suffer,' the Paris St Germain defender said.

Even Julio Cesar said that was a great sign. He thought he'd hold three penalty kicks if it came to it. ‘Regina tries to make us at ease. It’s not just about Neymar. We just talk about a lot of things – Neymar being one of them – but she emphasised we all have to feel at ease. Neymar has already done what he had to do.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . To new overseas signings, John Clark is simply the Celtic kit man. The 73-year-old club servant who recycles the training gear and lays down their jerseys. It takes time for the penny to drop. To realise that the grey-haired, diminutive old Bhoy servicing their needs is a living, breathing Parkhead icon. A survivor of the club’s greatest-ever triumph and their longest-serving employee since Willie Maley. Those who doubt it are pointed to a picture of the day 47 years ago this month when Celtic became champions of Europe. Icon: Former Lisbon Lion John Clark remains a loyal servant to Celtic at the age of 73 . ‘I don’t go about telling them who I am,’ says the modest Clark, Billy McNeill’ s former partner in central defence. ‘But I think the players spread the word. ‘They will come up and ask if it’s true. If they are down in my room I just show them the photograph. ‘I’ll say to them: “There’s been big changes since then, but take a look at that. The thing in the middle with the big handles is the thing you’ll always want to win. I won it.’” The Lisbon Lions are old and grey now. Some, such as Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Murdoch, keeper Ronnie Simpson and striker Joe McBride are no longer with us. But their former team-mates will raise a glass to absent friends when the Lions return to Lisbon for what could be the final time this weekend. They became champions of Europe with 11 players drawn from within a 30-mile radius of Glasgow. It’s a fact repeated many times, yet still seems mildly incredible in an era of multi-cultural football teams. History: Clark and some of his former team-mates will return to Lisbon ahead of the Champions League final . ‘These days the language can be a difficulty at times,' Clark admits. ‘You can walk into a dressing room and there will be two or three foreign lads all talking a different language. ‘You don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t like to think they are talking about you. ‘But there has always been a good camaraderie at Celtic. They have always mixed in quite quickly.’ Even so, the Lions had something special. Their stories are legend. There is always the danger of tales from the 2-1 win over Inter Milan being told so often they become stale. Such is the plight of the Scottish game now, however, that they actually become more remarkable with the passing of time. To mark the first Champions League final held in Lisbon since that Thursday afternoon in 1967, they will come together to relive them in the Portuguese capital this weekend. What makes the trip so poignant is the possibility it might well be their final visit as a group to the city where they made their name. ‘Everyone is getting on a wee bit,’ Clark concedes, ‘but we all still get on.’ Close-knit: Billy McNeill and Berti Auld during a minute's silence for former team-mate Jimmy Johnstone in 2006 . Amongst Celtic supporters, they enjoy the status of Gods. Yet they remain accessible, approachable and humble. They earned more than the average working man in 1967, but not by much. The idea of Clark doing a Yaya Toure and throwing a strop over a birthday cake is mildly ludicrous. ‘The modern-day players don’t bother too much about what we did,’ says Clark. ‘They don’t think about anyone else much. They count their cash. ‘We just looked at the wage slip and that was it. It’s different now, but players are still players.’ Together with Jim Craig and Bobby Lennox, Clark retains the sharpest memory for detail amongst the Lions. ‘I can remember all the players we came up against. ‘Laszlo Kubala of Zurich. The French captain played at Nantes. Was it Henri? ‘One of the best goalkeepers I ever saw was Illija Pantelic of Vojvodina. And then we played Inter Milan and they had Mazzola and such like. All good names. You don’t get those names these days, do you?’ Mystery: Clark has described current Celtic manager Neil Lennon as both good and bad . The Messis and Iniestas of this world are hardly footballing pygmies in comparison. And, on a memorable night two years ago, Celtic notched a notable win over the giants of Barcelona. However, when asked if the Scottish champions will ever match these clubs again, Clark is dubious. The financial gulf is now an unbridgeable chasm. ‘Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern and PSG – the cash they all have is amazing. It’ll be really difficult to win a European Cup again. ‘You have it in your mind that you’d love to do it, but you never know. The way finance is in Scottish football we’re up against it. The last 16 is an achievement now.’ Clark, who was Celtic’s assistant manager under Billy McNeill in the early 80s, tends to keep his thoughts on football matters to himself these days. Asked his views on current boss Neil Lennon, he grins: ‘Aye – he’s good and bad isn’t he? ‘He’s done quite well in his short time in management. The club wants to be in the Champions League every year and he’s done that. ‘The more experience he gets the better he will be for it – I won’t tell you the bad things. I’ll keep them to myself. ‘If he asks me my view I’ll say something in the passing. It was the same with Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan. Occasionally they may ask you things in the passing - but not much.’ Knowing when to keep quiet has served Clark well during 40-odd years over three spells at Celtic. Most of all under the formidable Jock Stein, the man who will no doubt dominate the conversation yet again in Lisbon this weekend. ‘Our gaffer was the PR man,’ Clark recalls. ‘If he said you could speak to the press, you spoke to the press. ‘If he didn’t and you did it anyway, you’d have a hard time. Especially from his left foot…’ Astute: Jock Stein managed Celtic to their only European Cup win in 1967, beating Inter Milan 2-1 .","Celtic kit man John Clark enjoying life 47 years on from European Cup win .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The perfect Best Man's speech at a wedding should be a mix of tender, funny and rude. One Best Man managed this and more after he rapped through his and sent the crowd into raptures. Spencer Loveridge wanted to go further to give his closest friend a day to remember with a musical show-stopper that his idols Goldie Lookin' Chain would be proud of. The 35-year-old shocked his best friend  Luke Davies, and his equally unsuspecting bride, Kate Davies, with a four-minute rap set to a Tom Jones sample. Scroll down for video . Magic moment: Spencer Loveridge sends his best friend Luke Davies, his new wife Kate and the wedding party into rapturous cheers and applause as he raps his best man's speech . Hysterics: Luke and Kate, who had no idea what was planned, were in hysterics as Spencer described his eating and toilet habits . Sending the crowd into hysterics his four minute speech included the lines: 'Love is blind, Or so the saying goes, But you’ve never seen him wipe bogeys on your windows. 'Lewy’s really found the perfect Hubby, but as we all know he’s a little bit grubby. Eating bacon with his hands, from a pasta bowl, Why is there jam on the remote control?! 'And after he’s been to the loo, It won't be smelling of flowers. Its actually probably best not go in there, for the next 24 hours . 'And if that wasn't enough you’ve got to put up us too, Too late Lewy, You’ve already said “I do!"".' The happy couple held their wedding reception at Canada Lodge in Creigiau, Cardiff, and were visibly shocked when freelance computer programmer Spencer popped on a tracksuit top and baseball cap and started to rap. 'Luke has been my best friend since we were about four years old,' Spencer said . 'We've been great mates for all these years. 'He asked me to be his best man in December. I had an inkling he was going to because we all made agreements many years ago down the pub that we'd all be each other's best men. 'So when the time came I thought ""Okay, he's quite a character so there's a lot of material"", but the trouble was it was all very disparate chunks. 'It was little funny things that he had done but nothing that you could stretch out to a full anecdotal speech.' Response: Spencer's rap sparked a standing ovation at the Cardiff wedding breakfast . Spencer, from Pontypool, said he was finding it more and more difficult to concoct something when inspiration struck. Close: Spencer with groom Luke Davies on his wedding day, where his friend gave a memorable and now celebrated rap speech . 'I had snippets of things that I started making rhyming couplets with. Then I thought ""Hang on a minute - I could do something with this' and started piecing it together into a rap. I'm a big fan of Goldie Lookin' Chain and I thought I could do a rap in a similar style. I put the track together using Tom Jones samples which fitted perfectly. 'My girlfriend pushed me into doing it and said 'You need to do this'. It got to the point where I was running out of time because I'd put so much effort into it and I was past the point of no return. It was do or die,' he added. 'I have been DJ-ing since 1999 and I dabble with music production, which, of course, helped me put the track together.' Spencer managed to keep his ruse a secret - despite his mates demanding to know what he had planned ahead of Saturday's nuptials for the pair, who live in Llandaff. 'Only my girlfriend knew what I was going to do,' he said. 'I managed to keep it a massive secret. 'It's clearly evident in the video that nobody had an idea because you look at the bride as I'm starting the rap and she looks terrified.' Change of clothes: Spencer dumped his jacket for a bright green tracksuit top and a baseball cap and rapped to a Tom Jones sample . Rehearsing the rap solidly by playing it in the car to and from work, Spencer admitted the pressure was on him before he got up and delivered his stunning best man's turn. 'It went in a blur but I was very focused on getting it right. I didn't drink throughout the day because I couldn't miss a single line or word as it wouldn't work. Luckily I managed to get it right.' Securing a standing ovation from the stunned audience, he said the best part was relaxing after his big moment. 'Everyone was coming up to me and saying 'I tell you what - that's the best best man's speech I've ever seen'. Even the photographer came up to me and said: 'Fair play mate, I've been in this game for 20 years and that's the best speech ever'. 'Now everybody keeps asking me when I'm getting married and who my best man will be. I keep telling them it might happen but I don't want to get the girlfriend too excited!'","Best Man Spencer Loveridge sang hilarious rap for Luke and Katie Davies .

"By . Katy Winter . Inspired by an initial few who bravely posted selfies showing their colostomy bags, now a whole movement of young women is sharing Facebook pictures showing theirs as well as the scars received from treatment for their conditions. The women who suffer from a range of stomach conditions are showing that they are proud of their bodies just the way they are and it's all thanks to Crohn's disease sufferer turned model Bethany Townsend, 23. Similar to the no make-up selfies campaign in which women encouraged each other to post pics of their natural faces, this new viral campaign sees people inspiring each other with the slogan 'Get Your Belly Out'. The new craze sees women posting pictures of their tummies to raise awareness of stomach disorders and illnesses . Hundreds of brave women have posted pictures of their colostomy bags on social networking sites such as Facebook . The movement, which was inspired by one Crohn's disease sufferer, has been given the name 'get your belly out' Hundreds of women have shared their pictures to raise awareness of stomach conditions Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The craze was started by ulcerative colitis sufferer Victoria Marie, 26, she said: 'It has exploded and become a global success. 'I personally am passionate, driven and inspired to continue working hard at raising awareness for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 'At the age of 26 I feel I have been to hell and back with this illness and it breaks my heart to contemplate how young children cope with such a life changing illness.' As well as colostomy bags, women are bravely sharing pictures of their scars, often from surgeries for illnesses . The movement aims to combat the stigma and squeamishness people feel around stomach conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis . The thousands of photographs have gone viral - just like make-up free selfies - with women encouraging each other to 'get their belly out' Victoria, from Swansea, made friends with other suffers following her diagnosis five years ago. She decided she wanted to confront the stigma and squeamishness people feel when talking about the effects of the condition and other similar ones such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS). Bethany Townsend became an internet sensation by posting a photograph of herself in a bikini, exposing the colostomy bags she has to wear because of Crohn's disease . The make-up artists picture has received millions of views, thousands of likes and hundreds of encouraging comments and she is now pursuing her dream of becoming a model. So together with three friends Victoria started the Get Your Belly Out campaign in a bid to break the taboos. The campaign has received a swell of attention after Ms Townsend became an internet sensation  after posting a photograph of her in a bikini online - exposing her colostomy bag to the world. The make-up artist's picture has received millions of views, thousands of likes and hundreds of encouraging comments and she is now pursuing her dream of becoming a model. What is Crohn's disease? Crohn's is an autoimmune condition affecting the bowel that is caused when the immune system triggers the release of a protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which kills the 'good bacteria' in the gut. This leads to inflammation and, in turn, diarrhoea, stomach pain, weight loss - because of poor digestion of food - and extreme tiredness. Around 115,000 people in the UK have Crohn's, with most diagnosed between their mid-teens and late 20s. But new figures suggest that its incidence is rising dramatically - there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 29-year-olds receiving treatment in England for Crohn's in the past ten years, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Crohn's is a chronic, often debilitating condition and many patients end up needing surgery to remove part of their bowel. What is Irretable Bowl Syndrome? Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition of the digestive system. It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation. Symptoms vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. However, most people have either diarrhoea, constipation, or bouts of both. You may also have mucus in your stools. You may find the painful stomach cramps of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels. The symptoms of IBS usually appear for the first time when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. They tend to come and go in bouts, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods. What is Ulcerative Colitis? Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition, where the colon and rectum become inflamed. Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus. The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus, abdominal pain and needing to empty your bowels frequently. The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is. For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives. Source: NHS .","Movement aims to combat stigma around stomach and bowl conditions .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest big name to pour a bucket of freezing iced water over his head in the name of charity - and has challenged Bill Gates to be next. The 30-year-old billionaire was taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge, which was launched by the ALS Association to raise money for fighting ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He looked unfazed as he tipped the huge tub of frosty water over his head, before reflecting for a moment and picking the Microsoft tycoon among his nominees for people to try it next. Scroll down for video . Drenched: Mark Zuckerberg posted the video of him soaking himself for charity on his Facebook page . Still smiling: The young entrepreneur shares a grin before nominating Bill Gates to try the challenge next . He laughed as he stood soaked through in his back garden, and also picked Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings for the challenge. 'You guys have 24 hours to complete the challenge or you have to donate to the ALS foundation - or both,' he wrote in the video's caption on his Facebook page . The Ice Bucket Challenge is the brainchild of former Division 1 baseball player Peter Frates, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012. It first took off in Boston, where the 29-year-old played, but has quickly spread all over the world, raising more than $4m for the ALS Association. Partakers simply film themselves pouring a bucket of ice cold water over their heads and then share it on social media, nominating friends to do the same. The forfeit is donating money to the foundation, though those that do take it on are also encouraged to donate. Zuckerberg was nominated for the stunt by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who proved again that he doesn't mind a little humiliation. The 51-year-old Republican posted a video on his Facebook page on Tuesday showing two of his children dumping the bucket of ice water over his head. The ALS Association reports raising more than $4m since July 29 thanks to the initiative, which has seen several celebrities take part. Singers Justin Timberlake and Adam Levine, the Kennedys, Mickey Rourke and golf stars Ian Poulter and Greg Norman are among those to soak themselves for charity, while late night TV host Jimmy Fallon has accepted Christie's nomination. President Obama unfortunately declined Ethel Kennedy's nomination, but did pledge to donate money to the foundation. In the UK, the idea has also been adopted by Macmillan Cancer support, who are encouraging people to donate £3 when they complete the challenge.

"By . Sam Adams . Hard-pressed British families have seen . the cost of their weekly food shop rise by twice the European average during . the past five years, according to new figures. Prices here have increased by 37 per cent since 2007 - and could go up by another 40 per cent over the next decade. This compares to food price rises of just 12 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany during the same period. Costs: The price of the average weekly food shop for people in Britain has risen twice as fast as in other European countries . Figures compiled by the Department . for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) show the rise in food . prices since 2007 in Britain is far higher than in other EU nations. And costs are expected to continue rising . at twice the rate of inflation, piling more financial strain on already . stretched budgets. According . to a report in The Daily Telegraph, the annual food bill for the average . family will rise to £4,000 by 2022, from £2,766 last year. Average . weekly shopping bills are now around £77, according to the consumer . magazine, Which? - an increase of more than £5.60 on last year. The rise in food prices worldwide has been blamed on an expanding population and increasing commodity costs, while wheat prices have been particularly badly hit due to bad weather this year in big producers such as the US and Russia which has damaged crops. Britain has been particularly vulnerable to price rises because it imports 40 per cent of the food it consumes, the newspaper reports. Forecast: Food costs are expected to continue going up by around four per cent a year in Britain for the next decade . Transportation costs have also risen fast - making it more expensive to import food from other parts of the world. Research by the shopping and price comparison website Mysupermarket.co.uk, shows the price of staple foods has risen fast during the past 12 months. The price of 500g of minced beef has, for example, has increase by a fifth, from £2.20 to £2.80, since last September. The rising cost of food is now rated as one of the top concerns by British consumers - as prices continue to rise faster than wages, according to the Telegraph. Food prices in Britain are among the fastest increasing in the developed world. Supermarkets claim they are trying to keep costs down for shoppers where possible. A . spokesman for Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, told the newspaper . that the firm was 'committed to helping keep the cost of food shopping . down. ' Despite . the recent price rises, food in Britain is nevertheless, still cheaper overall . than in other European nations, according to DEFRA, due in part to the . competitiveness of British supermarkets.","Food prices in Britain have risen 32% since 2007 - twice the EU average .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Most people bite their nails when they're nervous or get cravings for chocolate or crisps. But two sisters from Bradford have taken it to a whole new level - regularly munching on candles and second-hand books. Twins Adele and Anita, both 50, suffer from Pica - an eating disorder characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value, such as stones, sand, paint and dirt. Scroll down for video . Twins Adele and Anita, both 50, suffer from Pica - an eating disorder characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value, such as stones, sand paint and dirt . Adele eats her way through around two inches of wax every day to 'relieve anxiety'. She estimates she has eaten 300 candles in her lifetime . For Adele, the problem began when she was a child. She now eats around two inches of wax every day, much like many people tuck into a chocolate bar. 'When I was eight or nine I started sniffing fire lighters,' she told ITV's This Morning. 'I then started nibbling on candles and have done ever since.' She says candles are an emotional . crutch - and the 300 she has eaten in her lifetime have apparently never caused her any health problems. 'Carrying a candle with me calms my nerves. A whole candle will last me two weeks - I only take a little . bit [about at an inch or two] out at a time so people don't see it.' Her sister Anita is obsessed with the smell of old books - and regularly eats them. 'The older the book, the better it tastes,' she said. She shreds books before eating them (pictured) Anita now scours charity shops looking for ripe old tomes - and is unbothered by the germs and dust they may be harbouring . For her sister Anita, Pica struck later in life - when she was pregnant 24 years ago. 'I began having cravings for things that smelled like old bus tickets,' she told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. 'When I found the smell again, it was in an old book - and I haven't been able to stop since. 'The older the book, the better it tastes. I just love really old books. It's like eating a chocolate bar.' Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the patient is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. She now scours charity shops looking for ripe old tomes - and is unbothered by the germs and dust they may be harbouring. Once procured, the book is shredded to a tagliatelle-sized strand before being consumed. Asked by an astounded Eamonn Holmes why she couldn't just sniff the books, she replied: 'No, I have to taste them! 'Sniffing them works up an aroma - and I'm happy with what I do.' Commenting on the twins' eating condition, eating disorders psychologist Marcia Karp, told the programme: 'There are many reasons why people take non-food stuffs into their body. 'Pregnant women often have bizarre cravings and Pica can be sometimes be due to a mineral deficit.' She added: 'I have a friend who eats clay. She says: ""It calms me, it soothes me - it's almost like mother's milk"".' In June, MailOnline reported the story of Patrice Benjamin-Ramgoolam, who eats a tablespoon of brick each morning, scaped from her bedroom wall. Appearing on This Morning, she said: It's almost like someone who has a drug addiction – it’s like a fix. 'My body [calls] for it - my mouth will literally be dribbling.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by a husband accused of strangling his wife to death, but whose defence claims died of a previously undetected heart condition. 'Oh my god - I don't know what is going on,' real estate developer Adam Kaufman was heard by the court to say upon reporting finding his 33-year-old wife Eleonora (Lina) unconcious on their bathroom floor in November 2007. 'I don't know what happened. She's on the floor dying. She's not breathing.' Scroll Down for Video . Fight: Mr Kaufman, left, with attorney Al Milian, in a Miami-Dade court during beginning arguments in his murder trial . On trial for the second-degree murder of his wife, the prosecution allege that the call occured moments after Kaufman strangled his wife to death at their Aventura, Florida, home. Wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court, Kaufman watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife's body covered in cuts and abrasions, which they said were not there hours before her death. 'Lina Kaufman died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation to her neck, and her husband is the one who did it,' said prosecuting attorney Joseph Mansfield to the jury according to ABC News . According to the defence, Kaufman woke up and found his wife dead on the floor of their bathroom with her neck lying on a magazine rack in the early hours of November 7, 2007. 'The state's evidence cannot even prove that a homicide occurred, let alone that Adam Kaufman did it,' said defence attorney Bill Matthewman. The prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that Lina Kaufman's death was murder, but Mansfield said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered. Gone: Eleonora (Lina) Kaufman pictured here on her wedding day was found unconscious on the bathroom floor in November 2007 by her husband . Adam Kaufman, 39 (left) claims that he found his wife collapsed onto the magazine rack seen in the right picture in the couple's Aventura, Florida, home . Dr. Bruce A. Hyma, Miami-Dade County's chief medical examiner explained that 'only direct focused pressure' consistent with pressure exerted by another person could have caused the deep bleeding discovered in the victim's neck muscles. 'A healthy, active woman, arguable in the best shape of her life, and all that ended because of the actions of that man, her husband,' said Mansfield according to the Miami Herald . The defence team for Kaufman told the jury that Lina Kaufman was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart, which could have been the cause of her collapse. They also concluded that the injuries to the mother-of-two's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom. 'This case is a tragedy of errors. An innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime, this is a prosecution in search of a crime,' said Matthewman. Justice: Judge Bronwyn Miller listens to an attorney in opening arguments during Mr Kaufman's trial . Joseph Mansfield, Assistant State Attorney, (left) gives an opening argument in the trial of Adam Kaufman as Bill Matthewman, attorney for Adam Kaufman, (right) listens . The death of Lina Kaufman came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009, 18 months after her death and only when Kaufman complained to the medical examiner's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation. Appearing in court in 2009, the property developer's defence initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death, Lina's first ever, which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to NBC Miami . However, the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of Lina suffering from a bad heart. 'Under the laws of science, it's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened,' said Mansfield. Together: Adam and Lina Kaufman pictured on vacation were said to have had a happy marriage . Opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call, Kaufman was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing. The prosecution alleged that the information Kaufman gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks. 'Lina had a bad heart,' countered defence attorney Bill Matthewman. 'You will hear no motive. No evidence of a motive whatsoever. 'No life insurance. No financial crimes. No affairs during the marriage on behalf of Adam or Lina. 'No neighbours heard any arguments.' Under house arrest with his two children since 2009, Kaufman is supported by his wife's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter 'suffered from seizures, from fainting, from headaches.' It was on November 6, 2007, that Eleonora 'Lina' Kaufman received her first even spray tan, went to see a girlfirned who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body. Then at 6 a.m on November 7, a frantic sounding Kaufman phoned 911 to report his wife's death, in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes. 'Oh God! Oh God! Lina,' cried Kaufman as he was instructed to give his wife CPR. During the trial today, the jury heard from Dr. Tracy Baker, a plastic surgeon who had performed breast-implant surgery on Lina Kaufman. Not Guilty: Mr Kaufman was introduced by his defence team as a proud father and as a distraught widower . He told told the court that he knew Lina to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms. The court also heard from Larissa Adamyan, Lina's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell. 'She was dizzy, she called she called me. She was dizzy and on the floor,” said Adamyan according to CBS Miami . The police first became suspicious of Kaufman after one officer noted that his Mercedes-Benz was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died. Brother: Mr Kaufman turns to speak to his identical twin Seth during the trial in Miami . In addition, two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that Kaufman was dressed and that only one side of the pair's bed appeared to have been slept in. The defence dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken Kaufman's identical twin Seth, who lived down the street and had come to the house that night, for his brother. Lt. Michael Castro reported that Kaufman told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomitting. Vacation: In happier times Adam and Lina Kaufman are pictured on the beach near to their Florida home . The firefighter said that Kaufman changed his story at Aventura Hospital and said that he found his wife's neck resting on the magazine rack. He also added that he was wary of Kaufman's 'odd' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry. 'It was almost like an act,' said Castro. The defence have hired Dr. Michael Bodden, the former medical examiner for New York City to debunk the prosecutions claims. 'The investigation underlying this case was biased, incompetent, flawed and inept,' said Matthewman. Currently free on bail of $500,000, Kaufam could be sentenced to life imprisonment if he is convicted.","Jury played distressing 911 call made by Adam Kaufman after allegedly finding his wife Lina collapsed in their bathroom .

"By . Alex Ward . Deadly allergies mean this little boy must spend most of his life in isolation but it does not mean he gets out of doing his school homework. In place of seven-year-old Devon Carrow-Sperduti, he sends a robot to school, allowing him to answer questions in class and even be part of schoolyard gossip, all while he sits in the safety of his bedroom, five miles away. The amazing technology, called the VGo robot, has an interactive screen allowing Devon to interact with his classmates, despite never having met them face-to-face, at Winchester Elementary School in West Seneca, New York. Scroll down for video . Life of isolation: Devon Carrow-Sperduti, 7, has deadly allergies which mean he must spend most of his life in isolation but a robot in the school classroom, allows him to answer the teacher's questions and be part of schoolyard gossip . A 'virtual Devon': The robot has an interactive screen which allows Devon to mix with his classmates, despite never having met them face-to-face . Devon's robot has his own desk in the classroom and can volunteer to answer his teacher's questions with a flashing light, rather than raising his hand. Mother Rene said the $5,000 (£3,100) robot stops Devon from becoming a social recluse. She said: ‘The children don't call the machine the “VGo”, it's just Devon. ‘The VGo is basically a virtual . Devon. It helps him feel included, and realise that he still has to go . to school the same as any other child. ‘The only thing that's different is Devon is not in the classroom. ‘He's . required to do everything every other kid does in the class. He doesn't . get any special treatment, because he has to be treated just the same . as everybody else.’ Part of the class: The robot means Devon can go to school like any other child, allowing him to have a chance at having a proper childhood . Five miles away: Devon uses his computer at home which sends wireless signals to the robot at school enabling him to see his teacher, the blackboard and his classmates, as well as to move about the school . There is a high-definition camera on his computer at his bedroom desk and on the top of the VGo machine, which stands at about the height of a primary school pupil, and is on wheels, making it mobile like a Segway. From his home in Buffalo, New York, . Devon uses a computer screen to send wireless signals to the VGo, . enabling him to see his teacher, the blackboard, and the other children . in his class, as well as to move about the school. Rene said the robot is the ideal solution to Devon debilitating condition. She said: ‘Devon has so many . allergies that can be fatal to him, many of them are airborne, and we . just can't risk his life by letting him mix with other children. ‘If . my elder son, Dylan, occasionally has friends over to the house, they . have to shower and scrub down like they've been exposed to radiation. Not a recluse: The amazing technology, known as VGo, makes Devon feel included and his mother Rene says 'the children don't call the machine the ""VGo"", it's just Devon' Deadly allergies: The boy has so many deadly allergies, many airborne, that can be fatal and so he is unable to mix with other children. When he is in contact with other people, they must shower, scrub down and wear clothes washed and ironed by Devon's mother . Honour to have him: Kathleen Brachmann, the principal at Winchester Elementary School said it is a 'great opportunity' to have Devon able to attend the school through the robot . ‘I have to keep set of clothes that I . have washed and ironed that I have to ask guests to wear, to make sure . Devon never comes into contact with his allergies. ‘He . has been in the intensive care unit three times after suffering near . deadly reactions in the past and hospitalised countless times. ‘I . can't ask every child in a school to constantly scrub their hands, . brush their teeth and use mouthwash in case they have come into contact . with any nuts. ‘It's not practical and it's not fair . but I also don't think Devon should be denied the chance of a proper . childhood, so the robot is the ideal solution.’ The . family had not heard of the VGo until local education bosses suggested . the newly-developed technology as a possibility when Devon was due to . start school this year. Listen and learns: Devon's first-grade teacher Jennifer Szewc said that the robot's flashing light, which Devon uses to answer a question, is just 'like another hand in the room' The school’s principal Kathleen Brachmann said: ‘There was no hesitation in us accepting Devon. ‘I don't know if you'd get that every place. That's just how we are here. ‘A lot of people look at it as a challenge, we look at it as a great opportunity. We feel like it's an honour to have him here.’ Devon’s first-grade teacher Jennifer Szewc said: ‘One of the great things about the VGo is that Devon could turn and talk. ‘I could say, “could you go join me on the carpet?” and he would. ‘When he would turn on his light, it was like another hand up in the room.’ Devon was diagnosed with eosinophilic . esophagitis disease, an allergic inflammatory response in the . oesophagus, when he was just six-months-old along with anaphylactic . shock syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome and asthma. 'Boy in a bubble': Devon was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis disease, an allergic inflammatory response in the esophagus, and is restricted to eating just corn, apples and potatoes . As well as being unable to go to school, Devon survives on a restricted diet, eating just corn, apple and potatoes. Rene, a social worker, said: ‘He's a walking time bomb. ‘He . also suffers from severe skin allergies. His hands get red and scaly . easily. They become so irritated, sometimes the skin splits open and he . can't pick up a pen to write. ‘Even the smell of fabric softener can cause his throat to close. ‘He's almost like the boy in a bubble. I try to let him do some things. I want him to have the best life he could have.’ Boy, not a robot: Devon's (left) family were touched when his classmates made get-well-soon cards for him after a near fatal allergic reaction, for which he has been hospitalised for several times (right), drawing pictures of him as a boy, not a robot . After a near-fatal allergic reaction, Devon’s family were touched when his classmates made get-well-soon cards, drawing Devon as a boy, not a robot. Rene said: ‘We are just so thankful that the school has accepted Devon in this way and really proud that he has been able to overcome his disability.’ A room in the family home has been made into a dedicated classroom and teachers have made it look every bit the part.

"By . Hannah Roberts . A British port is in the running to dismantle the Costa Concordia, a mega-contract expected to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Able Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool, has been asked to submit a proposal for the vast demolition project, which is expected to take 200 people two years to complete. It estimated value of the contract is more than Euro 300million. The wreck of the stricken cruise liner is still stranded off the island of Giglio where it struck rocks and sank, killing 32 people. Almost two years on from the tragedy, the stricken hull is almost set to be towed away from the Mediterranean holiday island . Captain Francesco Schettino was allegedly performing an ill judged 'salute' to the islander when the giant ship ran aground. Almost two years on from the tragedy, the stricken hull is almost set to be towed away from the Mediterranean holiday island, the salvage team said. Its destination is still undecided. A final judgement will be taken in March but some eight ports are in contention including Able Port on the River Tees, among others in Italy, Norway, Turkey, China and France. Able UK confirmed that it was in the tender process and said that its yard had previously recycled both a French aircraft carrier and US Government vessels. 'The facility, including one of the world's largest dry docks, has full planning permissions and environmental accreditations to undertake this type of activity. The previous contracts were completed in October 2010 and employed over 100 personnel,' it said. Altogether 12 companies have been invited to bid for the job of breaking up, scrapping and recycling the vessel . Altogether 12 companies have been invited to bid for the job of breaking up, scrapping and recycling the vessel. Italy’s environment minister Andrea Orlando told reporters that although it was the government's preferred choice that the contract go to an Italian bidder, it was not in a position to make any demands. 'Naturally the port of destination is not unimportant to us, for many reasons,' he said, adding that given the environmental challenges it was preferable for the ship to be towed to a port nearby. But there are question marks over the suitability of several of the four Italian docks- which might need huge renovations to prepare them for the size of the task. The 114,000-ton ship was wrested from the rocks in September last year in a complicated 19-hour salvage operation, the largest and most expensive of its kind. Captain,Schettino, is currently standing trial in the Tuscan town of Grosseto charged with multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship . More than 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms are being used to keep the vessel stable. To tow the cruise ship away, Costa has rented for three months, at a cost of Euro 30 million euro, the Dockwise Vanguard, the largest semi-submersible vessel in the world. Michael Thamm, chief executive officer of Costa Crociere, said: 'We are very confident that we can remove this ship within the month of June. This is not very far away - and then a great job will be done.' Mr Thamm said he expected the cost of the Costa Concordia salvage effort to reach €600m (£496m) by the time it was removed from Giglio. News of the tender came as Giglio prepares to mark the two year anniversary of the disaster on Monday with a mass and concert commemorating those who lost their lives.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Paleontologists have long pondered what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago and came up with some crazy theories. While a spy proposed the dinosaurs suffered from overactive glands and a low sex drive, which led to their downfall, other scientists believed growing too big, hungry caterpillars, aliens and a taste for eggs were all good reasons as to why the ancient beasts died out. Now-a-days most scientists agree a combination of volcanic activity, climate change and a massive asteroid impact probably finished off  land-dwelling dinosaurs - with the exception of birds. While a spy proposed the dinosaurs suffered from overactive glands and a low sex drive which led to their downfall, other scientists believed growing too big, hungry caterpillars, aliens and even farting were all good reasons as to why the ancient beasts died out . A spy and Hungarian-born aristocrat, Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás, had plenty of extinction theories in the early 20th century including that dinosaurs had a low sex drive and overactive glands. The keen paleontologist thought dinosaurs got so large because of secretions from the pituitary gland, which caused them to grow too large. While he tried to apply knowledge of human conditions to the dinosaurs, there is no evidence to suggest that the gland had anything to do with the animals' size or extinction, Smithsonian reported. Another scientist living at the same time, called George Wieland, believed the dinosaurs ate themselves to death and the T-Rex got its 'first impulse toward gigantism on a diet of sauropod eggs'. The Yale researcher said the greedy carnivores ate too many eggs and caused their mass extinction, but now-a-days scientists agree that while fossils show the creatures had a taste for eggs, they could not have eaten them all. Staying with eggs, fossil expert H.K. Erben proposed in the 1970s that dinosaur eggs had multiple shell layers, while others were too thin, causing developing dinosaurs to either suffocate, or dehydrate if the shell was too thin and got broken. One researcher said greedy dinosaurs ate too many eggs to cause mass extinction, but now-a-days scientists agree that while fossils show the creatures had a taste for eggs, they could not have eaten them all. A nest of petrified dinosaur eggs being analysed is pictured . While he based his idea on eggshells found in Southern France, fossil records show this was a local phenomenon and not a widespread problem. In the early 1900s, when Darwin's theory of natural selection was still catching on, many palaeontologists thought the beasts became too sluggish, big and stupid to function. The now unpopular theory supposed that dinosaurs had a kind of evolutionary inertia and spent their energy getting larger instead of smarter, despite the fact that some of the largest species of dinosaur including the Stegosaurus and Brachiosaurus thrived. More recently, in the past decade, an infertility specialist has argued the dinosaurs died out as they couldn't find partners. Sherman Silber said that as temperatures can determine the sex of some animals, like crocodiles, climate change could have ensured that only one sex of dinosaur babies were born. There are several holes in this theory including that scientists do not know if the sex of dinosaurs were determined by temperature. In the 1960s, entomologist Stanley Flanders proposed that the first moths and caterpillars ate all the vegetation on Cretaceous Earth, causing the herbivorous dinosaurs to go hungry. In the 1960s by entomologist Stanley Flanders proposed that the first moths, butterflies and caterpillars ate all the vegetation on Cretaceous Earth, causing the herbivorous dinosaurs to go hungry. A modern  Pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly is pictured . Consequently he argued the predators would also starve as they had no more vegetarian dinosaurs to eat. However, once again, modern science and fossil records have shown that butterflies and moths happily coexisted with dinosaurs and did not gobble all the plants. The Smithsonian article notes that as the expertise of scientists often informs their theory, it is not surprising that ophthalmologist L.R. Croft believed bad eyesight was to blame for the extinction of the dinosaurs. In the 1980s he said rising temperatures caused cataracts to develop faster and even went as far to suggest that dinosaurs successfully evolved horns on their faces to protect their eyes from the sun. The theory does not explain why flying dinosaurs did not go blind too. While not strictly a scientific idea, last year paleontologist David Wilkinson speculated the dinosaur's annual . output of methane gas would have been enough to cause global warming. Before the idea of an asteroid impact (pictured) was embraced by the scientific community as a reason for the extinction of dinosaurs, physicist Wallace Tucker and paleontologist Dale Russell suggested in the 1970s that a death blow came from space . While they did not mention extinction, the media seized upon the idea to conclude dinosaurs farted themselves to death. Likewise, a TV programme last year called 'Ancient Aliens' amalgamated various scraps of science to state that aliens could have wiped out the dinosaurs. However, Utah State University’s Prehistoric Museum said there is no evidence to suggest this theory is true as no fossilized aliens, or alien waste has ever been discovered. Finally, before the idea of an asteroid impact was embraced by the scientific community as a reason for the extinction of dinosaurs, physicist Wallace Tucker and paleontologist Dale Russell suggested in the 1970s that a death blow came from space. However, they thought a supernova relatively close to the Earth exploded and bombarded the upper atmosphere with X-rays causing temperatures to decrease sharply. But no evidence of an astronomical event has been found.

"By . Associated Press . Donovan  Webster was driving drunk when he crashed and killed a 75-year-old man, police say . An acclaimed journalist and author was in jail without bond Monday on charges of driving under the influence stemming from a crash that killed a 75-year-old Virginia man. Donovan Webster, 55, of Charlottesville could face additional charges after an investigation into the Thursday crash in Afton, according to the Albemarle County Police Department. Authorities said the wreck killed Wayne Thomas White of Waynesboro, and it involved two vehicles and a tractor trailer. Webster was driving one of the vehicles, but police declined to provide further details on the wreck in Afton, just outside Charlottesville, which is 70 miles northwest of Richmond. Webster is a former senior editor for Outside magazine and has written for The New Yorker, National Geographic and other magazines. He also has written several books, including 'Meeting the Family: One Man's Journey Through His Human Ancestry,' ''The Burma Road: The Epic Story of the China-Burma-India Theater in World War II' and 'Aftermath: The Remnants of War,' a collection of essays on the effects of war plaguing civilians long after the conflicts. In 1997, the book won the Gelber Prize, one of biggest prizes in the world for books on international issues. He traveled to France, Russia, Vietnam, Kuwait, and a weapons testing site in Nevada to gather information for his book. His travels for various projects were the subject of two documentaries: 'Running the Sahara,' released in 2007 and narrated by actor Matt Damon, and 'Amazon Gold,' released in 2012 and narrated by Academy Award winners Sissy Spacek and Herbie Hancock. Webster also served as an editor for the Virginia Quarterly Review, a literary magazine that has been published at the University of Virginia since 1925, and a professor of media studies at the Charlottesville school. Webster's family confirmed to The Daily Progress newspaper that the author is the same man charged in the crash but declined to comment any further. According to court records, a hearing is scheduled for October. Globetrotting: Webster (left) has traveled all over the world for his stories. He is seen here in Mali . Wayne Thomas White, 75, was killed after Donovan Webster allegedly caused a crash while driving drunk in Virginia. He is survived by ten children and 19 grandchildren . Phone messages left for his family by The Associated Press on Monday were not immediately returned. A phone number listed for White was disconnected. According to an obituary, White 'had a lifelong love of farming' and had more than 20 years of service with Friendly Tire Service in Waynesboro. He left behind 10 children, 19 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.","Donovan Webster, 55, has written numerous books and written for the New Yorker and National Geographic .

"By . Leon Watson . As one of her predecessors Sir Bruce Forsyth might say, ‘Didn’t she do well?’ Miranda Hart has been announced as the host of a revival of the Generation Game, making her the first woman to present the show. BBC One controller Charlotte Moore confirmed that the star of Call The Midwife and sitcom Miranda is in talks with the corporation about the programme, which is due to return to our screens next year. Good game, good game: Miranda recreates Bruce Forsyth's legendary pose in an interview last year . She said: . ‘We are working closely with Miranda on how a modern day Gen Game would . work, whilst she continues to be committed to her work as an exceptional . actress. It’s an exciting process.’ Her . comments came after Miss Hart, 41, appeared to distance herself from . the revival yesterday, tweeting: ‘Apparently it’s 100 per cent cert I am . doing Gen Game. First I’ve heard of it. Mulling some ideas about it . might be more accurate.’ She also said that the idea 'is one of a few private brainstorms'. The . show is fondly remembered by millions for its cheesy catchphrases and . conveyor belt of less-than-thrilling prizes that always included a . cuddly toy. At its peak in the late 1970s, it pulled . in an astonishing 20 million viewers every Saturday evening, first with . Bruce Forsyth at the helm and then Larry Grayson. Forsyth, . whose best known lines included 'Didn't they do well?', 'Nice to see . you, to see you, nice!', and 'Give us a twirl', then returned for a . four-year stint in 1990 before Jim Davidson presented it from 1995 to . 2002. Challenge: Hart took to Twitter to let fans know the Guardian report was the 'first' she had heard about her 'confirmed' appearance on the show, before tweeting today that the idea is 'one of a few private brainstorms' Hart, the star of the BBC sitcom Miranda, has already appeared in a Comic Relief version of the show and described it as 'one of the greatest game shows ever'. The BBC1 controller, Charlotte Moore, told the Guardian: 'It will be a . modern reinvention of the Generation Game. 'Miranda will bring a very . different flavour to it. Her wit and spirit behind it will naturally . move it into the modern era. Miranda is brilliant at engaging with . people, she loves that interaction. She'll be brilliant.' Hart is a huge fan of the show and sang its praises in an interview she did with Forsyth last year. She . said: 'Bruce is too modest to say this but I am going to say it for . him. During the 1970s the Generation Game was getting over 20 million . viewers every week and my family were among them. I loved it. It is one . of the greatest game shows ever.' She even defended the programme when Forsyth himself said it might now be considered 'old hat'. Generation Game: Bruce Forsyth, right, and Anthea Redfern, centre, in action on the show. At its peak in the 1970s it pulled in 20million viewers a week . The show's format involved couples of family members competing against each other in a series of challenges. Typically the couples comprised family members who were a generation apart, such as mother and son. The new Generation Game is likely to be tweaked to make it relevant for a modern audience but insiders expect all the classic ingredients to remain the same. It is not known who will be Hart's co-host and whether the job will go to a man or a woman. One of hostesses in the original show, Anthea Redfern, famously had an affair with Forsyth and married him in 1973 before divorcing him six years later. The BBC hopes the new version will prove as popular as Strictly Comes Dancing, which pulls in more than 11 million viewers.","Popular game show set to be relaunched by the BBC .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . A Texas dad accused of shooting dead a drunk driver who fatally struck his two sons heads to court for the start of his trial today. David Barajas, 32, denies killing new father Jose Banda, 20, in a fit of rage after he plowed down 12-year-old David Jr. and 11-year-old Caleb on a rural road in Southeast Texas in 2012. As his case begins, the jury faces many complexities with the evidence: no weapon was recovered, no witnesses . identified him as the shooter and no gun residue was found on his hands. But there are also the moral issues, including how many people in Barajas' community have said  they might also have taken . the law into their own hands if faced with a similar situation. Tragic: David Barajas, pictured with his wife and their three children, heads to court this week accused of shooting dead the drunk driver who fatally struck his two sons in a car accident in 2012 . Barajas' attorney said he is a good . man, a grieving father and not a murderer - but his defense hasn't . failed to publicly suggest who else might be responsible for Banda's . death. Legal experts acknowledge prosecutors could face a greater challenge than simply proving who committed the shooting, similar to another Texas case from 2012 in which a grand jury declined to indict a father who killed a man who molested his child. 'It's not the right way to do it, but jurors a lot of times make judgments based on moral responsibility, not legal responsibility,' said Joel Androphy, a Houston defense attorney not connected to the case. The trial will focus on prosecutors' allegations that Barajas shot Banda in the head in December 2012 near Alvin, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. Minutes earlier, Banda's car struck Barajas' sons as they pushed the family's broken-down truck down a dark, narrow road just 50 yards from their home. Missed: Jose Banda Jr. (left) had welcomed a baby girl with his girlfriend (right) two months before his death . David Jr., 12, died at the scene while his 11-year-old brother Caleb died at a hospital. If convicted of murder, Barajas faces up to life in prison. Many in the community have rallied around the dad, including setting up a Facebook page, 'Free David Barajas,' which details fundraising events and where individuals have expressed their support. But Banda's family says their loved one's fate should have been decided by the justice system and no one else. 'What (Barajas) did wasn't right,' said Felicia Leija, 22, Banda's common-law wife and the mother of his daughter Alisa, who was born just a few months before the crash. 'For other people to say they would have done the same thing ... you don't know what you would have done.' Victims: David Barajas Jr., 12, (left) died at the scene and his brother Caleb, 11, (right) died later in hospital . Loss: After the boys were hit, witnesses saw a man shoot the driver but none could identify him as Barajas . Barajas' attorney, Sam Cammack, says claims that his client took the law into his own hands are untrue, noting that Barajas didn't even own a gun. Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne declined to comment. Arrested: Barajas was arrested for the killing and faces life in prison if convicted . Neighbors said they heard gunshots minutes after the crash, and authorities allege Barajas went home, retrieved a gun and went back to the crash site, where he shot Banda in the head. Toxicology tests later determined Banda had been driving while intoxicated. But Brazoria County sheriff's investigator Dominick Sanders said that in the moments after the crash, there had been no way to know it was alcohol related. Witnesses have identified Barajas as the person who approached the vehicle before the shooting, Sanders said. And other witnesses said there was a man opening fire but none could identify Barajas as that person. Investigators never found the weapon, and gunshot residue tests done on Barajas came back negative. A search of Barajas' home found ammunition consistent with the bullet that killed Banda, but Sanders said the missing weapon could still make 'a big difference in the case'. So could the perceived moral circumstances, which legal experts agree may influence jurors. In June 2012, a grand jury in Shiner . decided not to charge a father who fatally beat up a man who was found . molesting his five-year-old daughter behind a barn. Crash: Police cars gather at the site where Banda fatally hit the two boys in December 2012 . Collision: The boys had been helping push their father's broken-down car when they were hit by the driver . In that case, the father called 911 afterward and urged paramedics to rush to the scene, shouting, 'Come on! This guy is going to die on me!' From a strictly legal perspective, experts say the Barajas case will be difficult to prosecute given the lack of hard evidence. 'The prosecutor is starting from behind the eight ball,' Houston criminal defense attorney Grant Scheiner said. Cammack would not speculate on who may have shot Banda. 'Mr. Banda lost his life out there at the scene that night, somehow,' he said. 'That is not a good thing. But to suggest Mr. Barajas has anything to do with it is a far stretch of the imagination.'","David Barajas, 32, is accused of shooting Jose Banda, 20, after he struck his two sons, aged 11 and 12, on a rural Texas road in 2012 .

"By . Tim Finan . Three Iranians, two of them children, have been discovered in the back of a refrigerated lorry at Coquells, close to the entrance to the Channel Tunnel in France. The youngsters, understood to both be under 10-years-old, and their de facto guardian are understood to have sneaked into the lorry as it prepared to cross to the UK. A French source said that the three migrants were taken to hospital in Calais but did not require medical treatment as they had not been in the truck long enough for hypothermia to set in. Trucks line up at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel terminal in Sangatte, near Calais: Three Iranians, two of them children, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated lorry near to here. (File photo) The trio are among an estimated 1,300 migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East currently living rough in Calais, northern France, in the hope of making their way to Britain. Some live in ramshackle tents in what is now called 'Jungle 2', a camp next to a chemical factory only a short distance from the heavily guarded ferry terminal linking Calais to Dover. Others are squatting the town centre in unoccupied buildings seized by members of No Borders, a protest group campaigning for free passage for migrants to the UK. Earlier this month the town's police chief announced a decision to send in riot Police to clear Jungle 2 and a squat in the town. He said migrants would be informed of their rights to asylum in France. Mayor of Calais Natacha Buchart blames Britain for her town's problems, which began in the late 1990s. When an influx of migrants trying to reach Britain led to the opening of a giant Red Cross hostel in Sangatte, close to the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, where they were sheltered, fed and given medical care. Mrs Bouchart said she would like to see British border, which is currently at Calais on the French side of the Channel, shifted back to Dover to enable migrants free passage to the UK mainland. Migrants in Calais: The trio are among an estimated 1,300 migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East currently living rough in Calais, northern France, in the hope of making their way to Britain . When the Sangatte hostel was closed by Nicolas Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, in 2002, hundreds of migrants began sleeping rough in sand dunes and wasteland near the ferry terminal. What came to be known as 'The Jungle' was razed five years ago. This summer Jungle 2 rapidly expanded with new arrivals of Africans from Eritrea. Since the beginning of the year about 100,000 East Africans have entered Italy via Libya and the Mediterranean. Many of those head for Calais hoping to sneak on board trucks crossing the Channel to the UK. Meanwhile, more and more desperate refugees arrive at the port every day. In a recent interview, deputy mayor of Calais Philippe Mignonet said that if nothing is done to solve the problem between two and five thousand migrants will be camping there by the end of the year.","Both children are understood to be under 10-years-old .

During a press conference yesterday, Joanna thanked doctors and the family of the person who donated their face, and told journalists: 'I have nice eyebrows now'. Transformed: The 26-year-old, identified only as Joanna, underwent Poland's second ever facial transplant after neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition causing benign tumours - left her unable to chew, talk or swallow . Grateful: During a press conference yesterday, Joanna thanked doctors and the family of the person who donated their face, and told journalists: 'I have nice eyebrows now' Difficult: Before the operation, Joanna struggled to chew, swallow or speak. Following the surgery she can now do all these things again . New life: Joanna has reportedly told doctors that she hopes to return to education, possibly studying psychology 'as she would like to help others' Speaking at the conference, Dr Adam Maciejewski, who performed both Joanna's surgery as well as the only other facial transplant in Poland, said: 'Joanna feels very good. She's getting better.' He added that, once she has gets through the long-term rehabilitation programme she's still facing, Joanna hopes to return to education, possibly studying psychology 'as she would like to help others' Earlier Dr Maciejewski, who led the 23-hour surgery last week, said he hopes the transplant of 80 per cent of the skin on her face will give her the ability to chew, talk or swallow. Joanna was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves. The condition can also cause bone problems, pressure on the spinal nerves, severe pain, learning disabilities and vision and hearing problems. There is no cure for it. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born.

Joanna (pictured during surgery last week) was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis - a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves . Despite their alarming appearance, the . growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of . cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The facial tumour will not recur because the skin on her new face is from different genes, genetics expert Dr Anand Saggar told MailOnline. In May, Dr Maciejewski and his . colleagues performed Poland's first face transplant on a man whose face . was torn off by a stone mason's machine. His recovery is said to be . progressing. The man's operation took 27 hours and was carried out just weeks after his accident. It was thought to be the first face transplant to be carried out so soon after the damage had occurred - previous transplants have taken months, or even years, to prepare. Joanna is currently in serious but stable condition after the operation at the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland. Image shows her parents at a press conference . The man had to have his jaw, palate and eye sockets reconstructed. The world's first full-face transplant was carried out on a Spanish farmer in March 2010. Oscar had blown most of his face off with a gun during a hunting accident and was left unable to breathe, swallow or talk properly.","Joanna, 26, struggled to chew, swallow or talk before the massive operation .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Ed Miliband has accepted a £110,000 donation from a tycoon who took him to a football match in a Rolls-Royce. Businessman Assem Allam, 75, who owns Premier League side Hull City, handed over the six-figure sum two years after controversy over the Labour leader’s attendance at the game. Mr Miliband appeared in the chairman’s seats for the afternoon match against Ipswich Town despite having earlier said he was too ill to attend a rally against government health reforms in the morning. The match ended in a two-all draw. Fit for the match: Ed Miliband appeared in the chairman’s seats for Hull City's afternoon match against Ipswich Town despite having  said that he was too ill to attend a rally against government health reforms in the morning . Egyptian-born Dr Allam, who is known as the ‘Pharaoh of Hull’, has angered fans of the club by attempting to rebrand it as Hull Tigers. The latest Electoral Commission figures reveal Dr Allam donated £110,000 to the Labour Party in June this year. He previously donated £100,000 just weeks before Mr Miliband’s visit in March 2012. The Labour leader arrived at the KC Stadium in a Rolls-Royce Phantom provided by his host for his surprise visit to Hull City, who at the time played in the Championship. Party officials had earlier claimed he was travelling to Hull to attend an anti-NHS reforms rally in the city centre. The official version of events is that the protest was called off because he was ill, but that he then quickly recovered. Dr Allam is worth £320million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. A former auditor in the Egyptian finance ministry, he settled in Britain more than 40 years ago . Dr Allam is worth £320million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. A former auditor in the Egyptian finance ministry, he settled in Britain more than 40 years ago. He was forced to flee Egypt after being imprisoned and tortured on the orders of President Nasser. Dr Allam got a job with Charterhouse, a London merchant bank, and when it sold one of its loss-making companies, a diesel generator manufacturer, in 1981, he bought it for £1. He built the engineering business into one of the country’s most successful and profitable companies. When Hull City’s proposed name change to Hull Tigers was announced last year it was claimed it would make the team more marketable in Asia, where football is growing in popularity. But fans set up a campaign group called City Till We Die and protested during games. Dr Allam labelled them ‘hooligans’. The Football Association rejected the name change. Dr Allam has had a number of disputes with Hull’s Labour-controlled council over property developments he has proposed in the city. He wanted to buy the freehold of the stadium where his team plays from the authority, but it refused. The city council also refused planning permission for him to convert a former factory into apartments and build new houses. The latest Electoral Commission figures show Dr Allam donated £15,000 to the Conservative Middle East Association in May.","Labour leader travelled to Hull to attend anti-NHS rally but 'too ill' to go .

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin for the Mail on Sunday . Commons Speaker John Bercow faced a crisis last night after the leak of a bombshell Downing Street email denouncing his ‘bizarre’ decision to give an Australian woman a £200,000-a-year Parliamentary post. Mr Bercow’s determination to give Australian official Carol Mills the powerful job of Commons Clerk has sparked an all-party revolt. He has been accused of a ‘politically correct’ stunt – and trying to use manager Ms Mills’s inexperience in Parliamentary debates to grab more power for himself. 'Less stuffy': The determination of Commons Speaker John Bercow (left) to give Australian official Carol Mills (right) the powerful job of Commons Clerk has sparked an all-party revolt . The dispute took an extraordinary turn last night after one of Ms Mills’s senior colleagues at the Australian Senate effectively branded her unfit to do the job. Rosemary Laing, Clerk at the Australian Senate – the equivalent of the post planned for Ms Mills – said the ‘embarrassing’ appointment was ‘an affront’. The onslaught came in an email widely circulated in Westminster, including No 10, and obtained by  this newspaper. The dispute threatened to turn into a major row as it emerged: . * Outgoing Commons Clerk Sir  Robert Rogers, allegedly told to ‘f*** off’ by Mr Bercow, kept a sensational secret diary of the Speaker’s outbursts. * The Queen risked being dragged into the row amid reports David Cameron is ready to refuse to send the appointment to the Palace for Royal approval. * MPs’ calls for a vote to overturn the Speaker’s choice of Ms Mills were backed by ministers. * Male officials rejected in favour of Ms Mills may sue Mr Bercow for sex discrimination. Controversy: John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, pictured with his wife Sally . The row comes after widely respected Parliamentary traditionalist Sir Robert resigned after a series of clashes with the Speaker. Ms Mills is currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) of the Australian Senate in Canberra, responsible for everything from cleaning to catering, not debates, leading Westminster wags to call her ‘the Canberra Caterer’. Mr Bercow reportedly sees her as a ‘less stuffy’ replacement and part of his drive to ‘modernise’ Parliament. But critics claim it is a secret power grab because she will be  unable to challenge his rulings. Their claims are reinforced in the email sent last week by Ms Laing, who works closely with Ms Mills. She said: ‘We were utterly taken aback when we heard Carol Mills was front-runner to replace Sir  Robert Rogers and have followed events with disbelief and dismay. ‘It seems impossible someone without parliamentary knowledge and experience could be under consideration for such a role. It is bizarre and an affront. ‘Carol comes from the state public service. It is not simple to move to serving Parliament if there is a lack of understanding of Parliament.’ Ms Laing echoes MPs who say Mr Bercow would ride roughshod over Ms Mills. ‘DPS heads [such as Mills] have a lack of appreciation and respect for MPs and senators and an over-emphasis on the authority of Presiding Officers [such as Bercow].’ Referring to claims that Ms Mills’s department used CCTV to spy on the office of an Australian senator, Ms Laing said: ‘I was surprised a resignation did not follow.’ She backed calls for MPs to quiz Ms Mills before she becomes Commons Clerk and Chief Executive. It would be ‘enormously embarrassing,’ said Ms Laing. She added:  ‘The only thing more embarrassing would be to make the proposed appointment.’ Sir Robert refused to comment on claims that he had kept a diary of the volatile Speaker’s tantrums and alleged four-letter outbursts. A well-placed source said: ‘Robert could see the writing on the wall and took the necessary precautions.’ Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It would be wrong for the Queen to approve this appointment before MPs have been fully consulted.’ But last night, the Speaker refused to back down, insisting via a spokeswoman that Ms Mills’s appointment was ‘open and fair’. She insisted the choice was a ‘collective decision’ by the six-strong Commons interview panel, including Mr Bercow.","John Bercow's plan to employ Carol Mills has sparked an all-party revolt .

"By . Daniel Martin for Daily Mail . Liam Fox today becomes the most senior figure to demand Britain joins the US in carrying out bombing raids against Iraqi fanatics. As David Cameron finally returns from his holidays, the former defence secretary calls on the Prime Minister to sanction the use of our military to protect civilians from 'barbaric' Islamic State fighters. He attacks the 'catastrophic complacency' of Western politicians over the humanitarian crisis, accusing them of policy paralysis. Scroll down for video . Former defence secretary Liam Fox has called on David Cameron to sanction the use of our military against ISIS in Iraq . A British Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 aircraft from RAF Marham, eastern England, on their arrival at RAF Akrotiri Cyprus for their reconnaissance mission over Iraq . The Tornados will be pre-positioned in Cyprus and available to fly over the crisis area at short notice to  provide vital intelligence to assist the delivery of the UK Aid provided by the Department for International Development . His intervention came as: . * Downing Street said RAF Chinook helicopters are to be sent into northern Iraq to rescue tens of thousands of Yazidi refugees; . * British planes are also expected to take military supplies to help Kurdish fighters tackle the Islamic State militants; . * A rescue helicopter crashed because it was carrying too many refugees; . * A senior general accused the Government of being too terrified to intervene. Resisting strong pressure to recall Parliament, the Government said last night there were no plans to make the British operation in Iraq more than a humanitarian mission. However, writing in the Daily Mail today, Dr Fox says this approach is unsustainable – and that aid on its own is not enough to help defenceless Iraqis. Instead of leadership, he says there has been a vacuum that has allowed Islamic State to press ahead with a campaign of mass slaughter. And he warns that unless the maniacs are vanquished, young jihadis could flood to Britain to bring death and mayhem to our shores. In his hard-hitting article, the former minister calls on Mr Cameron to send the RAF to join US jets in blitzing Islamic State fighters – and says we should also supply arms to Kurdish fighters.

Liam Fox has called on the Prime Minister to sanction the use of our military to protect civilians from 'barbaric' Islamic State fighters (pictured) If RAF Chinook helicopters fly into action in Iraq – even on a humanitarian mission – it represents a considerable upping of the stakes. The heavy-duty twin-rotor aircraft can transport tons of aid and airlift out dozens of refugees but not without significant risk. Their advantage over high-flying cargo planes is that they can land, but this makes them vulnerable to attack. Crews would also face having to fend off hundreds of desperate refugees threatening to overload the helicopter, as has been happening with Iraqi Army aircraft this week. Humanitarian crisis: Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border . The use of Chinooks would also raise the prospect of British forces effectively becoming involved in combat, given that they might have to defend themselves against an attack by IS fanatics who would relish the chance of downing a British helicopter. As the spectre of 'mission creep' was raised again yesterday, three RAF Tornado warplanes jetted from RAF Marham in Norfolk for Cyprus, from where they will fly sorties over Iraq. Between six and eight Tornados will be equipped with reconnaissance pods used to scan the landscape distinguishing friend from foe, to identity where humanitarian supplies should be dropped. Mr Cameron, who has faced criticism for remaining on holiday in Portugal as the crisis unfolded, returns from his holiday later today and will be back at his desk at Downing Street tomorrow. The government has faced growing criticism over its apparent lack of a coherent strategy on how Britain is to respond to the Iraq crisis. One of the country's most senior generals yesterday accused the 'commitment-phobic' Government of being 'terrified' of intervening in the Iraq crisis before next year's general election. General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times: 'The longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate, the more dangerous the situation is going to become.' Yesterday both Tory MP Conor Burns and Labour's Gisela Stewart wrote to the Prime Minister to demand he recall Parliament to discuss possible UK action in Iraq.In his letter to Downing Street, Mr Burns said stronger action was needed against Islamic State because 'these people want a holocaust of everyone who does not share their brutal ideology'. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said 'it would be in the interests of the Government' to have Parliament recalled. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond again dismissed calls for military assistance yesterday. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As part of our efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Iraq, we are sending a small number of Chinook helicopters to the region for use if we decide we need further humanitarian relief options. 'We have also agreed to transport from other contributing states some critical military re-supplies for the Kurdish forces, so that they can provide effective protection from ISIS for the huge number of refugees now in Iraqi Kurdistan, and humanitarian operations.' Dr Foxwarns a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world . ISIS are BRITAIN'S enemy and have to be defeated . by LIAM FOX, former Tory Defence Secretary . For months, we have watched ISIS tighten their grip on the territory and people they control. They are well funded and well organised, strengthened by the chaos of the civil war in Syria and the actions of the disastrous Maliki government in Iraq. They are one of the most barbaric and savage forces we have witnessed in the world since the genocide in Rwanda. They pose a direct threat to the lives of civ- ilians who oppose their hardline religious views, they destabilise further an already volatile region and they will increasingly create young jihadists who will find their way to countries like our own. The idea that this is not our problem is wishful thinking at best, and cata-strophic complacency at worst. Yet, in the face of all the evidence, there has been policy paralysis in the West. Where we have needed leadership we have found a vacuum. Certainly, public opinion is split over any military action, understandable after the protracted conflict in Iraq, but this is an occasion where we need to lead public opinion, not follow it. The consequences of allowing an extremist caliphate to be formed, stretching from Syria to the borders of Iran, are almost unthinkable. Not only would it bring further horrors to innocent people, the likes of which we have seen graphically in the last few weeks, but it would potentially risk a full-scale Sunni-Shia conflict with profound economic consequences for us all. Those who say we should have nothing to do with the conflicts in the region might want to think about the effect on oil prices in the event of a clash involving Iran or Saudi Arabia. If the global economy were to suffer another oil shock, the price, for the poorest countries in particular, could be disastrously high. Perhaps worst of all, a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world and it would soon be used as a base from which to export terrorism and extremism. So, we need to be clear, ISIS are our enemy and need to be defeated. Either we use our military power to degrade and diminish their military capabilities, so that the countries in the region are able to deal with them effectively, or we can ensure that we supply our allies in the region with the equipment and knowledge they need to do the job themselves. In all likelihood, we will have to do both. A half-hearted and ineffectual intervention will only increase the suffering of those caught up in the nightmare of ISIS and increase the risk of a widening crisis. The US government has made a belated, but welcome, decision to use American air power to hit ISIS bases. We should be willing to do the same if asked. Sending humanitarian aid is right but if we are leaving the vulnerable unprotected from the military terror of the ISIS forces then our help is superficial. There are, of course, risks involved with any outside intervention, but those who think that we will be left alone by the fanatics if we are not seen to be taking a side are fooling themselves. In the West, we need to understand that Islamist fundamentalists hate us, not just because of what we do, but because of who we are. Our systems of law and government and our concept of rights, especially women’s rights, and religious tolerance undermine their very existence in the long-term. There is not going to be a cost-free option available in a situation which has already been allowed to continue for too long, but the cost of failing to act could be higher still.","Liam Fox calls on the Prime Minister to sanction the use of our military .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . One of the pioneering businesses of the British dotcom boom is to be put up for sale after it failed to live up to its initial promise. Lastminute.com, founded by internet icons Brent Hoberman and Baroness Lane in 1998, was acquired in 2005 by American technology company and travel specialist Sabre. The travel website - a former poster child of the digital revolution - was bought by Travelocity, Sabre's travel e-commerce subsidiary as a means to bolster its online holiday division in Europe. Pioneering: Lastminute.com was co-founded by Oxford graduates Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox. It was bought by American travel specialist Sabre in 2005 for £600m - earning the founders £40m . But the business has failed to live up to its original promise, despite continuing to spend significant sums on marketing and advertising - and a growing number of more flexible rivals have left it struggling. Its biggest market shares are in the UK and France but it has struggled to make an impact elsewhere in Europe. Sabre, which is listed in New York, has . appointed bankers at Houlihan Lokey, an advisory firm, to oversee an . auction, and has already begun sounding out potential buyers, according . to Sky News. Founder: Martha Lane Fox, pictured in 2011, was awarded the title of Baroness of Soho in 2013 . It is understood that the US company, which floated on Nasdaq in April, is prepared to accept a substantial loss on the roughly £600million it paid for the company. The sale comes despite an announcement made earlier this year Matthew Crummack, the . company’s relatively new chief executive, that the the . website would be repositioned as a leading mobile website. Lastminute.com was one of the country's most prominent offerings during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, promising customers a new way to book their holidays. It floated on the stock market in 2000 - just two years after it was founded by Oxford graduates Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox. The company was originally listed at 555p on the first day of trading - at that level the company was worth more than £800m. Soon after the dotcom bubble burst, causing internet stocks to plummet. By 2002, shares in the company were trading at just 17p. The deal  with Sabre in 2005 gave the founders just under £40m - nearly £100m less than their shares were worth when the company went public. Hoberman is still very much in the business of making money himself. He is chairman of trendy furniture group Made.com, which is expected to list on the stock market later this year. And he is a board member of music technology firm Shazam, Eton College, TalkTalk and Guardian Media Group. Lane Fox , who last year was made a Baroness, founded karaoke business Lucky Voice and sits on the board at Marks & Spencer. The entrepreneur broke 28 bones in a car accident in Morocco which nearly killed her. The impact smashed her pelvis in six places, shattered her right arm and right leg, caused severe internal bleeding and led to her having a stroke. She was only released from hospital in England after six months of gruelling operations - in total, she had 28 procedures.","Lastminute.com was co-founded by Baroness Lane of Soho in 1998 .

"By . Jaya Narain For Daily Mail . A rapper has been charged with ‘child destruction’ after he is alleged to have punched his pregnant teenage girlfriend in the stomach and she lost her baby. The 16-year-old, who was seven months pregnant, is understood to have screamed out in agony before collapsing in a park. Bystanders called 999 and she was taken to hospital where  she later miscarried. Dusan Bako, 18, thought to be the girl’s boyfriend, was arrested and questioned by police before he was charged with child destruction. He is due to appear before magistrates in Oldham, Greater Manchester, this morning to answer the charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Last night it emerged Bako is an aspiring rapper and musician who travelled from eastern Europe two years ago and settled in Oldham. He features in a number of  videos posted on YouTube, rapping with friends. Police were called to  Copster Hill Park, Oldham (pictured) and the girl - who was seven months pregnant - was taken to hospital,  where she sadly lost her unborn baby. Police said she had been punched in the stomach . Neighbours living close to his home said the unemployed teenager was originally from Slovakia or the Czech Republic, spoke poor English and had a small clique of immigrant friends. He regularly features in amateur recordings and videos. One neighbour said: ‘He has not been living here very long but he has a close circle of friends and we’ve seen him with a girl. He’s into rap music and struts around in all the rap gear. ‘He’s a fairly friendly lad, though. He’s from eastern Europe and may be part of the Roma community but no one really knows.’ Another said: ‘He has a number of close friends and they’re all into rap music – they hope to break into the music business and they record videos and music together – they have even recorded a music video in the park where this happened. ‘Most of the teenagers are unemployed and with nothing better to do they wander round the streets and the park. I think he had a  girlfriend but we hadn’t seen  her recently.’ The alleged incident happened at 3.15pm on Thursday last week when police were called to reports of an assault at Copster Hill Park in Oldham. The . sprawling community area has football pitches, a large children’s play . area with wooden climbing equipment and swings and a bowling green. Police said officers found a 16-year-old girl who had been punched in the stomach. Detective . Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels said: ‘The circumstances surrounding this . are exceptionally tragic. We have specially trained officers supporting . the girl, who is distraught by what happened in a way I cannot begin to . imagine. ‘The . incident happened in a public park in broad daylight and we know from . what people have already said to us that others may have been present in . or around the park who have seen this take place or have information . that can help us with this investigation.’ Dusan Bako, 18, from Oldham, Manchester, is to appear at Oldham Magistrates' Court (pictured) on Monday. He is charged with child destruction after a girl, 16, lost her unborn baby after being punched in the stomach . Police said they were . treating the tragedy as a domestic incident but would not confirm . whether Bako was in a relationship with the teenager or was the father . of the unborn baby. The offence of child destruction came into the statute books with the Infant Life (Preservation) Act of 1929. It states that anyone who intentionally destroys the life of a child capable of being born alive could be found guilty. The law stipulates that the foetus would have to be 28 weeks or older for the charge to be made. In . South Wales in 2012, Carl Whant was convicted of child destruction . after he fatally stabbed Nikitta Grender, who was eight-and-a-half . months pregnant, in the abdomen in February 2011. Whant was also . convicted of raping Miss Grender before murdering her and was given a . life sentence with a minimum jail term of 35 years. A spokesman for . the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales said at the time: ‘Child . destruction is a very rarely used charge; we are not aware of another . case like this one in Wales.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dusan Bako, 18, to appear in court tomorrow charged with child destruction .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Brought it on herself: Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, pictured, has herself to blame for becoming Britain's most hated woman, according to her mother . Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has herself to blame for becoming Britain’s most hated woman, according to her mother. The 23-year-old former escort - who first made headlines when she had a free £4,800 NHS breast enlargement - is ‘sticking up a finger’ at the world because she is an attention-seeker, her mother Lisa Cunningham said. But the shop worker, 50, insisted she is proud of her daughter and that her approach to life is down to the physical and psychological trauma she suffered as a teenager because of her small breasts. Mother-of-two Ms Cunningham told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can see when these things come out of her mouth that more and more people are going to turn against her - and that’s hard. ‘She wants the attention to be on her. She thinks that the notoriety will make her happy. I think she’s just sticking a finger up. ‘Josie is Josie and she’s not a child any more – there’s nothing I can do or say to stop her from doing these things.' Ms Cunningham said that her daughter suffered from a genetic condition when she was younger that meant her breast did not develop properly. She said that until the age of 11, Josie was a quiet and well-behaved little girl, but that for six years she suffered at the hands of bullies - who picked on her because she was flat chested. She said her daughter would come home in tears every day after having been emotionally and physically abused. She added that people would see Joise differently if they understood what she had to go through with bullying and her health. Josie's genetic condition led to serious kidney problems and it was during one hospital visited when she was 17 that she first found out she was pregnant. Miss Cunningham, who is now heavily pregnant with her third child, made headlines again this week when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. The former escort, from Leeds, has set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claims she’s fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. As A-level exam results were released this week, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). Bullied: Lisa Cunningham said that her daughter Josie, pictured shopping earlier this month, was bullied for six years and would come home in tears after being verbally and physically abused at school . 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.' Her mother Lisa was also a stay-at-home mother and said that she never claimed benefits, unlike her daughter. She said that it has become impossible to defend some of her daughter's actions, particularly her decision to smoke while pregnant. When Miss Cunningham was caught smoking and drinking, she said it was because she was disappointed to find out that she was going to have a third boy when she wanted a girl. Her request for a publicly-funded nose job came just a week after Miss Cunningham, whose baby son is due in October, revealed she was giving fans the chance to watch her give birth live on Skype - a move that her mother describes as 'bizarre and weird'. 'Attention seeker': Lisa Cunningham said that she thought her daughter Josie was 'sticking a finger' up at the world . At a cost . of £200 each, 50 people will be able to log on to the video chat service . and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. The . wannabe model has already scooped a staggering £30,000 by selling four . ringside seats to the birth of her third child at her home in Leeds. Three . of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is . believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each. Miss . Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the . more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and . take photos. She . formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes of selling DVDs of the . birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through. Miss Cunningham has previously admitted that she doesn't know who the father of the child is and will have to wait until her son is born to have the two potential fathers take DNA tests. Her mother said that she has her suspicions as to who the baby's father is, but refuses to name him publicly. She added that she didn't have a problem with Josie's life as an escort because she didn't think that she was sleeping with her clients. But she said that even though she now knows the truth, she would still support Josie if she wanted to return to the lifestyle after the birth of her first child. As well as the £4,800 NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has also undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.","Lisa Cunningham said her daughter Josie is 'sticking a finger' at the world .

"By . Tamara Cohen for the Daily Mail . Kevin Lee, who helps to manage the office of Labour MP Andy Burnham (pictured), is paid through a private company - an arrangement used to avoid tax . Labour is under fire for employing a senior adviser on an ‘off payroll’ arrangement which is often used to avoid tax. Kevin Lee, who manages the office of shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, is not on a typical staff contract but is paid through his own private company. These sorts of deals have been criticised by Labour, because they allow both the employee and the employer to get out of paying National Insurance contributions. If Mr Lee - who worked at HM Revenue and Customs in the 1990s – was paying himself out of company dividends, he could also avoid income tax and just pay Corporation Tax at a lower rate. These arrangements are legal but Margaret Hodge, a Labour grandee and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has lambasted the widespread use of them at the BBC and in Whitehall. She said two years ago: ‘If you work in the public service, its beholden on you to lead by example. Hardworking families up and down the country are paying lots of money in tax and its wrong that individuals working in the public service whose money comes from the tax those families pay aren’t paying their due share. ‘I do think that it’s an issue which somehow people got away with in better times, but now in the austerity era its obviously hugely important that every penny due is collected.’ A Labour party spokesman said they ‘do not comment on staffing matters’. Mr Lee, through the party, denied the pay arrangement for the last two years was for financial gain. One other – unidentified - political adviser, to a different MP, is understood to have similar arrangements. Both Mr Lee and the other adviser and are being moved onto staff contracts this year. Mr Lee, 50, is a former Labour party staffer who ran Mr Burnham’s failed leadership bid, and loaned money to it, in 2010. He was hired to head Mr Burnham’s office in October 2011, for two-and-a-half days a week, paid for by the Labour party. The arrangement is legal but has previously been lambasted by Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee and Labour grandee . The rest of the week he worked for Hazel Blears MP, and was paid for that by Ipsa which regulates MP’s expenses. Party sources said his off-payroll status dates back to when he worked for both MPs, and it is an anomaly which was not rectified when he went full-time with Mr Burnham in summer 2012. When he was appointed, Mr Lee’s job with Andy Burnham was attacked as a ‘huge conflict of interest’ because his PR firm – Lee Communications and Public Affairs – had several NHS trusts as clients. His LinkedIn page boasts of his ‘political acumen, excellent public affairs knowledge, and significant experience and understanding of stakeholder engagement with politicians.’ A Tory source said: ‘Labour want to put up National Insurance and hit families and businesses across the country – so it’s pretty galling that they don’t want to pay it for their own employees. ‘This is yet another classic case of Labour saying one thing and doing another. Burnham should apologise.’ Danny Cox head of financial planning at Hargreaves Lansdown explained: ‘Charging fees through a service company is far more tax efficient than being self-employed. ‘This is primarily because the employee pays some or all of their own salary in dividends – which are subject to a lower rate of income tax and no employee or employer national insurance.’","Kevin Lee, adviser in Andy Burnham's office, has 'off payroll' arrangement .

According to Ms Cummings, the whales began appearing close to the shore over the weekend. Before Sunday the closest they would come to shore was about 100 yards but now it has been more like 50 yards. In another photo a whale pops out to say hello to a mother and her daughter walking along the beach in Monterey Bay . Friendly: Before Sunday the closest they would come to shore was about 100 yards but now it has been more like 50 yards . A humpback whale lunge-feeding on anchovies off Salinas River State Beach, south side of the Moss Landing Harbor in Monterey Bay . According to Ms Cummings, the whales began appearing close to the shoreline over the weekend to feed on anchovies . Ms Cummings said this might be because anchovies had begun to bunch up closer to the shoreline. She told GrindTV: 'I think it has to do with the calmness of the ocean and the tides, plus the anchovies trying to seek refuge in shallow water—to no avail. 'The last few days our routine has been to first check out the whales lunge-feeding on anchovies along the beach, then head out a mile-and-a-half to groups of 10 to 12 humpbacks feeding together with hundreds of sea lions. 'The whales have drawn a crowd at the beach, and I was hoping she’d come up near a beachgoer for a sense of scale. The alert dog was a bonus.' Humpback whales are known for their magical songs, which travel for great distances through the world's oceans. These sequences of moans, howls, cries, and other noises are quite complex and often continue for hours on end. Scientists are studying these sounds to decipher their meaning. It is most likely that humpbacks sing to communicate with others and to attract potential mates. Mothers and their young swim close together, often touching one another with their flippers with what appear to be gestures of affection. Calves do not stop growing until they are ten years old. Humpbacks are powerful swimmers, and they use their massive tail fin, called a fluke, to propel themselves through the water.","The amazing image was captured on Sunday by Kate Cummings of the Blue Ocean Whale Watch .

An MP’s wife who gained thousands of Twitter followers after posting a number of selfies showing off her cleavage has taken to social media once again to reveal before-and-after bikini shots. Karen Danczuk, 31, who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47, has uploaded two photos of her posing in swimwear for her 6,000 followers. In one shot, the mother-of-two can be seen leaning over the poolside in a blue bikini while another shows her smiling to the camera in a one-piece. The social media lover has posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage, and about 40 images alone since the beginning of July. She accompanied the latest photo of herself in a bikini with the caption: ‘#throwbackthursday - enjoyed my mini break to Spain! Beautiful country, beautiful weather! KD’. It was followed up a day later with a more recent photograph of herself in a swimming costume, with the message: ‘Absolutely love this swimming costume!!! It’s a little quirky an extravagant but I love it!!!!’ It is not the first time that Mrs Danczuk, a councillor in Rochdale, has attracted national attention by posting images of herself online.

I’m not silly. I’m not a crazy party animal. I’m not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I’m quite a tomboy. ‘Not all my tops are low-necked. I don’t wear short dresses — all my dresses are knee-length. Gosh, I’ve seen more flesh in the supermarket than I have in my photos.’ She also claimed her husband was proud of her newfound attention, something which he reiterated by reposting her online tweets with the caption: ‘‘Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!’ The pair married in 2012 and have two sons together, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.

"By . Beci Wood . Ryan Giggs proved class is permanent with a delicious chip in a charity match. The Manchester United legend called time on his 23-year playing career in May but showed he's not lost any of his skill with a sublimely cheeky effort. The former Class of 92 were joined by celebrity friends for a fund-raising match against the Salford City team that Giggs now co-owns with Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. He's still got it: Ryan Giggs proves he's still a force to be reckoned with in charity match . Elegant: Paul Scholes showed composure in midfield but couldn't stop the Class of '92 going down 5-1 . And when trailing 2-0 to the Evo-Stick League Division One North side it was Giggs who stepped up and took responsibility when his side were awarded a penalty. The superb 'Paneka' effort was similar to the one Andrea Pirlo scored against England in Euro 2012. All the money generated by the match goes directly to Salford City, and Giggs was delighted to get back in action to help raise funds. Classy chip: Salford City goalkeeper is grounded as Giggs' effort floats over him . 'I couldn't turn down the opportunity of putting the boots on with the lads again,' Giggs said. 'It's for a good cause, it's a great way of raising the profile and for keeping fit as well. 'I grew up in Salford and a lot of the lads plied their trade there when they were young, so we've all got affiliations. 'It's a great way of hopefully putting something back.

'If we wanted glamour we wouldn't be doing this but we're getting a lot of benefits and a lot of happiness from what we're doing at the moment.' The new owners have ambitions of getting Salford into the Football League, and Butt - who, unlike Phil Neville, is retaining a place on the United coaching staff along with Giggs - said: 'We all have dreams. We all think we can go as high as we can. 'We think it is a city that deserves a Football League club. If we can get there, who knows how high we can take it?

"By . Candace Sutton . and Sarah Dean . and Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . Friends of Gable Tostee - who is charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright - have said they will stand by the 28-year-old no matter what. In a Facebook post the Gold Coast man's mate Tony Ongart has vowed that 'no matter how much hate' Tostee gets, he will stick by his friend. 'No matter how much hate from the media our mate gets, we always stick by our mates till the end including Gable Tostee', Ongart wrote. 'There is no physical evidence that accuses him of being guilty. So go hate as much as you want, we dont care, it wont change our decision. Scroll down for video . Warriena Wright died after falling 14 floors from a Gold Coast apartment where Gable Tostee lived . Tostee was arrested on Friday on the Gold Coast and charged with murder . 'In all these years hes stuck by us, and has never been a violent person. So we will back him up the whole way'. The post was flooded with hundreds of comments - and some people posted conversations they had with Tostee declaring they believed him to be innocent. Others discussed the media's involvement in the case, the evidence which had come forward - and defended his innocence. This comes as police investigating the balcony fall death of Ms Wright are reportedly drawing comparisons from a 1986 murder case where a woman plunged from a sixth floor window after her boyfriend attacked her. Goldcoast bodybuilder Gable Tostee was arrested on Friday and charged with Ms Wright's murder after she fell from the 14th-floor balcony of his apartment after they reportedly met on mobile dating app Tinder. The 28-year-old has maintained he is innocent and intends to plead not guilty, his lawyer has said. Police are looking at the Sydney case of Kim William Royall, who was found guilty of girlfriend Kelly Healey's murder because she fell while trying to escape his violent clutches, for clues in Tostee's case, the Courier Mail reports. This weekend, The Sunday Mail claimed evidence has emerged which shows Ms Wright was desperately trying to escape from Tostee's apartment just moments before plunging to her death. The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'No, no, no … I just want to go home.' A Gold Coast Fire Rescue cherry picker  collects forensic evidence from the outside of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise flat, from which Warriena Wright fell to her death . Police will allege she was attempting to climb down to the balcony below to escape Tostee when she fell to her death . Audio recordings from mobile phones found in a car in the building's basement are believed to be the lead detectives were looking for to arrest Tostee on Friday. Police will allege Ms Wright and Tostee first met in person at Cavill Mall about 9pm on August 7. Witnesses claim they heard a woman screaming 'I just want to go home' early on Friday August 8. Tostee hid in the building's foyer as police arrived at his apartment, CCTV footage obtained by police reportedly shows. His lawyer, Michael Purcell, says Tostee maintains he is not guilty of the murder and will be applying for bail. 'My client maintains his innocence and we look forward to the provision of a brief of evidence so we can move on with the court process,' he said. Audio recordings obtained by police allegedly reveal Ms Wright was fearing for her life . The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'NO, no, no ... I just want to go home,' 'I've got instructions to make an application to the Supreme Court for bail in the weeks to come.' Gold Coast regional crime squad commander, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, said there were two people in the apartment prior to Ms Wright's fall - 'Mr Tostee and Warriena'. Ms Wright, a New Zealand bank worker, was near the end of a two-week trip to the Gold Coast for a friend's wedding when she met her fate. Tostee has been remanded in custody until October 10 for the murder of Ms Wright. He did not appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning - the day after he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - and Magistrate John Costanzo adjourned Tostee's matter until October 10. It will be alleged Tostee hid behind a pillar as police surrounded Ms Wright's body . Tostee was escorted to the Gold Coast watch house by detectives in black suits . Tostee's family were also not present in court on Saturday. In the week leading up to Tostee's arrest, detectives kept his flat as a crime scene while they made extensive forensic examinations of the unit. On Wednesday, police in a cherry picker were raised up the Avalon building to take forensic samples from the outside of the balcony and other apartments on the way down. Days later, detectives arrested Tostee at his parents' Carrara home on the Gold Coast and took him to the Southport watchhouse, where he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - exactly a week after she plummeted to her death.

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . Daniel Fing has been named as the man at the centre of an investigation after explosives were discovered in a Queensland home . Police have found maps in a Queensland house pointing to possible bombing targets as well as more than 50 kilograms of chemicals used to make explosives. One of the sheets found at the property included a road map with an arrow pointing to the corner of George and Rawson Street in the Sydney CBD,  an intersection which lies just a few hundred metres from Sydney's Central Station. The word uniform was also apparently scrawled on the same piece of paper, a possible reference to the Uniform And Kitchenette shop nearby. On a second map was written 'brothel', 'grave', and 'bridge'  - which could be read as clues to a location on Sandgate Road in Newcastle, two hours north of Sydney. The maps and liquid explosives were discovered on Monday at a property Daniel Fing was renting in Pullenvale,15 kilometres west of Brisbane, which has since been abandoned, according to Nine News. When contacted a Queensland Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's an ongoing investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment at this time.' Fing, 30, is in police custody, and is now at the centre of a joint investigation. Scroll down for video . On Monday police discovered maps pointing to possible bombing targets at a property in Pullenvale, Queensland . Officers found the documents during a search on the house where they previously uncovered more than 50 kilograms of explosives . Last week officers were detonating bomb-making material at the Pullenvale property after an array of chemicals - some highly unstable - were found. Red Cedar Road was closed off for nearly 48 hours while officers carried out detonations. The quantity and type of materials found were alarming to officers, and they are currently assessing whether there was a plot to carry out any attacks in place. The whole street where the property lies was closed off while officers detonated explosives last week . The alleged mastermind behind this possible attack on Sydney's bustling CBD bombed the car of his ex-girlfriend's lover in 2006, while it was parked at a Newcastle McDonalds. The car and the one beside it was completely destroyed, but the owner escaped unharmed, the Newcastle Herald reported. Fing pleaded guilty and was charged just one day before he was due to be released on parole for unrelated explosives charges. In 2011, Fing was the victim of an alleged drive-by shooting. His father ,Trevor Fing, is a convicted serial fraud. Fing has a previous conviction relating to explosives and blew up the car of an ex-girlfriend's lover in 2006 .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Ordeal: Vikki Webb lost her father in May 2011. His lung cancer was only discovered when pain in his hips became so severe he paid for a private scan . The postcode lottery is killing 6,000 cancer patients prematurely each year, it was claimed yesterday. Around 6,000 more could live for at least 12 months after a cancer diagnosis every year if the average survival rate for England matched the top 10 per cent of local healthcare areas. Figures show the proportion dying within a year of a cancer diagnosis is two-thirds higher in the worst-performing areas of the country than the best. Almost four in ten cancer patients in Barking and Dagenham, Essex, die within just 12 months, compared with one in four in North East Hampshire, says the charity Macmillan Cancer Support. It has published estimates of variations in cancer care drawn from official data on cancer survival rates for 2011-2013. The assessment follows warnings by MPs of a postcode lottery meaning that in some areas, five times as many patients are waiting more than two weeks to see a specialist. A recent study of 35 countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found only Poland has worse survival rates than Britain for breast, bowel and cervical cancers. The latest analysis showed the number of people dying within a year of being diagnosed was almost 60 per cent higher in Barking and Dagenham than North East Hampshire – where only 24 per cent of cancer patients do not survive for 12 months. In Barking and Dagenham, 38 per cent of people diagnosed die within a year, a figure matched by Crawley, West Sussex; Newham, London; Swale, Kent; Vale Royal, Cheshire and Thanet, Kent. Wealthier parts of London and the South East are among the best-performing areas, including Westminster – where 27 per cent of people die within a year – and Richmond, Surrey, where the figure is 28 per cent. Well-performing: Wealthier parts of London are among the best-performing areas of the country, including Westminster (pictured), where 27 per cent of people die of breast, bowel and cervical cancers within a year . Contrast: In Barking and Dagenham (pictured), 38 per cent of people diagnosed with cancer die within a year . Experts say the alarming divide could be due to variations in how promptly patients are diagnosed and treated. Areas with the poorest survival rates are, on average, failing to meet a key NHS target which aims to ensure cancer patients begin treatment within 62 days following an urgent referral from their GP. Macmillan points out that there are regional variations in opening times of diagnostic units and availability of experienced staff. Its research also shows people do not always recognise the signs and symptoms of the disease, and may delay seeking help. If people do go to their GP early with cancer symptoms, these are sometimes not picked up by doctors, who may wait longer than necessary before referring someone to a specialist. The figures show that of the 80 per cent of cancer patients who saw their GP with symptoms before going to hospital, 17 per cent saw them three or four times. One in ten saw their GP five or more times. Juliet Bouverie, director of services and influencing at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the figures show ‘an inexcusable postcode lottery, which is responsible for 6,000 people dying needlessly within 12 months of being diagnosed with cancer every year’. Auditor Vikki Webb, 34, from Manchester, described the ordeal suffered by her father, Ade, who died in May 2011 aged 58. He had been diagnosed with lung cancer just eight weeks previously. The former nursing home owner visited his GP several times with a persistent cough, but was told he had bronchitis and given repeated courses of antibiotics. His cancer was only discovered when pain in his hips became so severe he paid for a private scan. His daughter said: ‘He had a persistent and very nasty cough for about 18 months before he died. ‘Despite being a heavy smoker for over 30 years, and being slap in the middle of the average age to develop lung cancer, he wasn’t offered a scan.’","Proportion of cancer patients dying within a year is higher in certain areas .

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . Footage has emerged of an attempted arrest gone wrong after officers were called to a street in south Melbourne. At the weekend police responded to complaints of young teenagers riding around on motorbikes at Hastings, a suburb of the Mornington Peninsula about 75 kilometres south of Melbourne's CBD. A group of boys were allegedly driving trail bikes in a dangerous matter, and others apparently threw objects at police when they arrived. Scroll down for video . A Melbourne teenager has accused a police officer of using excessive force during an attempted arrest . One senior constable attempted to arrest a 14-year-old boy, but the teenager claims the officer used excessive force during the ordeal and fled the scene. 'Well he walked up to me and he grabbed me off my motorbike by the ear and he dragged me over', alleged victim Beau Howroyd told Seven News. Video shows the officer trying to get Beau - who is kicking and screaming - into the police car. Beau Howroyd told Seven News a senior constable dragged him by the ear . Police were responding to complaints of a group of teens driving motorbikes dangerously . A friend of the teen, identified as Shaun Lyndon, then appears to grab his mate back from the police as another officer gets involved in the struggle. A tug-of-war of sorts then takes place, and the officer can be heard telling Sean: 'Let him go. He's in my custody let him go.' The pair then ran from the officers and Shaun told the program the police were 'slinging him (Beau) around like a little rag doll.' Beau's friend Shaun tried to intervene and the pair then fled from police . Police are yet to speak to Beau over the incident, and earlier this month the 14-year-old was fined for riding a motorbike without a helmet. A criminal investigation is said to be underway but not one into police conduct. According to Vic Roads in Victoria powered two-wheel vehicle riders account for 15 percent of all deaths and serious injuries on the state's roads, despite making up less than five percent of registered vehicles. Dirt bikes can be ridden on private property in most states of Australia without being registered or licenced but laws differ when they are driven on public roads.

"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . Australians will be given a rare, real insight to the World War One experience through a new documentary series, which uses the diaries, letters and speeches written by six Australians, telling stories using their own words - bringing them back to life 100 years after the Great War began. The War That Changed Us gives a fresh insight to war, telling the untold, true stories of the people. On the centenary of the beginning of WWI, Australians are given an opportunity to connect with six Australians who were struggling with war, either on frontline or waiting at home. Historians and film makers were both involved to create the four-part ABC 'dramatised documentary', creating storylines that are 100 per cent based on documented evidence. Episode one: 'Answering the Call: 1914-1915' airs on ABC on Tuesday 19 August at 8.30pm. Scroll down for video . A photograph of Archie Barwick from 1919. Barwick is played by Myles Pollard in 'The War That Changed Us'. Archie Barwick was 24 years old when he left Australia to fight in the war. Myles Pollard in his role as Archie Barwick in the World War One dramatised documentary, The War That Changed Us . Australian actor Luke Hewitt at World War I memorial, Australian Memorial Park, Fromelles, on August 4 - the very day World War I began. Hewitt plays Lieutenant Colonel ""Pompey Elliott"" in the dramatised documentary 'The War That Changed Us' Historian, Dr Clare Wright was crucial to ensure the screenplay accurately captures the true individual human experiences of war. ‘(This series) is about having a sense of empathy and connection with the characters, especially as they represent a number of experiences of the war. It shows a complex picture of what it was like to be a part of that wartime society,’ said Dr Wright. 'As it is a documentary, we stay between the bounds of fact. We can't make things up that didn't happen. But luckily, the truth is often stranger than fiction!' explains Dr Wright. 'Stories are very powerful in their real incarnation.' Historian Dr Clare Wright was crucial to telling the stories of six Australians wartime experiences in their own words, in this groundbreaking documentary . The characterisation of the six main personas is entirely based on their own word, using 'diaries, letters and correspondence, as well as the speeches they made, the public record they left, newspapers and archive research.' ‘We found characters that left descriptive, detailed archives behind them. We needed to tell their own story. We see the war as they saw it, feel like they felt. It’s not a contemporary reading or what we think they have felt or experienced. We’re actually put in their shoes to see the war play out in real time.’ The personal accounts of war are some of the most frank, emotional and sensory descriptions of six very different war experiences. We are intimately acquainted with three men and three women, all engaged in the war in different ways, including those at war, those waiting at home, and those that fiercely opposed not only war, but conscription. The War That Changed Us: The actors in character. The documentary uses the actors to tell the true stories of six Australians, using the exact words of the people represented. The screenplay was created using the detailed, emotional accounts the six people each left of their wartime experiences. ‘We looked at the way the way war changed the six people as individuals and how the whole country changes,’ Said Dr Wright . ‘War was part of the daily fabric of everyone’s lives, everyone was touched by war.’ Dr Wright worked with the series’ director, Don Featherstone to write the screenplay, which she calls ‘a close and positive collaborative experience to bring two backgrounds and skills together.’ ‘He is a professional in film and television and a magnificent storyteller. I could bring my own expertise and experience as a historian and that was a really wonderful working relationship,’ said Dr Wright. The primary sources that carry the story are ‘vivid, detailed and consistent,’ giving a rare insight into not only the events that took place, but how the people involved felt during the terrifying, brutal war that claimed more than 40,000 lives between 1914 and 1918. An image of Myles Pollard as Archie Barwick for the ABC four-part series The War That Changed Us. The first episode airs on Tuesday, 19 August at 8.30pm . Two of the characters include 24-year-old soldier Archie barwick, played by Myles Pollard, and Lieutenant Colonel “Pompey” Elliott, re-enacted by Luke Hewitt. Archie left a diary which is described as one of the top five war accounts. ‘Archie Barwick wrote in his diary from a trench in Gallipoli. We hear his own words as he talks about his feelings. Just like Archie, we don’t know what the next day or even minute might hold for him. He knows and we know that death might be imminent,’ said Dr Wright. In the diary, Archie wrote: . ‘Everything in this diary is true and anyone reading it can believe what’s written. I hope all at home can find something of interest for them, for that is the reason that I’m writing it. ‘My job will be to bring it home safely.’ 'Archie' prepared to repel Turkish attack in a scene from The War That Changed Us . Luke Hewitt, who brought husband and father Pompey back to life, is currently in Europe, visiting Australian World War I memorials in Begium and North Eastern France on the anniversary of the breakout of the war 100 years ago. ‘Standing at the memorial sites that was the overwhelming question...why? I know there are complicated political and Empirical answers to that question,  but I could not think of a simple one. ‘I feel extremely fortunate to have this opportunity… It was an overwhelmingly emotional day, to stand on the very ground where so many thousands of Australians lost their lives during this conflict. It gave us (my wife and I) both pause to reflect on the futility of war and how little we seem to learn from it.’ A portrait of ""Pompey"" Elliott (left) and Luke Elliott (right) the actor who brings him to life in the new ABC documentary series . Luke Hewitt read extensively to understand the real “Pompey”, and was moved by the words that remain for us to remember a man that time may otherwise have forgotten. ‘I read everything I could get my hands on. Much of it, historical accounts and journals of his war service. 'The best preparation I found was reading a biography written by Ross McMullin called ""Pompey Elliott"" which was full of Pompey's own words, letters home to his wife and children, accounts of him by soldiers who served under him and reports and communications on the battles he was engaging in.’ Luke Hewitt in character as Pompey Elliott and his young family. Historian Dr Ross McMullin was involved in the series and agrees that Pompey’s written words reveal him to be a complex, compelling man. ‘I was blown away reading the diaries and letters of Pompey Elliott. He was very frank and forthright – he called a spade a bloody shovel! As a commander he was tempestuous, controversial but outstandingly successful. ‘But his letters underline how much he loved and cared (for his family) and lamented the fact that duty as he saw it lead him away from them for five years,' said Dr McMullin. Pompey’s correspondence with his wife are a treasure when it comes to understanding the impact of the war. ‘Pompey's letters with his wife Kate are extraordinary. He had arranged with Kate to have a no-secrets pact in their correspondence while they were apart, so the letters are frank and illuminating.' Luke Hewitt as Major General Harold Edward ""Pompey"" Elliott . Mr Hewitt was moved by passages of Pompey’s writing. ‘After the fateful battle of Fromelles (Pompey) stood in the trenches, tears streaming down his face shaking the hand of every soldier returning from the fight and saying ""I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."". 'And although he was the consumate soldier, his letters home to his wife and children were extremely emotional and loving - yet graphic regarding the nature of the conflict. He was a very complicated man.' ‘Reading the personal accounts, not only from Pompey but from others at that time, gives you a connection to the emotion they were feeling. The sounds, the smells, the existence they were forced to endure comes alive. I think it allows you to perhaps imagine yourself in their place. In playing the role of ""Pompey"", studying his letters and visiting memorials, Luke Hewitt still cannot make sense of the 'futility' of war and enormous loss and tragedy that occurred, despite it being 100 years since the war began. In revisiting the past, Dr Wright, hoped to complicate people's understanding of WWI. 'The further we are from historical events, the simpler they are and it’s easier to make sense of it. It’s important to realise that the people in those times, like us, found it hard to understand or make sense of the events. It helps us empathise with World War One.' Hewitt, in engaging with the stories of World War One, believes there is no sense can be made of the hurt, destruction and loss that occurred during the war. 'Yes. I have a greater understanding now of how the war effected not only those away fighting, but those at home. 60,000 telegrams delivered to families advising them that there loved one was gone. '156,000 telegrams delivered advising their husband, son, brother was wounded or worse taken prisoner. What a fearful 4 years, 3 months and 1 week they must have been. Waiting.' Australians may find some of the experiences and messages of the film are far too relevant to our own lives. ‘We realise in revisiting this time in history that we don’t always learn from the lessons of the past,’ said Dr Wright.","A new Austalian series uses the words of Australians involved in WWI to tell the stories of six different experiences of war .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . When Mercedes Talamante mysteriously doubled in weight, she thought it was just a sign she was getting old. But after weeks of nagging from her daughter, she finally went to see a doctor - who found she actually had a 132lb tumour. The huge growth, thought to be the largest tumour of its kind, had developed on the Mexican woman's ovaries and was almost half her weight. The huge 132lb tumour - the largest ovarian growth ever -  was removed from Mercedes Talamante . Surgeons spent four hours operating on Ms Talamante, who almost doubled in weight when the tumour grew . Ms Talamante, 51, had become depressed because of her appearance and thought she had put on the weight because she was aging, but her daughter, Maria, convinced her she was sick. The ovarian tumour grew for five years until it was almost half of her total body weight, with the Mexican woman barely able to move for the last 24 months. Before the tumour started growing she weighed 143lbs, but by the time Ms Talamante got to the operating table in late July this year the scales tipped to 275lbs. Moises Aaron Nunez, the director of Cabo San Lucas hospital, in north-western Mexico, said operating on such massive ovarian tumour was unheard of. He said: 'We could not find any example of an ovarian tumour this big. There was no precedent anywhere in the world.' Ms Talamante only went to see a doctor because of weeks of nagging from her concerned daughter . Ms Talamante said at a press conference that she felt like she was 'walking on air' after the surgery . Dr Gilberto Inzulza led the surgical team who successfully removed the tumour, saying the procedure took four hours. At a joint press conference with the doctor, Ms Talamante thanked the medical team. She said: 'I feel like a new woman. In fact after the surgery when I took my first steps, I felt like I was walking on air.' She added that the first thing she planned to do when she got home was to go out with her daughter whose good advice saved her life.","Mercedes Talamante doubled in weight but thought it was just sign of aging .

The free service uses text messages so it can be used by people without a smartphone and in areas without an internet connection. It was invented by Stephan Boyer, in San Francisco to keep his girlfriend safe. The 23-year old MIT computer science graduate told Elle.com: 'My girlfriend, who lives in a dangerous neighbourhood in San Francisco, called to ask me to check up on her as she was walking home from work one day. 'I wondered if there might be an app or service that could offer a little extra safety for her when she goes out at night.' Anyone wanting to use the service can set up an account on Kitestring’s website, where they enter their phone number plus an emergency contact, as well as writing an alert message which will be sent to their chosen contact when needed. To use the service, people schedule a time and date for when they plan to be out and estimate how long they will be. The free 'safecall' service uses text messages so it can be used by people without a smartphone and in areas without an internet connection. To begin using the service, people have to create an account online and add contacts (pictured) which will be alerted by text in an emergency . To use the service, people schedule a time and date for when they plan to be out and estimate how long they will be. This can be done online (pictured) and via text message . Kitestring is a personal safety service, self-described as an 'overprotective mom'. How does it work? Users can ask Kitestring to check up on them at a specified time in the future and it will text them to make sure they’re safe. A user must reply to the message - or check in on the website - and all is well. If they don’t check in, Kitestring alerts their emergency contacts. It is possible to extend a trip or start a new trip if a user will be much later than they planned. Extra security: People can set up a password to stop savvy attackers pretending to be them. A ‘secret duress code’ can also be used to send an alert message to emergency contacts in a moment of peril.Cost: The basic version is free for 8 trips a month and there is no app to download. For £2 a month, people can make unlimited trips and have multiple emergency contacts. They can also customise their check-in period. Compatibility: The service uses text messages so it works on any mobile phone in 217 countries. They can text Kitestring a duration like ‘45m’ to start a trip, for example, or click on options on the company's website. When that time has passed, Kitestring sends a text message asking for confirmation that the person is safe. Users can . extend a trip by testing ‘ETA 15m’ for example, to receive another . text 15 minutes later, or can start another new trip if they expect to later than an hour after they originally said. Their . emergency contact or contacts are alerted with a distress message if the service . doesn’t hear back from a user within five minutes of checking up on them . with a text message. This time frame can be altered by premium users who pay £2 a month for multiple emergency contacts and other extras. But if someone’s phone battery runs flat, contacts will still be notified, which could cause unnecessary panic. This is because the ‘notifications system runs on our servers and does not depend on your phone being available,’ the company says. Because the service works using text messages, it makes itself useable by more people than previous ‘safecall’ apps for smartphones, which often rely on an internet connection and GPS. Kitestring works in 217 countries, which could also make it handy for backpackers and other holidaymakers exploring a new area on their own. When that time has passed, Kitestring sends a text message asking for confirmation that the person is safe. This is one suggested by the service . The service could be sued by backpackers in far flung places, or simply by people walking home in the dark (illustrated), meeting someone for the first time or when travelling through dubious neighborhoods where they feel unsafe. Unlike other services, Kitestring only needs basic mobile reception to send and receive a text .","Kitestring sends emergency contacts a text message if a user does not reply to a 'check in' message on their phone .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . For decades, food items have been touted as substitutes to expensive household cleaning products. And now a cleaning expert has revealed the science behind why certain foods are so useful for tackling rust, removing stains and tightening cracks in wood. This ranges from potatoes, banana skins, brazil nuts, vinegar to mayonnaise. A cleaning expert has revealed which food items can be used as substitutes to expensive cleaning products, and also the science behind why they are so effective. For example, potatoes are effective at removing rust because the oxalic acid reacts with baking soda to dissolve the hydrated iron oxides . Bananas: Wipe the inside of the banana skin on the spot of leather that needs to be cleaned. When finished, rub with a damp cloth. Cola: Pour into the toilet bowl and leave to sit for an hour to allow the acid to take effect. Clean the inside of the bowl with a toilet brush and flush away. Vinegar also works. Tomato ketchup: Good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. Rub onto the area that needs cleaning, leave to work and wipe with a moist cloth. Mayonnaise: Ideal for removing marks on wood. Use a cloth with a small amount of mayonnaise and wipe the mark that needs to be removed. Leave the oils to work and wipe away any residue with a clean cloth. Brazil Nuts: Also effective on wood surfaces. Cut a nut in half and rub vigorously over any scratches. Potatoes: Cut the potato in half and dip the side without peel into baking soda. When covered, firmly rub the potato on rusted areas. Grapefruit: Remove limescale by cutting the grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. Scrub the area and rinse with water. Coffee: Place dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid. Place in the fridge and leave to eliminate odour. For example, Alex Depledge, chief executive of cleaning site Hassle.com told MailOnline that tomato ketchup is good for cleaning brass, copper and silver elements. 'Tarnishing mainly occurs due to sulphur compounds in the air. 'When the ketchup is applied to the metal, the natural acid in the tomatoes reacts with the oxidising of the tarnished silver, brass or copper.' 'Potatoes and baking soda are effective at tackling rust because the oxalic acid in the potato mixes with the baking soda to help to dissolve the rust,' said Mrs Depledge. Even the weakest levels of acid can dissolve and loosen the hydrated iron oxides found in rust. This also means vinegar is a good rust remover. These foods can also replace the rust with a thin film of smooth hard oxide on the surface of the iron, to help it resist further hydrated oxidation. Phosphoric acid in cola drinks, and citric acid in lemon juice also work. 'Banana skins are often used to buff leather, followed by a damp cloth, and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches,' Mrs Depledge continued. Potassium is often found in shoe polishes too, for the same reason. 'Ideal for removing marks on wood, mayonnaise contains oils and proteins that gently diminish scratches and marks on wood. 'They also react and cause the wood to swell, which tightens cracks in surface.

'The oils in Brazil nuts are also effective and act like a natural die to darken and hide scratches.' Elsewhere, Mrs Depledge added: 'To keep a fridge smelling fresh, experts claim putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours. 'Smelly substances floating around in the air attach themselves to the surface of coffee beans via a process known as ‘adsorption'. 'Invisible to the naked eye the many tiny pores in a coffee bean create a large surface area, per unit mass. To keep a fridge smelling fresh, the expert claims putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours. Smelly substances in the air attach themselves to the surface of coffee beans via a process known as ‘adsorption' 'This gives, in chemical terms, plenty of area for the smell to adhere itself to and causes it to be cancelled out.' As a subsititute to limescale remover, Mrs Depledge recommends cutting a grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt. The salt acts like an exfoliator to remove the surface limescale, while the citric acid in grapefruit acts as the cleaning agent and breaks down the scale at a more molecular level. And cola drinks are an effective toilet cleaner because they contains carbonic, citric, and phosphoric acids. Many of these acids are found in household cleaning products already, and when mixed together, the reaction causes the stains to be lifted and removed.","Cleaning experts from London-based Hassle.com have revealed which food items can be used as substitutes to expensive cleaning products .

"By . Tania Steere for the Daily Mail . A hospital could face a huge compensation bill after it hired a private firm to remove cataracts and half the patients treated suffered complications. Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton hired private provider Vanguard in May to help reduce a backlog. But the hospital terminated the contract after only four days after 31 of the 62 patients who had the operation reported complications including blurred vision, pain and swelling. Musgrove Park Hospital, pictured, could face a huge compensation bill after it hired a private firm to remove cataracts and half the patients treated suffered complications . One 84-year-old man claimed he has lost his sight and his family is calling for a full independent inquiry. Some of the patients, including the 84-year-old man, have contacted lawyers to discuss seeking compensation, which raises the prospect of an NHS hospital picking up the bill for procedures done by a private health company. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust refused to talk in detail or discuss pay-outs when approached by The Guardian Newspaper, but a senior member of staff told the local newspaper that the hospital would be liable for any payments. Colin Close, Musgrove Park’s medical director, told the Somerset Country Gazette: ‘Any financial responsibility would rest with us. ‘If any patients wish to pursue compensation, we would work with them.’ He added: ‘We still don’t know exactly what the cause is – we’re trying to identify that at the moment. There could be a range of causes.’ Vanguard Healthcare Solutions, which carried out some of the procedures, said patient care was the number one priority and they were fully investigating the root causes of any complications (stock image) Dr Close said he would normally expect one in 400 patients to experience these complications. A spokesman for Musgrove Park told The Guardian: ‘Due to the ongoing nature of our investigations it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the sequence of events surrounding the unfortunate complications experienced by our patients receiving cataract surgery with Vanguard Healthcare in their mobile theatre onsite at Musgrove Park hospital. ‘Our first and foremost concern has always been our patients, and particularly those who have experienced complications. 'We have been in very close contact with them since the incident to ensure they are fully informed with our progress and receive the highest quality aftercare and treatment. 'We will want to discuss the outcomes of our investigations with them first, once they have reached conclusion.’ Ian Gillespie, chief executive of Vanguard Healthcare Solutions, said: ‘Patient care is our number one priority and we’re working closely with the trust to understand and fully investigate the root causes of any complications. ‘This investigation is still ongoing, making it inappropriate to comment on specific issues or on individual patient cases. 'Operations were carried out in Vanguard’s operating theatre by highly qualified surgeons, approved by the hospital, and with many years’ experience of working in the NHS.’","Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton could face huge compensation bill .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It's the ideal solution for commuters - a full size bicycle which fits into a bag and is assembled in less than ten minutes. Commuters struggling to fit their fold-up bikes on trains will instead be able to carry a normal-sized bike to work with them in a small backpack the size of a tyre. On arrival, all they need to do is attach the various aluminium hollow tubes together from simple twist joints - including the wheels. Commuter's dream:  This full-size prototype bicycle fits into a bag and is assembled in under ten minutes . And the chain is different to most bikes in that it uses a rubber belt drive system reinforced with carbon, while to brake you simply stop pedalling. Amit Mirchandani, a creative director at Indian creative agency Lucid Design, helped come up with the design because he wanted to make a full-size but compact carrying bike. The result is the Kit Bike - designed to take out the awkward nature of fold-up bikes. Mr Mirchandani, 35, said: 'Conventional bikes are awkward in every way except when you ride them. Twist and lock: Commuters struggling to fit their fold-up bikes on trains will instead be able to carry a normal-sized bike to work with them in a small backpack the size of a tyre (left). The prototype Kit Bike is put together by attaching the various aluminium hollow tubes using simple twist joints (right) Storage: Each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag, separate from the remaining 19 parts . A rival design to the Kit Bike is the origami bike that can fold into a package the size as an umbrella. An Italian designed has revealed the bike, which even has folding wheels, and a hub instead of a chain. However, despite its tiny size when folded, it still boast full size 26inch wheels and can even be folded in a single move. Inventor Gianluca Sada says he first came up with the idea after being disappointed with current folding bike designs. 'The idea of a folding bike has undertaken numerous studies that focus on reducing the weight and dimensions which have led, to too small sized bicycles,' he said. After dozens of prototypes, he developed the current bike, which includes wheels with no spokes, and a design small enough to be used as a backpack. 'The project may pave the way for a new system of mobility outside the classical schemes, widely accessible and easily transportable,' he explains. 'We thought what if there was a bike that was so small, it fit into a bag you could carry as a backpack? 'What if when you assembled the bike, you got a full-size bike that was comfortable to ride? 'We felt we could make one simple, minimal and cool - unlike folding bikes that tend to be complex in their engineering and construction. 'The Kit Bike was designed to do all these things and make problems of shipping and travelling with a bike a thing of the past.' The Kit Bike consists of simple twist joints that lock with aluminium hollow tubes using a specially designed key. The entire bike can be assembled from the leather bag or dismantled from one side making the process extremely simple and quick. Each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag, while the remaining 19 parts caters for the hollow tubing, seat, handlebars and chain. Mr Mirchandani, from Bangalore, India, said: 'Assembly and disassembly would take 10 minutes or less. 'At the moment it's still a prototype so we are not sure how much it will be to buy but it should weight similar to most aluminium bikes.'

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Risk: The obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in Britain, with the toll set to increase in the next decade (file picture) The obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in Britain, with the toll set to increase in the next decade. The biggest study of its kind shows that being fat is a major risk factor for the most common cancers, triggering more than one in ten cases. The chances of developing some forms of the disease are up to 60 per cent higher, with the risk often rising in tandem with weight gain. Researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall-bladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers in the UK. If Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026. Study leader Dr Krishnan Bhaskaran, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said people had made the connection with obesity being a cause of heart disease and diabetes. But he said there was a worrying lack of awareness about the link with cancer, even though two out of three adults are overweight or obese. ‘The number of people who are overweight or obese is rapidly increasing both in the UK and worldwide,’ he said. ‘It is well recognised that this is likely to cause more diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our results show that if these trends continue, we can also expect to see substantially more cancers as a result.’ The study used data from GP records involving more than five million Britons aged 16 and older who were cancer-free and had been followed for an average of seven-and-a-half years. The risk of developing 22 of the most common cancers was estimated according to body mass index (BMI), a measurement relating weight to height. Higher BMI increases the risk of developing ten of the most common cancers, says the study published in The Lancet medical journal. Over 12,000 cases of these ten cancers each year are attributable to being overweight or obese, say researchers at the School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Farr Institute of Health Informatics. 'The higher the BMI, the higher the risk': Researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall-bladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers in the UK . They calculate that if average BMI in the population continues to increase at the same rate – about half a stone on average over the next 12 years – there could be more than 3,790 extra cancers in 2026 as a result. Almost 167,000 people developed one of the 22 cancers studied over the follow-up period and BMI was associated with 17 of the 22 examined. In need of treatment: If Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026 (file picture) A healthy or normal weight is a BMI score of 18.5 to 24.99; above that is a sliding scale to life-threatening fatness. Carrying an extra two stones in weight over and above the ‘healthy’ range was clearly linked with higher risk of some cancers, and the risk went up with further weight gain. ‘The higher the BMI, the higher the risk,’ said Dr Bhaskaran. The rise in cancer of the womb was 62 per cent higher, gall-bladder 31 per cent, kidney 25 per cent, cervix 10 per cent, thyroid and leukaemia 9 per cent higher. Higher BMI also increased the risk of other cancers including liver (19 per cent), colon (10 per cent), ovarian (9 per cent), and breast cancers (5 per cent). Even within normal or ‘healthy’ weight ranges, higher BMI was associated with increased risk of some cancers. However, those with high BMI may be at a slightly reduced risk of prostate cancer and pre-menopausal breast cancer. Dr Bhaskaran said: ‘This variation tells us that BMI must affect cancer risk through a number of different processes, depending on the cancer type. ‘But the take home message is that putting on weight substantially increases your risk of many of these cancers.’ Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘We are still not getting the message across about the link between excess weight and cancer. Trying to keep a healthy weight is important, but you can reduce your cancer risk even if you’re obese by becoming more physically active.’","Britain's obesity epidemic is blamed for 12,000 cancer cases every year .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . Millions of Britons could be at risk of life-threatening diseases from an unlikely source - their filthy carpets. Unclean rugs can contain a shocking level of disease-inducing bacteria, according to research released today. After swabbing the shoes of people of various ages across the UK, scientists found high levels of bacteria from the pneumonia and E.Coli families. Sickening: . E Coli (pictured) was found in carpets , as well as vomit-inducing . toxins and traces of  gut and faecal bacteria from both animals and . humans were found embedded in carpets by researchers. File picture . They also discovered vomit-inducing toxins and traces of  gut and faecal bacteria from both animals and humans. The vast majority of those surveyed did not know some carpets are often embedded with horse and fox manure, urine, vomit, tar, human and pet hair, dust mites, pollen and traces of skin, according to the study by carpet cleaning firm Rug Doctor. It found that around 40 per cent of Britons wear footwear inside and less than one in five clean the bottom of their shoes. More than a quarter (28 per cent) of the UK’s population has had a pet vomit on the floor and 24 per cent have endured a pet leaving their mess. Furthermore, nearly a third (30 per cent) have had a baby or someone else be sick on their carpet and a quarter (22 per cent) admit to having had sex on the floor. A total of 91 per cent  let their children play on the carpet. Dr Pixie McKenna, from TV's Embarrassing Bodies, called the statisics 'shocking'. 'Dangerous bugs like pneumonia and E.

Dr Pixie McKenna, who appears on C4's Embarrassing Bodies, says poor hygiene in the home is a health risk . 'In fact, 41 per cent of people say they still don't intend to remove their footwear at the door. 'This is no laughing matter - poor hygiene at home risks your health.' The research also asked Britons about a range of hygiene habits and saw a third admit they don't always wash their hands after going to the toilet, almost half leave the same sheets on their bed for weeks, while half use the same dish cloths and sponges over and over again.

"By . Beth Stebner . Victims of ‘non-threatening’ crimes such as burglaries, thefts, and simple assault in Chicago will no longer be visited by officers when they call 911. Chicago police are now enforcing an austere new measure where officers are not dispatched to scenes where the offender has fled and where no one is in immediate danger. The Windy City is in the middle of both a crime and budget crisis, with sprees of violence erupting, even as first responders are forced to drastically slash their budgets. Scroll down for video . Less is more: The Chicago Police Department is cutting officer responses to 911 calls for non-threatening crimes, like burglaries and vandalism . Home visits: Those with non-threatening 911 calls will be passed on to file reports with officers, essentially freeing up more officers for beat duty . The Chicago Tribune reports that officers of the Chicago Police Department will no longer be dispatched to handle less dangerous crimes. The measures went into effect on Sunday. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said that this dramatic shift would free up as many as 200 officers from compiling paperwork to being out on a beat. McCarthy also said that unnecessary 911 calls – including reporting dogs barking and parents complaining their kids won’t eat their vegetables – are putting an unnecessary drain on the system. He said that as it stands, Chicago officers respond to around 70 percent of 911 calls, as opposed to around 30 percent for other cities. He said at a recent press conference: ‘I don’t mean to be flippant here, because I’ve been the victim of a burglary at least three or four times. I’d rather have the officer on the street, where he can prevent the shooting.’ The news comes as Chicago faces a . violent crime epidemic, with nearly 50 homicides and 170 shootings . already this year, and had 506 murders in 2012. Included in those numbers was 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, a student and band majorette who was guilty of no crime. New York City, which has a population roughly three times the size of the Midwestern city, had a 2012 murder rate of 414 people. But Chicagoans aren’t happy about the new change. ‘I think that’s ridiculous,’ one resident told CBS Chicago. ‘I think if there’s a burglary, they’ve got to come. It’s what we pay for. They have to come.’ Austere: Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, pictured at a news conference yesterday, said that he is using difficult measures to keep the city's crime in check . Task force: The announcement comes as Chicago is fighting a gun war and is trying to get rifles and other assault weapons off of the Windy City's streets . Supt. McCarthy later said that his job wasn’t to make people feel better, it was making tough decisions for the greater good of the city. For crimes like robberies, garage burglaries, and property damage, no cop will be dispatched unless the suspect is still on-scene and there is still a present danger for those around. Otherwise, calls will be fielded by officers on light duty, who will then file a report.","New measures will allow officers to work on beats rather than filing paperwork, police superintendent says .

Paddy Jones, 79, who was last night catapulted into the semi-finals of Britain's Got Talent with her younger partner Nico Espinosa, has hit back at critics who suggested she had no right to be on the ITV show . Mrs Jones' jaw-dropping routine with partner Nico, wowed the show's judges and the studio audience. She said the fact they won the Spanish TV contest Tu Si Que Vales (You Are Worth It) in 2009 should not count against them . The retired dental nurse, who lives near Valencia in Spain but is originally from Stourbridge, West Midlands, insists she has never met any of the show's judges prior to the audition . Tu Si Que Vales is not part of the ‘Got Talent’ franchise and is not owned by Cowell’s production company Syco. The retired dental nurse, who lives near Valencia in Spain but is originally from Stourbridge, West Midlands, insists she has never met any of the show’s judges prior to the audition and was ‘flabbergasted’ when Amanda Holden pressed the golden buzzer which guaranteed her a place in the semi-finals. The show’s ten million fans saw Amanda and fellow judges Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams initially give a frosty reception to the dancers, who Cowell described as a ‘bit weird’. The opening seconds of the routine seemed to confirm the worst fears of the panel and Cowell registered his disappointment by pressing his red buzzer. But moments later the couple embarked on a series of show- stopping lifts and spins which drew screams of delight from the judges and audience and ended with a standing ovation and an apology from Cowell. Mrs Jones, 80 in July, started dancing when she was two. The mother of four, grandmother of seven and great-grandmother of one said: ‘Because I am whizzed round so much I can’t see the reactions of people until we have finished the routine.’ Mrs Jones, who dedicated her perfornance to her late husband, said she was flabbergasted that judge Amanda Holden pressed the golden buzzer, which guaranteed her and her partner a place in the semi-finals . She said: 'I am flabbergasted to have got this far. I am ploughing ahead with it and enjoying it as much as I can. I would encourage older people to get up from watching TV all day to do something. It is a question of mind over matter' She said she was delighted Cowell had felt the need to apologise for his snub. Mrs Jones gave up on her dreams of becoming a professional dancer when she married her late husband David when she was 22 in 1956. He died from leukaemia in 2003 shortly . after the couple had started a new life in Spain and she began dancing . again at the age of 69 as a means of filling her ‘lonely nights’. Mrs Jones' husband David died from leukaemia in 2003 shortly after the couple had started their new lives in Spain . She walked into Nico’s studio on the off-chance he could teach her Flamenco. The pair hit it off and within months they were performing at clubs and dance competitions across Spain. Mrs Jones, whose real first name is Sarah, said: ‘I spoke to the children and asked them what they thought. 'They said I’d given up everything for Dad and them so do what you want because Dad would have approved. I think he would.’ She said she had no idea how she would top last night’s routine. ‘I am flabbergasted to have got this far,’ she said. ‘I am not expecting the impossible. I am ploughing ahead with it and enjoying it as much as I can. ‘I would encourage older people to get up from watching TV all day to do something. It is a question of mind over matter.’ Mrs Jones, who performed in professional panto when she  was younger, insists she does not have a stringent fitness routine although she has never smoked.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . The director of the National Security Agency has defended government programs that monitor phone calls and emails, claiming they have disrupted 'dozens' of terrorist attacks. NSA director Keith Alexander defended the programs as 'critical' at a Senate hearing on Wednesday - a week after a former contractor, Edward Snowden, leaked information about the snooping. While he refused to discuss specifics, he did say federal data mining appeared to play a role in helping disrupt a recent plot to attack the New York subway system. He said information developed overseas was passed along to the FBI and used to identify suspect Najibullah Zazi in Colorado and uncover the plot. He pleaded guilty to terror-related charges in 2010. At the hearing on Capitol Hill, Alexander also expressed his concerns about Snowden's qualifications. He was entrusted with the government's top secrets despite dropping out of high school. 'I do have concerns about that. I have great concerns about that,' he said. Scroll down for video . Defense: Gen. Keith B. Alexander, National Security Agency Chief, defends surveillance programs on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying they have disrupted dozens of terrorist attacks . Alexander insisted that the programs . were key for the nation's security and following Snowden's leaks, the . country is much less safe than it was two weeks ago. 'We're trying to be transparent here, . protect civil liberties and privacy, but also the security of the U.S.,' he said. 'If we tell the terrorists what we're going to do, they will . get through and Americans will die.' Sen. Patrick Leahy, who led the . hearing on Capitol Hill, pressed Alexander for further details on the . activities that had been disrupted, but Alexander said much of the . information was classified. Alexander said he hopes to reveal details of the cases in a week and pledged that the agency would be more transparent with the phone records program in the future. He said the NSA is amassing data and 'only in specific times' with the okay of justice and a court, do they actually access it. Insistence: Alexander said that the country is much less safe now than it was before the leaks occurred . In 2009, Najibullah Zazi plotted with two friends to detonate bombs in New York City during rush hour in the middle of trains. Last week, sources told Reuters that thanks to the surveillance systems, authorities were monitoring an e-mail address known to belong to a member of Al Qaeda. Zazi e-mailed that address and revealed himself and his plans. He was arrested and now faces life in prison. When news of the phone-records program broke, officials quickly credited it with thwarting the attack. But the use of PRISM to catch Zazi does little to resolve one of the key questions in the debate: whether the government needs to take such vast amounts of data to keep the country safe. That's because, even before the surveillance laws of 2007 and 2008, the FBI had the authority to monitor email accounts linked to terrorists. The only difference was, before the laws changed, the government needed a warrant. To get a warrant, the law requires that the government show that the target is a suspected member of a terrorist group or foreign government, something that had been well established at that point in the Zazi case. In response, Leahy said the intelligence community . believes that these surveillance programs are critical, but he added . that he thinks they should not be made permanent and that Congress . should be able to review and debate them periodically. Alexander spoke out after Snowden, a former CIA analyst, leaked information last week about programs that track phone calls and information from large internet companies. At the hearing, Sen. Collins asked Alexander when Snowden would have been able to tap into virtually any call or email . as claimed in an interview. 'False,' Alexander responded. Ahead of the questioning, he said U.S. critical infrastructure - which ranges from telecommunications to water to energy supplies - is not well prepared to handle a destructive cyber attack. 'On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being strongly defended, our critical infrastructure's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyber attack is about a three based on my experience,' Alexander wrote in the statement prepared for the Senate Appropriations Committee for a hearing on cybersecurity. Alexander said the U.S. has been and continues to be a target of cyberattacks by foreign nations. About 90 per cent of the nation's . critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector, and therefore is . not under the control of the U.S. government or military. 'Traitor': Edward Snowden, a former CIA analyst, leaked information about the surveillance systems last week . While he made no mention of the leaks about NSA surveillance programs in this opening statement, Alexander said it was vital to have a strong Defense Department role in cyberspace in light of what he called real and growing threats. 'While we feel confident that most foreign leaders believe that a devastating attack on the critical infrastructure and population of the United States by cyber means would elicit a prompt and proportionate response, it is possible, however, that some regime or cyber actor could misjudge the impact and the certainty of our resolve,' he said. Alexander told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit last month that the United States was increasingly vulnerable to attacks like those that destroyed data on tens of thousands of computers in Saudi Arabia and South Korea in the past year.","Keith Alexander said the U.S. is less safe now than it was before Edward Snowden leaked information about surveillance systems .

"By . Corey Charlton . A Harry Potter-style rotunda, Willy Wonka glass lift and London's eye-catching skyscraper The Shard are on the shortlist for architecture's top prize. The Riba Stirling Prize - whose nominees also include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, the London Aquatic Centre, the London School of Economics, and Manchester School of Art - is awarded annually to the best new building. Judges praised the revolutionary design . of the Library of Birmingham. With its 'Harry Potter rotunda' and 'Willy . Wonka-style glass lift', it was described as a landmark that has . 'shaken the traditional perception of a library'. Scroll down for video . The Library of Birmingham has been shortlisted for the prestigious award, with judges saying its design has 'shaken the traditional perception of a library' The futuristic library was designed by Francine Hoube and officially opened last year - as well as lending, it houses the city's collection of archives, photography and rare books . Judges compared The Shard to the 'Gothic . spire of a German cathedral' and said it was 'the most significant step . forward on the London skyline since St Paul's'. They said that making the tower, which is not yet fully occupied but houses a health clinic, offices, restaurants, hotel, apartments and public viewing gallery, on such a tight site was a 'rare achievement'. 'Understanding that there are many days when the London skyline reads only as a depressing grey silhouette, the architects have left a substantial part at the top open, adding further to the lightness even in these conditions, not unlike the Gothic spire of a German cathedral.' Meanwhile, they said the Manchester School Of Art felt more as though you were 'entering a metropolitan art gallery rather . than a university department' and would influence the design of art . schools and other university buildings for years to come. The Shard, pictured left, was described by the judges as the most significant addition to the London skyline since St Paul's and compared it to the spire of a Gothic cathedral, while the stunning Manchester School of Art, pictured right, was more like a 'metropolitan art gallery' than a university department . The London Aquatics Centre was highly praised - judges said removing the wings which had accommodated spectators during the Olympics, allowed the building to 'fly free'. The 'conceptually flawless' interior of the London Aquatics Centre was the backdrop for the swimming events at the London 2012 Olympics . The Olympic Park's London Aquatics Centre also recieved high praise, with judges praising architect Zaha Hadid's building, which was inspired by the 'fluid geometry of water in motion', as very beautiful and 'conceptually flawless'. Liverpool's Everyman Theatre was built on the site of the old theatre after it was deemed unsuited for productions and the audience in the 21st century. But the new build retains the ambience of an old building thanks to the use of recycled and exposed brick, judges said. 'After nine years' gestation, Liverpool has a brand new purpose-built theatre of outstanding quality. This is a building that will age gracefully, continually enriched by the patina of daily use. It will both reassure and delight its loyal audience and those discovering this gem for the first time.' Liverpool's Everyman Theatre is a refurbished building that manages to retains its history and traditional feel with the use of recycled and exposed brick . Also shortlisted is the London School of Economics Saw Swee Hock Student Centre - a 'startlingly original building', which is 'beautifully constructed' and a 'massive contribution to its townscape'. Riba (Royal Institute Of British Architects) president Stephen Hodder said the shortlisted buildings were 'poetic'. 'The shortlist comprises no ordinary new swimming pool, office block, theatre, library or university - they are beautiful, inspiring and transformative new buildings that their communities can relish and be proud of,' he said. 'They are remarkably crafted buildings and, the closer you look at their detail, both internally and externally, and their materiality, the more impressive they become.' The winner, picked by a team of judges, will be announced on October 16.

"By . Corey Charlton . A Romanian visited his holiday home only to find a completely empty plot of land with a field of corn planted in its place after his house had been stolen by thieves. Police in the Romanian port city of Braila got a call from Andy Pascali, 40, complaining that his holiday house on the Danube Delta had been stolen. At first they thought it was a joke, but when they turned up at the nearby village of Baldovinesti they found not only that there was no property where there should have been a three-bedroom building, but that a field of ready-to-harvest corn had been planted in its place. Before: The house owned by Mr Pascali in Romania which was stolen and replaced by a cornfield . After: The cornfield planted by a neighbour where Mr Pascali's house should have been before it was stolen . Police thought someone was playing a prank when they first received a call about the house being stolen . A shocked Mr Pascali, who posted the image of the cornfield on his Facebook page, said: 'I think this could only happen in Romania. 'My entire house has been stolen and my neighbours have taken advantage of the opportunity to plant a field of corn instead. Absolutely incredible.' He said the theft should be a warning to anybody who might be thinking about buying a holiday home in the country that they should make regular checks to make sure it was still there. He added: 'My message is to anyone with a holiday home in Romania is this, it could happen to you to!' He said that he believed the crooks had probably managed to recycle just about everything after slowly taking the house apart while he was not there. He said the property that he had inherited from his parents who had built it in 1986 had also been fully furnished with a brand-new fitted kitchen and bathroom. He added: 'I had been worried about thieves maybe breaking in and stealing the television or something, and so I put a barbed wire fence up around the house for added security. But they stole that as well.' Police officers looking across the cornfield which was planted on the empty plot of land . Andy Pascali (pictured) believes his holiday home was stolen piece by piece while he was not there . The man from the capital Bucharest had been looking forward to enjoying a break after the house was finally complete and landscape gardeners had finished putting down the lawn. They had even installed a pond with a fountain, which had also vanished when Andy turned up for his holiday. A local man admitted he decided to take advantage of the fact that the ground was no longer being used to plant a field of corn but denied knowing anything about the theft of the house in the first place.","Andy Pascali, 40, visited his holiday home only to find an empty plot of land .

"By . Louise Boyle . A teenage girl, whose police officer parents are accused of killing her boyfriend, has been left stunned by the murder of the 'sweet and caring' young man. Lisa Kepler, 18, turned her parents in after she allegedly watched her father shoot her new boyfriend, 19-year-old Jeremy Lake, dead in a Tulsa street, Oklahoma. Miss Kepler said that her father had never met her boyfriend, whom she had known for a week and described as a 'protective and good person'. Scroll down for video . Lisa Kepler, 18, pictured on Thursday, turned her parents in after she allegedly watched them shoot her new boyfriend, 19-year-old Jeremy Lake dead in a Tulsa street, Oklahoma . The girl has not spoken to her parents, Shannon Kepler, 54, and Gina Kepler, 48, since they were arrested. Jeremy Lake, 19, was shot dead on Tuesday night . Her father, who has served the police force for 24 years, is facing a first-degree murder charge while her mother was arrested on a complaint of accessory to murder after the fact. The officers were off-duty at the time of the shooting. Miss Kepler sobbed as she told NBC: 'Josh is the kindest person. 'He is the most protective person and a good person who helped the homeless. I don't know why my dad did this.' She said that she tried to call the jail where her father was being held to ask him why he committed such a brutal act. The 18-year-old revealed that her parents had kicked her out of home last week and that she met Mr Lake who was volunteering at the shelter where she had been staying. He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, Miss Kepler said. The young couple were walking to Mr Lake's aunt's house on Tuesday when her father turned up in his car. She said that he asked what she was doing in the neighborhood. When she walked away, the 19-year-old tried to introduce himself. The police officer then shot Lake two or three times, fled in his vehicle and later turned himself in, the affidavit said. Miss Kepler described Mr Lake to NBC as 'my everything'. She told Tulsa World: ‘I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.’ Shannon Kepler's lawyer Richard O'Carroll said that the officer plans to plead not guilty as he has a 'viable, if not perfect' defense. The husband and wife were booked on Tuesday night into the Tulsa County jail. They are being held without bail pending the filing of formal charges and have both been placed on paid administrative leave.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . It seemed that life couldn't get any better for Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen. The Midwestern couple, 22 and 26, was just a few weeks away from their wedding as they wrapped up a summer of leading Christian youth in outdoors trips near the Sierra foothills outside of Sacramento. Out in nature, hiking and rock-climbing, they were happy. 'I've just spent two awesome days with my fiancee Lindsay,' wrote Allen, 26, in a visitor log at a wooden hutch near the coastal hamlet of Jenner Beach, California. 'Can life ever be so perfect?' The two were on an impromptu getaway from camp when Allen wrote that note. Later that night, they had trouble finding a place to stay, so they packed their camping gear and headed to a deserted beach, where they fell asleep for the night. It was Aug. 15, 2004. They never woke up. MURDERED: Lindsay Cutshall, 22, and Jason Allen, 26, were camp counselors when they were killed 10 years ago. They were to be married weeks after they were shot while camping at an abandoned beach in California . Still seeking answers: The families of the victims, Bob and Delores Allen and Kathy and Chris Cutshall (left to right), routinely visit the spot where Lindsay and Jason were killed, hoping to understand the senseless tragedy . The two would be found three days later, still inside their sleeping bags, shot in the head at close range by a .45-caliber Marlin rifle. 'There's not a day that goes by that she hasn't come into my mind and my heart and oftentimes my prayers,' Cutshall's father, Chris, told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'And yes, there are still times that I shake my head a little bit. It was all so surreal.' It has been 10 years since the senseless tragedy, and the families continue to seek answers about the double murder. 'Did they run into somebody who doesn't like Christians? They freely talked about their love for the Lord,' Allen's dad, Bob, told the Chronicle. 'Or was there someone down on the beach who was planning something illegal and they just happened to wander upon it? I don't know. Lots of things it could be.' Detectives at the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office say the investigation remains very much active. 'There have been several times in the investigation where our adrenaline got going and we thought we had something good,' Lt. Carlos Basurto told the Chronicle. 'It turned out it wasn't as good as we thought.' Jason and Lindsay smile as they celebrated their wedding shower in May 2004 . One of those times came a few years back, when investigators thought that fugitive Joseph Burgess, who was a suspect of killing two campers in Canada, could have something to do with the Jenner Beach killing. But then he died in a 2009 shootout in New Mexico, and DNA evidence later exonerated him from the crime. There was also drifter from Wisconsin, who was a prime suspect right after the bodies were found. He, too, was ruled out shortly afterward. 'I think about this case all the time,' Basurto told the Chronicle. 'My wife still talks to me about this case. She'll ask, 'Hey, what's going on in Jenner? Did you ever think of this?'' Crime scene: Detectives with the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office investigate the beach where Jason and Lindsay were murdered . Heartbroken: The parents of the victims talk to reporters near the spot where Jason and Lindsay were killed . 'Not to say you don't want to do that for the rest of the cases,' he added. 'But in . this case, if ever there was an innocent victim, here you have them.' Friends and family of the couple last week traveled from all over the country to visit the spot where Lindsay and Jason lost their lives. A bouquet of flowers was placed at the spot where they camped. 'More than anything I just really miss them,"" Kathy Cutshall told the Chronicle.

"By . Damien Gayle . Dognappers who threatened to slice up a pet pug returned him after they were named and shamed them on Facebook, the dog's owner claimed today. Maria Smith said crooks had demanded £2,000 ransom in exchange for the safe return of Simba, who was snatched from her home in Walton, Liverpool. But Simba was eventually returned unharmed after Miss Smith tracked down the culprits on social media websites following a Facebook appeal. Safe: Trainee beautician Maria Smith cuddles Simba, her pet dog, who she was only able to get back from ruthless dognappers who threatened to slice him up after Facebook detective work led her to the culprits . Merseyside Police said they were investigating the allegations. After Simba went missing, the trainee beautician had taken to the Internet in a bid to track him down. 'People got in touch with me to say they had been offered my dog for sale, and that the thieves were going around asking people if they wanted to buy a dog,' she said. When one message included the names of the alleged thieves, Miss Smith posted them on Facebook in a bid to flush them out. 'The day before I got him back, I got a phone call from one of the thieves who said ""if you carry on posting on Facebook I will slice your dog apart in front of you"". 'They wanted £2,000 for him and I offered them the money because I just wanted him home. 'But in the end they handed the dog back because they wanted their names off Facebook - they were worried about being identified on the internet.' Miss Smith said two women, whom she didn't know, returned Simba to her late at night - nine days after he had gone missing. Brave: Simba stands defiantly atop the front garden wall outside Ms Smith's home in Walton Merseyside . 'I have had no sleep, it's been horrible. It's heartbreaking to have a pet go missing,' she said. 'I was lucky to get my dog back. There are people who never see their dogs again after they are stolen. 'I'm overjoyed he is back. People lose their dogs every day so criminals can make a profit and something needs to be done about it.' Miss Smith, 19, said Simba was taken from her back garden on July 22. 'I let Simba out into the back garden with my other dog, like I always do before we go to bed,' she said. 'After around 15 minutes I could hear scratching at the back door, but when I ran out there was only one dog there. 'Someone must have jumped over the back fence and taken Simba, he was nowhere to be seen. 'I was heartbroken, I have had Simba since he was eight-weeks-old and he was part of the family. 'My other dog, Junior, was crying as they normally sleep next to each other.'","Maria Smith's dog Simba was snatched from her back garden last month .

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . A proud Russian who insisted his four wheel drive could handle anything that recent floods could throw at it has become a laughing stock after his all-terrain vehicle sank in a giant 'puddle'. Albert Nevzorov, 29, had driven with pals around the Adlersky City District in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea coast that had recently seen heavy rainfalls, to show off its abilities. While other vehicles floundered in the water, Albert claimed his jeep would be able to handle anything the city's 'puddles' could deliver. So when he came across a flooded road he decided to show his friends what his machine was made of. After twice attempting to cross what he described as a 'puddle' before turning back, Albert was not put off. He had spotted cars on the other side of the flood and believed that they had made the crossing - without realising they were actually cars on the back of a sunken vehicle transporter. Determined Albert Nevzorov, 29, tries to show his mates that a bit of water is nothing his jeep can't handle. But the 'puddle' turns out to be deeper than he thought, and he runs into trouble trying to get to the other side . Pal Hilarion Uvarov, who took this video, said: 'I got the video camera working on my mobile phone and recorded attempt number three, where he had the bright idea of putting one of the wheels of the car on the curb to keep it out of the water. 'What he didn't realise was that he was driving down a slip road that just kept getting deeper. 'He thought there were parked cars but it was actually cars parked on top of a car transporter.' Russian president Vladimir Putin is also a fan of the four-wheel-drive and owns this Lada Niva jeep . Determined to make the crossing, Albert kept going even though the water level was rising and rising. Eventually the entire jeep becomes submerged in the flood, but luckily Albert manages to clamber out where he is left standing on the roof in the middle of the 'puddle'. The video went viral in Russia and soon became one of the most viewed items on social media sites where it was branded 'Titanic Three'.","Albert Nevzorov saw the flood and thought it was nothing but a 'puddle'

"By . Pa Reporter . Norwich manager Neil Adams will hold talks with left-back Martin Olsson after he appeared to raise his hand to referee Simon Hooper following his dismissal during their 1-0 defeat at Wolves. Olsson was sent off on the hour mark after collecting two yellow cards for challenges on the Wolves winger Rajiv van La Parra. Adams, whose side were beaten by a 64th-minute header from Dave Edwards, hopes that Olsson will not face any further action other than a standard one-match ban. Flashpoint: Olsson attempted to stop referee Simon Hooper producing his red card on the hour mark . Hopeful: Neil Adams said he didn't see the incident but that he was hopeful that Olsson would avoid a long ban . He said: 'I haven't seen it and hopefully there is nothing in it. 'But we will have a look at it and see what it is and if there are any consequences from that. 'I will speak to Martin about that. Of course I will. I didn't see it because as soon as the card comes out you're looking away to what you are going to do. But I will have a look at it. 'The officials have said nothing to us about any alleged hands on and like I say I have not seen it for now. We will get the footage going back on the coach. 'But there has been nothing said or suggested to me as of yet from that. We will need to make inquiries if something has happened.' Despite making the worst possible start to their bid to make an instant return to the Barclays Premier League, Adams refused to be too downcast but admitted that the loss of Olsson was pivotal. In trouble: The Norwich full-back pulls Rajiv Van La Parra to the ground to pick up his second yellow . Seeing red: Hooper eventually manages to get his card out and shows it to the Norwich man . He added: 'The second one was a stronger yellow than the first for me. We lost a player at a point where I thought we were controlling the game. 'We were looking good and pinning Wolves back and when the red card happens we get caught when we are down to 10 men. 'There were positives to take from the game but you are never happy when you lose.' Edwards, who had missed an excellent chance after just 22 seconds, made no mistake when he rose unmarked to head home Van La Parra's cross. It was a just reward for Wolves who had carried the greater threat all match through Van La Parra, Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. Norwich were lightweight in attack, their best chance falling to Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute. Distraught: Olsson trudges off, kicking a water bottle on his way, after being dismissed . Turning point: Adams said he thought the red card marked a change in momentum, allowing Wolves to score . But he was denied a goal on his debut following his £3million move from Bournemouth by a smart save from Carl Ikeme. Wolves manager Kenny Jackett was delighted with his side's performance on their return to the Sky Bet Championship after winning the League One title last season. Jackett said: 'First off it is a good win and a good day for the club. 'Pressure builds up through pre-season and everyone wants to get to that first day and to get a win on the first day is a big thing. With us coming into a new division that is great. 'But looking past that there are different types of challenges. You could see the way that Norwich defended their goal was very good and it was an excellent goal that won the game. 'It was a late run and a very, very good header into the far corner. 'There were crucial moments and the sending-off was one. That was pivotal as was Grabban's chance. 'Then Dave Edwards put that big chance in. They were pivotal moments in the game.'","Olsson sent off for second booking against Wolves .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . It's been over 10 years since Yowie chocolates were seen on Australian shelves but the chocolates are being relaunched in America then heading back to Australia in 2019. The Yowie characters were created by best-selling authors Bryce Courtenay and Geoff Pike in the early 1900s. The illustrations are the work of Australian artist Ted Blackall. They each contained a toy and a message or story about keeping the environment clean.The Yowie mission statement is: ‘Save the natural world'. Scroll down for video . Yowie chocolates were created by best-selling author Bryce Courtenay. The rights to the chocolates have been sold to a new company and are going to be sold in the U.S. Chocolate-lovers rejoice: Yowie chocolates will be back on Australian shelves in 2019 . Launched by Cadbury in 1995, Yowie sold 65 million units in Australia in its first year, before making the leap into the Asia-Pacific. However it was a disagreement between Cadbury with Courtenay and Pike over the rights to sell the chocolates in America that led to the pull of the product from shelves. Yowie Group chairman Wayne Loxton told ABC News  that Yowie was a smash hit and 'one of Cadbury's most successful brands ever launched in the history of the company'. The characters are based on the mythology surrounding the Australian Yowie which features in indigenous dream time stories. Yowie outsold their biggest competitor, Kinder Surprise, ""taking 30 per cent of the $80 million children's confectionery market"", Foster Stockbroking's Haris Khaliqi told ABC News. Kinder Surprise is not approved for sale in the US markets as authorities have deemed its small toy a choking hazard. Unlike Kinder Surprise chocolates Yowie usually contains a small Australian or New Zealand native animal toy. The Yowie mission statement is 'Save the natural world' and each contains messages and stories about how the Yowies protect their natural environment. The Yowie brand also included short stories written by Bryce Courtenay and Geoff Pike and were illustrated by Ted Backall. Yowie though, has received the only patent given by the US Food and Drug Administration for a chocolate-encased toy. 'If distributing with the right retailers - it could get to the stage where there is potential to build a brand around it as well with ancillary products, merchandise and licensing,' Mr Khaliqi said. Yowie Group plans on relaunching the chocolates in the Australian market in 2019.","A new company are launching the popular Australian chocolates in the US and then in Australia .

"A son surprised his mother with the dream car she had always wanted - and published a video of her delight on YouTube. Corey Wadden, an aspiring social entrepreneur from Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, got a friend to film the moment he handed his mother an envelope with the keys to the car inside. 'Since I was a kid, my mom's been raving about this car that she's always wanted: an old Saab,' Mr Waddon wrote on YouTube. 'Last year, I asked her to point out the exact car, in passing. She pointed out a copper coloured 1973 Saab 99 EMS.' Scroll down for video . Surprise! Corey Wadden bought his mother his dream car after tricking her into thinking he was making a documentary . This came in the mail: The film shows Corey Wadden handing his mother a letter that he claims was sent to her . Penny drops: His mom breaks down in giggles as she comes face to face with the car parked in the parking lot outside her apartment block . He explained: 'My mom used to clean houses for a living, and one of the houses she would clean for a few years was a guy who owned a 70's saab 99. He would throw her the keys and let her move the car all the time and she fell in love with it.' Mr Wadden says he spent six months just looking for the right car, then another six months to raise the cash to buy it. 'But suprising her with it made it all worthwhile,' he said. The film shows the scene as Mr Wadden collects his unsuspecting mother from her apartment, after telling her he needs to film her for a documentary he's making. Halfway down the block's austere-looking flight of stairs, he stops, hands her the envelope and tells her: 'Before we go out, something came in the mail for you, I don't know what it was but you should check it.' 'This didn't come in the mail,' she says, before finding the keys folded in a sheet of paper with a printed picture of the car. 'What the f***!' 'You're kidding me!' she then said, smiling and giggling uncontrollably as she comes face to face with the car parked in the car park outside the block. On his website, Mr Wadden explains his mother lost her job and she had no plan to support herself in old age - hence the gesture . Let's take it out for a spin: Mr Wadden says he spent six months looking for the right car, and then another six to raise the cash to buy it .

On his website he explains that after his mother lost her job, he realised she had no plan to support herself in old age. 'I decided to take 2 years of my life to do everything I could to retire my family and attain financial freedom,' he said. Two-and-a-half years on, Mr Wadden's still trying to make his first million.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . Mo Farah put family troubles behind him to win another two gold medals in the last week, it emerged yesterday. For as Mo repeated his Olympic heroics at the European Championships, his younger brother Omar was remanded behind bars charged with burglary. The 21-year-old is accused of breaking into a house with the intent to steal and will appear in court next month. Scroll down for video . Mo Farah did his trademark Mobot dance as he won the 5,000m final in Zurich, left, while his brother Omah, 21, right, was in Wandsworth prison, London, accused of breaking into a house with intent to steal . He was detained in Wandsworth Prison in south-west London while 31-year-old Mo won the gold medal in the 10,000m at the European Championships held in Zurich on Wednesday and the 5,000 metres yesterday. Previously, Omar has spoken about the support and advice given to him by his older brother and double Olympic gold medallist, Mo, 31, to help him rebuild his life. In an interview last year, Omar, who said he was training to be a graphic designer in an attempt to stay out of trouble, said: ‘I’m moving forward with my life and I have Mo to thank.’ ‘The friendship is still good. My dad said: ‘Why can’t you be more like Mo?’ and that’s what I aim to do now.’ But just over a year and a half later, Omar is being held in Britain’s largest prison accused of burgling a semi-detached house in Brentford, Middlesex. He is expected to face the charges at Kingston Crown Court on September 8. Mo, who was awarded a CBE last year after winning the 5,000m and 10,000m for Great Britain at the London 2012 Games, is said to be aware of the accusations against his sibling. Speaking after Mo – who is known for his trademark dance the Mobot - clinched his 10,000m victory in the Olympic Stadium, Omar told of his admiration for his brother. The 31-year-old won gold in both the 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre finals at the European Championships in Zurich, Switzerland . He said: ‘Mo’s success has inspired me to do something with my life. ‘The atmosphere was amazing. The whole place erupted and it was cool to hear everyone go mad for Mo, and for everyone to do the Mobot.’ He added: ‘I’ve held his medals. They’re pretty heavy.’ Omar was born in 1992, a year after his father Mukhtar fled the impoverished African state of Djibouti which borders Somalia with Mo who was aged just eight. IT consultant Mukhtar, who was forced to leave his wife and three of his six children behind, settled in West London before meeting Omar’s mother Fosiya Mohamed. Mo and Omar’s lives went in different directions as the older brother excelled in sport. But he always remained close to his family in the UK and Somalia . The brothers’ paths went into different directions, with Mo going on to achieve exceptional sporting success in the 2012 London Olympics Games making him a national hero. The inspirational athlete currently lives between Teddington, London and Portland, Oregon with his wife Tania and their three daughters Rhianna, Aisha and Amani.

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent . Shadow education secretary, Labour's Tristram Hunt, said he had 'real concerns' with pupils being 'crammed' into classrooms . Thousands of primary school children are being taught in giant classes of 50, 60 or even 70 pupils, figures reveal today. Labour said there are nearly 15,000 in classes of 40 or more – but faced an immediate backlash from critics who said the problem was created by the party’s previous policies. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he had ‘real concerns’ about children being ‘crammed’ into large classes. However, critics point out that Labour’s ‘out of control’ immigration policy caused much of the pressure on places. As well as direct immigration resulting in growing numbers of children at schools, pressure has also resulted from the so-called ‘migrant baby boom’ as more children are born to mothers arriving in Britain from overseas. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘Tristram Hunt seems to have forgotten it was Labour who cut 200,000 primary school places in the middle of a baby boom – at the same time as letting immigration get out of control.’ Labour published figures showing the number of primary pupils in classes of more than 30 has spiralled in the last four years. In 2010 there were 31,000 such pupils, compared to the current total of 93,665 – a rise of 200 per cent. Of those, nearly 40,000 are in classes of more than 36 pupils. Another 5,817 are in classes of 50 or more, 2,556 are in classes of 60 or more and 446 are in classes of 70 or more. On current trends, Mr Hunt said, by 2020 the number of children in large classes of more than 30 pupils will top 450,000. That would account for around one in four of all primary pupils. Mr Hunt said: ‘In 2008 David Cameron said; “the more we can get class sizes down the better”, but as parents and pupils prepare to begin the new school year, there are real concerns about the number of children in classes of more than 30 infants under the Tories. ‘By diverting resources away from areas in desperate need of more primary school places in favour of pursuing his pet project of expensive free schools in areas where there is no shortage of places, David Cameron has created classes of more than 40, 50, 60 and even 70 pupils. The number of pupils in classes of more than 30 has risen by 200 per cent since 2010 - but critics say it is due to Labour's 'out of control' immigration policy (stock image) ‘Labour will end the Free Schools programme and instead focus spending on areas in need of extra school places. ‘The choice on education is clear: the threat of ever more children crammed into large class sizes under the Tories or a Labour future where we transform standards with a qualified teacher in every classroom and action on class sizes.’ But Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘It’s a bit rich for Labour to complain about pressure on primary schools when the major factor in the increase is the result of the mass immigration which Labour promoted and even encouraged.’ And Mrs Morgan added: ‘As part of our long-term economic plan, the difficult decisions we’ve taken have meant we’ve been able to double the funding to local authorities for school places to £5billion, creating 260,000 new places. ‘But Labour haven’t learnt their lesson. Their policy of not trusting headteachers would create more bureaucrats, meaning more resources are spent on paperwork – not places. Children would have a worse future under Labour.’ The British population has risen by five million over the past 12 years, growing faster than anywhere else in Europe. In mid-2013, there were 400,600 more residents than a year earlier, equivalent to a city the size of Bristol. Immigration was directly responsible for 46 per cent of that rise. Migrants also play a major role in the current baby boom, with one in four infants now born to a mother who was born abroad. The National Audit Office has warned that 240,000 extra primary places will be needed by next month.","Shadow education secretary has 'real concerns' with 'crammed' classes .

Andy was boarding a rush hour train at Stirling station, north-west of Perth, when he slipped and one leg became trapped. Quick-thinking passengers and staff helped rock the 90-tonne train to help free his leg. 'My left leg missed the train and fell down the platform, right down past my knee, up to my thigh,' he said. 'I just got caught up in the rush somehow getting on the train, stepped through the gap instead of on to the train. 'They couldn't get my knee past the platform (despite) twisting and turning. 'In the end, all the passengers lined up along the platform and tilted the train just far enough for me to be pulled out of the gap.' He was treated by paramedics, but he did not sustain any serious injuries. 'I didn't realise how many people were witnessing this situation until I saw the footage later on the news,' he said. 'I was amazed. I had no idea it was that big of an incident, that it took that many people to free me.' 'I was feeling a little bit of shock. I was sort of wobbly on my feet, it took me a while to sort of get my balance,' he told Nine News . The man was boarding the rush hour train when slipped into the crack to the horror of passengers . Transperth spokesman David Hynes told the  ABC they were quick to alert the driver to ensure the train didn't move. 'Then our staff who were there at the time got the passengers, and there were lots of them, off the train, and organised them to sort of rock, tilt the train backwards away from the platform so they were able to get him out and rescue him,' he said. Mr Hynes said it was not a problem caused by overcrowding and praised the actions of staff and passengers who helped free the man. 'Everyone sort of pitched in. It was people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury,' he said. A number of passengers got off the train to help rail staff rock the train to help set the man free . The man (circled) was helped away by a staff member so he could be treated by paramedics, as passengers re-boarded the train . Nicolas Taylor told Perth Now that he and fellow passengers got off the train and worked together to free the man by pushing against the carriage away from the platform. 'He seemed to be a bit sheepish, because right where he fell was the ‘mind the gap’ writing,' he said. Mr Taylor said Transperth staff coordinated the incident well, taking about 10 minutes to free him. 'They did a really good job, they took control and handled it well. When I first saw it I thought we’d be there for hours.' he said.","Andy slipped and became wedged between a train and the platform at a railway station in Perth on Wednesday .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A benefits cheat who claimed over £35,000 in disability payments was caught when she posted a picture of herself on the Great Wall of China on Facebook. Dawn Pinchen from Annitsford, Northumberland, said she was unable to walk the length of a car due to a spinal injury. The 40-year-old fraudulently claimed £35,601 in income support and disability allowance over six years between 2007 and 2013. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Pinchen was caught by the Department of Work and Pensions after officials found a picture of her on the 13,000-mile Chinese landmark on Facebook. Dawn Pinchen, 40, falsely claimed over £35,000 in disability benefits - but was caught out when she was spotted on Facebook walking the 13,000 mile-long Great Wall of China (pictured) Officials had also seen her walking in to a shopping centre unaided, the court heard. She pleaded guilty to three counts of failure to notify in change of circumstances - and was handed a four-month suspended jail term and 150 hours unpaid work. Pinchen is also paying back the money she fraudulently claimed in installments of £18.25 a week. Speaking outside court, the woman said claims she was walking the Great Wall were 'a load of rubbish' - and said she was just visiting the landmark. The court heard how Pinchen was legitimately claiming benefits from 1994. Between December 2007 and January 2013 Pinchen’s circumstances changed - but she continued to claim and was given a total of £35,601. Fraud Investigation Officers begun observing Pinchen’s movements and she was soon spotted strolling into and out of her local shopping centre with no aid. In early 2010 Pinchen’s husband earned a large amount of money selling websites and then transferred the income into her bank account. Alec Burns, prosecuting . As a result, in 2011, the couple had the money available to travel 5000 miles for a 10-day sight-seeing holiday in China. Pinchen then posted photos from the holiday on Facebook, including a snap of her on the Great Wall of China. Investigators were able to press charges after gaining this crucial evidence to suggest she was physically and financially more stable than she claimed. Alec Burns, prosecuting, told the court: 'On the social media website, Facebook, Mrs Pinchen posted photos of her and her husband on holiday in China. There was a photo of her stood on the Great Wall of China. 'She had also been observed walking from her car into Manors Walk Shopping centre in Cramlington, Northumberland, and walking from her car into and out of her local ASDA supermarket with a trolley. 'On all occasions she did this with no aid at all. There was no sign of a walking stick or frame.' Addressing Pinchen he added: 'You were pictured on the Great Wall of China, walking.' Judge Penny Moreland QC told Pinchen: 'Benefits are for those who need them and for those entitled. Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, heard how Mrs Pinchen started claiming benefits in 1994 - but in 2007 her circumstances changed. She continued to claim for six years - and took home a total of £35,601 in that time . 'People like you, dishonest people, give those with honest claims a bad name and it is wrong.' Tony Cornberg, defending, said: 'There was some entitlement though we are not sure what that might be. 'Mrs Pinchen is still having spinal treatment. She is by no means a regular holiday maker. She has been sitting there watching life happen to everyone else.' Pinchen was sentenced to four months imprisonment suspended for 12 months and ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work. Speaking after the court case Pinchen said: 'Anyone who says that I walked the Great Wall is talking a load of rubbish. I did go to see it but I didn’t walk along it.'","Dawn Pinchen said she couldn't walk the length of a car after spinal injury .

"By . Darren Boyle . A benefits cheat who received £134,000 in welfare payments spent six months living in Goa undergoing plastic surgery, despite claiming she could not leave the house has been jailed for 27 months. Karen Trant, 51, from Dartmouth, Devon, told the Department of Work and Pensions that she was unable to leave her house or travel to strange places alone. Anti-fraud investigators received a tip-off from a member of the public that Trant had bought an apartment in Goa and underwent several cosmetic procedures such as a tummy tuck, liposuction, teeth whitening and even the removal of 'bingo wings'. Karen Trant, pictured, had a tummy tuck, liposuction and even her 'bingo wings' removed while on a six month holiday in Goa despite telling Welfare officials she was unable to leave the house and couldn't travel alone . Trant, right, pictured with a plastic surgeon in Goa bought an apartment in the province in western India . Trant was sentenced to 27 months at Plymouth Crown Court after admitting four counts of fraud. She admitted claiming disability benefits, income support, housing benefit and even council tax benefit. Allan McColgan, DWP Fraud Manager in the South West said: 'Our fraud investigators have powers to track benefit cheats around the world and bring them before the courts. 'We are determined to crack down on people who play the system, so that benefits only go to those who really need this help. In addition to any sentence imposed by the court, fraudsters must pay back all the money they falsely obtained and face a criminal record for life. 'We urge anyone who suspects they know someone that is fraudulently claiming benefits to call our National Benefit Fraud Hotline on 0800 854440.' Trant pleaded guilty to dishonestly claiming benefits over a 13-year period. According to the Crown Prosecution Service,between August 1999 and April 2013, she falsely claimed housing benefit, council tax benefit, employment support allowance, income support and disability allowance. Karen Trant, pictured, was jailed for 27 months at Plymouth Crown Court this afternoon for the £134,000 fraud . A spokesperson said: 'Despite claims that she needed continual supervision, could not walk outdoors in unfamiliar routes without guidance or supervision and being stressed by crowded places, she holidayed in Goa, India, paid for cosmetic surgery and enjoyed horse-riding and socialising in crowds. 'After several holidays to this idyllic part of India, Karen Trant bought an apartment at the Highland Beach Resort in Candolim in 2004, which extended her stays by up to five months. Back in the UK, her false benefits claims continued.' The court heard that Trant claimed £32,315.94 in income support, £8,134 in Employment Support Allowance, almost £30,000 in Disability Living Allowance and almost £65,000 in Housing and Council Tax Benefit. Claire Busby, a lawyer with the CPS Specialist Fraud Division, said: 'Karen Trant failed to notify authorities of cash from her divorce settlement in 1999, that she frequently holidayed in Goa and that, in 2004, she had bought an apartment there. Had she done so, she would not have been entitled to the benefits she claimed. 'The Karen Trant seen confidently riding a horse in the photographs seems a world away from the highly-dependent and anxiety-ridden individual she purported to be to justify her welfare benefits claims. 'This façade was completely undermined by her extravagant lifestyle, involving repeated lengthy trips to Goa and cosmetic surgery. 'The benefits system exists to support the most vulnerable in our society and Karen Trant had no entitlement to these benefits. She tried to conceal her wrongdoing, but was brought before the criminal courts and convicted by the jury.' Trant, pictured on a horse while on holiday, said she required disability living allowance among other benefits .","Karen Trant from Dartmouth, Devon admitted falsely claiming benefits .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Tracy Johnson, 52, who claimed ££50,000 of disability payments has been jailed . A globe-trotting benefits cheat who travelled the world while claiming she was agoraphobic and housebound has been branded ‘one of the worst benefit fraudsters ever’. Former model Tracy Johnson, 52, claimed she was a ‘prisoner in her own home’ and said she was so unwell that she could not leave her own house or walk more than five metres without help. But the mother, from Frome, Somerset, was actually enjoying a 'champagne lifestyle', travelling the world while writing travel guides, cookbooks and steamy novels as she falsely claimed benefits of around £50,000. Johnson, who has only paid back £600, was jailed for one year for 13 charges of fraud, dishonestly making a false representation and dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances between January 2008 and July 2012. However, she will not have to pay any more of the money back – as it has all been spent. Johnson lived it up in a variety of exotic locations including spending a four-month stint in India, which she told a court she thought she was ‘entitled’ to. She also enjoyed shopping sprees in New York and Madrid and spent six months working in sunny Argentina as a tour guide while receiving cold winter payments. And the day after telling benefits officials she could not walk more than five metres without help, she went on a two-day trip to central London. Tracy Johnson, 52, is pictured here at the Salinas Grandes salt flats in Argentina . She claimed she could barely walk whilst she was working as a tour guide trekking in South America. She is pictured here (left) at Ruins of Quilmes in Argentina . Judge Andrew Grubb told her: ‘You spent time in the USA and in Argentina operating a travel guide business and wrote a book. ‘You travelled and lived abroad while receiving benefits. ‘During that time you failed to inform the relevant bodies you were spending time outside the UK.’ Johnson, who was wearing a low cut grey top and tight-fitting black trousers, thanked the judge from the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court as he jailed her. Prosecutor Joanna James did not apply for a Proceeds of Crime order saying: ‘There is no money left - it has all been spent.’ Johnson was arrested after an anonymous tip-off about her worldwide travels. Earlier this month, a jury at Merthyr Crown Court convicted her of the 13 charges. Prosecutor Miss James said: ‘It was absolute, blatant dishonesty. ‘Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hardworking taxpayers could only dream of.’ The judge revealed that after Johnson was found guilty he received an email from a ‘person in Argentina’ who confirmed she was working there as a tour guide. Johnson asked the judge: ‘Who was that?’ But Judge Grubb declined to say because it was not relevant. He said: ‘Your actions amounted to a sustained and multiple benefit fraud involving a substantial amount of public money to which you were not entitled. ‘There are significant and aggravating features about the case.’ Johnson claimed she was suffering from agoraphobia brought on by post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001 while living in New York. But the court was shown her personal profiles on internet sites including LinkedIn where Johnson described herself as a dancer, actress, former model, DJ, interior designer and wedding photographer. She has written three racy novels including one called The Last Tango in Buenos Aires  - some of which were inspired by her worldwide travels. Johnson lived it up in a variety of exotic locations including spending a four-month stint in India, which she told a court she thought she was 'entitled' to . And while in Argentina she set up her own tour company called Northwest Nomads taking trekkers on expeditions to the country’s vineyards and mountains. Andrew Penhale, of the Crown Prosecution Service, described the fraud as one of the worst he had ever seen. He said: ‘Tracy Johnson plotted a blatant fraud against the public purse. ‘She used taxpayers’ money to fund a lavish, globetrotting lifestyle, all the while exploiting a system designed to support society’s most vulnerable citizens. ‘Ms Johnson claimed more than £1,000 per month in benefit payments over five years, when in truth she was spending the majority of her time either travelling or working abroad. ‘Not only did Ms Johnson travel the globe while claiming she was “a prisoner in her own home,” but she also ran her own tour guide company in South America and earned money working as a wedding photographer. ‘In 2011 she even authored a book entitled “Last Tango in Buenos Aires”, detailing her experiences as an English woman living in Argentina. Johnson is pictured here at the Basalt Cliffs in Patagonia. She was arrested after an anonymous tip-off about her worldwide travels . ‘Making a false claim to suffer from anxiety, depression and agoraphobia undermines those who do genuinely suffer from these debilitating conditions. ‘This is one of the worst examples of benefit fraud that we have seen.’ Among the overwhelming evidence prosecutor Joanna James brought before the jury were several posts Johnson had made on social networking sites. One of her Facebook posts read: ‘I am one spoilt girl. Early lunch in the Himalaya Spa. Lunch here would be two weeks’ wages in India.’ But Johnson told the jury during her trial: ‘I was entitled to a little break. I think I’m entitled to go and sit on a beach in Goa. ‘But you can sit on a beach in Goa watching the sunset and still be in a pretty desperate state.’ She also went on her Facebook page to describe Buenos Aires as ‘magical - like a new lover’. And her bank statements showed a six-month period where large sums of money were withdrawn from cash machines in Argentina - but not a single transaction occurred back in the UK. Johnson had claimed someone in the South American country had copied her card - while she had remained totally bed-ridden at her mother’s in Builth Wells, mid Wales. She also insisted transactions at stores including Ann Summers, lingerie outlet Victoria’s Secret and a luxury bedding firm had been made by her teenage son.","Former model Tracy Johnson, 52, claimed she was ‘prisoner in own home’

"By . Jill Reilly . A former Afghanistan Marine who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder  has found refuge in rowing the length of the Mississippi river. The trip to the mouth of the river at the Gulf of Mexico took Joshua Ploetz, 69 days, about 50 of them spent paddling. But Ploetz said he needed every inch of the more than 2,500-mile river to paddle away the demons of the war, or at least calm them a bit. Ploetz, 30, from Winona, Minnesota, returned from the war eight years ago after being injured by a roadside bomb, suffering a minor stroke and watching his friends die. But adapting to civilian life proved difficult. Relationships failed, employment was hard to come by and, Ploetz said, he had an overwhelming feeling of being 'lost.' Scroll down for video .

The group of seven friends were travelling home from a Bendigo visit before the driver lost control on the Calder Freeway just south of Macedon Woodend Road just after 11pm on Friday.

The group of seven friends were travelling in a four-wheel-drive when the driver lost control . Police said the driver, a 20-year-old from Glenroy, suffered minor injuries and was taken to the Western Hospital. Speaking from his hospital bed, Steven Luu, 17, from Kensington told News.com.au that the group of friends knew each other from Hawthorn Secondary College, which is now closed. 'We were just coming back from Bendigo for a visit, it was a place we wanted to go,' he said. 'A rabbit ran on the road. It’s really tragic what happened, they were such good friends. I’m still in a bit of shock.'

I felt helpless.' Detective Sargent David Yeoman said it appeared the driver had swerved to avoid a hazard.

Reverend Martin Howard, who is married with children, was banned from the ministry after confessing to church bosses about his relationship with a married woman from his congregation. Senior church officials in Bournemouth, Dorset, banned the Reverend for five years following an investigation. Reverend Martin Howard (pictured), who is married with children, was banned from the ministry after confessing to church bosses about his relationship with a married woman from his congregation . Senior church officials banned the Reverend for five years following an investigation into his affair with a woman from his congregation at St Mary's Church in Bournemouth, Dorset (pictured) Rev Howard, who is his 40s, publicly defended the sanctity of marriage last year after he displayed a poster at his church condemning gay marriage. Liz Howard, the wife of Rev Howard who has been banned from the ministry for adultery . The fluorescent green sign, posted outside the St Mary’s Church in Ferndown, Dorset, stated: ‘Marriage = 1 Man + 1 Woman’. At the time, he said: ‘The Government has no mandate to change the definition of marriage, and civil partnerships already give equal rights to same-sex couples. ‘Changing the law would leave clergy like me open to charges of discrimination if I refused on principle to take a same sex wedding. Is that really the tolerant society we want to create? ‘In displaying our poster, we hope marriage as we have received it will be maintained.’ And in the face of criticism from equal rights groups, he preached that ‘society is much stronger when marriage is promoted, honoured and protected’. But he was exposed as a hypocrite after the church found out about his affair with a married woman. He was handed a five-year ban by the . Diocese of Salisbury, the seventh largest Church of England area . covering Dorset and most of Wiltshire.

I’d . just throw it straight in the bin. I wouldn’t even put them on, I’d just . throw them in the bin – it was just a release.’ However, she said . Beckham’s well-documented love of male grooming – and the subsequent . mainstream acceptance of facials, massages and waxing for both sexes – . encouraged her to take the next step. She explained in an interview on . Good Morning  Britain: ‘When David Beckham came out, when they started . waxing themselves and everything else, I thought “this is good, I can go . to the beauty parlour now”, I can do things like that and I can say . “well, David Beckham does it, all these footballers do it, what does it . matter?”’ Maloney, a former boxing manager who guided Lennox Lewis . to the world heavyweight title, revealed at the weekend that she was now . living as a woman. She retired from boxing in October – claiming to . have fallen out of love with the sport. In fact, she had walked away . to begin preparing for her new life as a woman. Maloney, who has three . daughters from two marriages, is now more than a year into the . transition period. Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. So far Maloney has undergone hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. Fame and fortune: Maloney was one of Britain's great boxing promoters and made huge sums from the success of Lennox Lewis (pictured together after a win in Atlantic City in 2007) Release: Kellie said when her father died four years ago it lifted the lid and helped her eventually start her journey . ‘Living . with the burden any longer would have killed me,’ she said. ‘The . feeling of wanting to be like and dress like a woman has always been . there. I consciously made the decision that I wouldn’t dress like a . woman, but it was a constant urge.’ Maloney also admitted she knew from . the age of three she was born in the wrong body but kept it hidden for . decades fearing being branded 'a pervert'. 'It was probably when I was three or four I knew I was different,' Treat: Kellie said that the first thing she did was get her ears pierced when the news broke . 'I didn't like what I saw of myself in the mirror, but I thought it must just be something in my head. 'I feared being seen as a freak, a pervert. I felt I didn't want to be different. I thought it'd just go but it didn't.' After 'living in the shadows' the 'lid came off the day my father died four years ago', she said. 'I’d . been having counselling for ten years and I used to phone up the . counsellor, I’d only do it on the phone because I didn’t want anyone to . know who I was and I would say to this counsellor, ""tell me I’m not a . transsexual"", and he said, ""well I can’t tell you that but you keep . phoning so there must be something there"", and it just took, I don’t . know, I couldn’t get rid of it. 'I . think I would have killed myself if I hadn't come out. I was angry with . my children, my wife, it was destroying my relationships. That's what . made me do it'. Maloney said the hardest part was telling second wife Tracey. The pair are now separated, but remain ‘very good friends’. 'We’re separated now, divorced, but she’s very supportive. One of the saddest things, when it was coming out of my mouth, when I was telling her, I wanted to sort of catch it and put it back in, and I realised once I’d said it and we looked at each other, we knew that our marriage was over. 'But we are very good friends and we’re soul mates still, and my children have been first class. My eldest daughter has really been with me. Sophie is with me today, my 19 year old, and my young 13 year old, she’s really good. I’ve got a great team of support around me - TG [transgender] pals, everyone has been really fantastic.' Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, is now more than a year into the transition period, learning to live as a different gender. Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. So far the process has involved secret hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. Kellie had hoped to live secretly as a woman for 18 months before releasing a book next year about her journey. But she was betrayed by someone in her support group. 'I have said it was like living in the shadows. I didn't want to leave the house and for a while I started living as Frank again'. Fresh start: Kellie, pictured leaving ITV's studios with her dogs, thanked the boxing community and the many other people who have supported her . Family: Kellie Maloney was supported by her 19-year-old daughter Sophie at ITV's studios . She said today she felt happy and liberated by what has happened since. 'On . Sunday (when the story came out) it was a great release. I had always . wanted to get my ears pierced but thought it would make things too . obvious. The first thing I did was get my ears pierced'. Asked . how she felt about any negative comments, she said: 'I received so many . of them in my boxing business they'd just be like water off a duck's . back now to me. Really, that life has prepared me for this transition.' Maloney, famous for wearing Union flag suits in the ring, guided Lewis to the undisputed world heavyweight title during a successful 30-year career and her former charge has backed her since she spoke out to the Sunday Mirror. Lewis said previously: 'I was just as shocked as anyone at the news about my former promoter and my initial thought was that it was a wind-up. 'However, having taken some time to read Kellie's statements, I understand better what she, and others in similar situations, are going through. I think that all people should be allowed to live their lives in a way that brings them harmony and inner peace. 'I respect Kellie's decision and say that if this is what brings about true happiness in her life, than so be it.'","The 61-year-old told Good Morning Britain she lived 'two lives' for decades .

"By . Julian Robinson For Mailonline . A man has been awarded damages after being attacked by vigilantes when posters were pushed through his neighbours' doors - wrongly describing him as a paedophile. Paul Ford, 63, was hounded in a libellous campaign organised by taekwondo teacher Kathy Hook, following a fall-out between the pair at the club where she taught. The A4 flyers, delivered to homes in the Bentley area of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, read: 'Do you know you have a paedophile living on your street?' Paul Ford, pictured, claims he was attacked by vigilantes after posters were pushed through his neighbours' door wrongly describing him as a paedophile . The leaflets also listed Mr Ford's name and address, and added: 'Arrested last year - found with videos of children in his house.' Mr Ford said: 'I've been attacked and suffered black eyes and had my scooter smashed up. 'My life has been a nightmare.' Mrs Hook was given a police caution following the incident in 2011 but Mr Ford took civil action against her because he wanted to clear his name. At Sheffield County Court - in one of few cases where an individual has sued for libel - the allegations were found to be untrue and the videos were in fact innocent films of his own children, now adults, at a martial arts class. Mr Ford was awarded £10,000 in libel damages, £1,850 for legal advice costs, and £650 for his time on the case. 'I've been attacked and suffered black eyes and had my scooter smashed up because of these flyers. 'My life has been a nightmare since this. I feel I can get my life back. Paul Ford was hounded in a smear campaign organised by taekwondo teacher Kathy Hook, pictured) following a fall-out between the pair at the club where she taught . 'Ill probably get the money eventually but that's not the point. I needed my name clearing. The flyers said I'd done this and I had done none of it.' Mrs Hook, 44, who didn't attend the hearing as she was on holiday, admitted she was 'hot-headed' when she carried out the campaign. But she claimed she had previously been harassed by Mr Ford in a long-running dispute over the Ultimate Taekwondo club she runs in Armthorpe, South Yorkshire. According to Mr Ford's solicitor, Brian Wrigley, the row developed 'like an acorn that grew into an enormous oak tree and became out of control'. Mr Ford said his dispute with Kathy Hook began in 2002 when two of his children were members of the club. One of them sustained injuries, he said, sparking a long-running row over health and safety. In December 2003, the children were 'kicked out' of the club, which Mr Ford said was down to his grievance with its leader. Mrs Hook has disputed much of what Mr Ford has said and claims he has subjected her to '12 years of misery and harassment'. Mrs Hook, who lives in a detached house with her family, says she will not be able to pay the £12,500 court order by the deadline of October 29, and is planning a counter-claim. The unfounded allegation referred to videos Mr Ford took of his two children, who are now adults, when they took part in martial arts classes. But he maintains the videos, which can be found on YouTube and are available for anyone to view at his house, are completely innocent and contain nothing of a sexual nature. Paul Ford, pictured, was awarded £10,000 in libel damages, £1,850 for legal advice costs, and £650 for his time on the case . Mrs Hook, who represented Great Britain at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and has won medals in World Championships, competing in more championships than any other British competitor, contended the films showed other children who he did not have permission to film. The case went to court last year but Mrs Hook's request for an adjournment because of a pre-booked  holiday clashing with the court date was refused by the judge. Mrs Hook, who was named the Unsung Hero of Yorkshire in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards in 2012, said: 'I will be issuing proceedings against him for harassment and slander for what he has said about me. 'I think the judgement is totally unfair and people will see him as the hero in this. To me he has won a hollow victory.' She said that as she could not attend the court hearing she was unable to put in a counter claim and that had she been present, there would have been 'no victory'. 'I will be appealing the decision and will issue court proceedings against him,' she added. Referring to the libellous flyers, she added: 'In hindsight it was not a good idea. It was something I did on my own. 'I did it in a hot-headed moment. It was a stupid thing to do. You learn from your mistakes.'","Posters wrongly claimed that disabled Paul Ford, 63, was a paedophile .

The man wore a white Londis plastic bag during the bizarre raid, which was caught on CCTV and terrified a lone female shop worker in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Police have now released footage of the incident in the hope they can track down the bag-wearing suspect. Scroll down for video . A head for disguises: A knife-wielding robber wore a white Londis plastic bag on his head during a bizarre raid . Terrifying: The man pulled a knife on the surprised shop worker and helped himself to cash from the till . The footage shows the man walking into a Day One store in Bennetts Gate, Hemel Hempstead, at 8.45am on May 9. With his eyes - and at one point his nose - poking out from gaps in the bag, he walked to the wine aisle while the shop worker was serving another customer. Once the customer had left he suddenly pulled out the knife, which appeared to be a few inches long, and demanded cash from the stunned worker. He helped himself to money from the till before dashing off, leaving the worker shocked but unhurt. So far police have been unable to find the suspect, and the incident featured last night on the BBC's Crimewatch in a bid to track him down.

"By . James Rush For Mailonline . A 'heartbroken' polar bear in South Africa has died in a zoo after months of pining over the death of his partner earlier this year. Officials at Johannesburg Zoo said Wang, 28, believed to be the last polar bear in Africa, was put down because it was suffering from heart and liver failure. The zoo said Wang had been pining over the death in January of polar bear GeeBee, his partner of 27 years at the zoo. Scroll down for video . Wang, the last polar bear at Johannesburg Zoo (pictured on Valentine's Day this year), has been put down after suffering from heart and liver failure . He was the last remaining polar bear at the zoo, which has said it does not plan to replace the animals. Keepers had given Wang special treats following the death of GeeBee and even a Valentine's Day celebration to try to cheer him up. Born in 1985, Wang arrived at the Johannesburg zoo one year later as part of a conservation exchange program with a zoo in Japan. Zoo spokesman Jenny Moodley told The Telegraph that for a day after the death of GeeBee, Wang would not let zookeepers take her body. Ms Moodley said the bear also became 'quite aggressive' following the loss of his partner. Last month MailOnline reported how Argentina had refused to relocate its lonely polar bear to a wildlife park that specializes in the species, despite a petition by more than half a million people. Born in 1985, Wang arrived at Johannesburg Zoo (file picture) one year later as part of a conservation exchange program with a zoo in Japan . Animal rights activists had been calling on the 28-year-old animal to be moved to a zoo in Winnipeg, Canada, over claims that it was showing signs of stress. But Gustavo Pronotto, director of Mendoza Zoo, said that the bear, named Arturo, was too elderly to make the nearly 6,000-mile journey. Pronotto said that to make the two-day journey, Arturo would have to be sedated which carries risk for an animal his age. 'Arturo is close to his caretakers. We just want everyone to stop bothering the bear,' he said. He added that the behaviors which others had highlighted as signs that the animal was in distress were merely down to his age. A team of vets in Argentina ruled in February that the polar bear should remain in the zoo. Arturo's plight came to the attention of animal rights advocates, who dubbed him 'the world's saddest animal' when they launched a petition to call for him to be moved. The polar bear has been alone in his enclosure since his partner, Pelusa, died of cancer in 2012.","Polar bear Wang has been put down after suffering heart and liver failure .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Removed: Rev. Meier, pictured, has been thrown out of the Church of England following his eight-month affair with an 18-year-old girl . A married vicar who had an eight-month affair with a teenage girl has been expelled from the Church of England for eight years. Reverend Paul Meier, 47, started the relationship when the girl, who attended two church youth groups he ran, was 18. Rev Meier was youth missioner when he met the girl in the deanery of Storrington, West Sussex. The clergyman was suspended a year . ago from a . new post in Horsmonden, Kent, following the girl's complaints to church authorities. According to The Mirror, Rev Meier and his wife had been friends with the girl's family for almost six years before the relationship began in 2008. The father-of-two, told his wife Saskia he wanted to end their marriage because of the affair. A church disciplinary tribunal ruled that Rev Meier's . behaviour was 'inappropriate to the work of a clerk in Holy Orders', . after he admitted gross misconduct. The tribunal, held earlier this week, also heard how he had abused the trust placed . in him by his family, the girl, and her family. He has been expelled from the Church of England for at least eight years and removed from his post. Judge John Lodge, who led the tribunal into the allegations, said in a report: 'One day he kissed her and a full sexual relationship between them developed. 'Mr Meier told the complainant he wanted to leave Saskia and be with the complainant. 'Saskia did not know of her husband's adultery at that time, but his attention towards the complainant distressed her.' The tribunal also heard details of Mr Meier's behaviour after the girl started to show signs of distress due to the affair. Suspension: The Reverend was working in a new post in Horsmonden, Kent, pictured, when he was suspended . In the middle of 2008 the girl's parents sent her to a psychiatric unit where she began to recover. Rev Meier visited the girl, during which time he told his wife he wanted to leave her. Mrs . Meier told the tribunal: 'I advised him to go on a two-week holiday to . think things through by himself. He came back willing to stay, and our . relationship has grown steadily, with a lot of hard work and . forgiveness.' The judge said: 'The complainant . became mentally disturbed, as evidenced by attempts to self-harm, and she . acted bizarrely, eg locking the family out of the house one evening. Distress: The news has shocked residents of the town, pictured, where the father-of-two had been working . 'Mr Meier admits the complainant self-harmed and that she told him about it.' 'Rather than cease . his misconduct and provide her with the support she needed and deserved, . he allowed things to continue unchanged.' However, the judge said it . was 'to his credit that he has sought to rebuild his marriage' and that . several people had written in support of him. Mr Meier was not at the rectory where he lives this week, and was not available to comment.","Reverend Paul Meier, 47, started the relationship when the girl was 18 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . We're regularly encouraged to pay close attention to the environmental cost of our holidays, but now there's a cruise to take a tour of the devastation that mankind has allegedly caused. Tourists can now take a trip through the melted Northwest Passage to see the sights of the Arctic, while it still exists as we know it. The luxurious month-long grand tour will give climate-curious tourists the chance to see endangered Arctic animals such as polar bears in their quickly disappearing natural habitat. The ultimate journey? Departing from the Gulf of Alaska, (mapped) the 31-day journey will navigate the Northwest Passage, around Alaska and into the Beaufort Sea, through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and on to Greenland, before ending in New York City . Sail date: August 16, 2016 – for 32 days . Ship: Holds 1,070 passengers plus crew, weighs 68,000 tonnes and is 13 decks tall. Itinerary: Flexible with ‘expedition days’ finalised 14 hours in advance to coincide with favourable weather conditions. Possible adventures: Helicopter, Zodiac and kayaking trips plus Tundra treks with guides. Experts: 14 naturalists, explorers, scientists, historians and photographers on board. Extra lectures and photography workshops will be available and a local Arctic guide will give an insight into the Inuit community. Wildlife: Seals and walruses will be seen throughout the trip. In Davis Strait, Crystal Serenity might encounter humpback whales and Beluga and bowhead whales are possible. Musk-ox might be seen on shore, either in Canada or Greenland, and the Northwest Passage boasts teaming colonies of kittiwakes, guillemots and murres. The company said: ‘In general, wildlife along the Northwest Passage is unpredictable and often difficult to spot… while polar bears thrive in this region, there is no guarantee that any will be seen on the transit or that the ship will be able to approach within a few miles.’ Temperature: Highs of 9°C (48F) during the day and lows of –2°C (28F) at sea. Environmental impact: Not currently known. Conservationists claim that warmer . temperatures are threatening the animals’ existence and the cruise . is designed to give wildlife enthusiasts the chance to see a plethora . of creatures unique to the Arctic, while they still can, tapping into what some might say is a form of 'disaster tourism'. There is no mention of the . environmental impact of the journey itself, however, with some experts estimating that cruise trips are far more damaging than journeys taken by aeroplane. The ‘once-in-a-lifetime expeditionary voyage’ is being offered by Crystal Cruises from almost £14,000 ($24,000) and is set to appeal to wildlife lovers and those curious about our changing world. The luxurious Crystal Serenity cruise ship will be the first to traverse the Northwest Passage, ‘a mystical Pacific-Atlantic sea route far beyond the Arctic Circle that for centuries captured the imaginations of kings, explorers and adventurers,’ the firm says. It is only in recent years that the passage has become passable in the summer, because of melting ice. Until 2009, the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year, but climate change has reduced the pack ice and made the waterways more navigable. Departing from the Gulf of Alaska, the . 32-day journey will navigate the Northwest Passage, around Alaska and . into the Beaufort Sea, through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and on to . Greenland, before docking in New York City. ‘The company says: ‘Here in the Land of the Midnight Sun, you will bear witness to breath-taking landscapes that few have ever seen, from spectacular glaciers to towering fjords, and experience nature that is truly wild.’ The trip is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on August 16, 2016. In the lap of luxury: The luxurious Crystal Serenity cruise ship (pictured) will be the first to traverse the Northwest Passage, 'a mystical Pacific-Atlantic sea route far beyond the Arctic Circle that for centuries captured the imaginations of kings, explorers and adventurers,' the firm says . See them while you can: Tourists will be taken on ‘unplanned . expedition days’ to take in wildlife such as of polar bears (stock image pictured left), narwhals, (right) musk oxen and Caribou. But the company warns that endangered animals such as the polar bear may prove elusive . The company has been planning the cruise for over two years. It chose the August-September sail date because it says it is the optimum time of year to navigate the Northwest Passage. ‘This . is when the Arctic ice significantly recedes allowing vessels to safely . transit with minimal risk of encountering ice concentrations,’ the . company says. ‘And here in a land where the sun rarely sets, you have more time to absorb every last detail of this extraordinary journey.’ Tourists will be taken on ‘unplanned expedition days’ to take in wildlife such as of polar bears, narwhals, musk oxen and Caribou. They could also go kayaking in protected bays and trekking in the tundra with professional guides and scientists as well as taking a tour of the environment in small Zodiacs – rubber motorised boats. An escort vessel will follow the cruise ship packed with ‘adventure equipment’ including a platform for wilderness landings and a helicopter. The crew will be accompanied by a 14 naturalists, explorers, scientists, historians and photographers to point out and document the sights. ‘Once-in-a-lifetime experiences include the chance to see rare wildlife in its purest form - from humpback, beluga and bowhead whales, to seals and walruses, musk-oxen on shore and teaming colonies of kittiwakes, guillemots and murres in flight,’ according to the brochure. Holidaymakers will also have the chance to meet indigenous people in small groups, which the firm says is designed to benefit and not disrupt the locals and their way of life. The cruise claims to balance ‘rare adventure with intimate exploration,’ but there is no mention of its carbon footprint, which may seem unusual seeing as the itinerary is designed to appeal to people who love the great outdoors and are interested in the rapidly changing landscape. Crystal Cruises has not disclosed figures showing the cruise’s environmental impact on its icy surroundings. But . estimates made in 2013, indicate that the carbon footprint of a cruise . ship can be three times as large as a flight, if measured per customer, PopSci reported. A spokesman for the company told MailOnline: 'Crystal . Cruises will, as it always has, meet or exceed all environmental . regulatory requirements for the regions in which our ships sail with . respect to air, water and garbage discharge. 'For . the Northwest Passage transit this includes the voluntary use of . 0.1per cent sulfur content Marine Gas Oil which is extremely clean . burning and is well in excess of the existing environmental . regulations.  This, along with a relatively slow transit speed and using . one third of our engines for a vast majority of the cruise, will . achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint.' Getting less icy: The trip is two years is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on August 16, 2016. This satellite image of the Northwest Passage shows the ice retreating in August 2012 . In 2008, cruise company Carnival said that on average, its ships released 712kg of carbon dioxide per kilometre. Taking into consideration the number of passengers they carried, experts worked out that a journey was 36 times as damaging as a Eurostar trip when it came to carbon emissions, although unlike the Eurostar, people were living on board for a period of time. As well as damaging emissions, the United Nations Environment Programme's magazine, Our Planet, estimated that the average cruise ship generates 7.7lbs (3.5kg) of rubbish per holiday maker, every day, The Telegraph reported. Some of the ships also emit sewage and bilge water, with one cruise ship estimated to produce 19 tonnes of solid waste daily, according to Outside Online. As the ships are designed like small floating cities, they are more than a mode of transport and cannot be directly compared to flights, but like cities consume large amounts of power. In a book entitled Paradise Lost at Sea: Rethinking Cruise Vacations, expert Ross Klein claims that some ships have a carbon footprint that is three times as large as a Boeing 747, if averaged out by the number of passengers on board. Figures from a carbon offsetting business, Climate Care, suggest that the ships emit twice as much carbon dioxide per mile as aeroplanes and can also belch out sulphur - which causes acid rain - if barrel bunker fuel is used, which is less refined than diesel. Amazing scenery: Holidaymakers could go kayaking in protected bays and trekking in the tundra with professional guides and scientists who will help them understand the various animals and landscapes of the Northwest Passage (pictured) Air pollution from ships can equivalent to 12,000 cars and one estimate places it as high as 350,000 cars, Resource UK reports. A spokesman for the cruise company said: 'Crystal has a well-trained and environmentally-conscious crew, and we will operate, as we always do, with a “nothing overboard” policy. No garbage or food waste of any kind will be thrown overboard. 'Some garbage will be burned in the incinerator on board, while other trash, recycling and food waste will be collected and stored on board the escort vessel. This waste will then be offloaded outside of the Arctic communities into specific collection facilities that are equipped to handle these waste streams.' Rod Downie, polar programme manager at WWF-UK, old MailOnline: 'The loss of Arctic summer sea ice is perhaps the most visible sign of climate change on our planet. 'With new international shipping routes such as the Northwest passage opening up as a result of less sea ice, the risk of major shipping accidents and trans-boundary oil spills increases. 'These would have massive long-term impacts for Arctic communities and wildlife, including polar bears and beluga whales. It is increasingly urgent that the International Maritime Organisation in London agrees a robust Polar Code for safe and environmentally responsible shipping in the region.'","Luxurious month-long grand tour will give tourists the chance to see endangered Arctic animals and threatened icy landscape .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Colin Farmer was Tasered by a police office who mistook his while stick for a samurai sword. The officer was not sacked . A police officer who shot a blind man with a Taser when he mistook his white stick for a samurai sword will keep his job - and has only been asked to apologise to the man. Colin Farmer, 64, was hit with the stun gun in Chorley, Lancashire, by PC Stuart Wright in 2012 as he walked to his local pub. Mr Farmer, who thought he was suffering a stroke, was then handcuffed by the police constable - who was responding to reports of a man in the town centre with a sword. Mr Farmer was not released until the arrival of another officer whom PC Wright told: 'I think I’ve got the wrong person.' Lancashire Constabulary held a two-day . disciplinary hearing following a . recommendation from the Independent . Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) the officer had a case to answer for . gross misconduct. The meeting concluded PC Wright was not guilty of 'gross incompetence' - . but should be issued with a performance improvement notice and that he . be told to apologise personally to Mr Farmer. Mr Farmer condemned the decision today. He said: 'This officer broke a rule, he should never have shot a blind man in the back from 6ft away. There was no urgency for him to pull the trigger -I could very easily have been dead.' 'The odds have not been in my favour. Since it happened I have been diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder because if what has been going on. 'Before it happened I had only been out of hospital five months after having a brain haemorrhage and stroke, my brain hadn't even had chance to recover and then this. Let's just say I'm happy that at least he won't be getting a promotion. 'He can live with his conscience, but I did nothing wrong, I'm the innocent victim. If he can shoot a blind man and get away with it what signal is that giving out to people. 'It wasn't a mistake, he pulled that trigger on purpose, he could have waited. I have lost faith in the police, I have had no justice. If it can get to this then god help anybody. 'These trigger happy police officers . are killing people, if I had a pacemaker I would be dead by now. I . don't want an apology because it's an insult to me. It seems like he has . treated like a naughty schoolboy when I believe it  was total . negligence on his part.' An investigation by the Independent . Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was launched after the incident in October 2012. It discovered the man was walking away from PC Wright . at the time and posed no threat. Lancashire police found that although PC Stuart Wright failed to perform his duties to a satisfactory standard, his actions did not amount to gross incompetence. He has been asked to apologise to the man . GV of Peter Street where Colin was Tasered. The officer thought the man's white stick was a sword - so shot him with the device before handcuffing him on the floor . A report from the police watchdog found PC Wright failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain if Mr Farmer was carrying a sword before he discharged the Taser. He had used a level of force that was 'unnecessary and disproportionate to the circumstances' and caused further distress to Mr Farmer by detaining him in handcuffs despite it being 'obvious' he had the wrong man, it added. PC Wright also ignored instructions and radio transmissions about how to deal with the incident, and failed to comply with local and national guidelines on the use of Taser. IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'Mr Farmer was subjected to what must have been a terrifying ordeal. 'Our view was that Pc Wright could and should have listened to instructions from his force controller and taken greater steps to ascertain whether Mr Farmer was the sword-carrying man that had been reported by members of the public and when he realised his mistake should have acted quicker to put things right. 'There is public concern about use of force, and, particularly, Taser. Incidents such as this do little to ease that concern. Mr Farmer thought he was having a stroke when he was hit by the device, one pictured . 'I hope that the personal apology to Mr Farmer allows the officer to reassure him that he will learn lessons from these events and that the improvement plan for the officer and measures taken by the force to improve its training and communications prevent further incidents such as this.' In a statement, Lancashire Constabulary said: 'The officer was dealt with under Stage 3 of the Police (Performance) Regulations 2008 for Gross Incompetence by a panel made up of Assistant Chief Constable Tim Jacques, Chief Supt Richard Goodenough-Bayly and Mr Ashley Judd, the Constabulary’s Head of Human Resources. 'The panel found that the officer failed to perform his duties to a satisfactory standard on October 12, 2012, though his actions did not amount to gross incompetence. PC Stuart Wright had been called out on patrol following reports someone was in the town centre with a samurai sword, one example pictured . 'The officer will be issued with a . Written Improvement Notice and be required to demonstrate specific . performance improvements over a set timescale. Additionally, the officer . has expressed considerable regret over this incident and arrangements . will be made for him to offer a personal apology to Mr Farmer.' Tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and CS gasThey have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across England and Wales since they were introduced in 2004Police use a U.S. manufactured £500 X26 model which fires a 50,000-volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wiresIt has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably . Mr Jacques added: 'First and foremost I would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Farmer on behalf of the Constabulary for what happened that evening and the resulting distress and anxiety he undoubtedly suffered. 'The officer made a dreadful mistake when he discharged his Taser, but was acting on a reasonable and honestly held belief that his actions were necessary to protect the public. The officer did not perform his duties to a satisfactory standard but we did not feel that this amounted to gross incompetence. 'In addition to the findings relating to the individual officer this investigation has raised a number of issues for the constabulary to consider including the training given to officers carrying Taser.” Last year, Mr Farmer's lawyers said they had lodged a civil claim at the High Court for damages on grounds of assault and battery, false imprisonment and suffering inhumane and degrading treatment. Last August the Crown Prosection Service said it would not take any criminal action against the officer as there was insufficent evidence to prove he had not been mistaken.","Colin Farmer, 64, hit with a Taser as he walked to a pub in October 2012 .

"By . Sean Gallagher . The opening weekend of the new league season in Macedonia was marred by horrific scenes after a fan tragically had his hand blown off by a police stun grenade. According to local reports the incident occurred deep into injury-time of the match between local rivals Pelister and Vardar - locally known as the 'Eternal derby of Macedonia'. As the game entered the closing stages local riot police decided to pen in the visiting Vardar fans. VIDEO WARNING: Graphic images and video follow below . Tragic: The Vardar fan is clearly in distress after the horrific incident that took place at the weekend . Disturbance: The stun grenade causes chaos in the visiting away section . Agony: The injured man calls for help after losing his left hand in the horrific incident . Chaos: Other fans were also injured during the incident which took place at the weekend . That consequently led to disputes between the away fans and the police. A police officer is then believed to have dropped a stun grenade into the stand causing significant unrest in the Vardar end, before one supporter attempted to pick up the grenade. Tragically that supporter lost his hand with many others suffering injuries as a result of the incident. Vardar consequently won the match 1-0, however their manager Sergey Andreyev told reporters after the game that 'this win means nothing when a fan loses a hand'.","The incident occurred on the opening weekend of the new league season .

"By . Shari Miller . Police officers who suffered an injury while at work have claimed as much as £85million in compensation in the last five years - including for accidents involving insect bites, potholes and falling off chairs. The figures - which showed one individual alone received £130,000 after falling over and breaking his hip in a store room while on duty - were revealed by a Freedom of Information request made by The Sun. The claims, which were made between 2008 and 2013, racked up at least £75million in payouts, but the total figure is thought to be anywhere up to £85m. Payment row: Police officers claimed as much as £85m compensation for accidents while at work between 2008 and 2013 - at a time when budgets were being cut by 20% . Five forces declined to provide an answer to the FOI request. The staggering amount paid out in compensation is revealed at a time when considerable cuts are being made to police budgets. In recent years, the Home Office announced police funding would fall by 20 percent by 2015 and more than 10,460 officers would lose their jobs. As a result, earlier this year it was reported that the number of police officers in England and Wales is now at the lowest level in more than a decade. The 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding. There has also been a marked decline in the number of community support officers, or . PCSOs, with current figures showing 13,552 - down six per cent in a year. Critics have pointed out that some of the claims were more legitimate than others - and those that were frivolous should not have been accepted. Jonathan Isaby of The Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'In some cases the reasons behind claims are frankly ridiculous and should be rejected.' Among the compensation claims made were one for £3,300 after an officer caught his finger in a vacuum cleaner. £130,000 for an officer who fell over and broke his hip in a store room. £12,019 for an officer shot by a colleague in Sussex after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. £3,300 for an officer who caught his finger in a vacuum cleaner. £2,000 was approved for an officer who fell off his chair. £4,400 for an officer in Staffordshire who was given an ill-fitting protective vest. Four-figure sums for officers who tripped in potholes. Other claims were made for insect bites and officers who fell off their bikes. 12,700 staff and officers made claims between 2008 and 2013. Another was given £2,000 - after falling off his chair - while four-figure sums were accepted for officers who fell in potholes. Insect bites and falling off bikes were other injuries put forward for compensation claims, while one officer received £4,400 for an ill-fitting protective vest. Meanwhile an officer shot accidentally by a colleague in Sussex was given £12,019 for post-traumatic stress disorder. The majority of payouts were in Northern Ireland to officers who suffered hearing loss due to a firearms fault. Not all claims have however been successful or been pursued. In September 2013, PC Kelly Jones,who planned to sue the . owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a . break-in,  dropped her claim for damages. Ms Jones . faced controversy after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, a . garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she . lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene. She had filed against the owner of the Nun's . Bridges Filling Station, claiming he failed to ensure . she was 'reasonably safe' after responding to a reported burglary. She allegedly fell and hurt her leg and wrist while checking the building in August 2012. A . month after she filed her claim Home Secretary Theresa May told the . Police Federation’s annual conference that she wanted to see an end to . 'frivolous' legal claims. She told delegates of the Federation, which had funded WPC Jones' legal costs: 'I know that the vast majority of you are dedicated public servants of the best kind. 'But . when a police officer sues a member of the public because they slipped . on private property - that is simply not the sort of attitude police . officers should exhibit. 'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don’t make frivolous claims.' Ms Jones subsequently dropped the case, with the garage owner welcoming the move as 'a victory for common sense'.

"By . Agence France Presse . A 33-year-old Australian man has plunged to his death in south-east France while attempting to parachute off a cliff. Police said the man had thrown himself off the 2,600-metre peak of Brevent in the French Alps. Rescue workers said he likely died on impact. He was found 'several hundred metres lower in a wooded area below the site,' they said. The Australian was found several hundred metres below the peak . The base jumper had leapt from the 2,600-metre peak in Brevent, south-east France . Two hours later a French base jumper was also killed after hitting a rock face on his descent from Mont Granier in the neighbouring Isere region of southeastern France. The man, aged 52, and described as 'extremely experienced', was found 200 metres below the ledge from which he had jumped. 'He managed get over the first rock face, but not the second,' one of the rescuers said. Investigations have been launched into both accidents. An investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of the accident. On August 6, two base-jumpers, one from Switzerland, the other from France, died in similar accidents in the Alps. A base-jump is defined as a leap off a fixed high point -- the name being an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span (such as bridges) and Earth (natural settings). Unlike skydiving which involves leaping from an aircraft, base jumpers take off with a parachute from a fixed point, usually a cliff or a bridge. The sport carries high risks. A Norwegian study published in 2007 concluded that base-jumping is five to eight times more likely than skydiving to result in injury or death.","Man, 33, had attempted leap off Brevent in south-east France .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Pauline Pearce branded the party 'racist Neanderthals' and said she is quitting Lib Dems . Nick Clegg last night faced embarrassment after his party was branded ‘racist Neanderthals’ by a black woman who was bidding to be Liberal Democrat president. Londoner Pauline Pearce, who became a YouTube sensation when she denounced the 2011 rioters, said she is quitting the Lib Dem presidency contest because of the party’s ‘patronising and racist’ conduct. She was tipped to succeed senior Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, who steps down from the role in October. But she abandoned her challenge yesterday, blaming ‘nasty, underhand’ Lib Dems. ‘I feel hurt and let down,’ she said. ‘The Lib Dems are not the party I thought they were. They have a Neanderthal view of diversity, there is underhand racism and I have been patronised and ridiculed.’ Grandmother Ms Pearce was courted by all three parties and joined the Lib Dems after she confronted knife-wielding yobs in the 2011 riots in London. Her decision to withdraw from the race is a major blow to Mr Clegg, coming hard on the heels of the row over claims Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard was accused of sexually harassing women. Ms Pearce, 47, said ‘prestigious’ people in the party turned against her when it emerged she had been jailed in 1999 for a drugs crime. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was ‘upset that Pauline feels she has been subjected to discrimination and prejudice’ and asked her to report her experiences so they could ‘look at her concerns as a matter of urgency’. Her decision to withdraw from the race is a major blow to Mr Clegg (pictured) coming hard on the heels of the row over claims Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard was accused of sexually harassing women .","Clegg faces embarrassment after his party was branded by Pauline Pearce .

"By . Jack Crone For Mailonline . A group of reckless drivers who turned a public road into a 'life-threatening' racetrack have been banned from driving after footage was posted online and spotted by police. The clip shows the men pulling up in front of crowds of spectators in Tyneside before speeding down the road in their modified vehicles to complete a lap of the area. The men were competing in an organised drag-race around Newcastle's Newburn Premier business park - using traffic lights on Kingfisher Boulevard as makeshift starting signals. Scroll down for video . Reckless: Race took place at Newcastle's Newburn Premier business park in front of watching crowds . Organised: It is believed the race, in which traffic lights were used at starting signals, was pre-planned . A number of spectators used mobile phones to film the cars, which included a Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Nova, tearing around the business park. Video clips of the race, which took place around 7.45pm on July 7 2013, were soon posted online - leading officers from Northumbria Police directly back to the offending drivers. Seven of the men, aged between 19 and 26, have now been convicted of motoring offences, including racing on a public highway, with six being banned from the roads. One of Northumbria Police's leading traffic officers has branded the drivers 'reckless' saying their racing stunt could have cost lives. Banned: Six out of seven of the drivers that were arrested over the incident have been banned from driving . Illegal: Police are warning drivers that modifications made to cars need to be declared to insurance companies . Temporary Chief Inspector John Heckels, who is leading the force's road safety campaign, Operation Dragoon, said: 'The footage showed a number of reckless drivers treating the public roads like a racing track. 'It showed people speeding and racing while other drivers go about their normal journeys and pedestrians are crossing the road. 'Their actions are extremely dangerous, they are putting pedestrians and innocent road users' lives at risk and this behaviour will not be tolerated.' Life Threatening: Chief Inspector John Heckels, of Northumbria Police, has claimed races such as this put people's lives at risk . Police officers came across footage of the race in September 2013 while looking at similar clips as part of an investigation into a fatal collision. After watching footage of the organised race an investigation was launched to trace the drivers. All seven drivers have been convicted of motoring offences. Michael Gibb, 24: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and disqualified from driving for 12 months, fined £350 and ordered to pay court costs of £85. Meiran Al Nawrasy, 25: Charged with making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty and was fined £215. Michael Lister, 22: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and banned from driving for 16 months and fined £100. Kurt Miller, 20: Charged with racing on a public highway. Pleaded guilty and disqualified from driving for 12 months and fined £380. Daniel Leonard, 23: Charged with racing on a public highway and making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty to both offences and got 12-month driving ban, with a £200 fine for racing and £400 fine for the insurance charge. Also ordered to pay £85 in costs. Craig Thompson, 26: Charged with dangerous driving. Pleaded guilty and was given an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months with 40 hours unpaid work and an order for £85 costs. Also disqualified for 15 months and will have to do an extended test to get his licence back. Andrew Barnes, 19: Charged with dangerous driving and making a false declaration to obtain insurance. Pleaded guilty to both offences and was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for six months, banned from driving for 18 months, and ordered to pay court costs of £100. Must take an extended re-test before driving again . Chief Inspector Heckels said these convictions should serve as a warning that police will catch up with dangerous drivers. He also claimed drivers should be wary of making dangerous and illegal modifications to their cars. He added: 'Operation Dragoon was launched to identify and take action against dangerous drivers. Once we were made aware of the videos we took action. Now, as a result, six dangerous drivers are no longer on the roads. 'We are finding more and more that people are not informing their insurance companies about modifications made to their vehicles. 'In this instance three of the seven drivers had failed to disclose modifications to their insurance companies. One of the men had told his insurance company his Vauxhall Nova had a 1.2 litre engine when in fact it had a 2-litre engine. 'This is extremely dangerous, it is a criminal offence and it also voids insurance policies, meaning that any claims made could be rejected and that you would receive no money for your car should you try and claim on its insurance.'","Organised race took place at Newcastle's Newburn Premier business park .

"By . Aap . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has suggested Australia is prepared to send military forces to Iraq if that's what is needed to prevent genocide by the 'murderous hordes' fighting for Islamic State. Mr Abbott on Tuesday said he agreed with US President Barack Obama that the situation in northern Iraq was 'potential genocide'. 'No one wants to stand aside in the face of a potential genocide,' the prime minister said following talks with the British prime minister, senior UK ministers and intelligence officers in London. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has suggested Australia is prepared to send military forces to Iraq . Mr Abbott gave a press conference following talks with the British prime minister, senior UK ministers and intelligence officers in London . Asked if that could include military action Mr Abbott replied: 'Well we certainly don't rule that out.' 'We are talking to our security partners about what we can usefully do to help,' Mr Abbott said. 'The United Kingdom and Australia, and the United States, are acutely conscious of the potential for genocide on Mount Sinjar and elsewhere in northern Iraq and we will do what we reasonably can to protect people.' The Liberal leader stressed there was a fundamental difference between getting involved to prevent genocide and past western interventions in the region for 'geopolitical objectives'. 'This is a fundamentally humanitarian mission designed to protect innocent men, women and children from the murderous hordes that currently confront them,' he said, adding terrorists had been 'crucifying, decapitating, summarily executing people and dealing in a hideous way with woman and children as well as with men'. It's thought 60 Australians are fighting with Islamic State or offshoots in Iraq and Syria. Another 90 Australians are likely supporting them from back home. Mr Abbott on Tuesday said he agreed with US President Barack Obama that the situation in northern Iraq was 'potential genocide' Mr Abbott said he was conscious other countries had a greater capacity to act militarily but insisted 'Australia is not without capacity and we want to use the capacity we have for good'. He refused to say if he'd discussed the issue with Mr Obama but AAP understands he hasn't because Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister David Johnston have held talks with their US counterparts John Kerry and Chuck Hagel in Sydney. Jihadist militants have attacked the large town of Sinjar forcing thousands of mainly Yazidi civilians to flee up a mountain and hide there with little food and water. An international effort is underway to deliver aid to them and hundreds of thousands of other refugees in Kurdistan. Mr Abbott on Tuesday confirmed Australian aircraft will 'shortly' join the humanitarian effort. The Prime Minister stressed there was a fundamental difference between getting involved to prevent genocide and past western interventions in the region for 'geopolitical objectives' It's expected two RAAF C-130 transporters will be assisting with airdrops by the end of the week. The planes, based in Al Minhad in the United Arab Emirates, are awaiting aid supplies to arrive from Australia. Mr Abbott on Tuesday spoke with David Cameron on the phone as the British prime minister is currently on holiday overseas. But he talked in person with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The Australian PM also met with the chairman of the UK joint intelligence committee, John Day, and received a broader security briefing at Thames House. He'll depart for Australia on Wednesday morning arriving home on Thursday night Australian time.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he agreed with US President Barack Obama that the situation in northern Iraq was 'potential genocide'

It's one of the most distinctive and recognisable accents in the UK and now research has found that scouse is also considered to sound the least intelligent, least friendly and least trustworthy in the whole country. An investigation for ITV's Tonight programme found there is a social stigma and snobbery towards particular regional accents, with the scouse accent faring the worst across all categories and one in five Brits admitting to being discriminated against because of how they talk. The Devon accent scored high in all three categories, and came top for friendliness, while Londoners and Scots believed they were most discriminated against.

Three in five people believe Received Pronunciation, spoken by actor Benedict Cumberbatch left, to be the most intelligent accent - almost twice the score of second place Edinburgh. Again, the Liverpudlian accent, spoken by Coleen Rooney, right, fared badly rated the 'most unintelligent' by 37 per cent of people . Liverpudlians sound the least intelligent, according to the research, with an average of 13 per cent of participants voting them 'not all intelligent'.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Rory McIlroy is looking forward to a hero’s welcome in Northern Ireland this weekend and hoping to parade both his major championship trophies at Old Trafford on Saturday. ‘I’ll definitely be at the first game of the season with the Claret Jug and while I don’t know if I can parade the Wanamaker Trophy at the same time, I will try,’ said the Manchester United fan. McIlroy made it two majors in four weeks with his gripping, one-stroke victory in the USPGA Championship on Sunday and will spend the next few days trying to keep his feet on the ground. ‘I’m trying not to think about my place in the game because if you start thinking like that...’ said McIlroy, his voice trailing off. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Coral Daily golf: 8/13 for Europe at home for the Ryder Cup' Man of the moment: Rory McIlroy parades the Wanamaker Trophy and Claret Jug on his Instagram account . ‘I was happy to be a two-time major champion but now I’ve got four and the only active players who have got more are Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. I’m level with Ernie Els and Raymond Floyd who are both in the Hall of Fame, so it is pretty lofty company already. The next one would be huge to pull off because then I’d be alongside Phil and Seve Ballesteros. It’s too much to think about.’ There’s no rest for Rory. After this week he will be back in America for four weeks and the FedEx Cup play-offs — he is the runaway leader for the $10million bonus. Then it is on to the Ryder Cup in 45 days where he is ready to assume the role of team leader. Asked if he thinks he will be a target for the Americans, he replied: ‘I think it’s not only their team who will view me in those terms but my own as well. It’s only my third Ryder Cup but I am ready to be the talisman and drive us forward. I realise I have that responsibility and I am comfortable with it. In my first two I felt out of place offering an opinion but I realise I have a place in the game now that warrants that. I know I can lead this team. Centre of attention: The in-form Northern Irishman has now won two consecutive majors . ‘I don’t know whether seeing my name on the PGA leaderboard affected the other players but you have to think it counted for something, especially after how I have been playing. It is another thing to have in my locker. It was a great feeling to win in a dogfight because I’d never done that before in a major. ‘I think satisfaction and joy are the two things I am most feeling right now. I said at The Open I was determined to keep going forward. I never thought it would happen in my wildest dreams and I know I will probably never have another summer like it.’ American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson said: ‘I just wish he was on my team. He is making the game look easy — he knows it and the rest know it.’ Leading the way: McIlroy is on target to become on of the game's greatest players following his latest triumph .

The 25-year-old opener has been in sensational form for Notts in recent weeks, hitting a breathtaking 141 from 96 balls against Middlesex last Thursday following a sublime ton for England Lions against Sri Lanka A at Taunton last week. Hales has starred in 32 Twenty20 internationals but the selectors have been reluctant to employ his audacious strokeplay in the 50-over arena.

PROBABLE: Cook (capt), Hales, Ballance, Root, Morgan, Bopara, Bell, Buttler (wkt), Stokes, Jordan, Woakes, Tredwell, Anderson, Finn . But that is set to change this week when he is widely expected to be named in a 14-man squad for a five-match series being viewed as an audition for next year’s World Cup. ‘I’m feeling in really good nick across all three formats,’ said Hales after his blistering hundred at Lord’s on Thursday. ‘When you come across patches like this you want to cash in whenever you can. All I can do is knock on the door with performances for Notts and the Lions. 'My performances in T20 for England have been some of the best of my career so far,so hopefully if I do get thechance in one-dayers, I can take some of that experience in and build some big innings in that format as well.’ Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn is expected to return for the series, beginning a week on Monday at Bristol. Jos Buttler will keep wicket, with the selectors undecided whether to retain the highly dependable James Tredwell ahead of Moeen Ali.

Williams, nicknamed ‘Moneylegs’ after going unbeaten for over five years and 151 races as a junior, has proved she has what it takes on the senior stage. Only the stunningly good Dutch Dafne Schippers, was too good for her. Schippers clocked 22.04, the fastest in the world this year, after winning the 100m earlier in the week. ‘I’m so happy,’ said Williams. ‘To come away with two silver medals at senior level, I couldn’t ask for any more. ‘I was trying to chase Dafne down but her time was crazy.

"By . Chris Brooke . TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh yesterday entered the ageism debate about the lack of older women on television with a thinly-veiled blast at the fairer sex. The celebrity gardener, 64, suggested many women used their good looks to boost their careers in their youth and called for ‘less whingeing’ about the issue of the ages of TV stars. Titchmarsh - a charming housewives’ favourite for years - said: ‘Men in television tend to last a bit longer at the end of their careers, but it is women who make hay at the beginning. They don’t complain in their early days when they are disporting themselves on sports cars.’ Debate: Presenter Alan Titchmarsh said women often use good looks to boost their careers during their youth . He added: ‘I’d like to see a mix of all ages on TV and wish there could be less whingeing about it.’ Cut: Former newsreader Anna Ford left the BBC claiming she had been sidelined because of her age . The comments in an interview with the Observer are likely to rekindle the debate over broadcasting ageism. Last month a new study revealed fewer than one in five presenters at major broadcasters over the age of 50 were women. Overall women over 50 make up just 5% of on-screen presenters of all ages and both sexes. The row began when former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won an age discrimination employment tribunal case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show when it moved to a primetime slot. She was 52 at the time and returned to work at the BBC, but later said the apologies and offers of work were ‘clearly just a PR damage limitation exercise.’ Several other high-profile female . presenters have complained about their treatment by TV companies once . they have reached a certain age. Selina Scott was awarded £250,000 after she sued Channel 5 for ageism in 2008 when she was 57. While Anna Ford left the BBC in 2006 aged 62, claiming she has been sidelined because of her age. In . the wake of a multi-million pound contract for David Dimbleby two years . ago, Ford said: ‘I wonder how these charming dinosaurs such as Mr . Dimbleby and John Simpson continue to procure contracts with the BBC, . when, however hard I look, I fail to see any woman of the same age, the . same intelligence and the same rather baggy looks.’ Last month actress Julie Walters also accused broadcasters of ageism, commenting: ‘We’ll always have to campaign against why, for instance, older men on TV news programmes tend to be paired up with younger women. Where’s Anna Ford is what I say.’ O’Reilly, who is now hoping to become a Labour MP at the next election, said: ‘The broadcasters say they are committed to the fair representation of older women, but the figures don’t bear that out.’","Titchmarsh, 64, says women often use their good looks in their youth .

Amanda Lockey, 37, was walking along Dovercourt beach in Essex when she nearly trod on the Second World War grenade which still had its pin in it. The stunned mother-of-two also noticed another two live grenades just feet away and desperately called out to her husband, Bob, 36, and their two young daughters to warn them of the danger. Scroll down for video . Lucky: Amanda Lockey, 37, pictured with husband Bob, 36, had a lucky escape after she stepped just inches from a Second World War live grenade on Dovercourt Beach in Essex . She was on a family day out at the seaside with more than 12 relatives to celebrate her mother's birthday. Mrs Lockey, of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, said: ‘I almost trod on the grenade. Shocking: Amanda Lockey discovered three live Second World War grenades on Dovercourt beach in Essex. Officers confirmed they were left there deliberately . ‘I knew straight away what it was as I had seen grenades in films. ‘I started shouting out to my husband and daughters to be careful because there was a live grenade. ‘I am still in shock now.’ Police were scrambled to the scene and cordoned the area off before a bomb disposal team blew up the three No.36 Mills Bomb hand grenades in controlled explosions. Mrs Lockey, who works as a chef, said: ‘When they exploded the bomb, I’d never heard anything like it. ‘It was the loudest boom I had ever heard. It shook the ground, it shook my clothes and sent mud up everywhere. ‘It is just so frightening to think what could have happened.’ Captain Nick Mathieson, of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, confirmed the grenades appeared to have been placed there on purpose. He said: ‘The grenades were in very good condition and looked like they had been placed on the beach rather than washed up from the sea.' Army sources believe the explosives were dumped there by someone who may have discovered them on clearing out their shed. Mrs Lockey said: 'The grenades had definitely been placed on the sand, they were semi hidden - probably pushed an inch into the beach as I could just see the pins. 'They looked new rather than suffering the effects of being in the sea for more than 50 years. 'There were children playing on the beach and groups of young lads - anything could have happened - it does not bear thinking about.' A spokesman for Essex Police urged anyone with information about the grenades to get in contact and advised people to call 999 should they find an explosive, rather than disposing of it. He said: 'There are many unexploded devices around the county so they will inevitably be found by people out walking or when gardening.'","Amanda Lockey was at Dovercourt beach with her husband and daughters .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . He is the young rugby star who today hopes to kick England to victory against Wales. As fly-half, Owen Farrell will play a pivotal role in the title-deciding Six Nations match in Cardiff. On the touchline will be his proud father, Andy Farrell, one of the England coaches. Legacy: England rugby player Owen Farrell has the game in his blood as the son of former league and union player Andy Farrell, now one of the English team coaches . But what the millions watching don’t know is that the 21-year-old is the product of a teenage romance – and for the first five years of his life he was named Owen O’Loughlin. His mother, Colleen O’Loughlin, gave birth to him just weeks before her 17th birthday. Colleen had met Andy through family friends and they started dating when they were just 14. The teenage sweethearts used to regularly babysit together. Within two years, the pair had left school in Wigan and were young parents – coping with the newborn Owen, who arrived in September 1991. There was no celebratory message printed in the births section of the local newspaper, merely the list of all new mothers from the local hospital showing Owen weighed a healthy 8lb 9oz. Rugby dynasty: Owen with his parents Andy and Colleen when his father picked up his OBE in 2005 . State of origin: Owen Farrell's 1991 birth certificate . Exceptional: Owen, pictured at Millennium stadium yesterday, became - albeit briefly - the youngest player to play in the English Premiership in 2008 . However, he was not at first . registered as a Farrell, but took Colleen’s family name of O’Loughlin. Andy was named on the birth certificate as his father, giving his . occupation as ‘apprentice joiner’. Both . just 16, the pair gave their parents’ addresses for the certificate. The couple married in 1995, changing Owen’s surname to Farrell the . following year. By then, . Andy Farrell was a rugby league star for Wigan who had become the . youngest winner of the Challenge Cup, the sport’s version of the FA Cup, . at 17. He was to become one of the sport’s most decorated players . before switching codes to rugby union. Colleen’s . little brother, Sean, who the teenage sweethearts used to babysit, went . on to become captain of Wigan and a Great Britain player. On Owen’s . re-registered birth certificate, Andy changed his occupation to . ‘professional rugby league player’ and  Colleen Farrell said she was a . ‘fitness instructor’. Within a few years it was clear that Owen had inherited his father’s skills. Andy Farrell has told how his son was drop-kicking a ball before he was two. Owen said in an interview: ‘I was always watching dad lift trophies. 'That made me want to do what he does. I’ve always been there when he’s been training.

He did that once or twice but then I took him to training at Saracens and he soon forgot what he was missing out on.’ Owen’s career progressed at the same rate as his father’s – temporarily being the youngest player to play in the English Premiership in 2008.

"By . Mike Dawes . Billy Hurley III continued to lead the chase for the Greenbrier Classic title - and an Open Championship place - with a third-round 67 at White Sulphur Springs. The 31-year-old has never even recorded a top-three finish in his six seasons on the PGA Tour but put himself in prime position to break his duck by advancing to 12 under par in West Virginia and a two-stroke lead over nearest challenger Angel Cabrera. An opening birdie on day three was offset by a poor chip at the third but the rest of his front nine was exemplary, starting with a calm 10-foot putt at the fourth to move under par again. Eyes on the prize: Billy Hurley III leads the Greenbrier Classic heading into the final round . A precise spinning approach to the ninth set up a birdie and an outward nine of 32 shots. His pitch onto the green at the par-five 12th struck the pin and set up a short birdie putt, and he holed a good left-to-right breaker at the next to move four under par for the day. A miss from 12 feet at the 15th was the one blemish thereafter but the former Navy lieutenant will be happy with his efforts. With Open places on offer to the top four finishers not already qualified - so long as they are in the top 12 - Hurley has a fine chance of a place at Royal Liverpool, albeit with plenty of challengers waiting for him to slip up. Open possibility: Hurley looks set to qualify for next week's Major at Royal Liverpool . Second-placed Cabrera has no such concerns, the Argentinian already in the field for a shot at his third major to add to the 2007 US Open and 2009 Masters. He was 10 under after three trips round The Old White, his third a fine 64 which finished on a high with birdies at 16 and 17 including a huge breaking right-to-left putt from 30 feet on the former hole. Cabrera aside, though, Steve Stricker was the only member of the top 11 not playing for an Open place. The American Ryder Cup player was one of seven players at eight under, a shot behind Kevin Chappell who held third place outright after a one-under-par 69. In contention: American Ryder Cup star Steve Stricker is the only member of the top 11 already qualified . Stricker is alongside compatriots Michael Thompson, Cameron Tringale, Will Wilcox, Joe Durant and Chris Stroud and Colombia's Camilo Villegas. Durant produced one of the shots of the day off the 18th tee, spinning his yellow ball to within six inches before tapping in for a closing birdie. Jim Renner was alone on seven under with seven players sharing 12th place on six under. Five of those - Canada's David Hearn, Swede David Lingmerth and Americans Hudson Swafford, Luke Guthrie and Troy Matteson - are among the host of players chasing a trip to England, though Bubba Watson and Bill Haas are merely warming up for the Merseyside event.","Billy Hurley III has two-stroke lead heading into final round .

"By . Mike Dawes . Phil Mickelson, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Rickie Fowler and some of the world's best golfers took each other on in a flop shot challenge.

Agonising: Thomas Bjorn got closest to the pin after bouncing around the hole . Despite seeing players produce the flop over a living, breathing person for a challenge in the past, this time health and safety prevailed with a cardboard cutout of Lefty. Mickelson had already been using his wedge regularly during the week, starting at the tournament hitting a backward flop shot, followed by a wedge shot off the path leading to a birdie. There was no shortage of messing around, with Russell Know nearly taking the cardboard head clean off, Lee Westwood attempting to stick it through Mickelson's legs, and Miguel Angel Jimenez showing his football skills with a backheel over the cutout. Thomas Bjorn (5cm) took the honours with nearest the pin, from Luke Donald (21cm) in second and Mickelson (39cm) himself in third.

"By . Eleanor Gower . His world famous half sister has just been featured on the cover of Time Magazine's Most Influential issue. But sadly for little Nixon Knowles, life is a far cry from Beyonce's charmed existence. The four-year-old youngster - a product of an affair between Beyonce's father Mathew Knowles and Canadian-born actress Alexsandra Wright - has now moved into a trailer park just outside Los Angeles. Scroll down for video... Sad story: Beyone's four-year-old half brother Nixon Knowles and his mother Alexsandra Wright, have moved in to a trailer park just outside Los Angeles . New footage from Inside Edition features mother and son moving into the park after a judge granted Knowles a substantial cut in his . child support payments from $12,000 to roughly $2,500 a month, due to his dwindling income. This meant Wright could no longer afford the Los Angeles home she lived in with . Nixon. Worse still, a judge has since agreed that Knowles had in fact 'overpaid Wright to the tune of $110,000', according to a Thursday TMZ report. Fortunately, a women’s support group . arranged for the pair to move into a trailer after Wright was forced to go on . public assistance. 'I'm in the middle of a fight for my son's rights,' Wright said when quizzed about her financial struggles. Bleak outlook: The actress spoke to Inside Edition about their move . Little brother: Nixon Knowles is the product of an affair between Alexandra and Beyone's father Matthew Knowles . Most influential: Beyonce is one of the cover stars of Time magazine's famous issue . Far . from expecting Beyonce to use some of her millions to help them, Wright . insists she wants Knowles to accept his parental responsibilities. 'Take accountability. Stand up, do the right thing,' she said. 'It’s not Beyonce’s fault. I don’t hold her accountable. I hold the father of my child accountable.' She claims a recent article suggesting she 'blamed the star singer for her . predicament' led to her receiving a thousand death threats in the last . week alone. 'Because this article said I blamed Beyonce,' said Wright. 'And again, let . me say for the record - it’s not her fault. I’ve never blamed her. I want . the best for her. Everyone's in pain.' Wright laid into Knowles during a TV interview last month, claiming he had never . even met his son. She told Inside Edition: 'You've seen more . of my son than he has.' It previously emerged she was using 'food stamps to . survive' after it was alleged that Knowles owed $32,135,90 in child support. I don't blame Beyonce: Alexandra used a televised interview to send a message to the singer after receiving death threats . But the judge's latest ruling has come down on the side of Knowles, suggesting he should in fact have been only paying Wright $2,485 all along. Knowles will even get credit for 'overpayment', meaning Wright will receive no cash from him for the next three and a half years. She has vowed to 'continue her fight.' However, with Wright on welfare assistance, TMZ suggest that Knowles may still have to make some sort of payment to his former paramour. New home: Alexsandra was helped by a homeless charity after being forced to go on public assistance . According to TMZ, Knowles previously claimed in court he pulled in $127K in 2013, a far cry from the $3M a year he earned as his daughter's manager. Wright conceived her son during an . affair with Knowles, who was married to Beyoncé's mother Tina at the . time - the revelation of the relationship ended their marriage. Beyonce, 32, and sister Solange, 27, are both estranged from their father and didn't attend his wedding when he re-married earlier this . year, tying the knot with former model Gena Charmaine Avery in Houston, .

"By . Julian Robinson . Ukrainian war planes have killed 1,000 rebels in a massive bombardment on separatists, it has been claimed. President Petro Poroshenko has said that 'scores and hundreds' would would be made to pay as he vowed to avenge a deadly missile attack on Ukrainian forces. In exchanges marking a sharp escalation in the three-month conflict, jets struck at the 'epicentre' of the battle against rebels near the border with Russia, a military spokesman said. A Ukrainian man carries his baby through the ruins caused by clashes between Ukrainian army forces and pro-Russian separatists . The planes targeted positions from where separatists, using high-powered Grad missiles, bombarded an army motorised brigade on Friday, killing 23 servicemen. Warplanes also struck at targets near Donetsk, the east's main city where rebels have dug in, destroying a powerful fighter base near Dzerzhinsk, Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the 'anti-terrorist operation' said. 'According to preliminary assessment, Ukrainian pilots ... killed about 500 (rebel) fighters and damaged two armoured transporters,' Mr Lysenko said. In an earlier air attack on a base near Perevalsk, north of Donetsk, two tanks, 10 armoured vehicles and ""about 500"" rebel fighters were destroyed, he said. Rebel representatives denied they suffered big losses and said the Ukrainians were using outdated intelligence on where separatist forces were deployed. A tank lies in ruins near Donetsk, Ukraine. Air strikes are reported to have killed up to 1,000 pro-Russian separatists . Buildings, like this one in Donetsk, have been completely destroyed during the 'sharply escalating' conflict . 'There were no volunteers (rebels) where the Ukrainian aviation was active yesterday,' said a spokeswoman for the Luhansk-based separatists, referring to the Peravalsk attack. Earlier, the border guard service said jet fighters were scrambled to strike at the pro-Russian separatists after they resumed missile attacks on government forces deployed near the frontier with Russia, south-east of the city of Luhansk. In the military action, which began on Friday evening and continued well into Saturday, five Ukrainian servicemen were killed, Lysenko said. There were 16 overflights by Ukrainian fighter jets in all, he said. The surge in violence on Ukraine's border with Russia, south east of Luhansk which is controlled by separatists, sparked fresh Ukrainian accusations against Russia of involvement in the border fighting. One of the strikes took place close to Donetsk where rebel fighters have dug in. Reports suggest 500 rebels were killed in the attack . An elderly man inspects the ruins of a house destroyed after bombardments carried out by Ukrainian forces in the village of Stanitsa Luganskaya, 15km Northeast of Lugansk . Ukraine's Foreign Ministry demanded Russia stop supporting armed groups in its eastern region, and end 'provocations' on the border. 'The Russian side cynically disregards the fact that Ukrainian servicemen and peaceful civilians are being killed at the hands of terrorists whom it is supporting,' the Foreign Ministry said. 'But, on the other hand Russian border guards complained in a letter about Russian household pets being killed by a supposed Ukrainian artillery shell, 500 metres (yards) from the border.' Petro Poroshenko, pictured, said 'scores and hundreds' would be made to pay for a deadly missile attack on Ukrainian forces . The increasing violence will bring a new sense of urgency to diplomatic attempts to end the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. After a pro-Western revolt in Kiev ousted a Moscow-backed president in February, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and pro-Russian separatists seized strategic buildings in towns in the Russian-speaking east, setting up 'people's republics' and declaring they wanted to join Russia. More than 200 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed since then, and hundreds of civilians and rebels have also died. The United States and the European Union have brought in limited sanctions against Russian businesses amid Ukrainian allegations that Moscow has fanned the conflict and turned a blind eye to military equipment and Russian fighters crossing the border. On Saturday, the EU targeted 11 Ukrainian separatist leaders with travel bans and asset freezes, swerving away from fresh sanctions on Russian business to avoid antagonising its main energy supplier. The rebels' missile strike on Friday at a motorised brigade was against part of a contingent of troops sent to the area specifically to try to block military equipment and guns being brought in from Russia to help the rebels. Rebel fighters said Ukrainian fighter planes had also carried out air strikes on Saturday in the eastern town of Horlivka. 'There were a series of powerful explosions. Details are being clarified,' a separatist representative, Konstantin Knyrik, was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Rebels had also carried out mortar and missile bombardment of army checkpoints at Dyakove and Nyzhnoderevechka near Luhansk, the 'anti-terrorist operation' said. Journalists based in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces shelled Maryinka, a suburb, on Friday night and apartment blocks bore traces of fire on Saturday. A woman stands in front of a house destroyed after a bombardment carried out by Ukrainian armed forces in Stanitsa Luganskaya . The bombardment was carried out after President Petro Poroshenko said 'scores and hundreds' would be made to pay for a deadly missile attack on Ukrainian forces . Igor Strelkov, separatist commander in Donetsk, said his men had headed off a plan to move fighters and armour into the area. Subsequent Ukrainian shelling had killed 30 civilians and the number of casualties could rise, he said. Vladyslav Seleznyov, main spokesman for the 'anti-terrorist operation', said the violence there had been caused by rebels out to discredit the Ukrainian armed forces. Poroshenko, whose forces recently seemed to be prevailing over the rebels, vowed on Friday to 'find and destroy' rebels responsible for the missile attack at Zelenopillya, which also wounded nearly 100 and was one of the deadliest yet against government forces.","Kiev says air attacks have killed around 1,000 rebels at 'epicentre' of conflict .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows all too well what is on the line when his side face Besiktas for a place in the group stages of the Champions League. The Gunners head to Istanbul for the first leg of their play-off tie looking to maintain their record of reaching Europe's elite club competition for each of the last 16 campaigns. It is, of course, not all just about prestige, with each Champions League home match estimated to bring in around £3million of additional revenue not to mention lucrative prize money which kicks off at some 8.6 million euro (£7million) for successful qualification. Not like last time: At this stage last year Arsenal eased past Fenerbahce but Wenger knows it won't be easy . Confidence: Wenger hopes that the Gunners can build momentum from their Community Shield win . Arsenal breezed through what was last season a potentially tricky tie against Fenerbahce, coming away from Istanbul with a 3-0 victory before winning 2-0 back at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger, though, is taking nothing for granted against Slaven Bilic's well-organised outfit, who defeated Feyenoord 5-2 on aggregate in the third-round with former Chelsea striker Demba Ba netting a hat-trick in the second leg. 'I believe it will be a very tough game and a very important one for us. We want to be in the Champions League group stage,' said Wenger. 'Besiktas had a convincing result against Feyenoord, and so for us we have the luck to play the first game away. Tough task: Wenger is pleased to be playing the second leg at home against a strong Besiktas side . New signing: Chile star Alexis Sanchez has arrived at the Emirates Stadium keen to make a big impact . Absent: Neither Podolski or Ozil are likely to be fit for the trip to Turkey after their World Cup exploits . 'We know what is at stake of course and want to be highly focused for this game.' Besiktas' Vodafone Arena ground is being redeveloped, so Tuesday night's match will take place at the 72,000-seater Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where Liverpool famously beat AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League. German-born Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is of Turkish descent, but unlikely to get the chance to play in the first leg as he has only just returned from an extended break following the World Cup. Arsenal added Chile forward Alexis Sanchez, France international defender Mathieu Debuchy, promising young centre-back Calum Chambers and Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina to the squad over the summer. Impressive: Kieran Gibbs starred in the Community Shield win against Manchester City . Full-back Kieran Gibbs is confident the Gunners have the strength in depth to make an impact on all fronts this season. 'More players have arrived than departed and so the squad looks deeper than in previous seasons,' he wrote in a blog on sportlobster.com. 'There is now more competition for places, which is important for the team throughout the year. 'Hopefully, everyone can stay fit and well, because it should raise the performance of each individual player.'","Arsenal face Besiktas in Champions League play-off on Tuesday .

"By . Sam Webb . Assisted suicide: Rogue trader Nick Leeson, whose risky investments destroyed Barings Bank, has admitted he contemplated paying two men with Mafia connections to kill him in prison . The man who became a symbol of the excess, macho culture and greed of stock market trading has admitted he considered paying a hitman to murder him in prison. 'Rogue Trader' Nick Leeson, in an interview with CNN, spoke of the dark period of his life in a German cell. Leeson's risk-taking deals led to an £827million loss and single-handedly destroyed the centuries-old Barings Bank. A Watford schoolboy-turned-City whizzkid, Mr Leeson's early career was a success and he was promoted within the bank, but things began to unravel when he started making losses while trading in Singapore and used a secret account to hide them. In 1995 he was finally arrested in Germany, aged just 28, after going on the run when his financial mismanagement was discovered and was imprisoned while awaiting extradition to Singapore. He was surrounded by arms dealers, sex offenders, drug dealers and, he discovered, Italian men with 'connections' - an ice cream vendor, Luigi, and a 'well-dressed man' called Salvatore. He said: 'It would have cost me £10,000 I think. 'I presumed it would happen in the showers one day, someone would just knife me.' Shockingly, Leeson, now 46 and living in Galway in Ireland, had to speak to his wife and father in order for them to negotiate his murder on his behalf. He added: 'Obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation.' Back in Singapore, he was sentenced to . six and a half years in Changi Prison. He was released in 1999, having . been diagnosed with colon cancer, which he survived despite being given a . slim chance of pulling through. His wife divorced him while he was . inside. Scroll down for video . Darkness: The stark admission came during Leeson's TV interview . During the interview, Leeson also . spoke honestly about his crime and refused to sidestep the blame for the . momentous losses which finished Barings after 233 years of trading. He . added that he has no sympathy for rogue traders Jerome Kerviel of . Societe Generale and Kweku Adoboli of UBS, who lost £6.1billion and . £1.1billion respectively. 'Anything that they've done and . hidden is fraud.' Leeson said. 'I think it's a macho culture that's . evolved. When things go wrong, there's a certain age group that is . usually involved: young men.' Contrite: Leeson readily accepts the blame for his actions, although many have criticised the lack of oversight at Barings Bank at the time . When asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again, Leeson replied: 'No doubt about it. If you ask anyone in the banking industry, they will say ""yes"", but it won't be me.' Leeson is also considering a return to the financial sector, although, instead of trading, he wants to set up an organisation to help people financially crippled by the banking crisis. He is also a regular guest on the after-dinner and keynote speaking circuit. Downfall: Leeson addresses a press conference. A film was made about him called Rogue Trader and starred Ewan McGregor . From 1992, Leeson at first made large profits for Barings in Singapore. However, his luck turned and he used one of Barings' error accounts (accounts used to correct mistakes made in trading) to hide his losses. Leeson was chief trader while also being responsible for settling his trades, making it much simpler for him to hide his losses. By the end of 1992, the account's losses exceeded £2 million, which hit £208 million by the end of 1994. A series of risky trades in 1995 pushed the losses up further. Leeson left a note reading 'I'm sorry' and fled Singapore on 23 February. The bank was declared insolvent soon after. The Singapore authorities' report on the collapse was scathingly critical of Barings management .","'Rogue Trader' says he met Mafia-connected men who would do the deed .

"By . John Mcgarry . Celtic face an anxious wait to discover if their Champions League play-off clash with Maribor will go ahead next week after it emerged the Court for Arbitration for Sport will now hear Legia Warsaw’s case on Monday. The Poles were thrown out of the competition – despite beating the SPFL champions 6-1 on aggregate – having played the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in their 2-0 win over the Scots at Murrayfield. Having failed in their appeal to UEFA this week, Legia feared their case with CAS would be time-barred but the Swiss court confirmed it will deal with it as a matter of urgency. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Celtic rejected Legia 'rematch' call . The man in question: Bartosz Bereszynski (right) played despite being ineligible for the Champions League tie . What next? Michal Zyro and his team-mates celebrate scoring against Celtic and thought they were through . Reprieve:  Callum McGregor and his Celtic team-mates were reinstated to the Champions League . Legia are seeking ‘urgent provisional measures’ to be put in place which would effectively see them reinstated in the competition and facing Maribor rather than travelling to Kazakhstan to face Aktobe in the Europa League. In a statement on their website, CAS said: ‘The Court of Arbitration for Sport registered today at 17:30 a statement of appeal filed by the Polish club Legia Warsaw against the decision of the UEFA Appeals Body confirming the result 3-0 (forfeit) in favour of Celtic FC against Legia in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. ‘UEFA considered that Legia had fielded an ineligible player (Bartosz Bereszynski) during the match. ‘Legia requests urgent provisional measures from CAS allowing the Polish club to participate in the play-offs of the Champions League (20 & 26 August 2014). More generally, the club requests that the UEFA decision be set aside and that all sanctions against the club and the player Bereszynski be annulled. ‘The CAS has immediately initiated an arbitration procedure and the Respondents UEFA and Celtic FC have been invited to file written observations. A decision on request for provisional measures is likely to be issued on Monday 18 August around 18:00 (Swiss time).’ Waiting game: Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) is still not sure if his side will be in the Champions League . Outspoken: Legia Warsaw owner Dariusz Mioduski has slammed the decision not to reinstate his side . Meanwhile, Derk Boerrigter’s hopes of resurrecting his Celtic career were hit with a hammer blow last night when the SFA charged him with diving in the midweek win over St Johnstone. With his side leading by a goal at Perth with 14 minutes remaining, the Dutchman crashed to the ground under seemingly minimal contact from Saints captain Dave Mackay. Mackay’s anger at the penalty award – converted by Nir Biton – was compounded by a red card being shown by referee John Beaton. Celtic eventually won the game 3-0. Having reviewed the incident, the SFA’s compliance officer offered Boerrigter a two-game suspension – or the prospect of taking his chances at a fast-track hearing next Thursday. The winger, who has struggled to make an impact since joining from Ajax a year ago, has until Monday at 3pm to arrive at a decision. Boerrigter has allegedly breached Rule 201 - causing a match official to make an incorrect decision by committing an act of simulation. The agony and the ecstasy: It looked like Legia were through and Celtic were out but the situation has changed . Mackay, meanwhile, will have a claim for wrongful dismissal dealt with at Thursday’s hearing. Saints boss Tommy Wright was aggrieved not only at the penalty Celtic did get but one his side didn’t when his captain went down under a challenge by Virgil van Dijk. He said: ‘My view is that one was a penalty and one wasn’t.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila has vowed to hold showdown talks with his player if TV evidence proved he dived.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Singer and reality star Jenni Rivera had ties to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels before she was killed last month in a plane crash, a shocking report has claimed. A witness reportedly came forward with claims that the Mexican-American performer, known as 'La Diva de la Banda,' was connected to the Beltran-Leyva cartel, which is regarded as one of the country's most feared criminal syndicates.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Burnley's players have been seeing a psychologist to prepare them for the mental battle of staying in the Premier League. Sean Dyche’s team were promoted against the odds in April and are favourites to go straight back down again ahead of their opening game against Chelsea at Turf Moor on Monday night. Burnley captain Jason Shackell revealed that Dyche has called in sports psychologist Simon Clarkson since taking over nearly two years ago, and the players are now ready for what promises to be a season of struggle. VIDEO Scroll for Dyche: Burnley fans haven't always called me the 'ginger Mourinho' Simon says: Burnley captain Jason Shackell revealed manager Sean Dyche has called in a sports psychologist . ‘He delivers a little presentation with quite powerful messages and I think the lads buy into everything he’s done,’ said Shackell. ‘There are key messages and he thinks a little bit outside the box, which is nice. ‘The general message is we’re not going to get it all like we did last year, but it’s not getting too low with the lows and not getting too high with the highs. It’s just trying to keep it on a nice even keel and take one game at a time.’ Tough start: Burnley boss Dyche will take charge of his first game in the Premier League against Chelsea . Burnley were strongly tipped for relegation from the Championship last year as well before going up in second place, and Shackell believes his side thrive when they are written off. ‘It brings a certain freedom and freedom can be a powerful thing,’ he said. ‘With the pressure off, there’s no weight on our shoulders.’","Burnley squad have been seeing sports psychologist ahead of new season .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Just when you thought the news couldn’t get any better for Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, it did. Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse for his opposite number Tom Watson, it did. McGinley’s hope that England’s struggling trio of Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald could find some form at the USPGA Championship was thrillingly realised on the opening day. Westwood shot 65, his lowest score in 17 appearances in the season’s final major and one that also equalled his best in any of the Grand Slam events. When you think how close he has come to winning so many, it speaks volumes for the quality of this performance, which even featured a double bogey. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights of PGA Championship - Day 1 . Impressive: Lee Westwood hit a six-under 65 on the opening day at the PGA Championship at Valhalla . Final flourish: Westwood prepares his approach shot at the 18th hole . Surprise: Few expected the Yorkshireman to be in contention at the major . VIDEO PGA Championship - Day 1 highlights . Poulter was similarly encouraged by his opening round of 68 while Donald, one of the later starters, was tearing around this Kentucky course at a furious pace to reach four under after 11. Contrast all that cheer to place alongside the successes European golfers have enjoyed this summer with the turmoil on Watson’s plate. As if the sagas involving Dustin Johnson and Tiger Woods were not enough, America’s highest-ranked golfer Matt Kuchar withdrew from this event with a bad back. Halfway through the afternoon he was joined by defending champion Jason Dufner, another certainty to qualify for America’s team for Gleneagles but one who is clearly struggling desperately with a bad neck. Much more of this and Watson, who was a commendable level par after 14 holes, might have to pick himself. McGinley had a word with Westwood about his indifferent play over the summer and asked him to show some form. How does a combined total of 128 for his last two rounds sound? ‘I don’t know whether he is looking for a reason to pick me but I shot 63 last Sunday at Firestone and now I am leading a major, so I think I am ticking that box for him,’ said a buoyant Westy. Concentration: Westwood chips towards the flag on the first hole . Not bad for his age: Colin Montgomerie impressed on his rare venture away from the senior tour . Twelve months ago, Westwood blew a decent chance to finally end his well-documented major drought with a final round of 76 in this event. After a few beers on the way home, the frustration came pouring out in a uncharacteristically coarse Twitter rant. He’s hardly been the same player since, with yet more frustration expressed at the Scottish Open last month, where he said he had lost his spark. Since then he’s hit the gym, lost a bit of weight and gained a little self-esteem. He’s worked hard with his swing coach Mike Walker and rediscovered his timing. He’s finally listening to his estimable caddie Billy Foster, who urged him all along to remain patient. ‘I think anyone who ever picked up a club knows how frustrating the game is and how much it can make you swear,’ said Westwood. ‘I hate listening to Billy talk about patience because I’m not a patient person but he’s right. So it was nice to turn a good swing, good technique and good feelings into a good score.’ Perfect start: Westwood looks chuffed after his first round at Valhalla . Eye on the prize: Ian Poulter is another European who impressed on day one . Can he enjoy a good Friday? That’s the next thing, of course. Poulter’s not exactly the world’s most patient man either, and he’s certainly been tested this year when he has gone from one injury to another. If it’s not his shoulder giving him gyp it’s his back or wrist. ‘When you think how strongly I finished last season it has been very demoralising and the last eight months have been atrocious, to be honest,’ he said. It’s surely not a coincidence that he finally played well in the week where he was able to put in a five-hour stretch on the practice ground without feeling like seizing up at the end of it. ‘I’ve never had injuries before and never had to put up with taking two steps forward and one step back all the time,’ he said. ‘But it’s time to look forward. This is a good start at a time of year when there’s an awful lot to go at.’ McGinley had a quiet word with him too, and even if it is unthinkable that he won’t be at Gleneagles, he knows he can free up a wild card with a top-five finish or so here. Impressive: Westwood shares the lead with American journeymen Kevin Chappell and Ryan Palmer . Great day: But Palmer and Chappell aren't expected to be challenging come Sunday . Westwood shared the early first-round lead with American journeymen Kevin Chappell and Ryan Palmer, with Italian Edoardo Molinari and the perennial nearly man Jim Furyk a shot behind. In addition to those mentioned, Europe was well represented with Irish Open champion Mikko Ilonen from Finland on 67, Austrian Bernd Wiesberger and Joost Luiten from the Netherlands on 68 and Frenchman Victor Dubuisson on 69. England’s Justin Rose started yet another major badly and fought back, again as usual, finishing with three straight birdies for a 70. Colin Montgomerie, playing his first major for four years by virtue of winning the senior USPGA Championship in May, shot a creditable 70. The star turn during the afternoon, of course, was man of the moment Rory McIlroy, looking for his second major in four weeks and third win in a row. As ever, there was never a dull moment. After cruising to the turn in just 32 shots, a wicked hook at the 10th sailed out of bounds and he followed the resultant double bogey with another dropped shot at the 11th. Birdies at the next two holes took him to two under, though, and back on track.","Westwood hits six-over-par 65 on opening day at Valhalla Golf Club .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Rory McIlroy recovered from a slow start to boost his chances of a second major title in succession in the weather-affected 96th US PGA Championship on Friday. McIlroy briefly dropped three shots off the lead when he bogeyed the par-four 12th, his third hole of the day, but bounced back with a birdie on the next and made another from 18 feet on the 15th as more rain fell at Valhalla. And when the 25-year-old Open champion holed from 30 feet for an eagle on the par-five 18th, he suddenly held a two-shot lead over US Ryder Cup vice-captain Steve Stricker and fellow American Ryan Palmer. Going strong: Rory McIlroy stayed in the hunt for a third consecutive victory on the PGA Tour . Umbrella: Play was delayed for 50 minutes after a torrential downpour at the Valhalla Gold Club . Fans: McIlroy hits his tee shot on the 15th hole during the second round of the 96th PGA Championship . 'The golf course was pretty wet so the ball is not running anywhere and whenever it's like that and no rain coming down it is very playable and you could make a score,' McIlroy said. 'I didn't get off to the best of starts, but I righted the ship well and caught fire a little bit round the turn and am really happy with four under par. 'I'm feeling good about my game, I'm confident and hitting the ball well for the most part - not quite as well as I did yesterday, but still in control of my game and my emotions and I will need to do that over the weekend as well.' McIlroy had not looked in top form in the early stages of his round, pushing his opening drive into the crowd on the par-five 10th and failing to convert a birdie putt from 10 feet, although a par was at least two shots better than he managed there on Thursday after hooking his second shot out of bounds. Another birdie chance went begging on the 11th and the world number one then bogeyed the 12th, pulling his drive into the gallery and failing to get up and down from a greenside bunker. McIlroy, who followed his Open victory with a first World Golf Championship title in the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday, got back on track with birdies at the 13th and 15th and missed from six feet for another on the 16th after a towering four-iron approach from 224 yards. In front: The Northern Irishman seized the outright lead with an eagle at the par-five 18th . Sand: McIlroy hits his third shot from a bunker on the 12th hole during the second round on Friday . But he made amends by holing from 30 feet for an eagle on the 18th and could have had another on the seventh, missing from eight feet after a stunning three-wood approach. As if to emphasise a changing of the guard, his closing birdie on the ninth came just as former world number one Tiger Woods began his second round on three over par. Play had got under way in torrential rain at 7:30am but was suspended just 20 minutes later with the first group of joint overnight leader Palmer, Ireland's Shane Lowry and Bob Sowards still on the first green. Two members of the green-keeping staff at Valhalla had been attempting to clear water from the putting surface with squeegees, but that proved an impossible task as the rain intensified. Lead: McIlroy wasn't quite at his best but did enough to remain in the lead as he finished on day two . The rain eased enough for tournament officials to announce play would restart after a delay of 45 minutes, although preferred lies could not be used as they were surprisingly not in force when the round got under way. 'It was tough when we teed off,' Palmer said after adding a 70 to his opening 65. 'I wasn't quite sure if we should have teed off to be honest with you, you could barely see the fairway. It was tough when we got to the first green, we couldn't get a clean lie with the standing water, so they couldn't even squeegee it clear enough. 'We were questioning in the fairway why we had to hit into a puddle because the first green was already under water. They said, 'That's just golf'. We're like, 'Tell the guy indoors that's making the decision to come check it out, because it's wet'.'","Rory McIlroy takes the lead after strong second day at the US PGA Championship .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Remember those Black Fridays from not so long ago where Rory McIlroy would turn up with his B game, shoot 40 or so for nine holes and blow his chances of winning? If truth be told, he had another ordinary Friday here at the 96th USPGA Championship, hitting just eight fairways and 11 greens in regulation. How terrifying for the opposition, therefore, that the newly-refocused Rory still shot a four under par 67 to add to his opening 66 to lead the season’s final major at the halfway stage. If McIlroy is now able to hit the front playing average, what on earth is going to happen when he showcases his A game? McIlroy leads by a shot on a good-looking leaderboard from dangerous Australian Jason Day and veteran American Jim Furyk, with fellow countrymen Rickie Fowler and Ryan Palmer two shots adrift. Still on top: McIlroy wasn't at his brilliant best on Friday, but he still takes a one-shot lead into the third round . In the swing: The Northern Irishman is playing as close to perfect as you can get in the majors at the moment . Then comes Phil Mickelson after a spectacular eagle three at the last and Austrian Bernd Wiesberger, with two European big hitters – Henrik Stenson and Lee Westwood – four shots behind. Westwood slipped back after his marvellous first round 65 but is still in contention to win his first major after a 73. Ian Poulter was another to regress with a 73. Tiger Woods? Thank goodness he has now gone home after missing the halfway cut by a comfortable margin following a second round 74 because this was painful to watch. Difficult Tiger: It was a sad sight to see the 14-time major champion struggle with injury and form . Whatever happened to the 14-time major champion who only ever played to win? Here, he limped around both physically and metaphorically to raise the question again: what on earth was he doing here? Let’s hope we don’t see him again until he is healthy - however long it takes. As for McIlroy, add these two rounds to the four he played at Royal Liverpool at The Open and the 72 holes at Firestone last week, and that makes him 41 under par for the duration, with only one round in the seventies. It’s worth spelling them out: 66,66,68,71,69,64,66,66,66 and 67. If that is not the perfect ten rounds, it must be as close as damn it. McIlroy was asked for the umpteenth time why it has all gone right but this time gave a particularly candid answer. He did not say or mean it unkindly, but he did pinpoint the moment he ditched his tennis-playing fiancé, Caroline Wozniacki, at the end of May. Problems: Bubba Watson failed to find his best form, and later had to apologise for his behaviour on the course . ‘I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf,’ he admitted. ‘I’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now? 'I go to the golf course, to the gym and it’s just my life at the minute. I worked pretty hard before but the past couple of months I’ve really just buried myself in my game. It obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.’ A deluge created fresh water hazards in the middle of fairways and caused a 50 minute suspension early on. The day called for the steadfast rather than the spectacular, but trust McIlroy to come up with a mixture of both. Starting from the 10th, he had one eagle three at the 18th and should have had another at the 7th where he missed from 8ft. But this was a round where he also showed off some of the overlooked qualities of his game, including his new-found resolve to grind out a score. A perfect Day: The Australian Jason Day is McIlroy's closest competitor after reaching eight under par . McIlroy missed his first four fairways plus five greens in regulation in a row at one point, but saved par expertly on several occasions with a few adept up and downs. ‘I think when you’re 100 per cent confident as I am now you know you’re going to get opportunities to put it right, so I know I am not going to go on one of those runs where I shoot a 42 for nine holes,’ he said. ‘Mentally, I am just in a far better place.’ McIlroy vowed to keep playing the same brand of smart but aggressive golf that won him The Open. ‘I think the only time I’ve ever tried to protect a lead was the final round of the 2011 Masters and that didn’t work out so well (he lost a four shot lead),’ he said. ‘It took me a couple of years to learn to be comfortable with a lead but what works for me is to try to get four ahead if I am three ahead, and so on. Do I expect to win? I wouldn’t say that. But if I execute my game plan, there’s a good chance.’ Is there anything that can distract McIlroy from his mission? There was a fresh obstacle on Friday in the form of an insufferable example of self-pity from playing partner, Bubba Watson. On the charge: Rickie Fowler picked up eight birdies, more than making up for his three bogeys . Aren’t devout Christians supposed to be able to put things in perspective? Not this one on this day. He whined incessantly as his ball flew off in all directions except straight. The American’s woes were just one more bit of good news for US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson, then, but McIlroy donned cloth ears to drown out the constant moans. Bubba at least had the grace to apologise for his behaviour on Twitter afterwards. ‘Sorry for my actions today. Just trying to get better as a person,’ he wrote. While McIlroy was unaffected, US Open Champion Martin Kaymer – the third member of the group - stumbled to a 74. Still in contention: An eagle at the last put Mickelson within three shots of the lead at the half-way stage . He was a typically class act afterwards, preferring to praise one of his playing partners rather than attack the other. ‘When Rory hits his driver that long and that straight and his short game is incredible, it is very difficult to beat him,’ he said. ‘ . You just have to respect how good he plays. He’s definitely the best player in the world.’ Now, in his 25th major, Open Champion McIlroy has the chance to make it two wins in two months and make it four majors claimed at the age of just 25.

Mark Noble admits he did not enjoy most of last season at West Ham with manager Sam Allardyce’s future a constant source of speculation. ‘I probably only enjoyed about two months of last season,’ he said. ‘We were in the bottom three but then managed to put a few results together and jumped to 10th. But from 10th downwards last year everyone was in a relegation scrap and that’s not where we want to be this season. Hopefully (Allardyce staying) is done and dusted now.’ Back in action: Mark Noble is hoping for a whole new West Ham this season after a tough campaign last time . Pre-season has proved turbulent for the Hammers. They returned from Germany having failed to score against Schalke and Malaga. Loan signing Carl Jenkinson also suffered a hamstring injury. This was after the trip to New Zealand where Andy Carroll damaged ankle ligaments, ruling him out until December, and the side suffered two defeats. Noble said: ‘I’ve been through pre-seasons where we’ve battered everyone and then lost the first three. But you need a good start. Flying high: Noble competes for the ball during West Ham's pre season preparations in New Zealand . ‘We’ve got two weeks to knuckle down and do what we need to do to become a proper team. Hopefully we can get another couple of signings in and enjoy this season.’ Allardyce came in for heavy criticism last season when West Ham fielded a weakened team in the FA Cup and lost 5-0 to Nottingham Forest. But Noble says the Premier League remains the priority this time. ‘A cup run would be a bonus,’ he conceded. ‘For the club, what with the new stadium coming, the main concentration will be the league. We want to improve on 13th spot.’ Passion: Noble wants a cup run for the Hammers as well as improving on their league placing of last year .","Hammers midfielder is happy to be free of speculation over manager's future .

"By . Iain Rogers, Reuters . Barcelona defender Gerard Pique believes an 'angry' Luis Suarez will be desperate to prove himself when he has served out a four-month ban for a biting incident at the World Cup. Uruguay striker Suarez was given a nine-match international suspension and banned from all football-related activity for four months by FIFA after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil last month. Barca have since lured him from English Premier League side Liverpool and the 27-year-old could make his debut for the Catalan club in the La Liga 'Clasico' against Real Madrid at the end of October. Anticipation: Gerard Pique says he is looking forward to when Luis Suarez can finally join up with Barcelona . 'I expect that he (Suarez), like anybody who has the possibility of doing their work taken away from them, will be feeling rage,' Pique said at a news conference at Barca's pre-season training camp in England. 'For the time being he has to wait,' added the Spain defender. 'When he returns he will be full of desire to show that he is one of the best forwards on the planet.' Suarez will join Argentina captain Lionel Messi and Brazil forward Neymar in a formidable attack as Barca seek to bounce back from a disappointing 2013-14 season when they failed to win major silverware for the first time in six years. They have a new coach at the helm in former Barca and Spain midfielder Luis Enrique and begin their La Liga campaign at home to Elche on the weekend of August 23/24.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Captain Wayne. Captain of Manchester United. Perhaps captain of England by next month if all goes smoothly at Old Trafford. Is this a graduation season for Wayne Rooney? At the age of 28, can he finally be trusted? Or can anybody do it? After all, the only official duty on the pitch is the coin toss. Off the pitch, maybe some programme notes and a column in the local paper. You lead out the team and might get to lift the trophy, but otherwise does captaincy in football really matter? There is limited tactical scope, unlike in cricket or rugby and, as Sir Clive Woodward is quick to note, the idea that virtually anyone can pull on the armband is enhanced when it is aimlessly slung around after a substitution. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some infamous captains including Man United's Roy Keane . Practice for the role: Wayne Rooney has captained Manchester United on their pre-season tour . Flawed genius? But can the striker fulfill the position successfully in the long term? Countryman: If Rooney impresses, Roy Hodgson and England could also come calling . VIDEO Rooney favourite for captaincy . His own view is that on the field the captaincy is more important in cricket than rugby and more important in rugby than football, but that the reverse is true off the pitch where a football manager, the real decision-maker, needs his man in the pack. ‘He doesn’t have to be your chief sneak, but you need your captain there, delivering your message and letting you know if something is brewing,’ said Sir Clive. ‘We’ve all seen teams implode and we hear about managers who lose the dressing room. ‘I set great store by it and I think Louis van Gaal might be the same. He will have made this decision with great care. You want your captain to be in line with you and you have to trust him. It is not just about 90 minutes of football, but on the pitch too there will be times when you need your captain.’ History’s finest captains are usually those associated with success. In English football they range from Roy Keane and Graeme Souness to Bobby Moore and Billy Bremner, who was voted the Football League’s greatest captain in a poll last year. 1. Is he in the team on merit? Clear and simple. The most important factor in any sport. 2. Is he at one with the coach? Will he be your eyes and ears? Can he make sure the dressing room isn’t lost? You don’t have to be best mates. 3. Does he have the respect of his team-mates on and off the pitch? This is not about baggage from the past but what is happening currently. 4. T-CUP. Thinking correctly under pressure. Can he react in the heat of battle? Can he work with the referee? Can he go eye-to-eye and have a word with a team-mate when necessary? 5. Experience of captaincy. There is an art to it and it is underestimated in football. In the know: Sir Clive Woodward says the captain must deliver the coach's message on the pitch when needed . Expectation: Roy Keane is widely regard as one of the best United captain in modern times . ‘I’ve never heard of a great captain who wasn’t a great player in his own right,’ said Bremner’s Leeds team-mate Johnny Giles. ‘You won’t get many better captains than Billy and that’s because you won’t get many better players than Billy. He’d fight, he’d scrap, he’d create goals and he’d score goals. ‘The great Leeds United team was committed to a man, but you always need the sort of dynamic qualities you got from a guy like Billy. That’s what I think of as proper leadership.’ The best players score key goals and solidify defences, but the best captains add something more, an indiscernible binding quality which infiltrates the crowd, most evident when they are missing. John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Vincent Kompany are in this category. When Terry was a young captain, Jose Mourinho would encourage him to take advantage of his status; to exert pressure on officials and influence the game. Influence: Steven Gerrard is a captain Rooney should admire, as well as Vincent Kompany and John Terry . Leaders: Terry and Kompany have lead Chelsea and Manchester City to Premier League titles . First of many? Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher lift the International Champions Cup in Miami . Tony Adams was a ‘visual captain’ according to Martin Keown, who also played at Arsenal under Patrick Vieira. ‘Patrick wasn’t that type,’ he said. ‘He was softly spoken but on the pitch he came alive. There was steel in his play.’ The roar of the lion-hearted captain has faded amid technical advances at the top. There are more foreign players and coaches, for whom captaincy means something subtly different, and more backroom assistants. As a teenager on loan at Brighton, Keown found his skipper Danny Wilson was the go-to man for anything from pay packets to accommodation complaints. Mentor: Martin Keown says former Arsenal captain Tony Adams was a 'visual leader' Concentrate: Struggling England cricket captain Alastair Cook has shown you must do your own job first . Pressure: Rooney has been tasked with some sort of responsibility from a young age at United . He need not sort out lodgings for Ander Herrera, but Rooney must develop his leadership style while performing consistently. It is only a few weeks since his England place was up for discussion and he’ll be at the mercy of his goal rate. ‘You must do your own job first as Alastair Cook has found out over the last nine months,’ was Nasser Hussain’s instant reaction to the question: What makes a good captain? Beyond that, Hussain cites man-management skills and an ability to understand what makes others tick. Leading by example can be sticking your head where it hurts or soldiering through pain, or summoning a free-kick like David Beckham against Greece in 2001. Beckham wasn’t Manchester United captain but led his country well. In football, international captaincy is different, more occasional, more ambassadorial and Beckham’s mass appeal helped. At the World Cup, there were six goalkeeper captains, lots of midfielders and half a dozen high-end strikers: Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robin van Persie, Didier Drogba, Asamoah Gyan and Samuel Eto’o. Can work: Forwards Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo captained Argentina and Portugal at the World Cup . Defensive issues: With Nemanja Vidic and Co leaving, Rooney must take responsibility all over the pitch . Issue: Louis van Gaal must find a way to galvanize Robin van Persie and Rooney's partnership . In last season’s Premier League, 75 per cent of teams were captained by defenders, mostly centre halves, and the rest by midfielders. At club level, managers choose the voice of authority over the poster boy; someone who understands his working principles and tactical demands — often a defensive player who is well-placed to read and organise the game (and help to referee it). If you can spot a problem and fix it without instruction, that helps, too. There has to be good reason, iconic status or a local bond — Alan Shearer, for example — for placing the armband in attack. Pandering to precious stars or trying to reform rebels is seldom the best policy, as Arsene Wenger has found with five captains in nine years since Vieira left. Rooney’s appointment has a ring of diplomacy to it. United’s defence is low on experience without Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra and Van Gaal does not need to prove his loyalty to Van Persie, his captain for Holland. Short fuse: Many will think Rooney's temper and off-field temper will hamper his ability as captain . Second chance: But Nasser Hussain has shown you can prove the doubters wrong . ‘One of the biggest issues is how to galvanise Rooney and Van Persie,’ said Keown. ‘Van Persie is no problem. He knows the manager loves him. The player most ill-at-ease is Rooney. This is a show of faith. It will give him a lift. Just what Rooney needs at this stage of his career.’ Plenty will suspect that with his short fuse and penchant for off-field controversy Rooney is not one of football’s natural leaders. ‘You can be pigeon-holed,’ said Hussain, who found his own attitude the matter of national debate when he became England captain. ‘People were asking why they were giving it to an angry youth, a selfish cricketer,’ he said. ‘I remember sitting down with (former ECB chairman) Lord MacLaurin at Lord’s to explain how that was before I was England captain. I was the one going out to face Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne and had to prepare myself in the best way I saw fit. Important role: Louis van Gaal will place his full trust in Rooney . ‘Wayne Rooney might be the player he is because of his aggression and anger. You might not want him to be the good guy. ‘You certainly don’t want him to be sent off, but you change when you’re captain. You start thinking of others.’ Van Gaal is backing Rooney to adapt and for his contagious enthusiasm to win the day. It is a big call, one he needs to pay off if he is to swiftly end last season’s rot. For the Dutchman, Captain Wayne matters.","Louis van Gaal will trust Rooney with responsibility at United .

"By . Chris Wheeler for the Daily Mail . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Bacary Sagna has hit back at suggestions from Arsene Wenger that he was tapped up by Manchester City before quitting Arsenal to join the Premier League champions this summer. The France full-back left as a free agent after seven years at the Emirates, with Wenger claiming last week that the deal with City had been agreed ‘a long time ago’. But Sagna, 31, has defended his honesty and denied that the move was motivated by money. ‘I know exactly what happened, everyone knows,’ he said. ‘I’m not a tricky person. I’m very professional. Red to blue: France international Bacary Sagna swapped Arsenal for Manchester City earlier this summer . Summer signings: Sagna moved to the Etihad Stadium along with his fellow countryman Eliaquim Mangala . ‘All I will say is that I was at Arsenal for a number of a years. I have always been straight. I have always given the maximum, even when I came back from injury and was not fully fit, I always played. I don’t know why he said this. ‘I have been fair because I’ve respected my contract. I spent six years on the same contract and never went to the boss’ office to ask for more, but that’s life. ‘It’s not about the money. Can you find one player in Europe who stayed six years on the same contract? That’s what I did and I never asked for anything.’ Arsenal fans taunted Sagna during their team’s 3-0 win over City in the Community Shield at Wembley last weekend, even though he was not playing for his new club. The two teams meet again at the Emirates on September 13 and Sagna says he is prepared for more abuse after following in the footsteps of Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure since the Abu Dhabi takeover of City in 2008. Disappointment: Arsene Wenger lost yet another first-team star to Premier League rivals Man City . Bad reception: Samir Nasri was booed by the Arsenal fans during the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium . ‘It won’t hurt me,’ he said. ‘I’m ready to expect anything now. ‘It’s not easy to read some comments on social networks. I know it’s only a small minority and not all the Arsenal fans, but it’s still not easy to read it because I feel I gave everything. ‘If I was the first one then okay, but I don’t know what to think. Every time a player leaves they seem to get abuse. There are so many on social networks but that doesn’t represent the whole Arsenal family. ‘Of course, I had a great moment with Arsenal. That will stay with me for the rest of my life, but my team is City now, it is not Arsenal. ‘To me, I made the right choice and I’m very happy to be here, no matter what they think. I’m not the first one to leave their club and I won’t be the last one. ‘I’m looking at my personal life now and I want to fight, get in the team and give the maximum. I don’t look at the negatives.’ Emotional exit: Wenger decided to give right-back Sagna a kiss following Arsenal's FA Cup triumph . Teary-eyed: Sagna wipes his eyes after he plays his last game for the Gunners against Hull City . Sagna was in tears after Arsenal lifted the FA Cup at Wembley last season as he won his first trophy in English football in his last game for the club. But the former Auxerre defender insisted that the decision to leave had already been made some time earlier, and he has never had any second thoughts. ‘(Leaving) was very emotional,’ he added. ‘It was not an easy move, but for me it was a personal choice and the right time to do it. ‘Luckily I won a trophy in my very last game. I was very glad and it was a very emotional day for me because I had spent so many years trying to win a trophy. To me we had the potential to win trophies, but we only won one. ‘At the beginning of the season, I knew we had to have a really great season. I wish we had won the league, but we didn’t. At least we won the FA Cup. ‘I knew I had to come (to City), no matter what happened. I had already made my mind up. I wanted to change. I wanted to boost my career. I’m 31 now and it was time to move.’ Bacary Sagna was speaking at the club’s CityLive event to launch the new season.","Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes Bacary Sagna was tapped up .

"By . Simon Jones . Crystal Palace are interested in signing released Sunderland defender Carlos Cuellar on a free transfer. Cuellar has already said his goodbyes and his two-year stint at the Stadium of Light will officially come to an end when his Sunderland contract expires next month after the club opted against renewing the Spaniard’s deal. The 32-year-old has been weighing up various options and Palace manager Tony Pulis is ready to hold talks with the former Aston Villa and Rangers centre-half. Wanted man: Released Sunderland defender Carlos Cuellar is wanted by Crystal Palace on a free transfer . Keiren Westwood has also left Sunderland as head coach Gus Poyet re-shapes his squad. The out-of-contract Republic of Ireland international, who missed much of last season with a shoulder injury, has become surplus to requirements at the Stadium of Light with Vito Mannone establishing himself as number one and Oscar Ustari providing the back-up since his arrival from Almeria in January. The 29-year-old has not been offered a new deal and will now look to resurrect his career elsewhere after a largely frustrating three years on Wearside. The former Manchester City youth player joined the Black Cats on a free transfer from Coventry in July 2011, but managed just 24 senior appearances for the club with Simon Mignolet standing in his way for much of that time. Mignolet’s big-money departure for Liverpool last summer opened the door once again for Westwood, who had initially established himself as Ireland’s No 1 in the wake of Shay Given’s international retirement before a lack of first-team football persuaded then manager Giovanni Trapattoni to turn to Millwall’s David Forde. On the move: Goalkeeper Kieren Westwood is also on his way out of the Stadium of Light this summer . Westwood started 11 games for the club last season before injury struck in November, and has not been seen since. News of Westwood’s departure comes just a day after full-back Phil Bardsley severed his links with the club to join Stoke. Sunderland remain in talks with midfielders Jack Colback and Sebastian Larsson, who are also out of contract, although Colback in particular has suitors with derby rivals Newcastle among them.","Crystal Palace interested in signing Sunderland defender Cuellar .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Alan Pardew has warned of a testing start to Newcastle's season and believes his seven summer signings should be afforded time to adapt to the Premier League. The Magpies kick off their campaign at home to champions Manchester City on Sunday with the manager under pressure to return on a £40million close-season investment by owner Mike Ashley. In his last game at St James' Park Pardew was subject to howls of disapproval from supporters who had seen their side lose 14 of 19 matches. Ready to go: Newcastle players train ahead of their season opener against Manchester City . But the 53-year-old survived and will return to the Milburn Stand touchline in front of a sell-out crowd. Only then will we be able to gauge the forgiveness precipitated by the arrival of players such as France midfielder Remy Cabella, Ajax captain Siem de Jong and Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat. Pardew, though, is guarded against promising an instant return. 'I don't like setting targets myself with the team,' he said. 'What we do also need to understand - and I know people are saying it's desperate that I need a fast start after what happened at the back end of last year – is that I think that's going to be difficult because we have got a lot of new players. 'So I am kind of preparing myself for an even start, if I am honest, and to get stronger as we go along.' Good business: Jamaal Lascelles (left) and Karl Darlow (right) are among the players signed by Alan Pardew . Top acquisition: Summer signing Remy Cabella is expected to play a major role for Newcastle this season . Pardew is happy with the make-up of his squad and has publicly thanked Ashley for sticking by him after the trials of last season. There remains the chance of a late move for QPR's Loic Remy – who scored 14 times on loan at Newcastle last season – but the boss is confident that goals already reside in his team. Pardew's side failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last time around, but he said: 'We have had some good strikers here - Papiss (Cisse) had that fabulous year and Demba Ba. Since I have been here they have been terrific, and Loic, obviously, last year on loan. 'I do think that we have got one or two players in that dressing room who can emulate those guys. To emulate Alan Shearer or Malcolm Macdonald, I think that's a bit tougher, but those recent guys we have had, I think so, yes.' Emmanuel Riviere – a £6m signing from Monaco - will lead the line against City. He outscored Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez last season after netting 13 times, mainly from the bench. Stand by me: Pardew is delighted with the way Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has backed him this summer . And Pardew is confident the 24-year-old can prove to be his next big goalscoring hit on Tyneside. 'I think he's a player that was stuck at Monaco behind some unbelievable footballers,' he said of the former France Under-21 forward. 'All he could was come on to the pitch and score if he got the chance, and he did that, so he didn't do too much wrong there. 'We're fairly fortunate to have him and we think he's a player who can grow. 'I like his attitude and he's hungry with a good mentality. He's a different type of player to Papiss. 'I just hope everything falls for him at the football club. I have been fairly successful here with strikers and hopefully he will be a success too.' Pardew will certainly be hoping that proves the case. For while he has tried to temper expectation by reminding fans of his new-look team, memory of the old one still lingers. To that end, Pardew needs to start well, for 'even' – as the manager has predicted - might not be enough to pacify some supporters.","Newcastle kick off their campaign at home to champions Manchester City .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . A 200-year-old, European-inspired mansion with eight bedrooms, six bathrooms and 10 car spaces in Sydney's inner west is set to break suburban records if it sells for $9 million. But Wellings property - which has a gate house imported from Hamburg in Germany - failed to meet the reserve price set by its owners of 24 years when the Burwood estate went under the hammer on Saturday afternoon. The most expensive property sold in the area was set in 2010 by a six-bedroom home in Appian Way, which sold for $4,105,000, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. The mansion and its gate house, which is on the Register of the National Estate, is located at 4 Woodside Avenue in Burwood - in Sydney's inner west . Wellings' The Gate House was built before 1854 in Hamburg and was then moved to Burwood in two pieces by an Adeline Agnew . Its current owners are Frank and Marcellina Civardi who run Australian joinery manufacturers Civardi Furniture. With the help of renowned heritage architect Lester Tropman, Mr Civardi transformed the two houses - with some parts dating back to 1813 - into the Gothic-style vision seen today. The main house boasts an expansive kitchen decked out with granite benchtops, a commercial gas stove and finished off with European appliances. Every room in the house has a touch of the past to channel the estate's historic connections and has nine-feet high ceilings to add to its grandeur. The exterior matches the impressive interior, with extensive gardens sprawling across a 3,679 square-metre block of land. The property sits on a 3679-square-metre estate (left) , and features eight bedrooms, six bathrooms (right) and has 10 car spaces . The main house at Wellings is designed in a Gothic-style and is 200 years old. This is the first time it has been on the market for 24 years . Wellings' owners reserve price was $9 million and was passed in by bidders on the Saturday afternoon auction at Burwood . The property has been owned by Frank and Marcellina Civardi, of Australian joinery manufacturers Civardi Furniture, for 24 years, was passed in . The Gate House - a smaller building on the property - was built before 1854 in Hamburg and is listed on the Department of Environment's Register of the National Estate. It was selected by the then-French consul, Leonardo Etienne Bordier, at the 1854 Paris Exhibition and was then imported with three or four other buildings to be set up at Hunter's Hill - on Sydney's North Shore. Up until 1967, it was the gate house of the French Consul General's residence, Passy, in Ferry Street. It was then bought by Adeline Grant (nee Agnew) who was the wife of the former owner of Wellings - Dr Lindsay Grant. The Gate House was transported in two parts to Burwood and re-built to be a main feature in the front of Wellings. The house was restored by architect Lester Tropman - who specialises in heritage buildings and its owner Frank Civardi to reflect its rich history . Other features in the house include a billiards room, music room, pool, spacious outdoor dining area and sweeping veranda to look over its extensive grounds . The Gate House was selected at the Paris Exhibition in 1854 by French consul Leonardo Etienne Bordier and imported along with three or four other buildings for erection at Hunter's Hill - on Sydney's North Shore . Much of its original structures are still intact as it stands on a large lawn, encompassed by a paved driveway. The building is made out of pitch pine, which comes from a resinous variety renowned for its ability to resilience to age and weathering. It still features a lot of its original joinery and hardware, including its clipped tin verandah valance and barge boards. But unfortunately none of these features attracted bids close enough to the $9 million reserve price set by the Civardis for the 4 Woodside Avenue property. It is surrounded by an encompassing driveway and has its own large lawn, making it almost a standalone house by itself . The highest bid on the property on Saturday was $6 million and its real estate agent said it was negotiating with a bidder to come to an agreement . Highlights of the house includes its expansive kitchen which fitted granite benchtops and a commercial gas stove, complete with European appliances . According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Wellings is one of Burwood's oldest, surviving estates and only attracted a $6 million bid at its auction. But Ray White Burwood's Janeta Biviano remains upbeat that she will be able to seal a deal soon. She said she in talks with the bidder who lives in the next suburb over in Strathfield. 'There is plenty of interest in the property, as you can see with 15 people registering to bid,' she told Fairfax Media. 'It's just that people decided to keep their hands in their pockets on the day.' Burwood's suburb record for most expensive property sold is $4,105,000 - set in 2010 for a six-bedroom house in Appian Way . Its six bathrooms have kept with the Gothic style of the house with wooden trimmings and vintage light fixtures . Large windows in the bedrooms give occupants the opportunity to experience the full impact of the property's expansive greenery . Each of the rooms have high ceilings and are carpeted, with lofty dimensions and include ensuite bathrooms . The property is is close to major shopping centres, elite schools, a variety of restaurants as well as train and bus stations all within walking distance .","If the Wellings estate sells for $9 million, the Burwood property - in Sydney's inner-west - would break a record .

"By . Mark Woods . Only the fortunate few get to walk away from sport on their own terms. Even fewer do so with a freshly-minted gold medal as a souvenir from their final farewell. Chris Sherrington admits he couldn’t have staged his exit any better after confirming his retirement from judo this week in the wake of his heavyweight triumph at the Commonwealth Games. The Olympian, 31, has donned his robe and belt for the last time. But there will be plenty more fights to come. ‘I love a good scrap,’ laughs the Sportsmail columnist. ‘Love it.’ Returning to duty: Sherrinton salutes after taking gold in Glasgow and will now return to the Royal Marines . Except it will now come caked in mud and possibly in enemy territory with a full-time return to his day job as a Royal Marine Commando. The decision was made a week ago. ‘I looked at all my options. I was looking at a silver medal I won at a Grand Prix in Cuba. There’s only five or six judokas in the UK who have one of those medals and that was my second. It’s an incredible achievement. 'But I have to step back and take the sensible decision and that’s to go home.’ Where that is remains a destination unknown, to whichever foreign land he is required on his next tour of duty. Judo was a distraction and an outlet for his frustrations, an escape route from the demons of drink that threatened to dole his career a knockout blow. Honour: The heavyweight judoka meets Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond as Team Scotland celebrate . It was never meant to take him so far away from criss-crossing the globe in the services of his country. ‘It’s all I’ve wanted to do since I was 17,’ Sherrington insists. ‘The Navy’s given me so many opportunities. And I’m very grateful for that. It’s made me an Olympian. It’s allowed me to go places. 'It is hard to give up judo because I could have go on to Rio and got a medal. But what swung it is that I’ve been based in Walsall and there’s not the level of coaching there I need to be at my very best.’ There’s also self-interest here. While his sporting ranking has rarely been higher, his service standing has dropped off the charts. ‘Currently, I’ve got no rank,’ he reveals. ‘It’s only 10 years until I retire and my pension is based on my rank at that point so I need to work hard to improve that. I only did four and a half years before I got my sports draft so I’ve a lot to make up for.’ Duty calls: The Olympian will have to return to service and improve his rank as he moves away from sport . A course in coping with missions in the mountains is booked in. The training regime has already kicked off. Thirteen kilos have been trimmed off since he left the mat in Glasgow. ‘I was probably a little chubby there. And I’ve another five to go before I can start running again and get out there with a rucksack on my back.’ That will come in the autumn. After nine years without a holiday, with a honeymoon still owed to wife Zoe, the Lancashire-born Scot is under strict orders from his superiors to have a breather before he reports back. There are bookings for school visits in the meantime. But still plenty of gaps in the diary. The first mission on the slate is to get the message out about the power of sport and the benefits from fighting to reach one goal before targeting the next. ‘I want to be a role model,’ he says. ‘I think I’ve a duty to show these young kids that you can achieve huge things, even if you’re someone like me who didn’t do that well at school. Achievement: The sport allowed Sherrington to compete in front of a home crowd at London 2012 . 'I look at footballers. They have such a great opportunity to be positive role models but for some reason, they don’t do it. So if there’s anyone who wants me to come and talk at their school, I’ll be right there.’ Some have already been inspired. Sherrington was coaxed on stage last week at a concert in Linlithgow Palace but was approached afterwards by four men who had watched him in action. All were ex-Marines, all with the Falklands War on their CVs. ‘That was much tougher than anything I’ve ever had,’ he recounts. ‘And they told me they were proud of what I’ve achieved. That was just a really emotional moment. 'To get that applause from the crowd is one thing but to have it from them meant so much to me.’ It is an eternal brotherhood. Team GB has strong bonds but nothing like those forged in the line of fire. But the memories of what he accomplished in his stints on the mat will follow him now wherever he goes. And he leaves the stage as a champion, a privilege afforded only to the lucky or the brave. In hindsight, he saved his best to last. ‘I was so focused on getting that fight right,’ Sherrington smiles. ‘I knew if I did well, there’d be some media attention but I never expected everything that happened. 'Same with the public. The home crowd was incredible. I know I’ll never have something like that again. ‘But to finish the fight in the final the way I did was exactly what I wanted. It was so clean. I did my job perfectly. It was my time and it felt amazing.’","Sherrington won Gold at Glasgow 2014 .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . On Thursday Australian treasurer Joe Hockey came under fire after he said that 'poor people don't drive cars', which led to accusations that he is a 'cigar-chomping Foghorn Leghorn' who is out of touch with Australians. Since then his own personal wealth has come under scrutiny, and more recently the hundreds of thousands of dollars that go towards his own forms of road transport has been revealed. The Daily Telegraph report that according to Mr Hockey's expenditure and entitlements report, the treasurer has spent more than $200,000 of taxpayer's money over the past four years on cars and cabs. Scroll down for video . Treasurer Joe Hockey's list of expenses for road vehicles has come to light after he said 'poor people don't drive cars' earlier this week . Towards his Commonwealth car went more than $66,000, while he claimed over $57,000 on his own private vehicle. The bill for hire cars and cabs cashed in above $54,000 and Cabcharge took up an extra $30,000 worth of claims. In total Mr Hockey has claimed $208,386.48 worth of expenses relating to all the road vehicles combined, and that doesn't include the $140,000 spent on business class airfares. While these are all part of his entitlements as a member of parliament and frontbencher and anyone in his position would have the same funds available, it highlights again the great divide between some of Australia's most wealthy people and its poorest. Joe Hockey was pictured enjoying a cigar after delivering his May budget, in which he declared Australia to be a nation of 'lifters not leaners' On Thursday, following the comments Mr Hockey made on ABC radio in Brisbane the day before, the treasurers own affluence and assets were put under the microscope. Mr Hockey and his millionaire banker wife Melissa Babbage, own four properties between them, including a five-bedroom harbourside family home in Hunters Hill, one of Sydney's wealthiest harbourside suburbs, believed to be worth more than $5 million, which they bought for $3.5 million in 2004. Their $10 million property portfolio also includes  a 200 hectare cattle farm in Queensland and a beautiful six-bedroom coastal retreat with 180-degree views of the beach in Stanwell Park, an hour south of Sydney. Mr Hockey's statement of registrable interests, made in 2010, also lists him as joint owner of a property in the prestigious Canberra suburb of Forrest. Joe Hockey came under fire for his comments, which he made on ABC radio earlier this week . The treasurer and his wife own four properties with an estimated total value of more than $10 million. They include: . Mr Hockey has come under fire after remarking yesterday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households because poor people don't have cars or don't drive far. 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he told ABC Radio in Brisbane. Mr Hockey  has previously insisted that while his opponents might run the 'wealthy line', the money really belongs to his wife, who until 2011, worked as head of the foreign exchange and global finance division of Deutsche Bank. But Mr Hockey's life hasn't been one you would typically associate with struggle. The treasurer, who was pictured enjoying a cigar outside parliament after announcing his federal budget in May, attended the elite St Aloysius' College in Milson's Point. When he left home for university, he attended one of the country's most expensive university residences, St John's College at the University of Sydney, a popular institution for Sydney's private school educated children. It was at Sydney University that he got his start in politics, elected as the president of the Student Representative Council. In his statement of registrable interests of interests in 2010 Mr Hockey lists that he is a patron of two north shore golf clubs, a member of the North Shore Historical Society and a member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, among other charitable, sporting and cultural groups. Joe Hockey claims his extensive wealth, which includes a property portfolio worth more than $10 million, really belongs to his wife Melissa Babbage, who was an executive banker with Deutsche Bank . The controversial fuel excise has attracted criticism from Labor, the Greens and the head of the Nationals who claimed the measures would hit rural Australians harder than city-dwellers . Mr Hockey's comments about the driving habits of poor came as the government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest. The comment drew a rebuke from Labor leader Bill Shorten and some welfare groups. 'Are you serious, Joe Hockey? Are you really the cigar chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics where you're saying that poor people don't drive cars?' Mr Shorten told reporters in Perth. Mr Hockey today dismissed Labor criticism that he was out of touch with everyday Australians, calling Labor 'hypocrites' and saying 'I don't care about that commentary,' while speaking to ABC Radio. A number of politicians from Mr Hockey's own Coalition have spoken out about the controversial budget measure, concerned that it will hit rural communities hardest. NSW Nationals senator John Williams says people in the bush need cars, a point echoed by Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald. An aerial shot of Joe Hockey's cattle farm in Queensland . The Federal Government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise . 'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday. 'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.' But the treasurer disagreed, saying there was a clear trend that showed the higher the household income, the more fuel taxes were paid. St Vincent de Paul Society chief executive John Falzon said the treasurer was making a massive assumption. 'In fact many low-income households are heavily dependent on quite old motor vehicles that are not terribly fuel efficient as their only means of transport,' he told Fairfax Media. Cheaper housing was also often located in areas that were poorly served by transport, but far from jobs, so they have to travel long distances at times. On Wednesday, Joe Hockey brushed off the controversy surrounding his comments . When quizzed by reporters in Perth later on Wednesday, Mr Hockey was unrepentant, labelling the reaction to his comments as 'hysteria'. 'The fact is that there is a clear trend in Australia - the higher the household income the more fuel taxes are paid by the household,' he said. His office also released figures that showed average weekly expenditure on petrol ranges from $16.36 for those on the lowest income to $53.87 among the highest incomes. Households in relatively disadvantaged areas were also less likely to own motor vehicles than those in relatively advantaged areas. Where motor vehicles were owned, households in relatively disadvantaged areas were most likely to own only one car whereas households in relatively advantaged areas were more likely to have two or more motor vehicles.","Treasurer Joe Hockey claimed more than $200K in the past four years .

"By . Anne Shooter . Coconut water has become Britain’s fastest-growing soft drink. It’s made by extracting the milky fluid inside unripe green coconuts (this turns to milk when the coconut is ripe) and can be drunk as is or flavoured with sugar and fruit juice. The drink, which tastes like slightly sweet, slightly salty water, is low in calories and said to be high in minerals such as potassium and magnesium, which are vital for muscle movement, nerve transmission and brain operation. These minerals are depleted after exercise, so coconut water is often sold as a post-workout drink. Scroll down for video . Coconut water has become Britain's fastest-growing soft drink with 12.5 million bottles sold in the last year . Sales are up 114 per cent since last year, according to internet shopping experts mySupermarket, and there are 36 brands available in Britain. The market leader, Vita Coco, has grown 120 per cent over the past 12 months, with growth doubling every year since it launched four years ago. Last year, 12.5 million Vita Coco drinks were sold in Britain. The company was launched by two childhood friends from New York. They had met two Brazilian women in a bar, who told them they really missed drinking coconut water, which is hugely popular in Rio de Janeiro. Soon afterwards, the pair launched Vita Coco, which is now available in 75,000 stores in 13 countries around the world. While its popularity continues to grow, critics say that the benefits are hugely hyped, as the drink is 95 per cent water. They also say it is only slightly more effective than water as a drink after exercise, with many sports drinks higher in minerals. However, with only a small amount of sugar, it is lower in calories than most sports drinks. Coke and Pepsi each own coconut water brands — Zico and O.N.E, respectively — after jumping on the bandwagon on the back of Vita Coco’s huge success. In the past year, sales of coconut water rocketed by 71 per cent at Ocado and 55 per cent at Tesco. Matt Clark, Tesco’s world foods buying manager, says: ‘We started selling coconut water in 2008 when it was still very much a niche drink. ‘But in the past year sales have soared. Demand tends to rise whenever a celebrity such as Rihanna is photographed holding a coconut drink.’ M&S has launched its own range this year, at £2.99 a litre, and their most popular variety, the unflavoured M&S coconut water, has been selling 17,000 litres a week during the summer. They use coconut water from Indonesia and spent a year perfecting their recipes. Alex Beckett, of retail analysts Mintel, says: ‘Coconut water has been a runaway success story in the UK since 2010. Heightened awareness of the nutritional benefits of coconut water has driven interest in this drink.’ Introducing sneeze and stain-free lilies .

In a High Street first, the retailer has launched the Autograph Lily Bouquet, comprising of special Vendrome lilies, which have pollen that doesn’t fall from the flower. More than 12 million people in Britain suffer from the allergy, and the recent warm and wet weather has seen symptoms worsen as pollen levels soar to the worst seen for a decade. M&S flower expert Simon Richards said: ‘Lilies are one of the most sneeze-inducing flowers, and hay fever sufferers tend to steer clear of them. ‘The benefits of our new bouquet are two-fold. The blooms won’t trigger hay fever, and customers can enjoy the lilies without pollen shedding and staining.’ Vendrome lilies have been grown over eight years after the bulbs were found by chance. They are now available exclusively at M&S. This autumn, the retailer also plans to launch Autograph Double Lilies: hybrid blooms which have a double blossom and don’t contain stamens, so are completely pollen free. The Autograph Lily Bouquet is priced at £35 and available exclusively online until the end of August.

"By . Lauren Lumsden . World-renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel is at it again: This time, the genius behind the Cronut is whipping up Pretzel Lobster Tails. The treats, which will go on sale at his Manhattan bakery this coming Saturday, are soft pretzels stuffed with peanut butter and butter-crunch brittle - all in the shape of a crustacean. And, like real lobster tails often do, the sweets come with sea salt and a butter sauce for dipping. They are served warm, so the butter melts easily and the dough is extra soft. Hungry yet? Pastry chef Dominque Ansel's newest creation is the Pretzel Lobster Tail, on sale at his New York bakery starting this Saturday . Culinary magician: Chef Dominique Ansel, pictured in his kitchen, was named America's best pastry chef by the James Beard Foundation earlier this year . Mr Ansel said the shape is optimal for breaking off bite-size pieces and immersing them in the whipped honey brown butter. 'We were thinking of other things that also tasted good with butter, and someone joked lobster since it’s summer.' he said in a press release. 'We immediately thought of the lobster tail and how it was the perfect shape for tearing apart and dipping segments. It’s all about that buttery dipping sauce.' In anticipation of the treats being a hot item, the bakery is letting customers buy only one at a time. They will be for sale all summer long, and no end date has yet been given. Feeding frenzy: Customers line up around the block to get their hands on a Cronut, the treat Dominique Ansel created last year . Hot spot: The Dominique Ansel bakery opened in New York's Soho in 2011 . Mr Ansel rose to fame last year after inventing the Cronut, a donut/croissant hybrid that customers line up for every morning hours before the bakery opens. Since then, he has continued to innovate his dessert offerings by creating a chocolate chip cookie shot, a chocolate souffle hidden in a brioche, and a sundae in a can. He opened up his bakery, which is located in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, in 2011. Earlier this year, the James Beard Foundation named him as America's best pastry chef.","The lobster-shaped pastries are stuffed with peanut butter and butter-crunch brittle .

"By . Steve Doughty . A woman's chance of going through life without having children has almost doubled over the past three decades, national statistics showed yesterday. Nearly one in five of those who reached the end of their child-bearing years last year had no children, compared with just over one in ten of their mothers. The breakdown by the Office for National Statistics showed that the most common family in Britain has two children – but among a generation of women born in the late 1960s, the next most likely outcome is that they have no children at all. Family: The breakdown by the Office for National Statistics showed that the most common family in Britain has two children ¿ but among a generation of women born in the late 1960s, the next most likely outcome is that they have no children at all . There is also a historic rise in the number of single-child families, so that 15 per cent of mothers born in 1967 have just one child. The ONS pointed to a variety of reasons for growing childlessness and smaller families, including the decline of marriage, which has left many women without a stable home in which to have children. Other factors leading to more childlessness are the greater costs of having children compared  to sticking with a job or career and the ‘greater social acceptability of the child-free lifestyle’, its report said. The ONS also said a key reason is ‘the postponement of decisions about children until it may be biologically too late’. The evidence was gathered by the ONS in its  latest ‘cohort fertility’ figures – charts that show how many  children were born to women of selected ages. Researchers compared the child-bearing history of those born in 1967, who reached 45 last year, with that of women from their mothers’ generation, born in 1940. An average woman born in 1940 had 2.36 children, while an average member of her daughter’s generation had 1.91. Those born in 1940 had an 11 per cent chance of childlessness, compared to 19 per cent for the 1967 generation. Childlessness ran even higher for women born in 1965 and 1966, but high immigration in recent years has raised the overall numbers of mothers living in Britain. There have been high birth rates among women who have arrived in Britain since 1997. However, the ONS said that  smaller families ‘reflect women’s postponement of child-bearing to older ages, for reasons including increased participation in higher education’. Stable home: ONS pointed to a variety of reasons for growing childlessness and smaller families, including the decline of marriage . It also cited ‘the desire to establish a career, get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting a family’. And the ONS also noted the impact of the declining popularity of marriage. Factors in delayed child-bearing include ‘delayed marriage and partnership formation’. Independent analysts said that increasing childlessness is also a result of many couples having to rely on a double income to survive. Family author and researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘There is a downside to women’s advancement in the jobs market – all women have to be at work to meet the cost of housing and living, and their husband or partner doesn’t have an income good enough to rely on. ‘There is a tremendous loss if one of a couple leaves work, and there are no tax breaks to help them. Women just can’t afford children. ‘No political party will face up to the fact that most women want to look after their own children. ‘They don’t want to put them in daycare and they don’t want the father doing it.’ The statistic of 15 per cent of women born in 1967 having just one child is the highest rate since the generation born in 1935. The spread of ‘little emperor’ families – named after the Chinese phrase for parents with a single spoiled child – reverses a decline in the proportion of one-child  families that dates from the Second World War. One-child families were most common among women born in the early 1920s. ‘Around one fifth of women born in the 1920s had one child,’ the report said. ‘This may be because their marriage and child-bearing were delayed or disrupted by World War Two.’","One in five of those who at end of child-bearing years had no children .

"By . Sarah Dean . A Sydney teenager who openly supports terrorist group Islamic State has been arrested over a religious 'hate crime' attack in a shopping centre. The incident allegedly occured on August 10, just two days before he appeared on television claiming that the Australian government needs to stop picking on Muslims . The 19-year-old, who calls himself Abu Bakr, allegedly verbally assaulted, threatened and intimated a cleaner working at Bankstown Central shopping centre, in Sydney's west, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Abu Bakr was arrested on August 10 after allegedly verbally assaulting a cleaner at Bankstown central shopping centre in Sydney's west . Bakr, a part-time labourer, was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour-and-a-half later and further abused the man. The incident is being treated as a religious 'hate crime' police sources told Fairfax. On August 12 Bakr was featured in an SBS Insight show about Australians fighting in Syria. He wore the Islamic State flag symbol on his black jacket and walked off set part-way through the show when his lawyer Zali Burrows and the show's producer became embroiled in an arguement. Bakr, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, is already on the radar of security services and has had his passport cancelled so he can not travel overseas. The 19-year-old was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour-and-a-half later and further abused the cleaner . Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated to help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia. Before the SBS TV discussion fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie aired Bakr's lawyer Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client walked out because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'. 'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added. Bakr appeared on TV on SBS's Insight discussion about Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq on August 12 wearing the Islamic State flag on his top . Lawyer Zali Burrows said her client Bakr is 'a young kid who's passionate about injustice' Burrows said she and Bakr were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week. Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation. 'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter... he's a young kid who's passionate about injustice,' Burrows said of her client. She did not comment when asked why Bakr's passport has been revoked. Bakr was charged under his real name over the alleged shopping centre incident and will appear at Bankstown Local Court on September 10.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . We may be living in the age of 'social' media, but when it comes to munching, we're doing it alone. Industry research group NPD has concluded that Americans eat breakfast solo 60per cent of the time, and lunch 55per cent of the time. The only meal we are still enjoying with company is dinner, eating alone around 32per cent of the time. NPD put the trend down to our hectic schedules, greater tendency to travel, and the rise of single-person households. Lone munching: NDP research found that many of us are frequently dining alone, perhaps in part because almost a third of all U.S. households are now one-person homes . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost a third of all American households today comprise of a single person, and only 20per cent of all households are now made up of married couples with children. This means more people are living - and thus eating - solo than ever before in history. And even if we do live together as a family, a vast majority of us report eating a meal together less than five days a week, a recent Harris poll found. Additionally, we are so busy and mobile, according to a separate study conducted by Stanford University, that we eat one in every five meals in our car. The implications of these habits, especially for children, are profound. A major study conducted by the National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that children who do not eat dinner with their parents at least five times a week tend to perform less well academically, report being less close with their families, and are more likely to get into trouble with drugs and alcohol than children who do have more family meals. Table for one: Daniel Radcliffe with only a book for company (left), Leanne Rimes enjoying a solo lunch with a cocktail (center) and Ryan Gosling grabbing a bite to eat alone in New York (right) Additionally, children who eat dinner as with their families less than twice a week are 40per cent more likely to be overweight. Psychologist Dr Anne Fishel, who wrote a book titled Home for Dinner: Mixing, Food, Fun, and Conversation for a Happier Family and Healthier Kids, believes that eating in company is vital to our emotional health. 'Most American families are starved for . time to spend together, and dinner may be the only time of the day when . we can reconnect' 'Most American families are starved for time to spend together, and dinner may be the only time of the day when we can reconnect, leaving behind our individual pursuits like playing video games, emailing and doing homework,' she wrote for The Family Dinner Project. 'Dinner is a time to relax, recharge, laugh, tell stories and catch up on the day’s ups and downs, while developing a sense of who we are as a family.' Dr Fishel suggests cooking up large batches of soups or stews over the weekend that can be frozen and then served quickly and easily during the week.","Almost a third of all U.S. households are now one-person homes .

"By . Pat Hagan . Alison Morton of Buxton, Derbyshire, who had breast cancer in 2007 and had surgery to remove her left breast . A gel rubbed onto the skin to shrink tumours could transform the treatment of breast cancer for thousands of women. The . lotion, applied daily, contains the same active ingredient found in . Tamoxifen pills, the most commonly used breast cancer drug in Britain. Research suggests the gel is as effective as the tablets at controlling the disease but, crucially, has fewer side-effects. In pill form, the drug causes nausea and  hot flushes in half of women, while one in four will have extreme fatigue. More . serious complications, such as blood clots that could cause a stroke . and an increased risk of womb cancer, affect one in 100 patients on the . drug. Tamoxifen works by blocking the effects of the hormone . oestrogen. Many types of breast cancer rely on this hormone to grow and . have special receptors that oestrogen can lock onto. Tamoxifen sits . on these receptors and gets in the hormone's way, and is usually given . after surgery to reduce the risk of a tumour coming back. Many women . stay on the drug for five years after their diagnosis. However, it's . estimated that up to half quit before then because they're put off by . the side-effects. These include former care worker Alison Morton, . 51, who was diagnosed with breast cancer seven years ago. The mother of . three had a mastectomy after the discovery of a hormone-sensitive tumour . the size of a 50p piece. Alison was prescribed Tamoxifen to reduce . her chances of the cancer returning and - as her sister had breast . cancer at 42 and her mother had died of kidney cancer at 54 - she was . happy to give it a go. She soon changed her mind. 'As soon as I . started taking it I began to feel sick all day, like morning sickness,' says Alison who lives in Buxton,  Derbyshire, with husband, Neil, 50, a . gas engineer. 'I had no appetite and lost a stone in the first few . weeks. 'Within two days I had severe hot flushes every couple of . minutes, sweating so much people would say my face was streaming. I had . to change my clothes eight or nine times a day. I felt embarrassed and . didn't want to go out and socialise - and I was only 44.' She also . became so sensitive to sunlight that her eyes hurt when she went outside . and she had severe night sweats. 'I had to sleep on a bath towel and . get up and change it in the night as it would be soaked,' says Alison. She was offered treatment with the drug Tamoxifen but found the drug side effects too troublesome . 'Even . though I was flushed and sweaty, I also felt cold and shivery. The . sweats disturbed my husband's sleep as well as mine and I also felt . self-conscious.' Eventually, she tried sleeping pills, but still woke . up in the night drenched in sweat. Alison had never been depressed . before, but Tamoxifen made her tearful. She persevered for 50 days, hoping her body would adjust, but then decided enough was enough and came off the drug. 'I . know all the facts about Tamoxifen and how it can reduce your chances . of breast cancer recurring, but for me the side-effects were too much to . bear. 'The impact on my quality of life was too high a price to . pay. I would rather take my chances with breast cancer than live with . Tamoxifen's side-effects.' A recent study by Glasgow University found . 400 lives and £30 million could be saved each year if women continued . with Tamoxifen. It's hoped the gel will boost the numbers of women staying on the treatment, increasing their chances of long-term survival. It . is likely to have fewer side-effects because while the pill has to be . broken down by the liver and then circulated round the body, the gel is . applied only to the area affected by the tumour. It seeps through the . skin into the breast tissue. Tamoxifen has been the gold standard in . breast cancer treatment for the past 20 years and is credited with . playing a major part in a 30 per cent decline in the death toll from the . disease. It's not just given to those who have had breast cancer - . it's also recommended for those at high risk of developing the disease. Last . June, the National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence - NICE - . recommended that the drug be given to any women over 35 whose family . history gave them more than a 17 per cent risk of developing hormone . sensitive breast cancer: 488,000 women in this country. There has been a . hold-up in putting this recommendation into practice because the drug . has not been licensed for women who have yet to develop breast cancer . and so doctors are nervous of prescribing it. Yet even if these women were offered the drug, the side-effects mean many may choose not to  take it. Given . that so many women are reluctant to stick with the tablets, scientists . at Northwestern University, near Chicago, wanted to see if a daily . application of gel would  be as good at stopping the return of cancer as . pills, with fewer adverse effects. They recruited 26 women aged . from 45 to 86 with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, which accounts for . one in four breast cancers. It's a less serious form of the disease, as . the cancer cells are inside the ducts of the breast and do not normally . spread. Half the women received the gel, which they applied every day, and half took the oral version of the drug. Researchers . took regular breast tissue samples to monitor levels of a protein, . Ki-67, that is a marker for cancer cell growth. Raised levels suggest . cancer cells are multiplying. The results, published in the journal . Clinical Cancer Research last month, showed that after six to ten weeks, . Ki-67 levels had been reduced by similar amounts (50 to 60 per cent) in . gel and pill patients - suggesting the gel was just as good as the . drug. Alison had never been depressed before, but Tamoxifen made her tearful . But the amount of potentially toxic medicine circulating in patients' bloodstreams was five times lower in those on the gel. Researcher . Professor Seema Khan said: 'The gel minimised exposure to the rest of . the body and concentrated the drug in the breast where it is needed.' The gel reduced the risk of blood clots, but it did not reduce the incidence of hot flushes. However, . researchers believe this is because the group was too small to give . fully accurate results and they expect bigger studies would show a . reduction in flushes. Professor Khan says the gel may also be more . effective for some women because one in three lack the right enzymes in . the liver to properly metabolise oral Tamoxifen. Cancer Research UK . science information officer Dr Emma Smith said: 'Research looking at . ways to  make cancer treatment kinder is hugely important and this . simple  approach shows promise for this type of breast cancer. But the . study only looked at a small number of women.' Professor Tony Howell, . scientific director at the Genesis Breast Cancer prevention charity in . Manchester, said the study was interesting because it found a gel could . reduce the risk of blood clots and was as effective as tablets in . reducing cancer cell growth. However, he added: 'Blood clot problems are rare with Tamoxifen, though, and hot flushes are a much more common side-effect.' Researchers . are in talks with the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. over plans . to set up a much bigger trial - potentially involving hundreds of women. If . this produces the same positive results, it's possible the gel could . become available within the next two to three years. It could make all . the difference for women like Alison who, in the end, opted to have her . ovaries removed to stop her from producing oestrogen. 'The gynaecologist was  sympathetic - he said my family history warranted it,' she says. So, would she have been tempted to have tried the new gel instead? 'It . sounds as if it has a far less toxic effect than the Tamoxifen I was . given and is just as effective at fighting cancer,' says Alison. 'I . definitely would have tried it if it had been available at the time.' Additional reporting: JO WATERS.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss For Mailonline . The future of male fertility treatment may lie with synthetic sperm, a new study claims. Canadian scientists say they have pinpointed the protein required to kick-start the fertilisation process - and now believe they can re-create it in a lab. The researchers, from Queen's University, say a synthetic version of the protein - known as PAWP - could improve the diagnoses and treatment of male infertility. Male infertility could be treated with a synthetic version of a protein required to kick-start the fertilisation process, known as PAWP . In particular, it could help with cases where a man's sperm is unable to bond with the egg to form an early embryo. At least one in six couples now need medical help to have a baby - and for . half of them, the problem is the result of poor sperm quality. It . is believed the trend is linked to diet, lifestyle, exposure chemicals and possibly even tight underwear. A large French study in 2012 found that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame. And a Spanish study published early last year found that even in young men, sperm concentration . fell by an average of two per cent a year - and could soon hit levels . where fertility is compromised. Commenting on the new study, research leader Dr Richard Oko, said: 'Even in a synthetic form, the PAWP protein can help trigger the fertilisation process. 'PAWP is able to induce embryo development in human eggs in a fashion similar to the natural triggering of embryo development by the sperm cell during fertilisation,' he said. Most human infertility treatments are now done by injecting a single sperm directly into an egg . Therefore, Dr Oko believes supplementation of human sperm with PAWP protein could be used to improve the success rate of infertility treatments in the future. The average success rate of one fertility treatment cycle is only 37 per cent, according to figures from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's. This low success rate may be due to a variety of factors - including the sperm cell being unable to kick-start fertilisation and trigger embryo development upon egg entry. The research was published in the the FASEB Journal. The synthetic version of the sperm protein could improve the diagnoses and treatment of male infertility, scientists say .","Protein required to kick-start the fertilisation process has been identified .

The gadget is very much like increasingly popular wristbands that can help athletes monitor their training and general health. Software built into the collar analyses the body’s data in the context of the pet’s history and breed. Owners can set up email and text message alerts to notify them of any changes in pulse or breathing rates and build a ‘personalised health profile’ of their pet. They will even be able to compare the activities and ‘performance’ of animals if owners have more than one. Dr Asaf Dagan, chief veterinary scientist at PetPace which has developed the gadget, said: ‘This collar will enable pets, for the first time, to “tell” us how they feel.’ This dog wearing the PetPace collar can now communicate with its master .

'I didn't really know anything about leukaemia at all, I thought it was a cancer only children could get - now everything's just turned upside down for me. 'It's just so much to take in but I'm spending every day at the hospital with mum, and I'm learning as we go. 'I now know that for people who need a transplant, it's usually their last chance.' The devastating news came in the last few weeks, just a month ago the fashion designer and his mother had no reason to suspect there was anything wrong. 'I was filming for TOWIE and everything was as normal,' said Bobby, who joined the cast in 2012. 'Mum seemed herself and was physically doing everything she has always done on a daily basis, like walking to work and back, keeping the house in order and dog-sitting for my dog Beau. 'A few weeks ago she started feeling a bit run down and tired, but other than that things were still really normal.' After complaining of feeling lethargic . Ms Norris went to see her doctor. Blood tests revealed she had a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia.

Bobby, an only child, said he is devastated at his mother's diagnosis. The 54-year-old is currently in hospital and is receiving intensive chemotherapy twice a day to try and treat the disease . Doctors told Bobby and his family last week that his mother's best hope is a bone marrow transplant to try and treat the disease . 'Mum was rushed to hospital that very same day, and hasn't been allowed home since,' Bobby said. 'We're being brave for each other. I know she doesn't want me to see her upset or scared and vice versa. 'So we're both keeping strong for each other when I visit, but as soon as I get outside the hospital and into the car park, that's when I'm breaking down in tears.' Ms Norris has been receiving intense chemotherapy twice a day, but doctors told the family last week that the treatment alone would not be enough to cure her of the disease. 'My mum is my best friend, I'm devastated' - Bobby Norris . 'We were told that mum has a gene that will prevent the chemotherapy working to its full potential,' said Bobby. 'Her best hope of survival now is a bone marrow transplant. 'I’m an only child and my mum had lost contact with her brother. 'But we have recently managed to track him down to arrange a test to see if he is a potential match for mum, but siblings aren't always guaranteed matches – the vast majority of people have to rely on finding an unrelated donor. 'So it’s now a waiting game to see if we can find a stranger on the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register who is a match for mum and who is willing to donate their stem cells to her. 'It could literally be anyone – I recently found myself passing strangers at Lakeside Shopping Centre or traffic lights, and thinking, you could be a match for my mum or somebody else suffering from this terrible disease.' Bobby appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge people to sign up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in a bid to help find a donor for his mother . The 27-year-old fashion designer said: 'My mum is my best friend, I'm devastated' Bobby, left, dressed up for a Grease Lightning themed party for an episode of The Only Way Is Essex . Bobby is now lending his support to blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, which runs the UK bone marrow register and is marking its fortieth anniversary this week. He has launched a Twitter appeal #SaveBobbysMum and is urging fans to sign up. 'I know I’m not the only one this is happening to,' he said. 'There are other families being told the same news every single day – today, this evening, tomorrow. 'Two thirds of them will rely on Anthony Nolan to find them their lifesaving donor. 'A stranger to one person is another person's mum... These donors are lifesavers and I'm bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this' - Bobby Norris . 'I feel completely helpless right now, but all I can do apart from being there for mum is to try to raise awareness of the Anthony Nolan register, particularly to young people who are much more likely to go on to donate and save a life.' Bobby is now backing an Anthony Nolan campaign which launched this week, calling on people to ‘save a stranger’s life’. Since appearing on ITV's This Morning to appeal for a donor for his mother, the charity said they have seen a 2050 per cent rise in people signing the donor register online. So far 817 people have added their names to the database, since yesterday. Up from 38 on August 12 last year. 'A stranger to one person is another person’s mum,' Bobby said. 'For the donor, it’s probably just a case of sitting still for a few hours while the stem cells are taken out of their blood. 'But for me, and for families like mine, it’s the difference between having my mum around or not. 'It’s everything. These donors are lifesavers and I’m bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this.' Fashion designer Bobby tweeted his appeal for a bone marrow donor for his mother, launching the #SaveBobbysMum hashtag . The 27-year-old has given his backing to the Anthony Nolan Save A Stranger's Life campaign . After appearing on ITV's This Morning yesterday, Bobby tweeted to reveal the Anthony Nolan website had experienced an influx of visitors . To join the Anthony Nolan register, you must be aged between 16 and 30 and in good health. Bobby has urged everybody who is eligible to be on the Anthony Nolan register to log their details to  one day potentially save somebody's life. 'We only ever get one mum, so let's look after them and each other’s, and sign up to be on the Anthony Nolan register,' he added. Ann O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan said: 'We can’t thank Bobby enough for helping to spread the word about donating stem cells, particularly at such a difficult time for his family. 'There are still many misconceptions out there about what’s involved. 'For example, most people don’t know that nine times out of ten, the process is very similar to giving blood, and joining the register just involves spitting into a tube. 'Bobby is also absolutely right that we urgently need young people to come forward and join the register, particularly men aged 16 to 30 as they’re currently underrepresented. 'Any one of Bobby’s fans who he inspires to join the register, could one day save a life - but unless they sign up, they’ll never have this chance.'

"By . Lizzie Parry For Mailonline . A mother who claims doctors advised she abort her unborn son held her tiny newborn for the first time eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect. When Vicky Davies was 20 weeks pregnant a routine scan revealed her son had the condition congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Doctors at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl told the 33-year-old her baby had a 50 per cent chance of survival. But despite his tiny stomach and intestines developing in his chest due to a hole in his diaphragm, Samuel Wilson was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date. Vicky Davies was finally able to hold her tiny son Samuel for the first time, eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect . Ms Davies, left with her son, claims doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy, after revealing he had a 50 per cent chance of surviving at her 20-week scan when he was diagnosed with a rare condition, congenital diaphragmatic hernia . The defect caused a hole in his diaphragm allowing part of his intestines to push into his chest cavity . Now 10 weeks old, Samuel is being cared for in hospital as his parents and three siblings prepare to welcome him home for the first time next week. Mother-of-four, Ms Davies said: 'We went to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and our whole world came crashing down. 'We were told about his CDH and that there was a chance he would have Down’s Syndrome. 'Due to the low survival rate we were advised to look at the option of aborting the pregnancy. 'But I just couldn’t even imagine it. I know they have to give you all the options but I just had to give him a chance at survival.' Ms Davies and her partner Gavin Wilson, 40, were rushed from their home in Rhyl to Liverpool Women’s Hospital where Samuel was born weighing 4lb 15oz. He was placed in an incubator before his parents had the chance to hold their son. Ms Davies, said: 'We were told that it might not make it through the weekend, and six days after he was born we got a call at 1am to say they could do no more for him. Mother-of-four, Ms Davies said: 'Due to the low survival rate we were told to look at the option of aborting the pregnancy. But I just couldn't even imagine it. I know they have to give you all the options but I just had to give him a chance at survival' Samuel was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date. Before his parents, Ms Davies and Gavin Wilson were able to hold him, he was placed in an incubator in the special care unit at Liverpool Women's Hospital . 'I ran to the ward. I thought I was going to have to leave the hospital without my baby. 'But Samuel has been fighting ever since. He has the operation to move his stomach and intestines down on June 10 and is even feeding through a bottle now.' After waiting eight weeks, Ms Davies is now able to hold her new born son. She said: 'I finally feel like a normal mum. It was so hard waiting but he was so poorly, I just knew I had to wait. 'My daughter Elisa, 10, has held him a few times, but my two boys Jack, seven, and Thomas, four, are still a bit nervous. 'They love him to bits though and come and see him whenever they can.' Samuel was first moved to Alder Hey hospital and is now in Glan Clwyd. He is expected to finally be allowed home next Wednesday, August 20. A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital,  said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, as discussions between patients and their doctors are private. 'However, our clinicians would ensure that patients and families are aware of all available medical options in cases such as this.' CDH occurs in around one in 2,500 births and accounts for approximately eight per cent of all major congenital abnormalities. The diaphragm normally develops in an unborn baby by around the seven to 10 week gestation period. CDH occurs when the diaphragm fails to form correctly or fails to develop in the unborn baby. Now 10 weeks old, baby Samuel is ready to be taken home for the first time when he is discharged from hospital next week . It means the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity, which in turn prevents the lungs from developing properly. The stage at which the abdominal contents herniate, and the size of the hole in the diaphragm, determine how much the baby's lungs and other internal organs, including the heart, are affected. In some rare cases CDH is part of a chromosomal syndrome, including Down's Syndrome. The prognosis for babies diagnosed with CDH is 50 per cent. Once baby is fully stabilised and the Doctors are happy with baby’s blood gases, oxygen levels and general progress, baby will undergo surgery to repair the hernia, but there is no set timescale for when the operation is likely to take place.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Almost a year ago today the world's first lab-grown burger was unveiled and eaten, albeit at the mouth-watering price of £250,000 ($420,000). But in anticipation of a future where lab-grown meat is the norm, Dutch-based scientists, chefs and artists have launched a tongue-in-cheek cookbook for artificial food. The bizarre assortment of test-tube dishes includes roast raptor leg, dodo nuggets and in-vitro oysters. Scroll down for video . Who wants a batch of Celebrity Cubes (shown)? Scientists in Amsterdam have unveiled a cookbook for future artificial meat. It comes a year after the first lab-grown burger was unveiled to the public. The tongue-in-cheek book envisages food that might one day be eaten . The In Vitro Meat Cookbook was unveiled in Amsterdam a year after scientists revealed the world's first lab-grown beef burger in London, in what is hoped to spark a global food revolution. It looked like something you’d chuck on the barbecue without a second thought, but this artificial round of meat costs a very beefy £250,000 ($420,000) - as the world’s first test-tube burger. After the patty was lightly fried in a little butter and sunflower oil last year, the two volunteers chosen to taste it in front of a live audience were hardly effusive, though. ‘I was expecting the texture to be more soft,’ said Austrian food researcher Hanni Rutzler, taking 27 chews before being able to swallow a mouthful. ‘It’s close to meat - it’s not that juicy.’ The second volunteer, food writer Josh Schonwald added: ‘The absence is the fat. But the bite feels like a conventional hamburger. What was conspicuously different was flavour.’ The 186-page cookbook will cost £19 ($32) and is based on the idea that meat can be 'grown' in a bioreactor from cells taken from live animals. It is packed with new suggestions on what future cultivated meat products could look like. 'This cookbook aims to move beyond in vitro meat as an inferior fake-meat replacement, to explore its creative prospects and visualise what in vitro meat products might be on our plate one day,' says scientist and philosopher Dr Koert van Mensvoort, one of the book's main contributors. All recipes were created by a team of chefs, designers and artists, said Dr van Mensvoort in its preface, adding: 'While some dishes are innovative and delicious, others are uncanny and macabre.' The book also explains how to cultivate home-grown meat in a lab kit, before harvesting it for the pot. For instance, on page 63 there's 'Roast Raptor', which uses chicken tissue to grow meat around 'dinosaur bones' made in a 3D printer to create anatomically accurate models of dinosaur parts. 'Let the dinosaur rest for 15 minutes before carving and serving,' it suggests after cooking. The book includes meat from animals that are extinct in the modern day such as 'Dodo Nuggets' (shown) The book (left) is available to pre-order now and includes 'instructions' on how to make a 'bacon roll' (right) One of the pages has rather gruesome instructions on how to make a 'meat foam cocktail' (shown) In another recipe, tissue engineering and advanced genetic sequencing from a dodo sample preserved by the Oxford University Museum of Natural History will allow history aficionados to 'sample what the first sailors to visit Mauritius did in 1598.' There are decidedly less appetising ideas too, for instance oysters grown from meat stem cells. 'Bathed in a warm sea of serum, row upon row of miniature bioreactors nurture small morsels of flesh,' is how the cookbook describes the test-tube oyster farm. 'Connoisseurs may become adept at picking out the terroir of each lab, from the briny metal overtones of Atlantic serum to the sweeter, more rounded flavour from Pacific facilities,' the book said. In a future where artificial meat is possible, the scientists suggest we could even eat dinosaur meat . Lab-grown meat could also be altered so, for example, meatballs could be styled in different colours (shown) Last year Professor Mark Post of Maastricht University in southern Netherlands unveiled the so-called 'Frankenburger' in London, showing that cultured beef using strands of meat grown from muscle cells was indeed possible. Scientists insist artificial beef is safe, claiming it could eventually replace ordinary beef in the diets of millions of people and in so doing reduce huge environmental pressure caused by raising livestock. 'Our aim is not to promote lab-grown meat, nor to predict the future, but to visualise a wide range of possible new dishes and food cultures to help us decide what future we actually want,' Van Mensvoort said. The scientists say artificially producing meat could help alleviate the strain on livestock in the future .","Scientists in Amsterdam have unveiled a cookbook for future artificial meat .

"By . James Rush For Mailonline . It starts with just one bad decision, but ends with the most dire of consequences. A shocking public health video aimed at tackling obesity shows how a parent's influence can lead to a lifetime of unhealthy eating and, ultimately, have potentially fateful outcomes. The video, released by the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, works its way backwards from the moment Jim is taken into hospital after suffering a heart attack at the age of 32. Scroll down for video . A shocking public health video aimed at tackling obesity shows how a parent's influence can lead to a lifetime of unhealthy eating and, ultimately, have potentially fateful outcomes . The video rewinds through Jim's life, to reveal a pattern of unhealthy eating and a sedentary lifestyle, leading to him being taken to hospital after suffering a heart attack at the age of 32 . The video, taken from Jim's point of view, shows doctors inspecting him as he lies on the hospital bed, struggling to breathe, weighing 300lb. 'How the hell does that happen?' asks one of the doctors, before a series of shots rewinds to Jim's childhood to show how a lifetime of bad choices was started with one made by his mother. The video shows Jim at various stages in his life eating unhealthy foods and sitting around watching television or playing computer games. The short-film however goes back to Jim's childhood to show how his unhealthy eating habits were in fact precipitated by his parents - various scenes show his mother feeding him sugary breakfast cereals and even French fries as a baby. The video is aimed at teaching parents to instil healthy eating habits into their children at a young age. The video also shows how numerous doctor's warnings were not fully heeded, including those made when Jim was a child . The organisation's website says: 'As a parent, you might be thinking “I’ve done some of those things!” 'Don’t worry; we didn’t create the video to make you feel guilty. We created it to fast-forward to the year 2030 to show you what the future might look like for Georgia’s kids if we don’t act now. The choices we teach kids today become the habits they take into the future.' The video, which was published to YouTube by CHA in September last year, has gained attention in recent days after it was widely shared on social networking sites. The video goes back to Jim's childhood to show how his unhealthy eating habits were in fact precipitated by his parents . Various scenes show Jim's mother feeding him sugary breakfast cereals, and even French fries as a baby . While many viewers have commented on the effect it has had on them, some obesity experts have raised concerns over the 'shock' tactics. Obesity researcher Ted Kyle told Yahoo Health: 'If you want to draw attention to yourself and your campaign, then this is a helpful video. If what you want is to have a helpful effect on childhood obesity, the research is clear that shocking and stigmatizing doesn’t really help.' He said studies had shown shaming and stigmatizing people was not an effective way of altering a person's behaviour. Meanwhile, a recent study by researchers at Griffith University, in Queensland, has found children born to obese mothers are 50 per cent more likely to end up in hospital in the first five years of their lives. The world-first study followed almost 3,000 Queensland mothers and their children over a five-year period. Researchers found conditions of the nervous system, infections, metabolic conditions, perinatal conditions, injuries and respiratory conditions were more prevalent in children of obese mothers. Doctor Cate Cameron said the study, published in the International Journal Of Obesity, is good evidence pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant.","Video shows potentially dire consequences of lifetime of unhealthy eating .

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . Supermodel Cindy Crawford was among the speakers at a rally held by parents to raise concerns after potentially dangerous levels of toxic chemicals were found at Malibu High School. The 48-year-old Malibu resident appeared alongside actor Joshua Malina as the pair called for action after potentially harmful levels of a carcinogen were found at the school last year. Ms Crawford, who said she was speaking at the rally as 'a concerned parent' called on the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to carry out tests on caulk in classrooms built before 1979, and even offered to pay for it. Cindy Crawford was among the speakers at a community rally organised by parents' group Malibu Unites about potentially harmful levels of toxic chemicals found at Malibu High School . Ms Crawford called on the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to carry out tests on caulk in classrooms built before 1979, and even offered to pay for it . She told the meeting: 'Without confirmation where the PCBs are we cannot ensure that our children are not being exposed. 'In any event if money is an issue, Rande, my husband, and I have decided we would happily pay for proper and thorough testing of all pre-1979 classrooms.' Illegal levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which can cause cancer and effect the immune system, reproductive system and nervous system, were found in classrooms at the school last year after teachers raised health concerns. The chemicals were used in caulk dating back from the 1950s, but were banned under the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1979, according to the Los Angeles Register. Ms Crawford told the meeting: 'Without confirmation where the PCBs are we cannot ensure that our children are not being exposed' Parent group Malibu Unites organised the rally at Malibu Library yesterday to raise concerns and call for action before the school reopens following the summer break on Tuesday next week . Independent testing carried out by teachers and parents last month found samples of contaminated caulking containing as much as 7,400 times the legal limit. Parent group Malibu Unites organised the rally at Malibu Library yesterday to raise concerns and call for action before the school reopens following the summer break on Tuesday next week. Ms Crawford and Mr Malina were joined at the event by actor Ed Begley Jr and several school board members and lawyers. Actor Joshua Malina was also among the speakers at the rally at Malibu Library on Tuesday evening . Illegal levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which can cause cancer and effect the immune system, were found in classrooms at the school last year after teachers raised health concerns . Last year the school district agreed to investigate the concerns after 20 teachers signed a letter suggesting mould and other contaminants in some of the school's buildings made their colleagues ill - including three who were diagnosed with stage-one thyroid cancer in the previous six months. Superintendent Sandra Lyon has said the school's classrooms have been cleaned and they now meet Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, KTLA 5 has reported. According to the Los Angeles Register report, authorities have promised to clean up the school and weekly notices are sent out to keep parents up to date on the cleaning scheme.","Supermodel offered to pay for testing for toxic chemicals at the school .

The brainchild of restauranteur Ben Leventhal and financial investor Gary Vaynerchuk, it is working with restaurants directly to offer sold out seats. 'It depends on the restaurant, but each of the restaurants on Resy are turning over some of their reservations to us so we can offer them to customers, to our customers,' Leventhal  told Eater. Already available for limited download, Resy shows users up-to-the-minute reservations that are available in their area on a given evening and, like Uber, the price depends on demand. 'Those tables will vary in price, two bar seats on a Tuesday night at Charlie Bird might be ten bucks a piece and Saturday night at Minetta Tavern might be closer to fifty.' However the app has come under fire for being elitist on Twitter. Food writer and editor Gabriella Gershenson tweeted, 'Resy belongs in American Psycho's New York City.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . They are usually used for urgent warnings, navigation, or tooting a well-meaning goodbye before a long journey. But the horns of a giant cruise ship in the harbour of Hamburg Port were put to a more artistic use this weekend as they blasted out the well-known pop song Seven Nation Army. The captain of the huge MSC Magnifica showed off his vessel's musical capabilities on Friday with a rendition of the song, made famous by two-piece rock band The White Stripes. Scroll down for video . Tuneful: The MSC Magnifica serenaded onlookers . The simple yet catchy tune - often repeated at sporting events and among the staples of amateur musicians - boomed around the port on the first day of celebrations at the 825th anniversary of the German city's port, the second-largest in Europe. It was gratefully received by the enthusiastic crowd, despite the slower-than-usual tempo. Videos of the impromptu performance have been viewed tens of thousands of times on Youtube. As well as the ability to play simple tunes, the 95,000-ton Magnifica can also carry 3,500 passengers on its cruises, which take on a round trip from Southampton to Hamburg, via France and the Netherlands. It has three swimming pools, five restaurants, a cinema, casino and on-board theatre. The 300m ship has a top speed of 22 knots (25mph). The annual Port of Hamburg anniversary celebrations are billed as 'the world's greatest port festival'. This year's event began on Friday 9 May and finished this evening. Highlights of the festival included a grand arrival parade as ships poured into the port, a 'tugboat ballet' and a firework display. Anthem: The White Stripes, pictured here playing Seven Nation Army, won a Grammy for the song in 2004 . Seven Nation Army is by far the most popular song by The White Stripes, a two-piece rock band from Detroit. Jack White, the band's frontman, has previously spoken of how he enjoys it when his song crops up in expected places. In a 2006 interview he said: 'Nothing is more beautiful than when people embrace a melody... as a songwriter it is something impossible to plan. Especially in modern times.'

"By . Gerard Brand . Follow @@gedbrand10 . Eliaquim Mangala is British football's most expensive defender ever, but the new Manchester City recruit was put through his paces in training on Tuesday, and may have realised the step up from the Portuguese League to the Premier League is bigger than he thought. Signed for £32million from Porto, Mangala was pictured in his first training session at Carrington marking Sergio Aguero and Co. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mangala score with a cheeky back heel volley for Porto . Welcome: Mangala (centre) stands next to defensive partner Vincent Kompany in training . Runaround: Mangala becomes accustomed to his new team-mate Sergio Aguero . VIDEO City finally announce Mangala . Mangala, who had also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, becomes the second Porto player to join City this summer following Fernando’s £12m move to the Etihad. City needed more numbers at centre-back after injuries to Vincent Kompany and Matija Nasatasic left them short last term. Joleon Lescott also left on a free transfer to West Brom. Mangala, who is eligible to face Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday, is expected to form a centre-back partnership with captain Kompany, but admitted the holiday period was 'too long' upon his arrival at City. Working hard: Mangala admitted he tried to keep fit in what was a 'long summer' for the Frenchman . Taking a break: Mangala takes a drink (right) as manager Manuel Pellergrini looks on (left) Mangala said: ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure. I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays, but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible.' Mangala, 23, became City’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five-year deal, and manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in Europe will prove to be well worth the money. Recruit: Mangala is the most expensive defender in British football history at £31.9million . ‘I’m delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim’s quality in the squad,’ said Pellegrini, who saw his defence struggle in the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in Sunday’s Community Shield. ‘He is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe’s very best defenders.' Record breaker: Eliaquim Mangala has finally signed for Manchester City for £32m . Rarely seen: Mangala, consoling Antoine Griezmann, did not play a minute at the World Cup . City tried to sign Mangala and Porto pal Fernando in January but it’s taken until the summer to seal deals. Why the delay? Everything seemed ready to go last month, but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Porto only received £23m of the £31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to Doyen Sports Investments. But isn’t he French? He was born in Paris but moved to Belgium at five, where he started as a striker. Standard Liege converted him to a defender and sold him to Porto for £6m. He is one of four Frenchmen at City, along with Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy. Despite his fee he couldn’t get a game for France at the World Cup and was their fourth-choice centre back. Didn’t United want him? And Chelsea. Asked about his preference in May, he said: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it’s London.’ How will he fit into City's backline? Mangala has the tools — power, pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for Vincent Kompany. And doesn't he still retain some of that striker's instinct? He does - last season he scored three times in European competition (in the Champions League and Europa League). No defender netted more. Didn’t UEFA cap City’s net spend this summer at £49m? Yes, and they’ve spent £49.9m on Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini. Sagna was free and Frank Lampard is on loan. They got £10m from Sunderland for Jack Rodwell and £12m will follow when Javi Garcia joins Zenit St Petersburg.

She got the idea to re-purpose excess materials while she was a senior at Middlebury College in Vermont two years ago, inspired by a talk by . investor Jacqueline Novogratz about recycling-based businesses. Scroll down for video . Emily Núñez, 24, from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, got the idea to re-purpose excess materials in 2012 . Along with sister Betsy the pair upcycle shelter halves tents, laundry bags and sleeping bag covers . Emily began to think about what materials around her . were routinely wasted and could be recycled and turned into something . powerful, and shared her ideas with her sister Betsy, 26. They now run fashion firm Sword & Plough, while Emily works as a serving Intelligence Officer with the Group . Support Battalion in the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort . Carson, Colorado. The pair turn tents, laundry bags and sleeping . bag covers that would otherwise be thrown away or burned into sharp weekend bags, rucksacks and other accessories. Growing up in a military family Emily followed in her father's footsteps and joined the Army . 'It . has been challenging at times but the two roles complement each other. As an officer in the US Army your job is to lead soldiers and to . motivate them to accomplish a task. 'As the CEO, my job is to ensure that . we're accomplishing our social mission while keeping the team excited . about what we're doing,' she tells ABC's digital series Second . Tour, which profiles the lives of military . veterans who are doing unique things in the civilian world. Emily pondered everything that went to waste, shared her ideas with Betsy and they started a business . One of the main goals of her conscious company was to provide meaningful employment for veterans. They now mainly work with veteran owned, operated and . staffed manufactures - and they've recycled more than 15,000 lbs of military surplus. Growing up in a . military family Emily followed in her father's footsteps and joined the . Army, but after hearing the talk by Jacqueline Novogratz, founder . and CEO of Acumen Fund, Emily took note and put her social . entrepreneur spirit to work. And sister Betsy had every faith in her ideas. 'When she first told me about her idea I was so . surprised and happy that she shared that with me,' says Betsy. 'I knew this was . something that could be very special and could become something really . unique,' Betsy says. From that conversation the sisters continue to . build on the idea and business model. Emily also works as a serving Intelligence Officer at Fort Carson, Colorado . For Emily and Betsy Sword & Plough - a biblical phrase to 'turn swords into . ploughshares' - means . re-adapting military technology for a peaceful civilian purpose. While they never went to school for business and didn't have any . experience in fashion (their mother Judy put together the first prototype) nothing deterred them from their dream. 'It was a . challenge to start the business but at the same time it was a huge . opportunity,' she says. The . idea caught on and last year Sword and Plough participated in Mass .

That could all be about to change, however, after a millionaire property developer unveiled plans to bring a touch of the Middle East to the West Country. The ambitious project would see the Sandbanks peninsula in Poole transformed into an ultra-modern holiday destination, not dissimilar to Dubai’s Palm developments. Scroll down for video .

"By . Emily Allen . and Eddie Wrenn . Tourism leaders in Lebanon want to sue the producers of US drama 'Homeland' claiming the latest episode was full of 'lies' and wrongly depicts Beirut as harbouring terrorists. Lebanese Tourism Minister Fadi Abboud is so upset about the show's 'damaging' portrayal of the city that he is consulting lawyers. Abboud said the episode wrongly depicted the . city as a strong-hold for terrorists and a place where foreigners can . easily fall victim to random attacks. However his comments have now been overshadowed by a car bomb which rocked the city this afternoon. At least eight people have been killed and an estimated 80 people wounded in the worst blast seen in the city for years. Scroll down to see video of the aftermath . Syria links: The foiled terrorist plot is thought to have originated from Syria - in chilling echoes of the devastating explosion in Ashrafieh, east Beirut, pictured, .

A Lebanese men evacuates a wounded woman from the scene: This is the first such attack in the Lebanese capital since 2008 . The attack reportedly occurred as parents picked their children up from school. Reporters at the scene described seeing bloodied victims being . loaded in ambulances and heavy damage to residential buildings. The motive for the car-bomb is not immediately clear. However it comes at a . time when Lebanon has seen a rise in tension and eruptions of clashes stemming from the civil war in neighboring Syria. In . scenes reminiscent of the dark days of Lebanon's civil war, ambulances . ferried the wounded to several hospitals, where doctors, nurses and . students waited for casualties at the doors - meanwhile the hospitals . put out an appeal for blood donations. An employee of a bank on the street pointed to the blown-out windows of his building. 'Some people were wounded from my bank. I think it was a car bomb.

Lebanese Tourism Minister Fadi Abboud complained about Homeland's 'damaging' portrayal of Beirut -  just before a car bomb rocked the city . The war in neighbouring Syria, which has killed 30,000 people so far, has pitted mostly Sunni insurgents against President Bashar al-Assad, who is from the Alawite sect linked to Shi'ite Islam. Tension between Sunnis and Shi'ites has been rumbling in Lebanon ever since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war but reignited after the Syria conflict erupted. In Damascus, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoabie told reporters: 'We condemn this terrorist explosion and all these explosions wherever they happen. Nothing justifies them.' Phalange leader Sami al-Gemayel, a staunch opponent of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a member of parliament, condemned the attack. 'Let the state protect the citizens. We will not accept any procrastination in this matter, we cannot continue like that. We have been warning for a year. Enough,' said Gemayel, whose brother was assassinated in November 2006. The attack came just as the Tourism Minister Mr Abboud went on the offensive to try to revive . the city's reputation as the 'Paris of the Middle East' He insisted the city . was more secure than London or New York and feared foreigners would be put off. Controversial: Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, right, and Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson in a scene from the second season of 'Homeland,' which has come under fire by tourism leaders in Beirut for being 'damaging' Filming: The scene features Danes (pictured) aiming to take out a senior figure affiliated with Hezbollah, which is portrayed as a movement allied with Al Qaeda in the series, in Hamra Street, Beirut . Mr Abboud is particularly upset about the second episode of the Homeland, which he says shows the city to be a 'non secure zone'. He said: 'This kind of film damages the image of Lebanon – it is not fair to us . and it’s not true, it is not portraying reality.' 'We want to take action, we want to write to the filmmakers and . producers and demand an apology. 'And we are planning to raise a lawsuit . against the director and the producer', he told Executive magazine. The award-winning show, based on the Israeli series 'Prisoners of War,' is about a . U.S Marine named Nick Brody who was a POW for years in the Middle East. The federal government and the public . see Brody as a war hero, but a CIA operative played by Claire Danes . believes he was turned by the enemy and is now a threat to the U.S. In the episode 'Beirut is Back', which aired on Channel 4 last Sunday, Danes is aiming to take out a . senior figure affiliated with Lebanon’s Shiite Hezbollah organisation. The organisation is portrayed as a movement allied with Al-Qaeda in the series. The scene is supposed to be set in Hamra Street, West Beirut but Mr Abboud said the street is not violent and dirty but a lively, safe, . neighbourhood packed with cafes, book shops and pubs. Hamra Street in Beirut where the controversial scene was supposed to be set - but it was portrayed as violent when Mr Abboud said it was actually lively and safe and packed with shops, bars and cafes . During the 1960s Beirut attracted international superstars who would party in the city's seafront hotels. However this era was short-lived and ended when the civil war began in 1975. The city was ruled by militias and the city became divided between Christian and Muslims. It soon became known for its hostage-takings, suicide bombings and massacres. The Lebanon hostage crisis saw the kidnapping in Lebanon of 96 foreign hostages – mostly American and western European – between 1982 and 1992. Among the Britons taken was John McCarthy, who was set free in 1991 after more than five years in captivity, and Terry Waite, who spent four years in solitary confinement. Fighting continued to ravage the city, as did shelling from Israeli fighter plans, and there were many thousands of deaths, but from 1991 the city began to rebuild itself. It's now well on the road to being regarded as the most liberal and fun-loving major Arab cities. However, portrayal of Lebanon as swarming with guns is not unreasonable either. The country still has dozens of armed . militias that still flourish, and an alarming number of private . individuals have weapons in their homes. The biggest militia of all, . Iranian-backed Hezbollah, has gained so much power and influence over . the years that it's now part of the government, wielding virtual veto . power. Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces the Showtime drama, has refused to comment. Mr Abboud is also concerned about the fact the Beirut scenes were actually shot in Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis . about 150 miles south of Beirut. The two nations are technically at war. Jaffa, a popular mixed Jewish and Arab . neighbourhood of Tel Aviv, allowed the creators of . 'Homeland' to present a plausible version of Beirut. Ghada Jaber, a 60-year-old housewife, said Israel should never stand in for Lebanon. 'It is very insulting. Israel destroyed our country. Israel invaded and occupied our country.' However, Hamed Moussa, an engineering student at . the American University of Beirut, said it was not a problem that Israelis . are portraying Lebanese. He said Lebanese often play Israeli . characters in Lebanese soap operas. Ariel Kolitz, a childhood friend of . Gideon Raff, the Israeli co-creator of 'Homeland,' said the producers . didn't have the option of shooting in Beirut, where Raff and other . Israelis are not allowed to visit. Many Lebanese cannot forget the massive . destruction Israel inflicted on Beirut during the 1982 invasion when it . succeeded in routing the Palestine Liberation Organization from the . country. They resent the 18-year occupation of south Lebanon that . followed, and their leaders reject the existence of the . Jewish state. But to Israel, Lebanon has been a staging ground for missile strikes and other attacks on Israel, more than justifying the massive Israeli operations there that have occurred in every decade since the 1970s. Eytan Schwartz, a spokesman for Tel Aviv's mayor, said the Lebanese should be pleased at the TV show's choice for a stand-in. 'If I were Lebanese, with all due respect, I'd be very flattered that a city, and a world heritage site, thanks to its incredible architecture, and residents who were named among the top 10 most beautiful people in the world (ranked by Traveler's Digest magazine in 2012) could pass as Lebanese,' he said.","Lebanese Tourism Minister Fadi Abboud is consulting lawyers about legal action and is demanding an .

Three armed raiders who forced their way into homes to steal luxury cars and even threatened a nine-year-old boy with an axe have been jailed for almost 29 years. Gavin Hunt, 37, joined brothers Jamie Dixon, 32, and Christopher Dixon, 29, in a year-long tirade across the Midlands. Armed with sledgehammers, a crowbar and an axe, the gang broke into private homes and terrorised owners into surrendering their valuables. On one occasion they threatened a nine-year-old boy with the axe in a bid to make off with his father's two luxury cars. The gang burst into the home of wealthy property developer Rajinder Auluk in Birmingham, West Midlands. They told the terrified child they would 'cut him' unless he handed over cash and valuables. Mr Auluk gave the armed gang the keys and they quickly made off with his Nissan Pulsar GTR and a Mercedes CLK. The cars were later found abandoned nearby. Blasting the Birmingham-based trio as 'cowardly and callous', Judge Paul Farrer QC sentenced them to a total of 28 years and 11 months. Hunt admitted two charges of conspiracy to rob and was jailed for 12 years and 10 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday. Jamie Dixon admitted one charge of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to eight years and ten months. He was also classified as a 'dangerous offender' - meaning he must serve two thirds of his sentence before being eligible for parole. His brother Christopher Dixon admitted one charge of conspiracy to rob and was jailed for seven years and three months. Mr Farrer said: 'Sledgehammers, a crow bar and on one occasion an axe were carried in order to terrorise the people within. 'High value property was targeted and successfully stolen.' The judge also said the gang's planning involved 'real sophistication,' adding: 'Reconnaissance trips were conducted to scout out the premises to be robbed.' And he described the incident involving the Mr Auluk's nine-year-old son as an attack 'which no right thinking individual would have contemplated.' Terrorized: Gavin Hunt, 39, (left) and Christopher Dixon, 29 (right) were also jailed at Birmingham Crown Court . Seized: They made off with this black Nissan GTR after threatening the owner's nine-year-old son with an axe . Prosecutor . Malcolm Morse, told the court that between the end of 2012 and January . this year the gang 'knew what they wanted' and attacked five homes as . well as two cash and carry premises. The . gang wore dark clothes, gloves and balaclavas and targeted Audis . including one worth £70,000 which was taken from an address in . Northampton. Victims . were also tied with plastic cable ties and on another occasion a member . wore a 'scream' mask before bursting into a house in Boldmere, Sutton . Coldfield, West Mids. Horrific: These are the enormous weapons that the trio wielded as they broke into homes across the Midlands . Stolen: They broke into the Birmingham home of property develop Rajinder Auluk to steal his Mercedes . And when the householder tried to repel the gang with a hammer, he was hit a number of times with a crowbar. The court also heard the gang broke into . Mr Auluk's £360,000 detached family home and held an axe against his . nine-year-old son's neck on January 28 this year. Speaking at the time, the father-of-two said: 'We had just finished eating when my nine-year-old son went into the front room to get ready to watch wrestling on the TV. Trauma: Mr Auluk, 40, has spoken out about his terror - and that of his son who was faced with an axe . 'I heard a . loud crash at the front door and suddenly an explosion hit me in the . face as these men with axes and sledgehammers came piling through the . door. 'I said, 'take what you want' but they carried on shouting and held an axe to my youngest's neck. 'It was true panic. I was angry and frightened, but my main concern was what they were going to do to the little guy, I thought he was going to cut him.' Another family in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, were tied up and barricaded into a room while the crooks raided their home. Mr Morse told the court a laptop found at Hunt's home showed that the sophisticated gang had researched premises before attacking them. He said that Hunt and Jamie Dixon were arrested after the Audi they had stolen - which had a tracker device - ran out of petrol. Defending Hunt, Michael Anning said he had been recruited to play a specific role of driving to and from the offences and that no extreme violence had been used. After the hearing, Detective Constable Damian Forrest, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We are satisfied with the sentences handed to these dangerous individuals, and that they will no longer be able to terrorise residents in their homes or people at work for cash and cars. 'Thankfully, none of the victims were badly hurt in these robberies, but I have no doubt that the gang would have used serious violence to achieve their objectives if they had not got what they wanted. 'These robberies had a serious effect on the families targeted and I know they are pleased Hunt and the Dixon brothers will spend a considerable amount of time behind bars for what they put them through.'","Gavin Hunt joined brothers Jamie and Christopher Dixon in robbing spree .

Waste not: 10 tonnes of chalk waste mixed 10 per cent of clay create the walls, which are covered with tiles, left, while recycled products, such as this light fitting, right, make up the rest of Brighton's Waste House . He is . conducting an experiment into eco-friendly living and seeing if waste . materials can serve as the sole insulation in walls. According Baker-Brown, the idea is ‘that there is no such thing as waste, just stuff in the wrong place.’ The project is based on the building that Baker-Brown created in 2008 with Kevin McCloud from Channel 4's Grand Designs show. The 2008 version of the house- ‘House That Kevin Built' -  was the UK's first contemporary low-energy prefabricated house built using entirely ecologically friendly materials. ‘We have, with our students, been designing, re-designing and developing new methods of sustainable construction and new ways of using materials in order to create a truly contemporary representation of the constantly evolving ideas in this field,’ says Baker-Brown. View from above: The house began construction in April and opened for public viewing in June . Brush of genius: Old toothbrushes are used to fill cavities in walls instead of teeth . Work began on Brighton’s Waste House in April and by June the dwelling was open for public viewing. Over the next few years, university students . will observe the quality of the exterior walls to see if plastic can act as a . sustainable insulation material. Thrown-away . bricks, ply sheets and wood from other construction projects, as well . as old plastic razors, denim jeans, DVDs and video cassettes, have been . slotted into wall cavities as insulation, . and will be monitored to see how efficient they . are. The Brighton Waste House aims to prove that low-carbon materials can compete effectively with their more established high-energy, high-carbon counterparts. When fully completed, it will be one of the first A* energy-efficient rated sustainable buildings in the UK.","Brighton University's Waste House is made entirely of recycled materials .

"By . Jennifer Smith . The son of a world-class jazz musician has been jailed after attacking a cyclist who clipped the wing mirror of his car. Daniel Watkiss, the son of Cleveland Watkiss, was driving through Stoke Newington, east London, when he tried to overtake cyclist James Falle last July. When the victim accidentally touched his wing mirror while signalling for him to move past, the 30-year-old sped his BMW round and stopped suddenly in front of the bike. Daniel Watkiss was jailed for 18 months after attacking the cyclist after trying to overtake him in east London . Cleveland Watkiss has been hailed as Britain's best jazz singer. The vocalist 'broke down' in court as his son's sentence was read out . After demanding £50 to pay for the 'damage', Watkiss 'grabbed' the cyclist by the helmet before hitting him in the face. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday after being found guilty of dangerous driving and assault by beating. His father, who has performed with Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Keith Richards among others, broke down in tears as his sentence was read out. The court heard how Watkiss 'strangled' the cyclist by gripping the strap of his helmet so tightly. Cleveland Watkiss at Snaresbrook Crown Court . Giving evidence, Mr Falle described falling off his bike when the father-of-one swung his luxury car in front of him and braked suddenly. 'The next thing I knew he had grabbed my helmet and pulled me across my bike and into the road. ‘The strap on my helmet was strangling me; I couldn't breathe at this stage. I was trying to undo the helmet with one hand, but that was impossible while I was still being dragged forward,' he said. Watkiss started rifling through the man's pockets before trying to force him to produce his wallet to pay for the mirror which was not damaged, according to witnesses. Mr Falle was then struck across the face and neck before his attacker sped off, leaving him with bloody knees, cuts and bruises. Defence agent Liam Loughlin said: 'The reason he pleaded not guilty is that he was simply terrified of going to prison.' He added Watkiss has to provide for his 10-year-old son who has special educational needs, and would probably lose his job as a youth worker in the London Borough of Hackney if he went to prison. He added: ‘He’s remorseful and he puts it down to a moment of madness.’ Passing a sentence of 18 months in prison and a two year driving ban Judge Patricia Lees said: 'Mr Falle is an experienced cyclist and he is used to cycling in London, he was plainly not trying to aggravate the driver behind him.’ ‘You demanded restitution for the wing mirror, it was a nonsense, it was not damaged, and even if it had been there is no way a wing mirror costs £50. ‘The only explanation you could give was that you were planning on doing the work yourself and would need to buy parts.’ ‘It seems to me this offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is justified. ‘But because of you family matters I have reduced your sentence to shorter than you deserve.’ Cleveland Watkiss from Hackney, east London, has been hailed in the past as Britain's best male jazz singer. Born to Jamaican parents as one of nine children, the 54-year-old won best vocalist in the 2010 London Jazz Awards and was named best vocalist in the Wire/Guardian Jazz Awards for three years in a row. After studying at the London School of Singing with an opera coach, Watkiss released five solo albums before teaching musical workshops across London. He has performed with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as well as Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Keith Richards and pop stars such as Robbie Williams. Watkiss was hand picked to open two of the worlds greatest female jazz vocalists Cassandra Wilson and Abbey Lincoln. Recently he has put together a jazz quarter and continues to perform around London and the rest of the world. He was chosen to launch the Cultural Olympiad by Sebastian Coe ahead of the 2012 Games in a bid to promote London's culture alongside sport.

"By . Rob Draper for Mail On Sunday . Follow @@draper_rob . Jose Mourinho claims it would not be a failure if his Chelsea team finish second, despite being title favourites and having spent £75million in the transfer market. Mourinho derided Arsene Wenger as a ‘specialist in failure’ last season, referring to the Arsenal manager’s nine years without a trophy, which finally ended in May when Arsenal won the FA Cup. But the Portuguese seems to have softened his tone for this season, saying: ‘It’s the only league in the world where four, five or six clubs are title contenders. Only one can win. Do the other five fail? I don’t think so. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho discusses Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois' rivalry . No pressure: Jose Mourinho has revealed he is expecting a tough title challenge this season . Season opener: Portuguese tactician Mourinho has been preparing his side for Chelsea's game at Burnley . ‘One view is that one succeeded and five failed. Another view is that three, four or five did fantastically but only one won.’ Chelsea open their season at Turf Moor against Burnley on Monday and Mourinho added: ‘I can do nothing more than say: “We feel we are title contenders.” The only thing I can add is that probably, if you ask every manager in the Premier League are you a title contender, probably four, five or six will tell you, “Yes.” Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and the Stamford Bridge board expect Mourinho to challenge for the title. But they seem to have a greater understanding of the increased competitiveness of the Premier League and appreciate that winning the league is more difficult than ever. Mourinho is the only manager in the Abramovich era to have kept his job despite not having won a trophy at the end of the season, Claudio Ranieri and Avram Grant being the two previous incumbents sacked for that failing. But despite their heavy spending, Chelsea have balanced the books this summer, selling David Luiz for £50m, Romelu Lukaku for £28m and Demba Ba for £4.7m. And Mourinho said: ‘If the team finishing first is better than us — if we are very good but somebody is better than us — that’s football. That’s not a failure. The only thing you can do is be good. ‘We have to be good, we have to better than last season as a team, the quality of our game, in everything we have to be better. ‘We have to fight for the title and after that if somebody is really better than us, it’s because they were fantastic.’ High-profile departures: David Luiz is one of several players who have been allowed to leave Stamford Bridge .","The Chelsea manager believes up to six teams are competing for the title .
