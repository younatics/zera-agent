Malcolm Dyer, 59, of Ascot, Berkshire, who witnessed the incident last Wednesday at 1:10pm, said the woman immediately started to panic and he told someone to pull the emergency handle. Scary: The woman, who had placed the child in its pram on the train before returning to the platform at South Kensington station (file picture) in central London, went to pick up her luggage when the doors shut . The fire consultant told the London Evening Standard: ‘I saw the woman try to get on the train as the doors were closing.

The doors were going “Beep, beep, beep” and closed before she got on.

"By . Lewis Smith . PUBLISHED: . 18:00 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:45 EST, 4 June 2013 . Eight amazingly preserved log boats have been hailed as ‘more important than the Mary Rose’ after being dug up from a silted-up river. The boats, the largest of them 28 feet (8.5m) long, are thought to have been used for ferrying cargo and passengers in the Fens some 3,500 years ago. They are now being preserved for future study and as a tourist attraction using the same conservation techniques that saved the Mary Rose from falling apart when raised from the Solent. Ian Panter, of the York Archaological Trust and the log project's conservationist, inspects one of the eight Bronze Age log boats dug out of the ground at a quarry near Peterborough. The vessels, thought to be up to 3,500-years-old would most likely have been used to transport people and cargo . The boats resemble those used during the annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Although, the current international class eights race boats are more than twice the length of those found in Peterborough - at 19.9m long. Log boats from the Bronze Age have been found before but never have so many been found in the same place. ‘This is amazingly significant,’ Ian Panter, of the York Archaeological Trust and the log project’s conservationist, told MailOnline. ‘You normally get just the one boat. Eight in one spot is phenomenal. ‘What’s more, they were excavated under controlled archaeological conditions. Normally you get them when there’s pipe-laying going on, but we have been able give them the full works. ‘In terms of significance it’s probably even bigger than the Mary Rose.’ One of the recovered log boats was decorated with a criss-cross pattern on both the inside and the outside of the vessel. It is uncertain whether there was any particular significance to the decoration or if the owner simply wanted to personalise it . Archaeologists said they provide an . extraordinary window not just into boat-building and woodwork techniques . of the Bronze Age, but how human ingenuity overcame a changing . environment. About 4,000 . years ago rising sea levels caused wide areas of previously dry the land . near Peterborough and further east to be flooded and turn into wetland. People living in the region faced a transformed landscape but, archaeologists said, the boats and other artifacts found at Must Farm and the surrounding area demonstrate they quickly adapted. The log boats discovered in Peterborough were a similar elegant shape to those used during the annual Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. The log boats are around 8.5m long whereas the international class eights boats are more than double this length, at 19.9m. This gives archaeologists clues as to how many people could sit in the log boat compared to modern-day vessels . Each of the boats was hewn from a single tree trunk, six of them oaks, one alder and one lime. And it is clear from the repair work and patches that have been found on each of the vessels that they were greatly valued by their owners. ‘They have all been used for a long time,’ said Mr Panter. ‘They have patches. One has a clay lining which was added to make it watertight. One or two have had plugs of wood put in.’ The timbers were kept wet before archaeologists moved the boats from the mud to a purpose-built facility. Techniques pioneered on the Mary Rose Tudor warship are being employed to preserve the eight log boats. One of them was decorated with a pattern of crosses on the inside and outside of the log, but the significance is unclear. Quite why each of them ended up at the bottom of an old course and now silted up course of the River Nene remains a mystery. It appears that they were all, separately, sunk deliberately over a period of about 600 years when the transom board from the stern was removed. Because of the way the boats were made, they had to have a transom fitted at one end to replace wood that would have rotted. All eight have been found with a slot for the transom board. ‘All the transom boards have been removed and we didn’t find them. That suggests they have been sunk intentionally,’ said Mr Panter. It is the first time so many Bronze Age log boats have been found so close together. Usually log boats are found singly but at Much Farm there were eight, and they were all painstakingly excavated by archaeologists . ‘They have all been found at different depths within the channel. Each one has been sunk at a different time – it wasn’t a single episode.’ They could have been sunk as votive offerings to the gods or spirits, just as metal objects including swords and spears were in the same river. Another theory is that they were sunk for the winter season to prevent them drying out and splitting, before being somehow forgotten or lost. Or it could simply have been that the owner obtained a new vessel and decided it was time to get rid of the old one. The smallest of the eight boats is about 11.5 feet (3.5m) long and little more than a foot wide (30-40cm), while the largest is 28 feet long and about 2.5 feet (75cm) wide. The eight Bronze Age boats have been moved to a purpose-built facility where they will be conserved. Over the two-year project they will be sprayed with a special wax that will preserve the timbers . Mr Panter said all were likely to have been used to ferry passengers and cargo, with the largest able to transport about 15 people in one go. There are even indications that the 28-foot vessel was cut down from an even bigger boat. It remains unclear how they were propelled but it is most likely that paddles were used, though none have been found. Last week it was reported that The . National Trust has recreated a 2,300-year-old Iron Age log boat . hand-carved from a tree trunk. More than 200 people helped fashion the one-tonne log boat over a three-week period from a section of fallen 80ft oak tree. Emma Turvey, a conservation technician, inspects one of the boats in cold storage. The boats, which can be viewed through glass panels by the public, has slots for transom boards and some of them had carrying handles . The 15ft vessel is a scaled down copy of a 35ft Iron Age log boat discovered at the bottom of Poole Harbour almost 50 years ago. The original boat, discovered in 1964, was discovered after routine dredging work but it is now only display at Poole Museum. Visitors to Brownsea Island, the largest of eight islands in Poole Harbour, helped shape the flat-fronted boat using an adze, an ancient axe-like tool used for wood carving. The team restoring the Bronze Age log boat believe the settlement was located about a third of a mile from where the eight log boats were found and other artifacts in the area include ceramics, tools, glass beads and eel traps were also located. Last week it was reported that the National Trust has constructed a 2,300-year-old Celtic log boat over the course of three weeks in tribute to the one discovered in Poole harbour in 1964 . ‘It’s telling us quite a lot about woodworking in the Bronze Age,' said Mr Panter. ‘I think we are looking at something which certainly from the construction of the vessels and the way they have been maintained, it was quite an advanced technology. The eight log boats are just some of the relics that are associated with the Flag Fen landscape in the Bronze Age. About 4000-years-ago sea level rises created a wetland and the people living there had to adapt to a new way of life. Among the artefacts are the remains of a wooden causeway about 3,350-years old that is considered to be as significant as Stonehenge. The causeway is about the size of Wembley Stadium and was constructed over 400 years. On a neighbouring site was discovered the oldest knwon wheel in England and one of the most important collections of Bronze Age swords and dirks. ‘They didn’t just stand in the water trying to fish. They knew how to trap them and were making ceramics and glass.’ The boats were discovered in 2011 at Must Farm clay quarry which supplies the brick-making industry. They have now been moved to a refrigerated unit at Flag Fen, near Peterborough, where they are being sprayed with a specialised wax, polyethylene glycol, to protect the timber and where they can be viewed by the public. Mr Panter added: 'To under take the conservation with the public able to view it and watch the process develop over the next few years is a great opportunity. 'We're keeping the boats wet and cold to help keep everything as it is - so there's no biological activity to digest through the timber - to reduce decay of the wood.' Mark Knight from Cambridge Archaeological Unit, one of Britain’s leading prehistoric and wetland field archaeologists, said: ‘It is tremendously important that the Must Farm boats were brought to Flag Fen, because they are part of the same story. ‘The boats’ arrival at Flag Fen represents a kind of ‘coming home’ because both the boats and the causeway discovered at Flag Fen in the 1980s and now on display to the public, represent novel kinds of conveyances in a landscape fast disappearing beneath rising waters.’","The boats, the largest of them 28 feet long, are thought to have been used for ferrying cargo and .

After escaping media attention when her husband died in a tragic 2005 blaze, the widow of a Bronx firefighter said she moved into a haunted home in Long Island. Jeanette Meyran, 53, moved her two daughters to a secluded bungalow in St. James, N.Y., the year after her husband, Lt. Curtis Meyran, leaped to his death instead of burning alive in the 'Black Sunday' fire. Though she hoped for a fresh start in the two-story house, Meyran said she and her kids were terrorized by a demon after they made renovations in the 'Paranormal Witness' season three premiere on SyFy. 'In your wildest dreams, did you ever think rebuilding a home would cause such devastation?' Meyran said in the 'Paranormal Witness' episode 'The Long Island Terror'. Haunted: After her husband died in a tragic 2005 fire, Jeanette Meyran, 53, moved to a secluded home on Long Island she said was haunted . Long Island terror: The family's new home in St. James, New York, was not the retreat they hoped it would be . Meyran and her family believe the haunting is linked to the house's first owners. During renovations, her husband's friends found an 86-year-old diary describing satanic rituals with animal sacrifices. 'The pages seemed to be written by the young girl that was the daughter of someone who lived in the house,' described Meyran. 'I saw the name Christina. I realized that she was only a few years older than my own daughters.' Meyran said the diary was 'an incredibly dark story'. 'She would talk about her father. There were sacrifices. ""He hurt me again"" or ""He hurts the animals. They're bleeding and I bleed like they bleed"",' Meyran said. 'These people were sick. This is what went on in this house.' But Meyran and her daughters came to the house to escape other demons. After her husband died, Meyran said New York City media were relentless in trying to get interviews from her and her kids. 'I said maybe we should find some small place where we could maybe escape from this, away from the city, away from the cameras, and hopefully they'll find some peace,' said Meyran.'We just wanted to be left alone,' Danine Meyran, now 15, said on the show. 'I began to see this was a new way to give them a new life,' she said. Devastated: After her husband Lt. Curtis Meyran, left, died in a 2005 apartment building fire, Jeanette Meyran, shown at his funeral right, moved her kids to a new home in Long Island, but she said it was haunted . They moved from their home in Malverne, N.Y., to a small house in on an acre of Suffolk County forest that needed some work and her husband's firefighter friends were happy to help out. Afraid of looters during  construction, they installed cameras. Watching one of the camera feeds in 2006, Meyran saw a man in the woods surrounded her house. 'Right in the middle of the frame I saw what appeared to be a man,' Meyran said. 'It made no sense.' The paranormal occurrences continued. Starting in 2007, her daughters heard thumps and knocking that appeared to be coming from the walls in the middle of the night. 'It's new to us, we have to learn the sounds of the house,' Meyran remembered thinking of her daughters' experience. Danine and Angela Meyran, now 18, found a pentagram—as well as bones and teeth—in the woods. While fixing up the basement, Meyran's husband's friends also found a pentagram etched into the concrete floor. Solution: Jeanette Meyran and her two daughters, Danine, left, and Angela, right, tried using holy water to get rid of the spirits, but to no avail . Terrified: Danine Meyran, 15, said she and her sister found a pentagram in the backyard of their 'haunted' house. She also describes being trapped by a paranormal being in her house . When Angela was home alone one night, she became terrified when the kitchen was apparently ransacked by a ghost or spirit. 'My mom had left me alone in the house. She had given me instructions when she left that she wanted to clean up,' Angela explained on the show. 'And I just remember feeling like I wasn't alone. I looked back behind me a couple of times and there was nobody there.I couldn't shake this feeling of having somebody watching me and it was really starting to bother me.' When Meyran came home, she said she saw every cabinet and every drawer out. 'The place looked like it had been ransacked,' Meyran said. 'Was someone trying to hurt us? Was someone physically here?' The family heard whispers in the walls, some calling out their names. Meyran and her daughters also described how Danine was trapped by something in the house. 'It looked like she was having a seizure she was so frightened,' Meyran said, adding that she heard noises that 'sounded like someone was performing a ritual'. Trapped: Angela Meyran, 18, said she was trapped underneath her bed by a demon after her family moved to a new home in Long Island . Meyran and her daughters called out for their dead husband and father. 'This is the time more than anything . that I needed my dad, that I needed him to be there,' Danine said. 'I knew that if he . was there, everything would just be fine.' 'How do you protect you children? How can you fight what you can't see?' Meyran said. 'I felt something evil. I was so frightened,' Meyran said, describing another encounter. In 2008, they hired a priest to get rid of any paranormal activity, but the holy water he gave the family didn't help. The next year Angela went outside to go on the swings. She and Meyran said something pushed her off the swing, causing her to break her ankle. Angela also saw something in her bedroom mirror. 'I saw a black figure that kind of stepped out of my mirror. What could I do? I couldn't run,' said Angela, who added she hid under her bed. 'It smelled like death.' Satanic: In this SyFy reenactment, Angela and Danine Meyran find a pentagram in the backyard of their new home, which they said was haunted . Caught on camera: While trying out her new phone's camera, Jeanette captured what she believes to be the silhouette of her dead husband - another of the mysterious occurrences at the home . Strange magic: Meyran shares a still of a video she took when a pizza box mysteriously combusted in the home's fireplace . Following this incident, Meyran took her daughters to her mother's house and called a paranormal investigator, Liz Milano, early in the morning. 'They had so much tragedy in their life with their dad and her husband and then this thing creeps in and takes over,' said Milano on the show. Along with a psychic medium, Milano said she cleansed the house with kosher salt,sage and a blessing in 2011. 'It was like a battle. I heard chanting, I heard screaming,' Meyran said. Meyran and her family said the blessing worked. They still live in the house and cleanse it every three months, Meyran told The New York Post. Sometimes they still see ghosts. 'I see my dad in this house walking through the hallways checking on us. It’s nice to know he’s watching,' Angela told the Post.","Jeanette Meyran, 53, moved for a fresh start after her husband leaped to his death from a burning apartment .

"By . Liz Jones . PUBLISHED: . 19:18 EST, 12 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 12 May 2013 . The catwalks were full of white for this summer. The models were like ghosts - or at least looked as though they were still in their nighties. Stella McCartney showed a white mesh blouson, Victoria Beckham a white blouse and skater skirt edged with orange, Valentino a white cotton blouse and skirt in broderie anglaise. Moschino even sent out a white broderie anglaise jumpsuit, with side cleavage exposed. Now I have a little bit of a problem with a grown woman wearing broderie anglaise, a crisp holey fabric meant only for children. This fabric, especially in a maxi skirt, reminds me of that dreadful fashion trend: boho. Broderie anglaise is meant to look stiff, and clean, as though cut from expensive writing paper, but the boho appropriation rendered it sloppy, tiered and creased. Valentino Spring Summer 2013 Paris Fashion Week, left, and Stella McCartney Fall-Winter 2013/2014 during Paris fashion week., right . But white can be wonderful, especially in a crisp white shirt or extra thick, extra-long white T-shirt (when I had money, I would relegate a perfect white Gap tee to its next incarnation as a duster after one wear). Prada Sport does the best white tee in the world - thick, with a tiny pocket - but if you want to eat this month, try the new range at M&S instead. A washing tip: don't over-heat, and add a touch of Vanish, which avoids any yellowing. Pairing white jeans with a striped Breton top, or navy blazer, will take you anywhere, but anything head-to-toe white I find slightly problematic: you might look like Nurse Ratched, as though you have misplaced your insane asylum patient. So if you choose this look you must add a touch of colour somewhere: in an orange belt or bag, a zingy shoe, an embellished neckline or at least fluorescent nails. Far better is to choose just one piece in white: I love Topshop's leather mini skirt, and its longline silk tuxedo jacket (Topshop Unique, £195), which is great over anything: shorts, brown legs and flats on holiday, or even a long dress for evening, sleeves pushed up to the elbow. A black tux looks great with white stilettos, which are no longer considered Essex at all. (Whistles has a mid-heel stiletto, Cassini, for £125.) A fantastic little book is How To Wear White, by Francesca Beauman (Bloomsbury, £12.99), whose author, rather perversely, believes ‘white suits very few people'. It warns that any bride over the age of 35 should eschew this colour entirely, an edict I find a tad harsh. Better than pure white, she advises, is to choose something that is just ‘off'. White, of course, comes in many shades, from ivory to chalk, so it shouldn't be hard to avoid pure or paper white. My advice? Never wear white when your dress is long: it can look too bridey. Coats in white are problematic too: you will spend a fortune on dry cleaning. A white bag is perfect for a wedding (please don't carry your old battered, sagging, scuffed work bag anywhere this summer), but it must be blemish-free: my trick is to use the soft cloth bag you bought it in as a sort of extra lining inside, and never, ever carry a Biro, or touch it when there is any trace of foundation on your fingers. Underwear must be nude or white, with no twiddly bits, as white can be see-through. White fabrics I'd avoid (as well as broderie anglaise) include lace, linen and embroidery of any sort - it gets a bit Heidi. A sheer panel in white looks very fresh: see Topshop's A-line skirt with sheer stripe, or Stella McCartney's sheer shirt. My favourite look for summer is an oversized wool sweater in school uniform grey (by Dries Van Noten) over a sheer white shirt (Paul Smith, Frank & Eileen do long white shirts in voile) with tails poking out from beneath. My top white buys for summer . I thought I would give the nice people at Burberry a little challenge. So on the day of my visit I wore a pair of dirty wellies, had no make-up on, which tends to frighten people, and took along my border collie, Michael. Oh, and I was carrying two heavy bags. And an extension lead, so Michael could roam at weird angles, threatening to trip me up in a cat's cradle. Liz Jones was impressed with the service in Burberry on Bond Street, especially since she brought her dog shopping with her . To my surprise, the doorman opened the door for my motley load, nodded, smiled, and even offered to hold my laptop while I browsed. Michael hovered perilously close to all the embellished trenches, and to the fur, and to the python, but not one impeccably dressed and very pretty sales assistant turned a hair. This store was full of tourists, unlike Hermes opposite, which seemed as quiet as a country church in comparison. I asked for a cheap option for a wedding, which raised brows, as nothing there is cheap, although the staff were helpful, directing me towards simple cotton dresses, and a scarf, although even these summer scarves were £275. I didn't try anything on, as with a dog, it was far too complicated, plus I didn't want to get the sales assistants' backs up by not buying anything. Nevertheless, this store seemed welcoming and unsnooty. They only lose a point for not having a bowl of water near the door for dogs. 9/10 .","Stella McCartney showed a white mesh blouson .

Two small explosions were heard outside the Conservative Party headquarters in the small south Lincolnshire market town of Bourne between 12.20 and 1.30am today. A window was smashed by shrapnel from one of the devices and scorch marks were left on the pavement outside the building which is the constituency office for Grantham and Stamford MP Nick Boles.

George Zimmerman revealed his dramatic weight gain during his latest court appearance today as a judge denied his attorney's request to let some witnesses testify in private. Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest, appeared in court on Thursday as his lawyer asked the judge for some witnesses to give their testimony out of the public eye. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the witnesses have concerns for their safety about testifying at Zimmerman's trial, which starts next week. Changed: George Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest for the killing of Trayvon Martin, arrives in Seminole circuit court for a hearing on Thursday - revealing his dramatic weight gain . Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year . O'Mara said that the seven witnesses he wanted to keep hidden include one eyewitness to the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin on the night of February 26, 2012. He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision, but prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request. Prosecutor John Guy had opposed the request, explaining it might be 'alarming and confusing to a juror and might otherwise highlight their testimony when it shouldn’t be highlighted'. O'Mara also called Ben Kruidbos, a former IT director in the state prosecutor's office, to the stand. The defense claims Kruidbos is a whistleblower who revealed deleted texts, photographs, and video found on the teenager's phone which prosecutors failed to disclose to the defense. Different: Zimmerman, pictured left on Thursday, shows his weight gain since a hearing in April 2010, right . In court: A judge denied his attorney's request that some witnesses testify in private . The information includes Martin possibly holding a gun and smoking marijuana. With the photos and text messages, Zimmerman's attorneys hope to show . that Martin wasn't the 'angel' he's been made out to be by his family, . attorneys, and the media, but rather an experienced fighter who used . drugs. O'Mara also told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting . was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he . confronted Martin last year at a gated community in Sanford, Florida. 'We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with . the event,' O'Mara said. 'It could have affected his behavior.' Rejection: Circuit Judge Debra Nelson talks with defense and prosecuting attorneys at the pre-trial hearing. She denied a request from Zimmeman's attorney Mark O'Mara, left, to allow confidential testimony . But the judge ruled that the photos, . messages and social media records cannot be mentioned in Zimmerman's . opening statement, although they could be looked at later in the trial. An . attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said the teen's parents . were pleased with the judge's rulings. 'Trayvon Martin is not on trial,' Crump said. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused to allow jurors to travel to the . shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay . the trial set to begin June 10. The judge called the request to let jurors see the crime scene 'a logistical nightmare.' Drastic: An image taken a day after the shooting shows a much slimmer Zimmerman as he recounts the attack . Killed: Trayvon Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was shot dead as he walked home in February 2012 . Zimmerman, 29, is pleading not guilty, claiming he shot the unarmed teenager in February 2012 in self-defense when the boy fought with him and went to grab his gun, he said. A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic. Jury selection begins on Monday.

Prices have rocketed by 56 per cent in the past year. Salmon supplies have become more scare because of bad weather. Pricey: A shortage of salmon has made it an expensive treat over the past year . Trade magazine The Grocer said . yesterday: 'Bad news for fish fans – one of the UK’s most popular . species - salmon - is currently experiencing sharp price increases.' The report says that cold weather in Norway has caused salmon growth rates to slow down, thus reducing production and pushing prices up higher. At £4,745 a tonne, farmed Norwegian salmon is now 56.1per cent more expensive than this time last year and up by 4.5per cent month on month, says The Grocer. Salmon prices are being supported further by rising fishmeal prices, which has hit commercial producers and then consumers in turn. This has pushed up production costs on fish farms. The Grocer said that the picture also . remains challenging for coldwater prawns, with prices rising because . global supply has tightened. The . total allowable catch for coldwater prawns this year is 90.000 tonnes . smaller than in 2012. This caused prices to increase by 36.6per cent . year-on-year.

A drug addict has admitted killing his own toddler son, who died of an overdose after swallowing a huge amount of his father's heroin. Daniel Jones, who was 23 months old, passed away after consuming a whole wrap of the Class A drug at home in May last year. Parents Emma Bradburn, 34, and Simon Jones, 30, were arrested in December after extensive tests on Daniel's body revealed there was enough heroin in his system to kill an adult. Death: Parents Simon Jones and Emma Bradburn have admitted playing a part in the death of their baby son Daniel Jones, who died of a heroin overdose last year . Further examination of hair samples from Daniel - who was known to social services - revealed he had also been exposed to a horrifying cocktail of drugs. The court heard he suffered 'chronic' exposure to cannabis and opiates and 'occasional' exposure to amphetamines and cocaine. Jones today pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the youngster when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Victim: Daniel was nearly two when he died, after swallowing a wrap of heroin he found . His partner had previously admitted causing or allowing the death of her child, but had denied manslaughter. Prosecutors revealed yesterday they would accept Bradburn's guilty plea to the lesser charge. Daniel was pronounced dead when paramedics were called to the £200,000 home the pair shared in Wolverhampton, West Midlands at 6.15am on May 29. Roger Blezzard, prosecuting, told the court previously: 'Both of the defendants were living together with a small child. 'Their behaviour resulted in the child taking an overdose of heroin which has caused his death. 'Substantial evidence of exposure to other controlled drugs was also found from toxicology reports from the child's hair. 'There is the suspicion the child had been exposed for some time to drug consumption.' The pair were remanded in custody for reports to be prepared and will be sentenced on July 3. Police revealed after the case that they had found a cannabis factory in the couple's loft following the death of Daniel. Neighbours revealed how the couple had moved to the area after Bradburn was given a hefty compensation payout following a car accident several years ago. Local resident Natalie Baker, 38, said: 'She got compensation following an accident and was in a coma for about a year. 'They bought the house outright and moved up here from Low Hill which is a more downmarket area. 'It was a bit of a shock when it all happened. 'They seemed to have a lot of support from family members who were always coming and going. 'But there were also coppers everywhere so we knew something was wrong. 'They told all of us it was cot death which seemed a bit suspicious because he was too old. 'I asked her a couple of months ago if she'd had the funeral yet but she said they were still waiting for toxicology results. Crime scene: Daniel consumed the drugs in the £200,000 home in Wolverhampton he lived in with his mother and father (pictured) until he died in May 2012 . 'I knew they smoked weed because you could constantly smell it coming from the house. 'There were lots of dodgy characters always coming and going. 'But I had no idea about the harder stuff. 'It makes me sick to think about it. Shame: Baby Daniel lived in a home strewn with drug paraphernalia, which the parents tried to hide from the authorities . 'Daniel was ever such a sweet little boy, he called himself 'Superman' because he always wore a t-shirt with the red and yellow 'S' on it.' Other residents said Daniel's death had been 'devastating' for the local community. Anthony Baker, 67, and daughter Natalie, 38, who live next door, added: 'It was devastating. 'He was an ordinary child. I used to have a laugh with him over the fence. 'He was just a normal happy child.' Another neighbour said: 'Daniel was a little sunbeam, his smile would light up a room. 'It's evil, atrocious and appalling what has happened to such a beautiful little boy.' Detective Inspector John Smith, from the Wolverhampton Public Protection Unit, said today: 'This is a tragic case where a young life has so needlessly been lost because of the carelessness of those who should have been there to ensure his safety. Officers who initially visited the scene reported finding a clean and well maintained house that looked like any 'normal' family home - but then upstairs we found a very different story. 'Away from the areas where people may visit, the main bedroom was untidy and strewn with drug paraphernalia and this is the room in which the family slept. 'It seems that during his short life, Daniel became accustomed to living amongst these items and, tragically, consumed a quantity of heroin that ultimately led to his death. 'We don't know exactly how the youngster came to ingest the illegal drug - but we do know that he should never have been exposed to them in any case. 'Those who should have been caring him for him ultimately caused his untimely and tragic death.' A spokeswoman for Wolverhampton City .

The couple will be sentenced next month.","Daniel Jones died last May after swallowing whole wrap of Class A drug .

A jealous boyfriend today admitted stabbing a mother-of-three to death on Christmas Eve before going out for a pint and a pizza. Charmaine Macmuiris, 37, had been with David O’Sullivan, 28, for just three weeks before he attacked her in a jealous rage and stabbed her 10 times with a kitchen knife. Ms Macmuiris was found dead at O’Sullivan’s flat in Carmarthen, west Wales, on Christmas Day. David O'Sullivan was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing Charmaine Macmuiris to death in a jealous rage. He then went and bought a pizza and beer while the mother-of-three lay bleeding to death . He was today jailed for life at Swansea Crown Court and sentenced to a minimum term of 14 years after changing his plea to guilty moments before he was due to stand trial. Ms Macmuiris's mother Christine said her daughter had been taken in 'the most cruellest of ways on the most cruellest of days'. She had been due to wrap presents with her family but was persuaded to meet bricklayer O'Sullivan. The pair fought at the pub and O'Sullivan threw a pint of lager over Ms Macmuiris. Ms Macmuiris's family said she was looking forward to celebrating Christmas with her three children Hannah, 20, Ruby, 15, and Keilan, 12, and toddler granddaughter Pixie. Her mother said in a victim impact statement: 'Charmaine has been robbed of her life. 'She was a much loved mother, daughter, sister and auntie and we have been devastated by her loss and the shocking manner of her death.' Patrick Harrington QC said after the brutal attack, O'Sullivan went to buy some alcohol and food. He said: 'After, he left the home and went to two pubs and . drank larger and bought a pizza - he returned to the address of the . murder and ate his pizza. Ms Macmuiris was discovered at O'Sullivan's home in Maes yr Ysgol, Carmarthen, on Christmas Day . 'It is only when his parents arrived on Christmas day that police were called.' The court heard O'Sullivan mistakenly believed his girlfriend was seeing another man. He sent threatening text messages to the man and his family on the night of the murder. He persuaded the mother-of-three to come back to his flat before murdering her. Police officers came to house after hearing reports of a disturbance but O’Sullivan told them 'everything was OK'. O’Sullivan was confronted by police officers as Charmaine lay bleeding to death in his house. Mr . Harrington QC told the court: 'When police officers asked him . about cuts to his arm he said he had punched a hole in the wall. 'A . little later he was seen standing outside his home by neighbours, he . said he and his girlfriend had argued and he had hit her and she was . lying on the bed. 'But he had not merely hit her, he had stabbed her to death.' Prosecutors said he punched Ms Macmuiris in the face in the lounge before stabbing her to death in the bedroom. Charmaine Macmuiris's family said she was taken 'in the cruellest of ways on the cruellest of days' Mr Harrington QC said: 'Even before that time he showed himself to be possessive and jealous towards her.' Ms MacMuiris' family said his 14 year sentence was not long enough. They said in a statement: 'As a family we would like to thank friends, neighbours, and Dyfed Powys Police for all their help and support that has been provided throughout this difficult time. 'We are glad that O’Sullivan has been sentenced and we were spared a trial. However we do not feel that a minimum term of 14 years reflects the severity of what he has done. We are all still devastated at losing Charmaine.' Judge Eleri Rees told Harrington while sentencing him: 'This was a vicious and brutal killing. 'There may have been more than one assault - there is physical evidence of a struggle with blood stains in a variety of locations. 'You used a kitchen knife to attack Charmaine and death would not have been instantaneous or the result of any one wound or blow. 'At some point her daughter tried to text her mother and you tried to respond but in a clumsy mistake you sent a text to another person. 'This was the most callous behaviour to show to someone who you purported to love.' Speaking after the case Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, Wales, said: 'David O’Sullivan finally admitted his responsibility for a senseless and brutal assault that led to the tragic death of Charmaine Macmuiris. 'Only O’Sullivan himself can truly know what caused him to carry out such a vicious attack on an entirely innocent victim. 'What is certain is that those close to Charmaine continue to deal with the truly awful consequences of what he did.'","Charmaine Macmuiris, 37, was stabbed 10 times by David O'Sullivan .

Financial advisor Ian Wild, 54, was removed as a trustee of his father's estate after a family inheritance row left him facing his mother and sister across London's High Court . A bid by a multi-millionaire businessman to avoid his family having to pay inheritance tax ended in court after his widow and children became involved in a bitter dispute over the legacy. When manufacturing tycoon John Barry Wild died aged 78, he left personal assets including his £2.3m business empire in the West Midlands and a country home in Warwickshire worth more than £1m. Mr Wild had set up a family trust in a bid to pass on his fortune to wife Susan, 79, son Ian, 54, daughter Julia, 47, and his six grandchildren in the most tax-efficient way. He hoped to avoid both disagreements and large tax bills with the scheme which he arranged in 2003, six years before his death in 2009. But Mr Wild's death sparked a bitter family row that ended up in London's High Court after his son became convinced his own mother was planning to cut him out of her will. Mr Justice Arnold heard that after Mr Wild's death the family home, Holywell House, near Shrewley, Warwickshire, went to his widow. The £2.3m fruits of his business empire, WJ Wild Group Ltd, went into the family trust to be split four ways between his widow, his two children, and his grandchildren by his eldest child Tim, who had predeceased him. Mrs Wild and her two children were all appointed trustees of the fund from which they were to benefit, along with the family accountant. The younger Mr Wild, a financial advisor from Worcestershire, and his sister Julia Wild, who runs a London-based marketing agency, were both paid out their quarter shares of the fund shortly after their father died. However, the court heard that a 'long-standing animosity' between the mother and her middle child exploded into a series of disagreements at trustee meetings, as Mr Wild’s suspicions grew that his mother was planning to cut him out of her will. He demanded sight of the will, . despite her denials, and his suspicions grew after she refused to let . him see it. The court heard that the younger Mr . Wild, acting 'out of 'spite and resentment' in his role as one of his . father's trustees, refused to agree to his mother being paid her . £500,000 cut of her late husband's money, and blocked attempts by the . other trustees to hand her the cash. The tycoon's widow Susan Wild, 79, left, and their daughter Julia Wild, 47, right, outside London's High Court . Oliver Hilton, for Mrs Wild and Miss Wild, asked the court to remove Mr Wild as a trustee, opening the path for his mother’s share to be released. He denied Mr Wild’s claims that he was refusing to release the money to his mother to protect the fund, saying: 'The real reason why Ian didn’t want his mother to receive any money was because he thinks she has rewritten her will and cut him out. 'He therefore wants to maximise his own inheritance by getting as much out of the trust himself. 'He is motivated out of spite and [is] not acting in his capacity as a trustee and depriving his mother of her beneficiary right. 'Ian has acted in an improper, capricious and non-genuine manner out of spite and in consideration of his own interests. 'He is acting in a perverse fashion. This is spite and resentment for his perception that he has been cut out of his mother’s will. John Wild's £1m family home in Shrewley, Warwickshire, was left to his widow, 79-year-old Susan Wild . 'It seems that there has been a falling out between mother and son which has clouded Ian’s judgment. How Susan might bequeath her estate has no bearing on how it should be distributed to her,' the barrister added. Anna Clarke, for Mr Wild, denied there were any improper motives behind his actions, saying he was acting merely to preserve the funds in the trust. 'Mrs Wild’s personal circumstances do not warrant the payment out to her,' she added. Mr Justice Arnold, whilst making no findings of bad faith against Mr Wild, handed victory to his mother and sister last Friday, ordering that he be removed as a trustee. The judge said: 'I consider that Ian has allowed himself to become unduly influenced by his concern over Susan’s will. 'Ian has allowed his judgment as a trustee to become clouded by matters which are not relevant to the exercise of his duties as a trustee. The proper course for this court is to remove him.' The ruling means the mother’s money will be immediately released to her, and the judge ordered Mr Wild to pay a £40,000 legal costs bill. Speaking outside court about the row between her brother and mother, Miss Wild said: 'There wasn’t one particular thing they fell out about, it’s just a general animosity. 'She and Ian have not been getting on for years.' She added: 'The relationship between he and I has irreparably broken down too as far as I am concerned. I haven’t seen his children either for at least two years.' On the subject of her mother’s will, Miss Wild said: 'I hadn’t heard anything about mother leaving everything to me and I don’t know for sure if it’s true - her will is confidential. My mother is quite capable of leaving everything to charity, but I would support her in that if she did.' Miss Wild added: 'My father would have turned in his grave if he knew [what would happen]. It has all backfired.'","The family of tycoon John Barry Wild fell out over his legacy after he died .

"By . Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 06:56 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:25 EST, 10 June 2013 . A couple forced to wait 26 hours for a delayed flight home from Majorca have won a payout in a case that could open the floodgates to thousands more like it. Kim Brittain, 61, and his wife Sue, 55, sued charter airline Monarch after they were among 200 tourists stranded at Palma de Mallorca Airport. Their case is one of the first of its kind in the British courts. It comes after the European Court of Justice declared last October that airlines must pay compensation for delays caused by their own failures, such as technical faults and staff problems. Victory! Kim Brittain, 61, and wife Sue, 55, took on Monarch Airlines when it refused to pay out compensation for a day-long delay, and have now won £430 using new legislation from Brussels . Mr Brittain, an architect, said Monarch had tried to ‘bully’ him and his wife, refusing to pay them for the delay and dragging them through the courts. They said they fought the claim because 180,000 people are faced with similar holiday problems every year and they should ‘know their rights’. On July 3 last year they were due to fly back to Birmingham Airport at 10.45am but their flight did not take off until 12.42pm the next day – 25 hours and 57 minutes later. Passengers were left to wander around the airport terminal in  sweltering heat and were handed food stamps for meals, which  they had to supplement with their own cash. Big guns: Monarch Airlines were branded 'bullies' by the couple because they sent in two barristers to contest the £430 compensation claim . They said staff were unhelpful and . police officers threatened some tourists with arrest when they became . frustrated and filmed what was happening on their mobile phones. Monarch eventually sent a bus and took . the passengers to a hotel but they arrived there just 20 minutes before . the restaurant closed, giving them little time to have a meal. Under new EU rules, airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights, unless there are 'extraordinary circumstances'. This can include sudden severe weather events, such as a hurricane orsomething like the volcanic ash cloud episode of three years ago. The ruling that outlines these rights is Regulation (EC) 261/2004, and this became law earlier this year. Compensation is around €250 (£210) for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, €400 (£330) for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and €600 (£500) for other journeys. It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline. This means any direct flight from the UK should be covered, along with any flight to it run by a European airline. Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, they can take their case to court. Airlines will often try and claim extraordinary circumstances to avoid paying, such as by citing technical faults as being covered by this. However, extraordinary circumstances are judged to be something unexpected and out of an airline's control, and it can be argued that an airline should be prepared for mechanical problems as a matter of course and these are not extraordinary. The nub of the matter is that if your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim. Upset by their experience, Mr and Mrs . Brittain, from Wythall in Worcestershire, applied to Monarch for . compensation. But the airline refused to pay, saying the delay was . caused by ‘exceptional circumstances’. Refusing to back down, the  Brittains . took the case to court and a judge at Worcester County Court awarded . them their full compensation claim of £430, plus legal costs. The ruling follows a judgment last . October in which the European courts found passengers should be entitled . to compensation of up to £480, plus expenses, for hold-ups longer than . three hours. At the time airlines were warned the . ruling could cost them millions by opening the floodgates for hundreds . of thousands of claims. In January Jeff and Joyce Halsall, . from Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, became the first people in the UK to . benefit from the ruling, winning a case against Thomas Cook after . waiting 22 hours for a return flight from Tenerife to East Midlands . Airport. Yesterday, Mr Brittain spoke of his delight at winning his case. ‘They treated us like cattle,’ he . said. ‘I’d had enough. I was faced with two barristers and their . solicitors but I thought: “I’m semi-retired, I have the time to do it, . let’s have a go.” ‘The airlines try to scare people off . with the prospect of court proceedings but I knew we were in the right . and decided to fight it. ‘Monarch sought to defend a case they . had no chance of winning  and spent thousands of pounds instead of . settling on day one. The fact they chose to do so I saw as a bully boy . tactic and I’m glad the judge agreed.’ The couple will now donate the compensation to sight charity Focus, where Mrs Brittain works. Monarch said it was considering an appeal against the ruling and could not comment further.","Kim and Sue Brittain took the airline to court after long delay last July .

Three men who raided 45 homes across the South East of England and stole £25,000 from elderly people in just six months have been jailed. Patrick Cawley, his brother John Cawley and James Boyle pretended to be police officers to trick their way into the pensioners' homes. In all cases they would flash a fake police warrant card before telling their victims they had arrested someone for a burglary in the area and that they needed to check if anything had been stolen from their homes. Patrick Cawley and his brother John Cawley have both been jailed after carrying out a string of burglaries . While the elderly person was distracted, one of the men would rifle through their belongings and steal cash and valuables. The con artists targeted vulnerable people in their 80s and 90s who lived alone and often suffered from health issues. Their oldest victims were two men aged 99. Hertfordshire Police were forced to launch Operation Manhunt which was led by a specialist unit set up to investigate distraction burglary and crimes against the elderly. Between January 2012 and July 2012, more than £25,000 was stolen from victims in Hertfordshire, Essex, Warwickshire, London, Surrey, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire. James Boyle was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary . The men were finally caught in July 2012 trying to escape from a home in Waltham Cross after a neighbour called police when she saw the burglars acting suspiciously. They were jailed at St Albans Crown Court. Patrick Cawley, 54, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary and was sentenced to six years eight months imprisonment. He was also issued with an Asbo which stops him from being in the same company as James Boyle or John Cawley. John Cawley, 51, of Kings Cross Road, in London, was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment after pleading guilty to commit distraction burglary and was handed an Asbo. James Boyle, 39, of Tookey Close, Harrow, north-west London, was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary and was given an Asbo. Speaking after the case one of his victims, who wished not to be named, said: 'The burglary destroyed my confidence. 'I thought they had come to my door to tell me bad news about my son and of course once they’d got in that was it. 'It destroys your confidence and it makes you nervous, I don’t know who to trust. I keep the chain on the door now. I do appreciate the support I have had from the police.' The three men were sentenced at St Albans Crown Court after raiding 45 homes in the South East of England stealing £25,000 from elderly people . Detective Sergeant Mark Clawson, from Operation Manhunt, said: 'These men thought they were untouchable and thought that by travelling the country they would evade police, but they were wrong. 'By the time of their arrest we had already linked the majority of their crimes and were close to identifying them. 'These ruthless criminals left a trail of destruction behind them, often leaving their victims feeling extremely vulnerable and unable to continue living independently at home. 'In some cases the victims’ health has severely deteriorated as a direct result of the incident.'","Patrick Cawley, John Cawley and James Boyle pretended to be police officers to trick their way into the homes .

The grandmother had been on the run for more than 12 years having been convicted in 2000 at Bristol Crown Court of possessing cocaine with intent to supply. Gibson had been originally arrested by police in 1998 at a motorway services with 2.9kg of cocaine - with a street value of £240,000 - in the boot of her car. She had been bailed to return to court for sentence but failed to appear and remained at large, living in the north of England away from her family. Police arrested the pensioner in April this year at her daughter's home in Yate, South Gloucestershire, and today she returned to court to be sentenced. Jailing the great-grandmother, Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC said: 'I sentence you on the basis you were a courier of this amount of cocaine. 'I take into account your age and I treat you as a person of good character and I take into account what I have read about your health. 'This is not the easiest of sentencing exercises but in my judgement the very least sentence which is appropriate for an offence of possession of cocaine with intent to supply is one of four years’ imprisonment.'

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was attacked after admitting discussing the 'Plebgate' case with journalists . Senior Tory and Labour MPs  yesterday lined up in the Commons to attack Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe over the ‘fabricated’ Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair. In a deliberate show of strength, Conservative allies  of the ex-chief whip said Sir Bernard, Britain’s most senior police officer, ‘has a lot of questions to answer’ after he admitted discussing the case with journalists and breaking his own rules by not keeping a note of what was said. Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘What now seems apparent is he [Mr Mitchell] was the victim of media spin at the highest level of the Metropolitan Police.’ Mr Mitchell was forced to resign in October after officers claimed he repeatedly swore and called them ‘plebs’ when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate. However, a Channel 4 News investigation cast doubt on that account when it revealed CCTV footage showed there was not a large group of tourists at the gates at the time, as had been claimed. An email from a civilian witness backing up the officers’ version of events has also been called into question. Mr Mitchell strenuously denies the allegation and was stunned when official Met reports were leaked earlier this year stating there was no evidence that police officers had lied about  the encounter. He blamed the Met for the leak and described it as ‘a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career’. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was forced to resign after officers claimed he repeatedly swore and called them 'plebs' when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate . Last weekend, friends of Mr Mitchell used Freedom of Information laws to reveal that Sir Bernard had a meeting with journalists where the case was discussed but that no records were kept about exactly what was said – a breach of guidelines. At Home Office Questions in the Commons yesterday, eight MPs asked about different aspects of the case. Conservative MP Richard  Ottaway said there was now a ‘situation where the police and the Met appear to have  fabricated evidence against a Cabinet minister’. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said: ‘The Commissioner promised a ruthless search for the truth... but this has now taken eight months, involved 30 investigating police officers, and cost the taxpayer £144,000 for an incident in Downing Street that lasted 45 seconds.’ Labour MP Tom Watson, left, said Mr Mitchell was the 'victim of media spin' and Police Minister Damian Green, right, refused to be drawn on Met Police conclusions . Damningly, Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the Channel 4 team might carry out the investigation more effectively and more independently than the police. In response to the questioning, Police Minister Damian Green said: ‘The Metropolitan Police are conducting an investigation under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. ‘I absolutely understand the importance and the very many lessons that may well be drawn from this case. What I should not do and will not do is draw any conclusions in the middle of the investigation.’","Britain's most senior police officer discussed case with journalists .

Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court . Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court - by giving their evidence before the trial. They will be allowed to record their testimony on video in advance of the case going to court, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will say today. The move follows a series of cases in which sex abuse victims have been put through hostile questioning by defence barristers. In one case a rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 endured 12 days of questioning in a ‘forensic examination’. Another vulnerable victim in the same case had to read out line by line from a police statement she gave detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather. A series of pilots will see vulnerable victims given the chance to give evidence out of court with the footage played to the jury. The announcement will please victims’ groups who have warned that children have been ‘thrown to the wolves’ in court. But the move could raise concerns among lawyers over whether defendants are getting a fair trial - and whether the evidence used against them is properly scrutinised. Mr Grayling said it was wrong for young and vulnerable victims to have to relive their experiences for days on end in an ‘aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere’. ‘The particularly hostile treatment of victims and witnesses in court has nothing to do with fairness or justice,’ he said. ‘It is simply not right that young and vulnerable victims are forced to relive the most traumatic experience they have ever had, often for days on end, when cross-examined in court. ‘I am adamant we must put a stop to this, but without compromising everyone’s right to a fair trial. ‘So for the first time we are going to spare these victims from the aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere by making sure they can give evidence and be cross-examined before the trial starts.’ Details of the treatment in court of several victims of a sex grooming gang sparked fury earlier this year. The pilots will take place at three Crown Courts in Leeds (pictured), Kingston-upon-Thames and Liverpool from later this year . The 18-year-old, who had been attacked from the age of 13, was quizzed aggressively about her sex life during the harrowing trial over 12 days in the witness box. She broke down after being repeatedly accused of lying by lawyers acting for seven men on trial and at one point was accused of being ‘naughty’. One barrister reportedly walked out of the trial in disgust over the treatment of another witness at the Stafford Crown Court trial in 2011. The seven men were convicted of child sex offences against four girls in later retrials after the case collapsed. The pilots will take place at three Crown Courts in Leeds, Kingston-upon-Thames and Liverpool from later this year. If successful, it will be extended to courts across England and Wales. Victims will still be cross examined, but via videolink and away from the drama and audience of a court trial, officials said. By separating testimony from the main court case, the move could give judges greater control over methods of cross-examination. However, there will still be no limit on the number of lawyers who can cross examine a victim or witness, how long they can be in the witness box or the material on which they can be questioned. Officials suggested it would also ensure victims could be given counselling earlier, without the long delays often found in the courts. The change in the law will affect all child victims and witnesses and adult victims seen as the ‘most vulnerable’, and allow them to escape a courtroom grilling in front of an audience. Questions were raised about cross-examination when a violinist killed herself after she was branded a liar and fantasist by her attacker’s lawyer. Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose half-way through the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer , music director at Chetham’s School of Music in the mid-1990s, and his ex-wife Kay, both 68. Kate Blackwell, who represented Mr Brewer, told Mrs Andrade ‘you have told this jury a complete pack of lies about the visit to this house’. During one exchange, the victim said ‘this feels like rape all over again’. A week later she was found dead at home. Her family said they were convinced the court ordeal lead to her death. But the judge in the case said the barrister’s conduct had been exemplary and her questions ‘perfectly proper and completely professional’. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC said: ‘This pilot is one step towards making courts child friendly and starting to remove the gladiatorial element of cross examination. It could also mean young people won’t have to testify years after they come forward allowing victims to start to rebuild their lives earlier. “Many young victims of abuse tell us how the current process can be almost as horrific as the abuse itself. ‘Cases have been dropped because the witnesses were too vulnerable to cope with the aggressive cross exanimation in court by several different barristers.’","They will be allowed to record their testimony on video in advance of the case going to court .

New link: Murder detectives have asked Romanian authorities for help in trying to establish who Zaad Al-Hilli, pictured left, who is the brother of Saad Al-Hilli, right, repeatedly called . Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor leading the inquiry, said: 'There were calls made from the phone of Saad al-Hilli's brother to Romania. 'We know calls were made to Romania but we do not know who was at the other end of the line or why the calls were made. 'A formal request for assistance was made to Romania several months ago but so far it has not produced anything.' 'It is simply that we can leave no stone unturned. 'This is part of the masses of data we are gathering month after month.' Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy . Clues: Prosecutor Eric Maillaud, pictured, has revealed murder detectives are investigating a new link to Romania . The men's father, Kadhim Al-Hilli, . died in Spain two years ago, leaving a number of properties and cash . including the equivalent of some £800,000 in a bank account in Geneva, . which is less than an hour's drive from the murder scene.

The attack began with an loud blast just as Kabul's residents had finished morning prayers at around 4:30 a.m. Police said that attackers wearing suicide vests occupied one or two buildings under construction on the west side of the airport and were firing at the military facility, which was quite a distance away. It was unclear whether they hit anything inside the NATO facility. 'It first started with a big explosion which we think was a suicide attack.

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 19:46 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 11 June 2013 . Science minister David Willetts has called for EU controls on GM crops and food to be relaxed . Controls on ‘Frankenstein Food’ crops should be slimmed down to clear the way for commercial cultivation, according to Britain’s science minister. David Willetts, who has been heavily lobbied by GM campaigners and scientists funded by the GM industry, insists biotech crops could feed the world. Mr Willetts in the science department and the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, are pushing for EU controls on new GM crops and food to be relaxed. The move is at odds with the views of most British consumers, who are suspicious of the impact of GM crops on human health and the environment. Official research by the Government’s Food Standards Agency(FSA) suggests shoppers actually want more information about GM and how it is getting on to dinner tables by stealth. Currently, a large part of the meat, milk and eggs in stores comes from farm animals fed a GM diet, such as genetically modified soya and maize, however consumers are kept in the dark. Ministers have ignored a recent FSA study which found that two in three people want any food derived from a animals fed on GM to declare the fact on the label. Mr Willetts insisted that EU controls on various new types of technology ranging from GM crops and food to stem cell research and nanotechnology are far too restrictive. ‘We believe that GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient, and also just as importantly more sustainable by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,’ he said. ‘There are just too many 21st-century technologies that Europe is just being very slow to adopt ... one productive way forward is to have this discussion as part of a wider need for Europe to remain innovative rather than a museum of 20th century technology.’ Uncertainties: But the majority of British consumers are suspicious about the impact of GM crops on human health and want any food derived from animals fed a GM diet to declare it on the label . He added: ‘By the time you’ve added up . the French overregulation of nanotechnology, the Brüstle judgment on . stem cells (where the European Court of Justice blocked a scientist from . protecting his research with a patent), the fact that there isn’t a . regime that would permit the use of innovative space vehicles, you’re . left with a great weight of regulation.’ James Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize for his co-discovery of the structure of DNA, also defended GM. ‘The educated middle classes just don’t like genetics, and now they don’t want GM food either because they’re worried about safety, but the truth is it’s probably safer,’ he said. In 2011, a team of doctors in Canada found that toxins implanted into GM food crops to kill pests were reaching the bloodstreams of women and unborn babies. Some 93 per cent of blood samples taken from pregnant women and 80 per cent of umbilical cords were positive for traces of the chemicals. It is not known what, if any, harm could be caused. Eight governments have banned cultivation of a Monsanto GM maize called MON 810, which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it, on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects. The ban on the maize and other forms of GM has been made under an EU environmental protection provision known as the ‘Safeguard Clause’. The eight are Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and most recently Poland, while Italy said it plans to follow suit. As a result, the US GM giant Monsanto has effectively given up on lobbying to get approval for new GM crops to be grown in Europe. Spokesman, Brandon Mitchner, said: ‘We are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in Europe. ‘Currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops. The reason is, among other things, low demand of the farmers.’ This was confirmed by a spokesman for Monsanto Germany, Ursula Luttmer-Ouazane, who said: ‘We’ve understood that such plants don’t have any broad acceptance in European societies. It is counterproductive to fight against windmills.’ Other GM companies, such as Bayer CropScience, BASF and Syngenta, have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in Europe.","David Willetts is calling for EU controls on new GM crops to be relaxed .

A Japanese prosthetics maker has found himself on an unexpected mission – making fake fingers for the mafia. In the East Asian nation a chopped off pinkie signifies a membership of the Yakuza, the feared Japanese mafia, who are required to sever their own fingers to pay for offenses to the organisation. For the past ten years, Shintaro Hayashi has been making prosthetic pinkies for members of the Yakuza who want to disguise their background in the underworld. Fresh fingers: A technician sculpts prosthetic fingers made from silicon in a workshop in Tokyo, Japan, to fit onto past and present members of the yakuza . After building his career making silicone prosthetics for breast cancer patients and amputees he found himself with a new clientele. ‘I started to see a gradual increase in people who were asking for prosthetic pinkies,’ Hayashi, 39, told ABC News. ‘They weren't the standard small, medium or large, but custom-made pinkies.’ A missing pinkie is a telltale sign that someone is a past or present member of the Yakuza. The ritual, known as ‘yubitsume’ is a way for members to ‘pay’ for committing offenses to the Yakuza, such as taking drugs, getting in fights or stealing. Gruesome business: The Yakuza tradition of forcing members to cut their . fingers off as punishment has seen a surge in clients for pinkie . prosthetics . Replacement: A former yakuza member who has had to cut off his little and ring finger as punishment for breaking the 'code of conduct' shows off his prosthetics . Examples: Plastic surgeon Maria Niino, holds prosthetic fingers that she makes for Yakuza members . The little finger on the left hand is the first to go – often one joint at a time – but many Yakuza members are missing several digits. Shintaro Hayashi helps ex-Yakuza disguise their past to help them find a job, or current members to hide their allegiance at family occasions or official outings. One single finger prosthetic costs £1,925 and is custom made to fit the ‘yubitsume’ victim’s hand. Most Yakuza customers visit Shintaro Hayashi’s workshop several times a year as the silicone is worn out or needs repainting. Shintaro Hayashi estimates that around five per cent of his clients are former Yakuza members and has produced more than 300 prosthetic fingers. Drawing board: A custom made little finger costs on average over £1,900 to make . Helping hand: Fingers are lined up to be fitted and re-touched at Shintaro Hayashi's clinic . New beginning: One of Shintaro Hayashi's ex-Yakuza clients shows off his . prosthetic little finger, which he got when he left the organisation . and needed to disguise his past to get a job . He says his Yakuza clients come in three categories: former members who are looking for a career outside the mafia, members who need to cover up for a child’s wedding or a family event or men pushed by their partners who are worried about their reputation. ‘Many people keep a fist, to prevent detection,' he told ABC News. 'But there comes a point where you can't hide your fingers any longer. Some people have one joint severed, others have worse.’ The Yakuza is a collective term given to Japan's organised crime syndicates. It is estimated that the Yakuza has over 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs, but together they make the largest organised crime group in the world. Victim: Some Yakuza members who have been part of the mafia for a long . time has had several fingers fall to the gruesome 'yubitsume' tradition . Old practice: The 'yubitsume' always starts on with the first joints on the left hand little finger as this would weaken the way a traditional Japanese sword is held . They are known for their controlled organisation and strict codes of conduct, which involves punishments such as 'yubitsume' for members who break the rules. The tradition of 'yubitsume', beginning with the first joints of the left hand little finger comes from the Japanese way of holding a sword with 'yubitsume' intended to weaken the Yakuza member’s sword grip. A recent crackdown on the Yakuza has seen an increasing demand for prosthetic pinkies. The number of members has been on the decline since the Japanese Government introduced the Anti-Organized Crime Law in 1992 and as recent as last year, the US Treasury Department froze assets for the largest Yakuza ‘family’, the Yamaguchi-gumi, . Shintaro Hayashi can only see his client base expand, and adds: ‘If you put on the finger, you can turn your life around.’","Japanese mafia punishment sees members cut off their own fingers .

On high streets where many shops still lie empty as they recover from the worst recession in Britain since the 1930s, one type of business has continued to thrive in the economic gloom. Bookmakers have swamped the UK's shopping parades – with numbers up 25 per cent since 2008 - and in one London borough, Newham, there are currently 82 - six per square mile. Around almost every corner in this generally deprived part of East London are shops where people can stake £100 a spin on casino-style gambling machines, which are as addictive as crack cocaine. Yesterday Newham Council was in court to defend its decision to block plans for a new Paddy Power shop, and if they win it could lead to hundreds of betting shop licences nationwide being turned down or revoked. Concentrated: This graphic shows the main areas which have been saturated by betting shops in Newham, East London, which has 82 bookmakers . The local council say these bookmakers, often open for 14 hours a day, fuel violent crime, street drinking and underage gambling. A source from within the council said: ‘We mapped out where crimes and disorder take place and compared that with where the betting shops are – and it lit up like a Christmas tree'. Earlier this year they rejected an application for the new betting shop on the grounds that it would make more money from gaming machines than from traditional betting on horses and sports results, saying this meant it fell foul of the 2005 Gambling Act. Councillor Ian Corbett, chairman . of the licensing sub-committee, said: ‘We are the first council to . invoke the primacy clause to reject a licence application, as we are . unconvinced that at least half of the gambling on premises would have . been traditional betting. ‘We are increasingly concerned about the number of gaming machines in Newham and their impact on our high streets. ‘Not . only that, we are concerned at the high proportion of incidents of . crime and disorder and that betting shops are part of the problem.’ Battle: Critics say that betting shops are filled with fixed odds betting terminals, which are as addictive as crack cocaine .

Newham frequently appears high up . lists of the most deprived areas of Britain, along with nearby London . boroughs such as Hackney and Tower Hamlets. It is an area of high immigration, and has been thought to be in serious economic decline since the fall of manufacturing and the closure of the nearby London Docks. The Olympic Park at Stratford is located within Newham, but it has yet to be seen whether the complex will have its desired effect of revitalising the borough and bringing employment back to the area. Ali Mil, 32, who runs a phone card stall on Green Street, where the Paddy Power could still appear if they win the legal battle, says that these shops are damaging lives. 'They have a bad effect on young people, it's too easy to lose money. It brings problems to the area. The gambling creates problems: fighting in the streets, drinking. There is a bigger problem coming in the future,' he told the Independent. Until now, town halls have complained that they can block betting shop applications only if there is evidence that there will be an increase in crime, a threat to the vulnerable, or there is proof of unfair gambling, which is difficult to establish before a shop has opened. Legal fight: Newham is locked in the courts with Paddy Power as the . council tries to stop the opening of another betting shop in their area, as they say there are too many (examples in East Ham, above left to bottom right) Previous decisions to reject applications have often been overturned on appeal. In many cases, councils withdraw their objections as they are liable for costs if they lose. This has led to accusations that councils are being ‘bullied’ by expensive legal teams brought in by the bookies. The Association of British Bookmakers said previously that Newham’s decision to throw out the application was ‘at odds with the Gambling Commission’s advice and guidance on this issue. ‘There is a misconception that there must be more profit or turnover from betting than machines to satisfy primary gambling activity. That is simply not the case.'","Newham Council is in court because they say bookies fuel street crime .

A 'vice queen' and her two male accomplices are facing jail after being convicted of operating a lucrative prostitution racket that ran for nine years. Margaret Paterson, 61, Robert Munro, 61, and Ian Goalen, 59, operated a brothel and escort business from Edinburgh, but were today found guilty of proceeds of crime and immoral earnings. Paterson and Munro provided prostitutes and former bank manager Goalen was a driver for the women, who worked in Edinburgh, West Lothian, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Facing jail: Margaret Paterson (left), 61, Robert Munro (centre), 61, and Ian Goalen (right), 59, operated a brothel and escort business from Edinburgh, but were today found guilty of proceeds of crime and immoral earnings . Their lucrative scam came to an end when police raided their premises in September 2011, finding sex toys, designer shoes and evidence showing Paterson had gone on a £462,000 shopping spree. Credit card records detailed how she bought luxury items from Harvey Nichols, Louis Vuitton and Mulberry - and police officers who searched her home also found £205,000 in cash. They also discovered mobile phones which people rang in order to book sessions with the women, and that Paterson and Munro kept records of those who were using their business. Prosecutors told the trio that they will be subject to proceeds of crime proceedings. Sentencing of the three has been deferred in order for the court to obtain reports about their characters. After conviction today, temporary judge Michael O’Grady QC said: ‘These are serious offences.’ Edinburgh’s High Court also heard how police discovered that the ex-night manager of the George Hotel in Edinburgh, Roderick MacLeod used to phone the agency for guests who wanted sex. Money: Credit card records detailed how Paterson bought luxury items from Harvey Nichols, Louis Vuitton and Mulberry - and police officers who searched her home also found £205,000 in cash (pictured) Paterson set up AaBella Escorts in October 2002 and it quickly became a lucrative money-spinning venture for her and business partner Munro. The firm advertised in a number of newspapers. The trial heard from Kellie Ann Bolton, 31, who said she worked for Paterson and Munro as a prostitute just before the business was closed down in September 2011. She said that she would charge punters £150 for an hour long session. When prosecution lawyer Paul Kearney asked Bolton - who worked under the name of Colette - if women who worked for the business needed to have sex with customers, she said yes. The court also heard from Mr MacLeod, 45. He told Mr Kearney that ‘somebody’ provided him with a telephone number for the escort agency when he started working for the hotel. Mr MacLeod said that whenever a guest wanted an escort, he would telephone AaBella and that they would send girls to the hotel. Wealthy lifestyle: High-value goods were found at Paterson's home following the police raid in September 2011 . He told the court: ‘I telephoned the agency infrequently. A guest would come to me and ask for an escort. I would phone the agency, speak to Trish (Paterson) and I would put the call through to the guest’s room.' Mr MacLeod said that he used the agency once during his time working at the hotel. He added: ‘It was because I was very, very drunk.’ Kitchen manager Martin Cumberbatch, 44, of Bathgate, West Lothian, said he used the agency in 2010 after splitting up with his wife. He told the court that he paid £140 for a young Polish woman to visit him at his home.  Mr Cumberbatch told the court: ‘It was just a bit of companionship.’ The court heard that in September 2011, police received a tip off that Paterson was running a brothel. Officers raided the premises and Paterson’s home address just a few weeks later. Detectives found sex toys and condoms. They also discovered two whips and a red riding crop. Stunned policemen also found handcuffs and leaflets for a sexual health clinic for prostitutes. The trio will be sentenced on July 8 at Edinburgh’s High Court.","Margaret Paterson, 61, Robert Munro and Ian Goalen operated brothel .

Spy chiefs may have been operating a secret ‘snoopers’ charter’ to track people’s internet use in the UK, a senior Government minister has admitted. Business Secretary Vince Cable made the claim after it emerged GCHQ trawled through private information, including emails, photographs and social networking pages, harvested by a secret U.S. surveillance programme. Critics accused agents at the listening post of attempting to bypass British law by sending requests for intercepts to American authorities – a claim denounced as ‘fanciful nonsense’ by Foreign Secretary William Hague. 'Snoopers' charter': Vince Cable admitted the Government had used a U.S. spy programme to monitor people's internet use . Investigators usually need a court order or warrant to access personal communications. But they have been able to sidestep this crucial safeguard by asking for details of individuals’ web activity hoovered up by Prism, a system run by the US  National Security Agency (NSA). GCHQ compiled 197 intelligence dossiers from Prism in a single year. It has had access to the programme since at least 2010. Mr Hague faces a ferocious Commons grilling today when he is sure to be asked exactly when ministers knew about the intelligence trade-off. British agency: GCHQ, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was said to have generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the 12 months to May 2012 - a 137 per cent increase on the previous year . Asked yesterday if the system had . allowed the Government to operate a covert ‘snoopers’ charter’, Liberal . Democrat Mr Cable said: ‘It may well have been.’ The Lib Dems oppose controversial . £400million plans to give intelligence agencies powers to monitor the . public’s every phone call, email and internet click. 'Secret work': Mr Hague (pictured today) refused to confirm or deny details of the eavesdropping agency's links to the Prism spy scheme . But supporters claim that, without the new laws, paedophiles, organised criminals and terrorists will escape detection. Mr Hague repeatedly declined to say whether or not he had personally authorised GCHQ to engage with Prism. But he insisted the eavesdropping centre operated within a ‘strong’ legal framework, with reviews of decisions by the Interception Commissioner. Mr Hague said: ‘I can't ever confirm . or deny in public what Britain knows or doesn't know about. 'We can talk . about the framework that we do things. We can't possible go into “we . exactly do this”. ‘Ministers . give authority to the actions of GCHQ and what it does has to be in . line with those authorities. Intelligence gathering operations come to . me or the Home Secretary personally. ‘We . take our duties on that very seriously. We spend hours on these things . every week. Our decisions are then subject to continual review by an . Interception Commissioner.' Tory MP David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said: ‘Nobody will argue against target surveillance of individuals but there are problems with mass sweeps of information. It invades people’s privacy and you lose support.’ Mr Cable said . it was a possibility that the Prism system may have allowed the . Government to operate a covert sort of snoopers' charter. He added: ‘One . is that the Americans have developed this very sophisticated Prism . system, which enables them to get access to data in other countries, . with or without our knowledge. 'And there is a separate issue about . whether GCHQ were involved in some collaborative exercise,’ Mr Cable . told Sky News. ‘I think a lot of people will be . reassured that we do work well with the Americans, but the whole point . about surveillance is you have got to have it when you're dealing with . terrorism or other crimes.’ But he added that all surveillance had to be ‘proportionate’, with ‘some oversight, legal and political’. Denial: Google's CEO Larry Page (left) and chief . legal officer David Drummond said the firm (right, offices in . California) had no programme that would give the U.S. or any other . government direct access to its servers . The existence of Prism was disclosed in reports by The Guardian and The Washington Post. Data base: The U.S. National Security Agency's headquarters are pictured in Fort Meade, Maryland . It is said to give America's National Security Agency and the FBI easy access to the systems of nine of the world's top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype. It was reportedly established in 2007 under changes to US surveillance laws passed under President George Bush and renewed last year under Barack Obama in order to provide in depth surveillance on live communications and stored information on foreigners overseas. The row crossed the Atlantic after The Guardian said it had seen documents showing that GCHQ had access to the Prism system since at least June 2010. The British agency, based at Cheltenham, was said to have generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the 12 months to May 2012 - a 137 per cent increase on the previous year. According to the newspaper, the Prism programme appeared to allow GCHQ to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material, such as emails, photographs and videos, from internet companies based outside the UK. GCHQ refused to comment directly on the report, but in a statement it insisted that it operated within a 'strict legal and policy framework'.","William Hague: Law-abiding Britons have 'nothing to fear' from GCHQ .

Locked up: Exeter university cleaner Szczepan Majcherczyk has been jailed after groping students and shoppers over a four-day period - and then blaming it on his upbringing in rural Poland . A university cleaner has been jailed after groping students and shoppers over a four-day period - and then blaming it on his upbringing in rural Poland. Szczepan Majcherczyk worked as a cleaner at . Exeter University and used his pass to get into the library where he . spent an hour staring at a female student before offering her a condom and asking for sex. The 32-year-old also approached a first-year . student near St James Park station in Exeter, putting his hand onto her . bottom and inside her shorts, and groped a . 17-year-old girl through her leggings in a separate attack. CCTV cameras also captured the father-of-one touching a young customer at Exeter’s Royal Albert Memorial Museum and approaching a complete stranger in Tesco to ask her for sex. At Exeter Crown Court, Majcherczyk, from Exeter, admitted three sexual assaults and two offences of threatening behaviour. Judge Francis Gilbert, who jailed Majcherczyk for 21 months, told him he should be deported back to Poland. 'The Home Office will look at deportation. If it was up to me I would deport you' Judge Gilbert said. 'The suggestion there may be a cultural background to these offences due to your upbringing in rural Poland is one I reject utterly. 'These offences were alarming and shocking and totally unexpected by the victims. You told the student in the University library in pretty blunt terms you wanted to have sex with her and offered her a condom. 'In Tesco you propositioned another young lady and in lewd terms which were bound to embarrass and distress her.' Mr Gareth Evans, prosecuting, said Majcherczyk’s crime spree started on February 16 when he approached a woman at the museum in Exeter and asked for a date, telling her there were a lot of nice women there. She refused but then felt him standing uncomfortable close to him before he touched her on her bottom, forcing her to grab his hand and move it away. The next assault happened just hours later on the same evening when he approached an 18-year-old first year student near St James Park station and put his hand onto her bottom and inside her shorts, touching intimate areas through her thick leggings. Convicted: Szczepan Majcherczyk worked as a cleaner at Exeter University and used his pass to get into the library where he offered a female student a condom and asked her for sex. This is one of the university buildings . Two days later another student was working in the library and became alarmed to see him staring at her across a table for an hour. He then asked her for sex and pulled out the condom which he left on her chair. The next assault happened as a 17-year-old girl was walking home in Exeter and was approached from behind and groped through her leggings. The final incident happened at Tesco where he approached a young woman shopper and offered to carry her bags before asking to take her home so they could spend the night together. He was caught on CCTV and identified by staff because he had worked as a cleaner at the High Street store before moving to the university. Mr Warren Robinson, defending, said Majcherczyk has lived in Britain for eight years and has a five-year-old child but his relationship had broken down and he was depressed and drinking too much at the time of the offences. He said: 'During these few days he was relying on alcohol too much and perhaps fell back to older and inappropriate cultural values from his childhood in rural Poland.' Majcherczyk was also put on the sex offenders’ register and told to pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Szczepan Majcherczyk worked as a cleaner at Exeter University .

A Muslim cleric is demanding £50,000 compensation from the Home Office after he was placed under house arrest over his suspected links to Al-Qaeda. The alleged hate preacher was put under a control order for three years after MI5 reportedly suspected him of being one of the greatest terror threats to national security. His movements were restricted, he was banned from using the internet or a mobile phone and prevented from studying science at college. The man, who can only be referred to as .

Allegations: A Muslim cleric is demanding £50,000 compensation from the Home Office after for being placed under house arrest after MI5 (above) suspected him of being a terrorist . But the control order, made in 2006, was quashed by the High Court when the security services refused to reveal more of the evidence against him after a request from the Iraqi cleric's lawyers, it was reported by The Daily Mirror. The man, who lives in Britain with his . wife and children, is one of at . least four former terror suspects who courts have given the go-ahead to . sue for 'illegal detention'. In a court document detailing its evidence, MI5 alleged AE had 'extremist and criminal' contacts in the UK.

He said: 'He contends he is innocent. The Home Office never disclosed any evidence, therefore my client could never receive a fair trial. 'He couldn't respond to the allegations other than to deny them. My client has lost a significant portion of his life while subject to the control order.'

It is one of the world's most sophisticated software programmes, used to tap directly into the servers of Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. But it seems the sophistication behind the controversial U.S. data mining programme codenamed Prism does not extend to its logo. A photograph of a prism used as the programme's logo was a free-to-use image taken by British historian and broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis, according to reports by Gawker. The logo of data-mining programme Prism uses a picture taken by British broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis . Hart-Davis, right, offers the free-to-use picture, left, called Natural Science on his website . The prism on the logo appears to be a close-up of Hart-Davis' picture that has then been inverted. The bizarre origin of the photograph was uncovered after a company that produced tongue-in-cheek merchandise featuring Prism's logo was ordered to stop selling on copyright grounds. However, it emerged that Hart-Davis, who offers some free-to-use scientific pictures on his website, took the image. The picture, called Natural Science, shows the prism and refraction of light into a rainbow. Mail Online has so far not been able to contact Hart-Davis. The Eton-educated broadcaster, who is a distant relation of the Queen and David Cameron, is well known for his series of history programme, such as the BBC's What The Romans Did For Us and What The Tudors Did For Us. In 2012, it emerged Hart-Davis had been . warned about inappropriate touching by Glenwyn Benson, then the BBC . controller in charge of commissioning factual programmes. The . incident occurred when Mr Hart-Davis embraced a radio producer more . than 30 years his junior. He said his gesture was misinterpreted. The Prism scandal hit the headlines last week after documents were leaked to The Washington Post and The Guardian. The particulars of the PRISM data-mining programme have been outlined in a top-secret PowerPoint presentation for senior intelligence analysts, which ended up being leaked . This graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined PRISM, with Apple being the latest addition in October 2012 . It . was revealed that the programme allowed the U.S. National Security . Agency and FBI to tap directly into the servers of major internet . companies. It was . approved by a judge in a secret court order and allowed the government . to seize actual conversations in emails, video chats, instant messages . and more. Director of national intelligence . James Clapper said the programme, authorised in the USA Patriot Act, has . been in place since 2008, the last year of the George Bush . administration, and 'has proven vital to keeping the nation and our . allies safe.' 'It continues to be one of our most important tools for the protection of the nation's security,' he said. According to information declassified . today, the government does not unilaterally obtain information from the . servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers. It requires approval from a Fisa . Court judge and is conducted with the knowledge of the provider and . service providers supply information when legally required to do so. The government cannot target anyone . under the programme unless there is an 'appropriate, and documented, . foreign intelligence purpose' for the acquisition. The NSA said the programme is 'one of its most important tools for the protection of the nation's security' Apple said it had never heard of the PRISM programme but reports say it contributed to discussions with the government concerning sharing information . Those purposes include prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities or nuclear proliferation. The foreign target must be reasonably believed to be outside the United States. It cannot intentionally target any U.S. citizen or any person known to be in the U.S. The Post and the Guardian cited confidential slides and other documents about Prism for their reports. They named Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, AOL and Paltalk as companies whose data has been obtained. The companies have said they are not voluntarily handing over user data and have strongly denied newspaper reports indicating that Prism has opened a door for the NSA to tap directly on the companies' data centres whenever the government pleases. Amid reports of government spying, Mr Obama assured Americans on Friday that 'nobody is listening to your telephone calls'. What the government was doing, he said, was digesting phone numbers and the durations of calls, seeking links that might 'identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism'.","Prism programme used Hart-Davis' photograph of refracted light .

The BBC has admitted that the clock on its homepage doesn't tell the correct time because it would take 'around 100 staffing days' to put right, and it has taken the decision to remove it from the site. The confession came after a member of the public made an official complaint to the BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) criticising the clock's inaccuracy. He complained after discovering that the analogue-style clock in the top left-hand corner of the site 'merely reproduces the time stored on each individual user's own computer whether this is accurate or not.' An analogue clock was added to the BBC's homepage during a redesign in 2010 yet it doesn't tell the correct time. A member of the public made an official complaint to the Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) asking for it to be fixed or be removed. The BBC admitted it wasn't accurate but said it would take around '100 staffing days' to fix . The complainant added that the clock was 'inaccurate and misleading' and readers would 'assume' it displayed the correct time. It was added to the homepage as part of the site's redesign in 2010. As explained in the report: 'The complainant said that there is no other piece of information the BBC publishes which it knows is factually inaccurate or unreliable. 'The complainant believed that the clock should either be configured in such a way as to ensure the time was correct or removed from the site.' It continued that the complainant believed visitors to the BBC website . would assume the clock was accurate and the fact it wasn't was 'not . consistent with the Guideline requirement for the BBC to do all it can . to ensure due accuracy in all its output.' The Editorial Standards Committee looked into the clock complaint but ruled that the BBC had not 'knowingly and materially' misled the public. The BBC has been told to fix the clock but can do so within a 'reasonable time frame' The BBC was forced into an embarrassing climbdown over climate change claims made in Sir David Attenborough's groundbreaking Africa series. In the last episode of the series, entitled 'Future', Sir David discussed the challenges facing the region. Speaking over footage of Mount Kilimanjaro, Sir David made the assertion that 'some parts of the continent have become 3.5C hotter in the past 20 years'. However, figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by 0.76C, causing widespread concern among viewers. However, the ESC concluded that the BBC did not 'knowingly and materially' mislead website users in this instance. The Managing Editor of BBC Online was quoted in the reported saying that making the clock accurate would 'dramatically slow down the loading of the BBC homepage' and the work needed to do it would 'take around 100 staffing days'. Following a request for a statement, a BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The BBC takes accuracy very seriously. 'Given the technical complexities of implementing an alternative central clock, and the fact that most users already have a clock on their computer screen, the BBC has taken the decision to remove the clock from the Homepage in an upcoming update.' The BBC is governed by a charter called the BBC Charter and Agreement. Among other rules, the BBC is bound to report fairly, without political bias, and accurately.

They said they were concerned about Devillard's motivation for marrying the 68-year-old, who lived in a hut close to the Italian border without electricity or running water. Marcel Amphoux, who died in a car crash last year, has cut wife Sandrine Devillard (pictured together) out of his will, according to reports . Their marriage made headlines after villagers turned up to boo and whistle throughout the ceremony . Amphoux, who died in a crash in November, owned five shepherd's huts close to Alpine ski resort Serre Chevalier. The huts may be worth hundreds of thousands of euros each if they were converted into ski chalets. Land in the area is worth up to 3,500 euros per square metre, local media reported. But, Amphoux's blonde wife, 42, has been cut out of his will and has been left nothing, according to The Independent. A local lawyer has told the newspaper that Amphoux's will has been uncovered. He said that it was written on the back of an envelope in the weeks before he died. According to the reports the . shepherd's huts have been left to the tenants and the rest of his estate . has been left to an unnamed beneficiary. Lawyer Jean-Michel Colmant was quoted . in The Independent as saying: 'Everyone who has seen it confirms that it . is in Marcel's writing. He has clearly stated that he wishes to leave . nothing to his wife.' Devillard has not commented but is expected to contest the will. Puy-Saint-Pierre villagers speculated about the Parisian estate agent's motivation for marrying toothless Amphoux, who lived in a hut without running water or electricity . Amphoux, pictured in his wife's homemade music video, owned five shepherd's huts that he refused to sell but could have been worth hundreds of thousands of euros . French media reported the romance began when Devillard approached Amphoux in a bid to buy his land. He refused and they began a relationship soon afterwards. Villagers said she told tenants that they were being evicted and that the huts were hers. Village mayor Jean-Marius Barnéoud reportedly even asked police to investigate the unlikely union over fears Amphoux was being duped into marrying her. Photographs of their wedding appeared in national newspapers. She wore a raspberry, satin gown with gold jewellery and a bejewelled handbag. Amphoux was dressed in a suit but kept his floppy hat on for the ceremony. After intense speculation about her motivation for marrying Amphoux, Devillard attempted to silence her critics with a self-penned song and music video about her love for her husband. Marcel Amphoux died in November last year after the car being driven by his wife's friend plummeted off a mountain in heavy mist . In the video for The Call of the Sun, Devillard is dressed in a medieval-style dress as she runs around the mountains. Amphoux also appears but wears a hood that covers his face. Devillard said at the time: 'Marcel is a man from the Middle Ages, even prehistoric times. 'I am a true Parisian. I still live there. But I visit my husband as often as I can. To see him and to make him smile,' according to The Independent.

The latest Facebook message rumours would add a similar function to the web version of the site. Facebook has not yet commented on these rumours. In January, Facebook confirmed plans to start charging users to send messages to . people they aren’t already connected to - with a premium to be paid . for contacting very popular people. Every user currently has the ability to send a message to any other user for free, however unless being sent to a friend or friend of a friend the message goes directly to the receiver's 'other' folder. Described by Facebook as the place 'where less relevant messages go,' this little known option was introduced in 2010. Communication at a cost: Facebook is trialing a new service which enables users to send messages directly to people they don't know at a price . The new service offers direct access to the receiver's inbox, provided the sender is prepared to pay the fee . Facebook initially floated the idea of paying for messages prior to Christmas, when it was suggested that the service might cost $1 per . message. However a technology journalist at Mashable was surprised when they attempted to send a message to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and received an option charging a hefty $100 fee to send a message directly to the social network's CEO. Zuckerberg has more than 16 million followers on the site and without paying for a direct message to his inbox, any message would go straight to his extremely overcrowded ‘other’ folder. The company admitted at the time that it is experimenting with ‘extreme price points' to reduce incoming spam for Facebook users with large subscriber counts and big online presences. Users are also limited to sending one of these kinds of messages per week. Facebook is confident that imposing a financial cost on the sender will be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and best ensure the delivery of messages that are relevant and useful to the receiver.

"By . Paul Thompson, Paul Bentley and Rob Waugh . Created 5:59 PM on 14th September 2011 . Scandal: Scarlett Johansson, seen here in 2006, has called in the FBI after nude photos of her leaked online after they were stolen by a hacker . Scarlett Johansson has admitted that she took naked photographs of herself which were leaked online. The 26-year-old Lost In Translation star, who has never appeared fully nude in her movies, has been left humiliated after the explicit pictures were published on a website yesterday. The . FBI has, meanwhile, been called in to investigate how the private photographs were hacked from her mobile . phone - and it emerged today that it is closing in on the suspected hacker. Law enforcement sources told TMZ authorities are 'honing in' on the criminal gang, with the identity of one of the ringleaders known to the FBI. Johansson is the latest victim of the phone-hacking ring thought to be responsible for . stealing naked photos and videos from at least 50 female Hollywood . celebrities. Johansson's lawyer today issued a statement making it clear that his client took the explicit pictures. One of the photographs shows her posing seductively with her top off, while in another her bare behind is visible in a mirror. The photographs show wallpaper in the background which matches the design in previously seen pictures from inside her bedroom in Los Angeles. While parts of her body have been exposed for her movie roles, she has never before been seen completely naked. 'The highly personal and private photographs at issue capture our client self-posing in her own home in a state of undress and/or topless,' the statement, from lawyer Marty Singer, read. He also threatened to sue any media outlet which publishes the pictures under copyright laws - the fact that Johansson holds the rights confirms that she took the pictures and that they are authentic. Authorities also today confirmed it is looking into the case. 'The FBI is investigating a person or group responsible for a series of cyber intrusions of high-profile figures,' FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. 'This would include many devices - could mean a computer, desktop, laptop, iPad, cell phone... intrusions into personal online accounts too.' Other stars reportedly targeted  include actresses Jessica Alba, Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus, as well as singer Christina Aguilera. Investigation: The actress, pictured here in a campaign for Mango, was named earlier this year as one of the 50 victims who had their cell phones or emails compromised by a hacking gang . Distinctive: The wallpaper shown in the background of the nude pictures appears to match the design on the walls in Scarlett's bedroom, seen here . Miss Johnasson is likely to have had the photographs stolen by hackers after she tried to email them, experts explained. Other possibilities include hackers infecting her phone with malicious . software, or taking the data from a computer paired to the phone via a . virus. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC: ‘My guess is that, even if these photos were taken on Scarlett Johansson's phone, she would then maybe have emailed them to somebody. ‘Then, either their email got hacked or they were in her sent folder in her online email account - that would be the most natural way.’ Orla Cox, Norton Internet Security Expert, added: ‘Smartphones such as iPhones are only as secure as you make them. If you don’t have a passcode, and leave it lying it around, people can easily steal directly from you, simply by picking it up and sending pictures direct from the phone. ‘Even if you have  a passcode, a determined hacker can often guess – many people use simple combinations such as 1,2,3,4 or repeated digits. Hackers may have attacked the PC the iPhone was ‘paired’ with and stolen pictures that way. Sophisticated modern hackers do their research on targets and create tailor-made attacks which play on the victim’s personal interests. These type of hackers tend to be organised criminals who use socially-engineered deceptions to breach computer and smart phone security. Socially engineered attacks use details culled from sites such as Facebook to ‘trick’ the user into installing software – sending emails that appear to be from a friend, but that install malicious software that let them ‘control’ a victim’s PC. If any lesson is learned, it is that if you don't want explicit pictures spread online, don't take them and send them around in the first place. Gossip sites in America have been . speculating as to whether the photographs were meant for her ex-husband, . actor Ryan Reynolds, or any of the men she has dated since the . break-up, who include fellow Hollywood A-lister Sean Penn. Bloggers have linked the leaks to a hacking group called Anonymous that has boasted of targeting celebrities. Black . Swan star Mila Kunis was also named as a target, with hackers allegedly . uncovering picture of a shirtless and 'seductive' Justin Timberlake on . her phone. One image is said to show Timberlake . wearing pink underwear on his head while there is another reported to be . a separate explicit shot of an unidentified male. A fourth image is said to show Kunis in a bath, covered by the tub from the neck down. Kunis and Timberlake, co-stars in the film Friends With Benefits, have long denied rumours of an off-screen romance. It is not clear if the Johansson and Kunis incidents are related. Celebrity website TMZ.com  said Johansson had called in the FBI as a 'criminal act' had been committed. 'The FBI is aware of the alleged hacking incident and is looking into it,' an FBI official told FoxNews.com. Now the star has threatened to sue anyone who publishes the nude photos. Her lawyer Marty Singer has now written to various websites, warning of legal action. The photographs are currently still being shown on buzzfeed and Daily Gossip, among other sites. 'If you fail to comply, you will be acting at your own peril. Please govern yourselves accordingly,' the letter states. Johansson was named earlier this year as one of 50 victims who had their mobile phones or emails compromised by a hacking gang. High . School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens met with the FBI to discuss the . hacking of her Gmail account after photos of her kissing another woman . were leaked online. Sources connected to Johansson told TMZ the actress had called in the FBI to investigate the leak. She is currently filming the . super-hero film The Avengers with Captain America star Chris Evans and . Hollywood A-lister Robert Downey Jr. A spokesman for Johansson refused to comment.

One of the people injured in the Santa Monica shooting rampage on Friday spoke from her hospital bed to reporters. Debra Fine told the media that she saw the shooter, John Zawahri, 23, wearing a Kevlar vest and carrying a rifle, which he pointed at the woman in the car in front of her. Fine tried to intervene and was shot four times by Zawahri, after which she crashed her vehicle and pretended to be dead to escape his wrath. Scroll down for video. Debra Fine, speaking here to reporters from her hospital bed, was shot four times by Santa Monica mass murderer John Zawahri . After Fine was shot she lay as 'still as she could,' she told Fox News from her hospital bed, a routine which she believes saved her life. 'My biggest fear was that he was going to come out and he was going to finish,' Fine told the news outlet. 'And I said ‘I can’t die, I have twins.' When Fine initially saw the shooter he was motioning for the female driver in front of her to pull over. Debra Fine is attended to by a good Samaritan in her car after being shot four times by John Zawahri near Santa Monica College . Firefighters rush to take Debra Fine out of her car after she was shot four times by the Santa Monica gunman . 'I first thought it was because he was trying to take traffic in a different direction because President Obama was in town,' Fine said. 'And then I saw that he actually had the rifle pulled up and pointed at her. So that’s when I realized it was quite a bit more than that.' Trying to help the woman, Fine quickly maneuvered her own vehicle between Zawarhi and the woman shouting 'Don't!' Zawahri immediately shifted his gaze to Fine which she described as 'clear and ferocious' and 'incredibly frightening.' John Zawahri (pictured in his high school yearbook photo) was identified as the shooter in the Santa Monica campus killings. Zawahri killed four people, including his father and brother, and injured many more . 'The next thing I knew, glass was shattering on the passenger side,' Fine said. Zawahri's bullet only grazed her shoulder, but caused Fine to crash the car. 'I feel so grateful I’m alive,' Fine said. 'If I hadn’t ducked, and just laid down there, I don’t think I probably would have made it.' Fine's injuries were just the beginning of Zawarhi's rampage. After injuring her he set fire to his father's Santa Monica home. He then continued on hijack a car and carry out a killing spree that ended at Santa Monica College, taking the lives of four people including his father and brother. After shooting Debra Fine with a rifle through her passenger side window (bullet holes can be in the glass), John Zawahri set fire to his father's house . Zawarhi himself was killed by Santa Monica Police. He is believed to have been gone on the shooting spree because of mental anguish over his parents divorce. One of Zawarhi's other victims was 68-year old Carlos Navarro Franco, who died after his shots were fired into a car he was driving on the Santa Monica campus. Franco's daughter Marcela, 26, who was also in the car, died from gun shot wound later at the hospital.

"By . Nicole Mowbray . PUBLISHED: . 17:35 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 11 June 2013 . Posh Spice has long been making fashionistas sick. Who could fail to be envious of her jet-set lifestyle, her beautiful family or her burgeoning fashion empire? But the newly discovered medical condition Poshitis is not a malady caused by excessive jealousy but the name experts have given to a real physical problem — muscle strain caused by carrying heavy bags. Experts are blaming the A-list’s favoured 'Arm-Hook Crook' (AHC) — the trend for carrying an oversized weighty handbag on a bent elbow — for a rise in the number of women suffering shoulder problems, torn muscles and inflamed tendons. Big is best: Victoria Beckham photographed out and about with her gargantuan white Hermes Birkin bag . And I’m ashamed to say, I’m one of them. Earlier this year, I purchased a gorgeous new designer bag. Although it was, in the words of Stella Artois, 'reassuringly expensive', it wasn’t the price tag that left me wincing. Made by luxury French fashion house Celine, my new tote is heavy duty leather and full of useful pockets that fasten with several chunky zips. It’s got extra flaps and reinforced straps and metal studs on the bottom so it doesn’t get ruined if you put it down on the floor (but as it cost more than my first car, this is something I never do). Despite it’s equally hefty price tag, the handle is too small to fit over my shoulder, so, of course, I do the whole ‘arm hook crook’ thing. Yet since I bought my Celine bag, I’ve had a relapse of an earlier jumbo handbag-related ailment — sporadic but severe bouts of shoulder pain that radiate down into the pectoral muscle on my chest. It’s unsurprising then, that oversized totes are not only loved by the style set but by osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists, too, as handbag-related injuries are boosting their bank balances. I first felt my 'handbag injury' almost four years ago when I noticed a sharp pain in my right shoulder. But because I’d had a car accident a few years earlier that left me with a cracked sternum and damaged muscles in my upper back and around my collarbone, I put it down to a flare-up of that. Love: Beckham is famous for her passion for big bags, although it's one the fashion world shares . Ouch: Sadly for big bag fans, carrying them around can lead to painful injuries to the arms and shoulders . Then, after a few weeks of nagging twinges, I went to see a physiotherapist who, after taking one look at my overloaded Mulberry bag, promptly sent me to fashion purgatory by telling me to go home via Millets and invest in a Karrimor backpack. 'The kind worn by hikers' he said. 'Make sure you get one with padded straps and wear it on both shoulders.' I didn’t, nay, couldn’t! But I found the bag’s abandoned shoulder strap from the depths of my wardrobe and stopped carrying the equivalent of four bricks in it. Briefly, my symptoms abated. Several years later, fashion’s love affair with the large handbag is not only going strong, it’s got stronger. Hermes Birkin bags are more popular than ever, Mulberry’s new Willow is rather substantial. Then there’s Phillip Lim’s latest number, the 31 Hour leather tote and Alexander McQueen’s Heroine handbag. My Celine model is called the 'Luggage'. It’s a fitting moniker for something that currently houses my iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, complete make-up bag, pair of flat shoes, a diary, a note book, my keys, two pens, a bottle of water, several hairbands and various assorted lip balms. 'We have seen a huge increase in women with shoulder and neck problems caused by handbags,' said physiotherapist Sammy Margo, who also says some patients are lugging around bags weighing one-and-a-half stone. 'Women may think they are following a catwalk trend, but they are storing up trouble.' Perhaps so, but when it comes  to bags, women know that size  does matter. Celebrities may favour large bags to make them look smaller, but most women simply carry them out of necessity. It’s that, or a small bag accompanied by two linen shopping bags full of everything a modern girl needs, swinging from your shoulders. Bags of damage: If women like Mollie King, . Cheryl Cole and Millie Mackintosh copy Victoria and carry their bags in . the crook of their elbow, they could face torn muscles and inflamed . shoulder tendons . Model approval: Exclusive gym Bodyism trains Elle Macpherson (left) and Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley (right) Having flirted with a mini Mulberry shoulder bag throughout winter (it could barely fit my purse and a lipstick, meaning keys were left languishing precariously in my pocket) and an envelope-style snakeskin clutch bag throughout spring (it gave me hand cramp and I eventually left it under a chair) there was no option but to big-up my bag again. This is not something Michael Tanner, Performance Specialist at London’s exclusive Bodyism (the gym beloved by celebrities such as Elle Macpherson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) approves of. 'Carrying a heavy bag has many postural affects on the body,' says Michael. 'It not only pulls down the shoulder, which can put constant strain on the neck muscles, but our bodies naturally lean away from the side on which we’re holding a weight — in this case a bag. 'This leaning leads to a tightening of the opposite side of the neck, as well as throwing your shoulders, hips, knees and ankles out of alignment. 'Don’t even get me started on high heels,' he adds. Oops. I daren’t tell Michael what I am wearing today. But if I had to make a choice between the two fashion evils, I know which I’d choose. And let’s just say I won’t be hotfooting it to Millets anytime soon.","Large handbags can cause torn muscles and tendon damage .

Police chased a black bear cub for more than three hours around north-east Albuquerque in New Mexico. Footage of the young bear's escapade shows police cars trailing a lolloping bear cub around suburban streets. Police chased the bear from La Cueva High School, appropriately called 'Home of the Bears' for their mascotthe black bear, to Black Bear Lane, where they lost him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bear on the lam: This juvenile bear led police on a three-hour chase through north-east Albuquerque before disappearing somewhere off Black Bear Lane . The little bear eluded police before trotting into the aptly named Black Bear Lane and Black Bear Loop and disappearing into the foothills. Game and Fish officials suspect the bear was recently let loose by its mother and was looking for a new home. New Mexico Game and Fish officials said the bear is young, probably . weighing around 100 to 150 pounds, and that this sighting wasn't . unique. 'It's sort of happening statewide right now,' Rick . Winslow, a bear and cougar biologist with Game and Fish, told KRQE News . 13. 'We're seeing a lot of bear activity.' Homeless: Experts say the juvenile bear was probably let loose by his mother and is searching for new territory . Winslow said this time of year is when bears are typically on the move searching for a territory and a mate. 'The . younger animals are kicked out because of more dominant animals, and so . they're moving across the landscape trying to find a place to live,' Winslow said. It sounds as though this bear cub was seeking a new territory and strayed into the urban area. At home: Black bears often wander into urban areas where they feed on garbage, pet food and bird seed . While the cub is cute, its bigger relatives regularly cause trouble around the state. Winslow said that more animals are coming into populated areas looking . for food and water, a movement that's exacerbated by the current drought. 'In the southern part of the state, there's been a couple of bears that have actually killed cattle,' Winslow said. On . Tuesday a bear broke into a home in Cimarron, New Mexico and attacked an elderly woman, who suffered minor injuries. Not a teddy bear: Officials advise residents not to attract bears with garbage left on the street or birdseed, as they can be dangerous . The 400-pound bear was tracked by dogs and killed by authorities, who took its body to be tested for rabies. Winslow said sightings like Thursday's of juvenile bears will only increase in coming weeks. 'With the good bear population statewide, we can anticipate seeing more animals moving around and getting into human communities,' Winslow said. New Mexico Game and Fish officials say residents should be wary of putting out trash before the day of removal, and not to put out birdseed, which will attract hungry bears.","Police chased a juvenile black bear cub for more than three hours around north-east Albuquerque in New Mexico .

The Taliban today said they were doing everything in their power to kidnap or assassinate Prince Harry during his tour of Afghanistan. Just four days after the 27-year-old arrived in the volatile Helmand province, militants confirmed that he was one of their prime targets. 'We are using all our strength to get rid of him, either by killing or kidnapping,' Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location. 'We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him,' Mujahid added, declining to go into detail on what he dubbed the 'Harry operations'. The 27-year-old prince, who is third . in line to the throne, took up his new role two weeks after he was . photographed frolicking naked in Las Vegas. Known in the military as Captain Harry Wales, he first served in Afghanistan in 2008 as an on-ground air controller. But his tour was cut short when a news blackout, designed to protect him while on the front line, collapsed. The Ministry of Defence has said the threat to Prince Harry's life in Afghanistan was less severe in helicopters. He . arrived under cover of darkness last week to join the Apache unit which . has the highest 'kill rate' in the war. He will be based at Camp . Bastion for four months. Captain .

Battery-operated, multi-pronged forks designed to make Italian inspired mealtimes easier are available in most kitchen departments. And now the latest 'spaghetti fork' promising to end slurpy suppers is the Rolognese utensil from German firm Donkey which claims to roll up slippery pasta in an instant - the only downside is that you have to power it yourself .. with a crank handle! The new spaghetti fork promising to end slurpy suppers is the Rolognese utensil from German firm Donkey . The crank-enabled children's spaghetti fork costs £8 from Amazon and comes in blue and pink . The utensil, especially designed with . children in mind, is the latest in a wave of revolutionary cutlery . aiming to make the task of feeding yourself long pasta even simpler. The Rolognese spaghetti utensil, made of wood and stainless steel, poses a technical solution to the 'problem' of rolling up spaghetti. It works by sitting the wooden-handled fork in the spaghetti and turning the handle. Like magic, the spaghetti curls around the fork without too much mess or fuss (and a bit of fun).

If ramen, udon and yakisoba are your choice of stringy food though, perhaps the Calamete 'thumbed' fork from Japan Trend Shop would suit your needs. The design of Calamete is based on the . human hand, with a thumb that sticks out to make perfect twirling . without needing the spoon.

On the other hand no spoon equals less washing up . At the more hi-tech end of the spaghetti fork spectrum the twirling fork from Kitchen Craft, coming in . at under £8, claims to swirls spaghetti up in an instant. The motorised fork makes for plenty of twisting fun for children (or adults) who want to impress their guests during meals of spaghetti, tagliatelle or noodles. A spokesman for Kitchen Craft says: 'Easy to operate, the fork is a useful gadget which requires little effort and avoids unwanted mess when enjoying spaghetti bolognese.' And for the more stylish pasta connoisseurs a serving fork with a whopping six . prongs from brand Alessi is made of mirror-polished stainless steel.

Jayne Massey, 14, has only been paired with Black Lab/retriever cross Witney since April this year and is one of the youngest people in the country to benefit from a guide dog. While she was at a school holiday activity day, Jayne’s parents Marie and George, and her four-year-old niece Ava, took Witney for a walk in Walton Hall Park, Liverpool. As they left the park after the walk, a dog suddenly ran over to them and pounced on Witney, attacking her face and throat. Marie said: 'There was a group of people with this dog who were just stood there arguing amongst themselves. The dog was wandering up and down with its lead in its mouth and then all of a sudden it saw Witney and went for her.

MPs will today give a second reading to the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which would amend the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. As well as outlawing attacks on assistance dogs, it would also allow prosecution of the owners of dogs which attack people on private property. Guide Dogs chief executive Richard . Leaman said: 'A change in the law can't come quickly enough for our . guide dog owners, who too often have to bear the devastating . consequences of these attacks. 'When a guide dog is attacked, someone with sight loss can completely lose their means of getting out and about independently. 'The impact on their life is huge and . we are calling on the Government to do everything in its power to . promote responsible dog ownership, deter these attacks, and ensure this . deeply worrying trend does not continue.' Mr Leaman added:  'We have fought . long and hard on this issue and while we are delighted these measures . are being proposed, there is no time to lose. Only when irresponsible . owners are held accountable for their dogs, and heavily punished for . their aggression, do we believe the number of attacks on guide dogs will . come down.'

But after later excusing himself from the evening celebrations at Buckingham Palace, speculation has been rife about the state of the Duke of Edinburgh's health. And now his eldest grandchild, Peter Phillips, has told the public not to be surprised if the Queen and her husband give the 'odd engagement' a miss due to their increasing age. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Peter Phillips, left, the Queen and Prince Philip's eldest granson, told the public not to be surprised if the Royal couple miss the odd engagement due to their age .

Speaking on ITVs Daybreak this . morning, Phillips was asked if his grandfather was OK, after it was . revealed the elderly Prince was feeling a bit 'under the weather' following the events the day before. He . replied: 'Yes, but you also have got to remember his age, both of their . ages, you know... what they do at their age - they do a lot more than . most other pensioners of their equivalent age so... if occasionally . there is the odd engagement cancelled, it shouldn't come as such a . surprise, given the workload that they do have.'

Mr Phillips, 35, said he was 'hugely . proud' of his 87-year-old grandmother, describing her as a 'great . inspiration' to the country. He said the Abbey service had been 'fantastic', and imbued with a 'real sense of history.' 'She . is a great role model, she always has been.

If you've been wondering why you never seem to meet anyone you like or how you're supposed to find someone when work rules your life, dating website, MySingleFriend.com could have the answers. According to the site, singletons can be split into five groups, each with their own dating characteristics - some of which could be holding them back in their quest for love. 'Picky pandas' such as George Clooney are choosy about potential dates and need extra encouragement if they're to step out of their comfort zone, while 'Sharks' like Made in Chelsea's Spencer Matthews think they're just too cool to settle down. Animal instinct: Perfectionist George Clooney is a 'picky panda' while Harry Styles is a busy 'worker bee' It's a jungle out there: Are you a loyal pooch or a scary shark? MySingleFriend founder Sarah Beenie reveals all . Other groups include 'Man's Best Friend', which includes puppy-like singletons who prefer spending time with friends to dating, 'Worker Bees', who struggle to find time to meet new loves, and 'Night Owls' whose partying habits get in the way of their relationships. According to psychologist David Holmes who analysed the personality types, identifying - and tackling - these characteristics in yourself can help you find love in the long term. 'Although most people have a complex collection of personality traits, there are often strong features that could provide signposts as to the direction their dating personalities are taking,' he explained. 'Everyone will have a friend or someone they know – maybe even themselves – that they feel fits one of the profiles.' He added: 'Looking for examples we all know, Harry Styles leads a hectic working lifestyle – the classic worker bee – and needs to find someone that can both understand and slot into that crazy schedule.' Man's Best Friend: Russell Brand . Night Owl: Cara Delevingne . Shark: Spencer Matthews . 'MySingleFriend is all about having fun dating – so we wanted to take an alternative look at the trends between the profiles of singletons on the site, to help daters understand it’s not so much of a jungle out there,' said Sarah Beeny, TV personality and founder of MySingleFriend.com. 'We found that we could easily pull out the common ""usual suspects"" of the dating world through the behaviours described in profiles on our site. 'Because friends write the singletons profile, there’s no holding back on good and bad traits. The brilliant, honest and often hilarious profiles on MySingleFriend clearly show that there are behaviours common to all our single friends.' THE WORKER BEE . Most commonly found buzzing around big cities, a busy working life is often found to be a drawback in dating. 'Harry Styles may find himself being a busy bee as being a bit young and successful to find the time to strike a good love-life to work balance,' explains Holmes. THE PICKY PANDA . A perfectionist who needs encouragement to step out of their comfort zone. Once they do, they might realise Mr or Mrs Perfect is out there after all. 'Picky pandas tend to enjoy time on their own and are very careful when choosing a date,' says Holmes. 'George Clooney gives this impression and with many of those who become comfortable with themselves first, have a lot to offer to those who are patient and close enough to the picky panda’s criteria.' MAN'S BEST FRIEND . An adorable, excitable puppish personality who loves attention, these singletons have lots of friends and are very loyal to their group, but often struggle to leave the pack and make time for that one special person. 'Russell Brand is your typical man’s best friend,' says Homes. 'Very popular, fun and loving attention but unable to settle with one person. However, like most dog-types, they can become very faithful once they find their place in the pack.' THE NIGHT OWL . Common amongst students and twenty-somethings, these would-be daters love to party but burning the candle at both ends leaves them with no time for dating. Looking for other singletons that come to life in the evenings is recommended here, but also dating at lunchtimes or grabbing a pre-party drink in the afternoon. 'Cara Delevigne loves to party so is best suited to another night owl, who can keep up with her,' says Holmes. 'However be prepared for finding a relationship that may make the day more interesting and ease those nocturnal excesses.' THE SHARK . More common among men, some singles are judged to be a bit too cool to settle down by their friends and often struggle to find someone they are happy with. Rather than give up on dating, it is important these people use online dating to flirt and play the numbers game online, so that when the dates happen, they matter. 'Spencer Matthews is our shark,' says Holmes. 'He acts like a player but will hopefully meet his match in charm who will capture his heart.'","Types include 'sharks' who are too cool to settle down and 'picky pandas'

But now 'Wiggo' has shaved off his famous sideburns in a bid to make himself less recognisable to fans. He has admitted that he was often mobbed because of his distinctive mod haircut and had grown tired of all the attention following his remarkable run of success. Famous facial hair gone: British cycling legend Bradley Wiggins has shaved off his sideburns which has become synonymous with his rising sport stardom, winning the Tour de France and seven Olympic medals . The 32-year-old told the Sun: ‘They were too recognisable, it was getting a bit much.

A woman who was raped by a stranger in an alleyway has waived her right to anonymity to share her harrowing story and give other victims the courage to report their attacks. Juliet, who is in her forties, was attacked after leaving a bar in Manchester on New Year's Eve 2011. She was drunk at the time so did not remember the ordeal until the following morning when she had some frightening flashbacks and felt so sore it hurt to even sit down. Juliet told the MailOnline her experience was 'most people's worst nightmare' and something she still struggles to deal with today - but she wanted to share her story in the hope it will give strength to other rape victims and change society's view on the taboo subject. Scroll down for video . Brave: Juliet has shared her story in the hope it will encourage other victims of rape to seek justice . She said: 'Many victims of rape don't report it because they feel ashamed or experience self-blame. But no-one deserves to be raped. 'I had done nothing wrong, I had just gone out for a drink. It happened to me and it could happen to anyone, male or female. 'Victims need to come forward and report rape so a clear message is sent to rapists that they will not get away with it.' With the support of the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, one of 46 specialist centres in the UK for rape victims, Juliet was able to see her attacker brought to justice. A new BBC documentary, The Unspeakable Crime: Rape, that airs this evening, reveals the work the centre is doing to help people like Juliet. In the footage, Juliet explains how she had gone out to celebrate on New Year's Eve after first drinking a bottle of wine at home. She had another drink and a shot and was expelled from the bar by the doorman as she appeared very 'out of it'. She said: 'I remember feeling really out of it and going, ""what the hell are you doing here, Juliet? Go home!"" And then it's blank. 'Many victims of rape don't report it because they feel ashamed or experience self-blame. But no-one deserves to be raped' 'My next memory, and I didn’t remember this until the next morning, and it’s in an alleyway... I don’tremember what's happened. Except the alleyway and then somebody holding me there and holding me and holding me.' Juliet could recall elements of a sexual attack but her memory was sketchy. After reporting what she could remember to the police, CCTV footage, her injuries and a forensic examination helped piece together her horrific ordeal. After examining Juliet, it was found she had injuries to her mouth consistent with forced oral sex. Other swabs taken from her found evidence she had also had sexual intercourse - something she had no recollection of. Support: Juliet saw her attacker jailed thanks to the help of Dr Michelle Carroll (forensic doctor at St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre), left, and PC Christine Taylor from Greater Manchester Police . After being told about what the doctors had found, Juliet was shocked she couldn't remember what had happened. She said: 'I still don’t remember and I still can’t believe that it’s happened. I still want it to have not happened. I wish somebody would come and say, ""Juliet, you got it all wrong"". But I know that’s not going to happen.' Juliet said learning to live with what had happened to her was difficult and she frequently suffered from anxiety attacks. 'You can't let it be you. And that's what I’ve really learnt. My identity . isn't 'I got raped'. I am Juliet. But I'm forever altered' She said: 'I couldn’t even get to the shops without freaking out and running home. Because you feel stained. You feel contaminated. You feel like everything you touch is going to be soiled with what has happened to you.' At first, Juliet also had to live with the fact her attacker was still at large - and she had no idea who he was and if he could strike again. Don't suffer in silence: Many victims of rape are too ashamed to come forward but Juliet said they should report the crime so attackers are punished (posed by model) However using the DNA swabs that were . taken from her, Greater Manchester Police's serious sexual offences . unit made a match with a 20-year-old male called Mustafa Yussuf. In many rape cases, there is not . enough evidence to prosecute. But thanks to the CCTV footage of Juliet . leaving the bar looking drunk and stumbling from an alleyway some time . later, the DNA evidence, and footage of Yussuf in the area on the same evening, he was charged. He pleaded not guilty but after hearing all the evidence, a jury found him guilty of rape. He was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison and put on the sex offenders register. Juliet said it was a relief to know her attacker would be jailed but it was a 'hollow victory' given he was given a short sentence while she has to live with what happened forever. But she hopes her case gives other victims hope of some justice. 'I didn't even remember my attack but the guy was still convicted thanks to the forensic evidence,' she said. Justice: Even though Juliet couldn't remember all of her ordeal, her attacker was found guilty thanks to the forensic evidence (posed by model) Juliet's is one of thousands of rape cases that the St Mary's clinic deals with every year involving women, men and children. But Dr Cath White from the clinic said Juliet's case was unusual in that 'stranger rapes in the alleyway are really quite rare.' She added: 'The vast majority are people that are known, whether it's partner, ex partner, colleague. And that's in the adults. When you move into the children, particularly the younger you go with the children, the more likely it is to be somebody they know.' Today, Juliet said she is still haunted by her experience and can suffer from flashbacks. She has moved away from Manchester and said she won't go into the city centre again because it makes her so anxious. She added: 'I'm more reserved now and not as out-going as I used to be. But while I can't forget what happened, I have learned to live with it. 'You can't let it be you. And that’s what I’ve really learned. My identity . isn't ""I got raped"". It's not. I am Juliet. But I'm forever altered. 'I hope people who see my story on the documentary will see that I have survived - and I hope that will give them strength.'

What's lurking inside your bacon and cheese bagel? The olive eyes have it: While meat and cheese are 'versatile, easy to manipulate, and delicious' Kasia says she loves to use olives for eyes . Always experimenting with new ideas, Kasia likes to create scenes with her funny creations . She said: 'I get excited finding new types of bread and fillings to work with, but my favourite ingredients are meat and cheese because they just seem inherently funny to me. 'Plus they're versatile, easy to manipulate, and delicious. I also love the olive eyes. They give a consistency to my sandwiches, although I am considering branching out to new eyeball materials. Amusing: Kasia's creations keep evolving, she says, as she comes up with new ideas every day . This rare piece is a copy of popular kids' character Hello Kitty - an exception among Kasia's collection of scary and funny monsters . I've made almost 50 monsters. The ideas are coming quicker to me and I'm getting faster at it, so lately I've making more and more. 'Building a sandwich can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. Then I can spend up to an hour shooting them in various positions and settings. 'I try to get done taking pictures as quickly as possible because as soon as they're done, they get to go to my belly - unless my fiance beats me to it.' Irony: This clever design shows an American hot dog man, grilling sausages on a barbeque . Many of Kasia's creations appear to represent stereotypes from different nations. Can you guess which one this is? Fill me in: A smorgasbord of ingredients is used adorn and stuff her her sandwiches, which are usually happily consumed by her fiance .

An iconic mansion given to Idaho by the billionaire founder of the McDonald's french fry has been handed back to his heirs because it's too expensive to run, it was announced yesterday. J.R. Simplot, whose company Simplot invented the frozen fry in 1953 and has been the primary supplier of the potato snack to McDonald's for more than 50 years, gifted the luxurious property overlooking his home city of Boise to the state in 2004. The eccentric billionaire, who grew up in a log cabin and had just $80 when starting his company at age 14, decided he wanted his family home to belong to his beloved state and it should become the governor's house. Thanks but no thanks: J.R. Simplot's mansion will be returned to his heirs by Idaho which was gifted the property in 2004 . Mr Spud: J.R. Simplot built a multi-billion dollar fortune in agriculture and specifically providing McDonald's with potatoes for their fries . However, after nine years of being snubbed by governors not wanting to look too lordly by living in the home and a cost of $150,000 a year maintaining it - mostly watering its lush green lawns - city officials have decided it is more hassle than it's worth. On Friday a meeting of the Idaho Governor's Housing Committee agreed to return the 7,379 square foot property, valued at $2million in 2004, to the billionaire Simplot heirs. The agreement said though officials are 'very grateful' for the gift they believe it's 'in the best interest of the state and the Simplot family to return it.' Simplot's heirs originally insisted Idaho keep the property but are now said to be more amenable to taking it back. Flying the flag: Simplot's one stipulation in his multi-million dollar gift was that an American flag fly over the property at all times . Million dollar view: The mansion sits atop of a hill in Boise, Idaho, but has never been lived in by a governor . J.R Simplot is a well-known figure in the town of Boise where he founded his small agricultural company in 1929 specializing in potatoes and onions. His fortunes rocketed overnight when company scientist Ray Dunlap invented the frozen french frie and made the company millions - not least of all from its work for the fast food chain which it started supplying back in 1960. Down-to-earth Simplot's favorite food was said to be McDonald's fries or hash browns made from his own produce and he often stopped in the chain to enjoy the snack despite his vast wealth. He donated millions to the town including the mansion at 4000 Simplot Lane which was home to the Simplot family before his death in 2008 at age 99. Uncertain future: It is unclear what will now happen to the Simplot mansion which will be returned to the family by the end of June . Open doors: The mansion was generously gifted to the state but they claim it is too expensive to maintain . Patriot: The proud entrepreneur from Idaho wanted to use his wealth to support the state by donating the house . As he donated it the agricultural baron known as Mr Spud, who by then had also set up Micron Technology making microchips, said: 'As governors go and come, they'll enjoy it, I hope. They won't have any trouble from . me, that's for sure.' The house has it's own website and is described as the 'State of Idaho Executive Residence' or 'Idaho House' in short. The website says: 'It serves as the center of the First Family's ceremonial, social and political activities. 'Because the house is also a significant landmark in the valley, ever attempt it made to share this beautiful home with Idaho's citizens while continuing to meet the building's primary function as home for the State's chief executive'. Lying empty: Officials say it is too expensive to maintain the home that no governors have ever lived in . A look inside: Pictures reveal the large mansion which hasn't been lived in . No one home: Governors have snubbed the mansion choosing to remain in their own homes . Ironically it has never actually been home to a governor with officials snubbing it lest they be seen as snobbish. Some residents oppose the state's decision to ditch the property which now faces an uncertain future. Resident Michael Kostanecki told a public meeting in October: 'You can't have Idaho without that flag and without that hill. If we have any pride in the guy who really helped develop the state, we should keep it the way it is.' The property, which comes with 37.479 acres, has the condition that a 30-by-50 American flag continually fly on a 130 foot flagpole above the house on the hilltop overlooking the town. At a meeting in October it emerged much of the maintenance fee was being spent on keep the house's lush lawn watered. $300,000 was also spent furnishing the mansion. It will be returned to the family by June 30 and be emptied over the next 30 days. The state has said it may look at building a new Governor's house which is more manageable once the transfer is complete.","J.R.Simplot donated his iconic 'house on the hill' to Idaho in 2004 so it could become the governor's home .

The vehicles are undoubtedly different and many of the clothes might look a little out of place in 21st century Europe, but the locations are much the same and many of the buildings remain unchanged. A collection of photos made up of two different shots of the same scene taken decades apart offers a fascinating look at how fashion, transport and architecture has changed in Hungary's picturesque capital Budapest over the decades. Hungarian photographer Kerenyi Zoltan turned his camera into a time machine by taking archive pictures of various landmarks around the beautiful city taken throughout the 1990s and superimposing them on his own modern day shots. Then and now: A pair of friends from 1960 and a modern couple appear to share the viewing platform at Gellert Hill in Budapest to look out over the city's Liberty Bridge . Modern meets nostalgia: A picture of a tram wreck in Louise Blaha square from 1956 is set against a 2013 picture of the same site. The McDonald's would undoubtedly not have been there when the crash happened . She's in fashion: A swimmer from 1971 frolics in the water at the famous Hotel Gellert in Budapest next to sunseekers from 2011 . Clever: Kerenyi Zoltan's picture makes it look as though these two men from 1962 are looking back at the man behind them in the fairground ride carriage in 2012 . He spent hours painstakingly putting more than 300 pictures together, ensuring that each scene matches perfectly. Kerenyi used pictures from photo archiving site Fortepan to complete the collection, which he calls Ablak a Múltra, or Windows To The Past. The images took him around two years to put together and his work received worldwide acclaim when his images recently went viral on Reddit. He decided to put Windows To The Past together after developing a keen interest in old snapshots of the city. Window to the Past: Liberty Bridge and the Aero Express Co. seaplane station is pictured in 1927 and 2013 . Contrast: Budapest city park looks busier in 1969 as it hosts a car show than it does in 2013 . Permanent fixture: The city's iconic Chain Bridge pictured lit up at night in 1938 and 2013 . Now deserted: The Ferenc Puskas Stadium is packed out for an event in 1953 but sits deserted in the 2012 picture . The stunning images not only highlight the similarities and differences of Budapest's past and present, but the juxtaposition of the photos offers a nostalgic look at bygone days by placing residents and tourists from decades past in a modern setting. The collection sees 1960 meet 2013 at the Gellert Hill lookout over Budapest's Liberty Bridge. The cleverly done shot makes it look as if a couple from the modern day are looking out over the same scene as a pair of friends from more than half a century ago. Down to earth city: It may look like Budapest is being invaded in this 1980 picture of people parachuting close to the Danube, but the sky is a lot clearer in the 2011 shot . Picturesque: The Hungarian Parliament Building is pictured back in 1976 and later in 2012 .

Another seamlessly contrasted image highlights the difference in fashions between 1900 and 2013. A Victorian couple are pictured walking alongside the Hungarian National Museum, wearing traditional costume while those seemingly walking around them are wearing modern clothing. The difference between 20th and 21st century Hungary is perhaps best illustrated by a picture of a tram crashed in Louise Blaha Square in 1956 set against the same square today. Though the picture shows that the public transport system hasn't changed much, one of Budapest's beautiful buildings captured in the background of the shot is now occupied by a McDonald's.

When her home in York was raided, police found a room piled high with boxes of electrical items . including widescreen TVs, digital cameras and DVD players and a stack of vouchers. Aladdin's cave: Police discovered a room full of high-value electrical goods when they raided the home of Jennifer Margaret Ward . Along with her partner Alistair .

Cleared: Christopher Hird (pictured yesterday outside court), 48, of East Yorkshire, was told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact in total . A science teacher admitted he was 'stabbed in the back' by three of his female pupils who  maliciously accused him of sexual assault after he leaned over them during chemistry lessons. Christopher Hird, 48, who was a teacher for 24 years, was yesterday cleared of touching three girls aged 11 to 16 for his sexual gratification. Mr Hird - who was also head of science at South Holderness Technology College in Hull, East Yorkshire - was repeatedly told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact. But instead he was hauled through the courts, suspended from his £38,000-a-year job, and forced to wait 15 months to prove his innocence. After a six-day trial which cost nearly £100,000, a jury agreed with Mr Hird's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent. One pupil had even gone to the headteacher of the school to stop the case because he thought it was malicious - but the boy was not listened to. Mr Hird spoke outside Hull Crown Court yesterday after being found not guilty of two charges of sexual assault, one of sexual activity with a child and another of indecent assault. He said: ‘I have been through 15 months of hell for no good reason. It should never have come to court. I knew I was innocent. My lawyers kept saying it would be dropped, but no-one wanted to make that common sense decision. ‘My thoughts were only for the children’s welfare. When I moved around the classroom to lean over children it was only in the proper context. My motives were pure. ‘You don’t expect a knife in the back from a child, but innocent teachers run a daily risk of having their lives destroyed by false claims from children. I am afraid the teaching profession is under siege from similar complaints.’ And Magistrate Tony Smith, a former teacher . whose daughter was taught by Mr Hird, said: ‘I had no doubt about his . innocence, but he has paid a high price. 'The one thing that has struck . me about this case is the girls have remained anonymous, but his . personal life has been pilloried.’ The case was sparked by a girl who told a friend she would ‘get him done’ for touching her hair while using a paper towel to remove ink sprayed on her face by a disruptive pupil in a lesson. She was unhappy that he had moved hair out of the way and told her mother, saying he had put his hand near her crotch and brushed her thigh. Mr Hird denied any touching had taken place at all. He said the girl had not liked it when he told her to take her coat off in a lesson and she had refused. School: Mr Hird had been teaching at South Holderness Technology College (pictured) in Hull, East Yorkshire . He said it had been a battle not worth . fighting because she was part of a troubling group who were working. A . male classmate of the girl told the jury he saw her outside immediately . after the incident. The boy said she was grinning and initially claimed it had been an accident. But when challenged about reporting the touching, the pupil claimed she told him: ‘I don’t care. I don’t like him’ He said he was so concerned he went to the headteacher, but could not stop the case progressing. The boy added that Mr Hird had already been suspended, but over the coming weeks he found the girl’s account was changing as she told it to other people. He said: ‘He was a good teacher one of the best I had for science. I never saw him behave in a sexually inappropriate way. She was exaggerating. I heard her tell three or four different accounts to people. I thought there was something odd about this. She did not seem distraught in any way.’ 'Innocent teachers run a daily risk of having their lives destroyed by false claims from children' Christopher Hird . Mr Hird told the jury: ‘I am an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher who has a child’s best possible interests at heart. I always aimed to get them to fulfil their potential. I did get results.’ The jury heard there were two other complaints from girls of touching as he leant across them. One girl claimed he pull a paper towel out from under her bottom and touched her buttock. Mr Hird said the girls had made up the allegations. He told police one girl was probably just after compensation because she only came . forward after reading about his arrest in the local newspaper. On the main complaint where he was said to . have brushed her hair sexually, he said: ‘She asked me where the ink . was. It could easily have gone in her eye. Legal process: After a six-day trial at Hull Crown Court (pictured), which cost neatly £100,000, a jury took less than three hours to agree with Mr Hird's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent . ‘The contact with the paper towel was a few seconds. It was not sexually motivated. I got no pleasure from it. I was far from happy at the time. I wanted her to get back to work.’ Christopher Hird will now have his suspension reviewed, the local council confirmed today. Director of children, family and . adult services at East Riding Council, Alison Michalska, said: ‘The . overriding concern of the council is the health and welfare of East . Riding pupils. ‘As soon as the council is advised of . an accusation against a member of staff or anyone working with . children, immediate action is taken to safeguard the young people . concerned and the police are informed. ‘I would urge anyone who has any . concerns about someone to speak up and all calls made to the East Riding . Safeguarding Children's Board are always treated in the strictest of . confidence. East Riding Council will be reviewing Mr Hird's suspension following the conclusion of the court proceedings.’ He told the court there were 23 students in most of his classes and he treated boys the same as girls, adding: ‘It is best practice to circulate as much as possible when teaching. ‘I accept it means coming into close . proximity with students. It is impossible to read their work if you . don’t get to their eye line. I place myself in a position where I could . see their work.’ Eleven members of staff and nine former pupils gave glowing character references to the jury. A 19-year-old Hull University chemistry student, said: ‘He is a very good teacher and easy to get along with. He gave up his lunch times to help with revision only two other teachers did that.’ Defence barrister Mark McKone told the jury Mr Hird had worked his way up through the school to his job without criticism. He said schools were the worst place for Chinese whispers - which could produce the most sinister meanings. Mr McKone added that Mr Hird’s character references showed he did not have a bad reputation and the allegations were not credible. Mr Hird himself said after the case that he was waiting to discover whether he will be re-instated in his job and wanted the case out of the way to return in September. He added that despite adverse headlines in the local newspaper, he had not suffered in the street from taunts and found a huge amount of support from people.","Christopher Hird, 48, had been accused of touching girls aged 11 to 16 .

Botanists are hailing as a success a project to save the loneliest plant in Britain from dying out after they mated it with a partner from 175 miles away. A rare single female wild asparagus plant was found leading a solitary existence on the Isle of Portland in Dorset in 1997. The endangered wild asparagus is one of the few plants in the UK that have separate sexes and require a male and female to cross-pollinate with each other to reproduce. Future's bright: National Trust Conservationist Lucy Cordrey with a female wild asparagus which has now successfully mated after being discovered clinging to the windswept Dorset coast . In 2006 experts found a male variety . in Cornwall which they carefully moved to Dorset and then rubbed its . pollen on the female's stigmas. Her . fertilised flowers then grew, producing bright red berries which each . contained six seeds. These were then recovered, sewn in pots and grown . in greenhouses. After two years, some 60 plants were . deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have . spent the last five years. In safe hands: Botanists managed to mate this female wild asparagus, which reached the ripe old age of 70 before it was spotted clinging to the windswept Dorset coast, with an equally lonely male found in Cornwall . Out . of the original 60 plants, 51 are still thriving today and are now on . the verge of flowering for the first time, meaning they can reproduce . and sustain themselves. Joy: The painstaking project to save the loneliest plant in Britain from dying out was hailed a success after botanists mated it with a partner from 175 miles away . Wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the UK and its habitat is being steadily reduced, which is why scientists have made the effort to help them. The plant is different from garden . asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground . and its smaller spears have a bitter taste. The . 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30; one at Ferrybridge at the . eastern end of Chesil Beach alongside the lone female and the other near . to Portland Bill lighthouse. Bryan . Edwards, an ecological surveyor at the Dorset Environmental Records . Centre, said: 'We brought up a Cornish boy to have a bit of fun with our . Dorset girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game. 'Because . their natural habitat is in an exposed, hostile environment like sea . cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to . flower. 'When they were last looked at 21 out of 30 were still there on the Portland Bill site and they were very healthy. 'We are optimistic that we will begin to see some flowering now. 'To stand any chance of long term survival, a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes. 'Any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction. 'We . still don't yet know which sex the new plants are and won't be able to . tell until they flower. The males have a different size and shape of . flower. 'But we are . confident of a mix of male and female plants and then nature will take . it course and the population will be self-sustaining.' Success: A fresh young wild asparagus found thriving near the lonely female plant on Portland, Dorset, discovered in 1997 - thanks to the perseverance of botanists' pollination programme . As well as conserving a rare and endangered plant that is IUCN Red List, it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more draught tolerant. Other colonies of wild asparagus in Britain exist in coastal areas of south Wales and Cornwall. They appear to benefit from the north Atlantic drift, the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm. The wild asparagus breeding project has been coordinated by various bodies including the National Trust, Natural England.","Solitary female specimen was discovered clinging to wind-lashed coastal cliff .

This bungling thief is clearly no bright spark after managing to set himself on fire while trying to steal live high-voltage power cable. Blundering Richard Howells caused a power cut to 1,000 homes – including his own grandmother’s who found herself stranded on her electric stairlift for several hours until engineers could fix the problem. The 21-year-old, of Penlan, Swansea, saw sparks fly from his fingers and set himself on fire when he used a screwdriver to try pry out part of the 11,000-watt cable which he hoped to sell to pay his £140 phone bill. Not such a bright spark: Richard Howells, pictured outside Swansea Magistrates Court, electrocuted himself while trying to steal high-voltage power cable . City magistrates were told he almost died and had to roll on the floor to put the flames on his body out after the near fatal theft on April 4. He was tracked down by police after they checked local hospitals for people who had been admitted with burns. Howells’s solicitor, Phil Huxtable, said: . 'It’s only by luck he is able to face the court today. He came close to . killing himself through his own stupidity.' Magistrates sentenced him to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months. He was told to pay costs of £80 and an . £80 victim surcharge but chairwoman of the bench, Jennifer Wright, said . they could not award compensation because Howells would not be able to . pay them. 'It’s quite horrific what could have happened to you but also to other people who lost their power. 'People have all sorts of life-preserving machinery and they could have died through that stupid act,' she told Howells. Prosecutor Julie Sullivan said Western Power were called and told a large number of homes had been affected by a power cut and the problem stemmed from an electricity pole between Cadle Mill and Westdale Road, Blaenymaes. Dangerous: Electricity pylons in the Blaenymaes area of Swansea, from which Howells tried to steal cable . Engineers arrived and found a tough mains cable, which comes out of the ground, had been cut through. Mrs . Sullivan said: 'The only way it could have been cut through was in a . deliberate act and would have been extremely dangerous for the person . carrying out that act. There could have been a fatality.' The repairs took four hours and cost more than £4,800. Police . helicopters were deployed to find the culprit, but when that did not . turn up results, police checked hospitals and found two people had . checked in with burns injuries. Howells, . of Penlan, Swansea, had serious injuries and he had been transferred to . the burns unit, Mrs Sullivan said. He told staff he had got the injuries . after starting a fire in the woods near his girlfriend’s house and said . they had been caused by a piece of wood. Warning signs: Howells ignored the signs which warned: 'Danger of death - Keep off' which were on electricity pylons in the Blaenymaes area of Swansea . Police then went to his girlfriend’s address at Penplas Road and found off-cuts of the missing cable in her garden. Howells, who admitted attempted theft and criminal damage, said he planned to sell the cable. Mr Huxtable, for Howells, said: 'He’s fully aware this was a stupid offence to have committed and it almost cost him his life. He has had direct knowledge of the impact of this offending on people. 'His own grandmother in fact was stuck on her stairlift for several hours before the power was restored.' He said Howells decided to steal the cable after failing to find regular work and racking up a £140 phone bill. He had argued with his girlfriend about the phone bill. He said he went to the pylon and 'didn’t really consider the consequences of his actions.' He said Howells took himself to the police station, and if he had not done so the police would have struggled to find him.","Richard Howells saw sparks fly from his fingers after prying out the cable with a screwdriver .

A mother has told of her torment after finding out the man who tortured her baby to death is living just a stone's throw from her in a small village. Evil Scott Harman, 30, was released having served just four and a half years of a seven year sentence for brutally killing his eight-month-old daughter Jessica. But the parole conditions which barred him from living near to his ex-wife Nicola, 30, have expired enabling him to return. Torment: Evil: Scott Harman, 30, left, served just four and a half years for killing his eight-month-old daughter but is now living near his tormented ex-wife Nicola Harman, on the left on the right hand picture, in a tiny village . Care assistant Nicola told a friend, according told the Sun: 'She can't believe it - and is terrified every time she goes out in case she sees him. 'It's pure torment - after she has just started to put the tragedy behind her and move on with her life.' In 2008, a jury at Lewes Crown Court convicted Harman of manslaughter and child cruelty - charges which he consistently denied - after a month-long trial. Jailing him for seven years, Judge Richard Brown said: 'The jury have, in my view, convicted you on the clearest evidence of unlawfully killing your baby daughter. 'She was eight months old. She required the most careful attention and care. Instead of giving her care, you viciously assaulted her on several occasions using extreme force to fracture her ribs. On the final occasion, you shook her or possibly flung her on to the bed. No remorse: Judge Richard Brown, pictured, said Harman had shown no remorse and jailed him for seven years . 'All these actions were no doubt done by you in a moment of uncontrolled temper.' Harman, of Horam, near Heathfield, showed no emotion as the verdict was announced. The dead child's mother, Nicola was not in court to see her former husband jailed. After sentencing, police read a statement written by Mrs Harman. It said: 'My beautiful tiny baby girl weighed just 3lbs 13ozs when she was born on August 8 2003. Sadly, on April 1 2004, aged just eight months, she was so cruelly taken from me. 'Four hard years have gone by and now at last I can finally say ""May you rest in peace"". 'I hope my family and I can live our lives the way we should. 'I can still picture Jessica's lovely little face with her big blue eyes looking at me, and she was always dressed in pink. 'Jessica, you will always be with me, in my memories which will never fade and forever in my heart.' During the trial the court heard Jessica was alone with her father when she stopped breathing. He . was changing her in an upstairs bedroom at the family home in Horam, . near Heathfield, after returning home from a day's work in an air . conditioning factory at Hailsham. His wife was downstairs eating her supper when she heard her husband shout out that something was wrong with their daughter. Despite . desperate attempts to resuscitate her, Jessica was pronounced dead . later that evening at Eastbourne District General Hospital. But after she died a post mortem revealed she had a severe head injury and 15 fractures of her ribs. The rib injuries had been caused on at least three separate occasions in the weeks leading up to her death. Both parents were arrested within days of her death on suspicion of cruelty but police inquiries against them were dropped. The post-mortem examination concluded the cause of death was unascertained. At an inquest in February 2006, after hearing the medical evidence the coroner asked for a further police investigation. Harman was charged in July that year. In court Harman told the jury he loved his daughter and had been the happiest man alive when she was born.","Scott Harman, 30, shock his eight-month-old daughter to death .

Green was arrested in Verwood, Dorset, less than half a mile from her house. Representing herself in court, she apologised and vowed: 'I'm never going to do it again. 'I had a drink the night before and stupidly had a couple of glasses of wine with my lunch. 'I didn't realise I was going to push myself so far over the limit. I'm really sorry.'

As well as being disqualified from driving, Green was fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. She was offered the chance to pay to take part in a drink-driving rehabilitation course which would reduce her ban by three months. Dorset police traffic inspector Matt Butler said: 'Drink driving is extremely dangerous and entirely unacceptable. This case shows that offenders will be caught.

A major rescue operation was launched after a dog plunged 250ft off a cliff while chasing a rabbit - and lived to tell the tale. Golden retriever Sam was on a holiday break with his owner, Jonathan Minshull, and his family, in Devon, when the drama unfolded. The family were walking along a grassy cliff edge near Sidmouth when Sam spotted a rabbit and gave chase - straight off the edge of the 500ft precipice. On safe ground: A rescue team manage to haul Sam the golden retriever back to the top of the 250ft cliff . Long way down: Sam the gold retriever fell 240ft down to a ledge, circled left in red, on a cliff in Sidmouth, Devon, but survived after a cliff rescue team plucked the dog from where he came to rest, right . But miraculously the eight-year-old . much-loved pet survived the plunge - after a cushioned landing on some . gorse bushes on a ledge midway down helped to break his fall. Sam was winched to safety by member of the local search and rescue team and reunited with his frantic owner. Jonathan, . 38, from Derby, said that initially he did not even realise that Sam . had gone missing because the group had been posing for some photographs. He said: 'He was there one minute and the next he was gone. 'At first we thought he'd run into a field which was near the path. 'We were searching in the field for him, it didn't cross my mind for one second that he might have jumped off a cliff!' Miraculous: An outcrop of gorse bushes prevented lucky Sam from falling further down the 500ft cliff in Sidmouth, Devon . To the rescue: A full-scale cliff rescue swung into action after Sam the golden retriever plunged over the edge while chasing a rabbit . The Minshulls, who were also walking with friends, hunted for Sam for around an hour, frantically calling his name, before one member of the party went down to the beach and finally spotted the dog on a ledge halfway up the cliff face. Jonathan said: 'I was in Sidmouth visiting my friend, Simon Price, for his 40th birthday and it wasn't until Simon went down on the beach and looked up the cliff that he saw Sam on the side of the cliff. 'His fall had been broken by some gorse bushes.' Jonathan said he could not believe it when he saw that Sam was on his feet and moving around on the ledge. He said: 'When I saw he was moving around on the cliff I was amazed. 'I imagine he was barking but I couldn't hear him barking because he was too far away. Drama: The rescue - involving nearly a dozen members of the emergency services - unfolded on the edge of a dangerous 500ft cliff in Sidmouth, Devon . 'I was actually quite relieved when I saw him on the cliff because at least I knew where he was. 'I dialled 999 and the fire service turned up really quickly.' A . fire crew from Sidmouth and a specialist rescue team from Devon and . Somerset Fire Service's headquarters were sent to the scene to help . rescue Sam. When they arrived they assessed the situation and set up safety cordons.

Holiday to remeber: Jonathan Minshull, pictured centre right with friends, was enjoying the stunning views when he realised his golden retriever had disappeared over the cliff edge . Mr Minshull said that following the incident Sam was miraculously unscathed, apart from being thirsty and tired. He said: 'When he was pulled up over the cliff he was really happy to see us - he just wanted to get back to the campsite to cool down.' Mr Minshull said Sam was a much-loved family pet whom the family had owned since he was a puppy. He said: 'My kids adore Sam. He's just a big, daft dog. He's got a heart of gold.'

On the up: UKIP party leader Nigel Farage can expect a strong performance in the European elections . Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party is on course for further success in next year's European elections, according to the latest poll. In the 2014 contest 27 per cent of prospective voters would support UKIP, with Labour on 23 per cent and the Tories on 21 per cent. The rise of Mr Farage's party has caused major headaches for the Conservatives and this will be the latest challenge from the right for David Cameron to contend with. The poll for the Open Europe think tank also found that 39 per cent of those who had voted Tory in 2010 would back UKIP if the European election were held now. In a general election, the poll suggested Labour would take 37 per cent of the votes. This would give Labour an 11-point lead over the Conservatives on 26 per cent, with UKIP on 20 per cent. The Liberal Democrats would be trailing behind on 9 per cent. There was some good news for David Cameron though. Widespread support was clear for his policy of renegotiating the UK's relationship with Brussels before putting the new settlement to a public vote by the end of 2017. If a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU were held now, 37 per cent say that they would vote to remain in the EU compared to 41 per cent that say they would vote to leave. However, if there was a significant return of powers to Westminster followed by a referendum, 47 per cent would vote to stay in the EU, while 32 per cent would still vote to leave. Main parties: UKIP is a headache for David Cameron, left, as the party is attracting Tory voters and for  Ed Miliband, right, as Mr Farage is only 2 per cent behind him on trust for the new EU negotiations . The Prime Minister was still rated as . the party leader most likely to succeed in negotiating a better deal . with 29 per cent backing him to win back powers, with Ed Miliband on 14 . per cent, Mr Farage on 12 per cent and Nick Clegg on 4 per cent. Open Europe's director Mats Persson said: 'Whilst the Conservatives may be heading for a perfect storm in the EU elections, their overarching goal of a renegotiated position for the UK in the EU still enjoys substantial support from across the political spectrum. 'Most voters would clearly prefer to stay in the EU but on new membership terms, over withdrawing altogether. 'However, unless a new relationship can be negotiated, the UK electorate could well vote to leave the EU - which should also be a wake-up call for Labour and Lib Dems.' Trusted: David Cameron, pictured talking to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, was still voted the favoured party leader to lead EU negotiations on membership . 'It's rather surprising that Mr Cameron, despite everything, is still the most trusted party leader to negotiate a better deal for the UK in Europe. 'However, it's obvious that all parties suffer from a major credibility deficit on EU issues. 'For this exact reason, Mr Cameron must press ahead with a robust reform agenda now. Waiting until 2015 will risk losing the public support he still enjoys.'","27 per cent of British people would vote UKIP in European elections .

D’Oliveira, affectionately known as Dolly, was selected for the 1968 tour – but it was cancelled when the South African government refused to allow a black player to compete against its white team. No official team from any country toured there until apartheid was abolished, following Nelson Mandela’s release from prison in 1990. D’Oliveira, an all-rounder who was born in Cape Town in 1931, emigrated to England in 1960 and signed for Worcestershire in 1964. He made his debut for England in 1966 and played in 44 Test matches. In 1969 he was made an OBE and a CBE in 2005. D’Oliveira had suffered from Parkinson’s disease in his later years. He is survived  by his South African wife Naomi Brache and their two sons, Damian and Shaun. Damian, who also played for Worcestershire, said: ‘After a long battle with Parkinson’s, Dad passed away peacefully.’ D’Oliveira’s England team-mate Tom Graveney said: ‘It’s terrible – he was a great friend. I persuaded him to come to Worcestershire.’ Legend: Basil D'Oliveira in action. His death has been described as a great loss . Gerald Majola, Cricket South Africa’s chief executive, said: ‘Dolly was a son of whom all South Africans can be extremely proud.’ Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted: ‘RIP Basil D’Oliveira .  .  . Great man.’ CSA chief executive Gerald Majola led the tributes to D'Oliveira, whose health had been deteriorating for some time leading up to his death in England. '""Dolly"", as he was known around the world by an audience that went far beyond the game of cricket, was a true legend and a son of whom all South Africans can be extremely proud,' Majola said. 'He was a man of true dignity and a wonderful role model as somebody who overcame the most extreme prejudices and circumstances to take his rightful place on the world stage.'

As bounty hunters with bush knives entrapped them in a circle and moved in for the kill, the only thing this mother orang-utan could think to do was to wrap a giant protective arm around her daughter. The pair seemed to be facing a certain death as a gang of hunters surrounded them in Borneo, keen to cash in on the palm oil plantations' bid to be rideof the animals. But, happily, a team from the British-based international animal rescue group Four Paws arrived in time to stop the slaughter and saved their lives. The pregnant mother and daughter were captured . and moved to a remote and safe area of the rainforest and released back . into the wild - but not before the mother was equipped with a radio . device so she and her young can be tracked to ensure they remain safe.

A few minutes later and the orang-utans could have been dead' said Dr Signe Preuschoft, a Four Paws primate expert . Rescue: When the animal rescue group found the 'clearly petrified' mother and baby they discovered a gang of young men who were looking to cash in on the palm oil companies' offer of £70 per orang-utan . Before the rescue, a Four Paws team had . scoured the area on the Indonesian side of Borneo, which is shared with . Malaysia, but found no other orang-utans which had survived an earlier . slaughter. Deforestation has dramatically reduced their habitat and their numbers have dropped from 250,000 a few decades ago to only 50,000 in the wild. And while the loss of their habitat by logging companies has created a major threat to their existence, a more brutal form of reducing their numbers has emerged in recent years - direct slaughter. Palm oil is used in hundreds of products . from chocolate to oven chips, but the demand for buying it at a low . price has resulted in significant deforestation as habitats are being . destroyed to make way for plantations. Some palm oil companies see orang-utans as pests, a threat to their lucrative business, and have placed a bounty on their heads. Fresh start: The apes were released back to rapidly decreasing wilderness elsewhere in Indonesia by the charity group . Everything must go: The plantations, which are carving great swathes through south-east asia as they cut down trees to farm palm oil for the West, view the orang-utans as a pest . Company executives are reported to be offering up to £70 to employees for each orang-utan killed on the palm oil plantations. While such stories were at first denied, proof of the slaughter emerged last September when graves and bones were found by investigators. 'Killing of orang-utans is illegal in Indonesia but the law is lacking enforcement,' said a British Four Paws spokesman. 'Before November last year only two low-level arrests had ever been made. 'But in the last two months 10 more arrests have taken place including the arrest of the senior manager of the plantation where the worst graves have been found.' In an equally tragic scenario, babies left alive after adult orang-utans have been slaughtered have been put up for sale in the pet trade by hunters. When traumatised babies are found by Four Paws and other animal rescue teams they are taken to a sanctuary and taught skills they will need in order to return to the wild.","Pair saved at last minute by Brit-based animal rescue group .

"By . Sophie Borland and Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 09:38 EST, 21 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:21 EST, 21 May 2013 . The head of the NHS is to retire early on a £110,000-a-year pension, following months of mounting pressure over his role in one of the worst-ever hospital scandals. Sir David Nicholson will quit next March with a taxpayer-funded pension pot worth nearly £2million. His position has been under intense  scrutiny after a major report implicated him in the Mid Staffordshire hospital  disaster, where up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died needlessly. Sir David Nicholson was grilled by MPs over the official report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . Campaigners had repeatedly called for Sir David Nicholson to resign over the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal . He has also been accused of presiding . over a Stalinist culture across the health service, in which doctors, . nurses and managers are afraid to speak out about poor care. Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, said it was 'fantastic news' that Sir David was to leave the health service . Last night bereaved families and MPs questioned the size of his pension and demanded to know why he wasn’t leaving immediately. Although he is due to stay on for . another ten months, he told Health Service Journal he may leave earlier . if a suitable replacement is found. Sir David, who is 57, would normally . be expected to retire when he reached the age of 60. Even in his resignation letter to . Malcolm Grant, chairman of NHS England, he refused to apologise for the . Mid Staffordshire fiasco. He merely said: ‘Whilst I believe we have made . significant progress together under my leadership, recent events . continue to show that on occasion the NHS can still sometimes fail . patients, their families and carers. ‘This continues to be a matter of . profound regret to me but please note that on a daily basis I continue, . and will always continue, to be inspired and moved by the passion that . those who work in the NHS continue to show.’ That did little to appease Julie . Bailey, who set up campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella . died at the trust. Describing his pension as ‘an obscene amount of money . for failure’, she said: ‘He’s going with his knighthood and pension . still intact. 'He’ll have a happy retirement, unlike us who have been . left with awful memories of watching our loved ones suffer. ‘We are disappointed he is not going . immediately but hopefully this is a chance to finally change the NHS. We . can start to look to the future now.  He was part of the problem – not . part of the solution. 'We now need a leader who will galvanise and . inspire the front line, not bully them.’ 'Cure the NHS' campaigners demanded Sir David resign but he insisted he would stay on in his £200,000 job . Sir David Nicholson has worked in the NHS since 1977, the same year he joined the Communist party. After working in mental health for a decade, he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died. In 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the National Health Service, in charge of a £90billion budget and 1.3million staff. He claimed £50,000-a-year in expenses on top of a salary of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of ‘benefits in kind'. The package was criticised at a time when his 'Nicholson Challenge' was imposing £20billion in efficiency savings on the NHS. He insisted he had to travel by first-class to do his job, but refused to explain to MPs why his expense claims included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter. He was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the NHS where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out. In a three-year period under his rule a total of £14.7 million was spent on almost 600 ‘compromise agreements' preventing ex-employees from speaking out. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who put . down a Commons motion calling for Sir David to resign, said: ‘It is a . terrible indictment of our political system that he has not already been . fired. ‘It is an even worse indictment that . in an era where we talk about accountability, he should walk away to an . enormous pension, funded by the public.’ Andrew Bridgen is Tory MP for . Leicestershire North West, and some of his constituents died at . Stafford. He said: ‘His position was untenable, he had lost confidence . of 90 per cent of NHS staff and more importantly of the patients. ‘He should go sooner – as soon as a . suitable replacement is found. I believe we need a new era of honesty . and candour within the NHS and that has to start from the top. ‘The fact he hasn’t apologised for . the awful events of Mid Staffordshire and elsewhere and his huge pension . will undoubtedly rankle with many.’ Sir David has faced calls to quit . since February, when a high profile report linked him to the appalling . neglect of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust between 2005 and . 2009. Relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they . resorted to drinking dirty water from vases, while nurses said they left . wards in tears because care was so poor. Sir David was accused of not taking . action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the . trust,  and later when appointed NHS chief executive in 2006. In fact at the height of the scandal, . in October 2005, he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing . letter to managers praising them for hitting targets. But he has . repeatedly insisted that at the time he had ‘no idea’ of the unfolding . scandal and maintained that the failings were ‘system wide’. He came under further pressure when . it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about . another trust, University Hospitals Lincoln, where 670 patients may have . died needlessly. Sir David, who earns £211,000 a year, . became known as the ‘man with no shame’ because of his stance over the . scandals. Sir David’s pension pot is currently worth just under . £1.9million, although this will almost certainly increase with inflation . by the time he is due to leave, when it is likely to be more than . £2million. Although his retirement was announced . only yesterday, Government officials are believed to have been planning . it for some time, having realised his position was untenable. And while his letter of resignation . had yesterday’s date at the top, it includes a paragraph which refers to . preparations for reforms beginning on April 1, suggesting it was . written in March. The Mail understands that bosses at . NHS England were lining up possible successors three months ago, despite . publicly giving Sir David their full backing. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: . ‘[Sir David’s] job has often been incredibly complex and  very . difficult, and yet he has always had a reputation for staying calm, and . maintaining a relentless focus on what makes a difference on  the NHS . frontline.’ The Francis Inquiry into failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust found up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died as a result of poor care .","Chief executive of NHS England to quit £211,000 job in March 2014 .

Tragic: Karl Josiah, pictured, lay undiscovered at the crash scene for four days despite frantic searches by his family . A young man lay undiscovered for four days after his car plunged down a motorway embankment, an inquest has heard. Karl Josiah’s body was not found for days after the fatal crash as his car had landed in trees and bushes, undetectable from the roadside, or even from the air. Has family and friends had launched a desperate search for the 23-year-old after they were initially unable to convince police that Karl was missing. Once officers joined the search for Karl his Renault Clio, borrowed from his mother, was found on a patch of wasteland, obscured by trees and bushes after it had rolled down the roadside gully, and hit a concrete culvert before coming to its final position. An inquest into Karl’s death heard how he had journeyed from his home in Bromley, Kent, on January 18 this year to visit his girlfriend, Sarah Foster, who lived in Newbury, Berks. The pair had gone out for the evening before Karl dropped Sarah off at around 3.15am the following morning and set off for home. He had sent her a text at 3.39am telling her he was 'drowsy', and she warned him to stay awake. At around 5.30am, when she had not heard from Karl but expected him to be home, Sarah tried calling him but found his phone was off. Sarah and her mother joined in the search for Karl along the side of the M4 through Berkshire. 'The family were searching, there were frequent trips along the road,' read Berkshire coroner from Sarah’s statement. 'It wasn’t until January 23 you describe being out searching with your mum, there were police on the hard shoulder and the awful truth was revealed.' Discovery: Mr Josiah was discovered after Highways Agency officers noticed marks between junctions 6 and 5 of the M4, at Slough, which led down a grass verge to undergrowth which hid the car . Sarah said that she had not seen Karl take any drugs and that she was not aware that he did take drugs. However, she did say that he had drunk around a pint and a quarter of beer. A post mortem examination showed that Karl had consumed cannabis, cocaine and a small amount of alcohol prior to his death. However, the inquest heard that it was unlikely he was under the influence of any substance - although the come down from the cocaine may have caused him to feel drowsy and tired. His cause of death was given as multiple injuries, caused by the impact of the crash. Karl was discovered at around 1.06pm on January 23 after Highways Agency officers noticed marks between junctions 6 and 5 of the M4, at Slough, which led down a grass verge to undergrowth which hid the car. Earlier a helicopter had been deployed to look for Karl, although it had been unable to spot him through the greenery. Fatal: Collision investigator Tony Reading said the car had gone down the grass verge and hit a concrete drainage culvert after leaving the road between junctions 6 and 5 of the M4, pictured . Collision investigator Tony Reading . said the car had gone down the grass verge and hit a concrete drainage . culvert, which caused it to bounce off, and land on its side, around 15 . metres below the motorway level. There . had been heavy snow that day, and although there was snow on the verge . and possibly on the hard shoulder, the road itself had been clear. Mr . Reading said that the car had been travelling at 'a speed of at least . 70mph', and that Karl had failed to negotiate a gentle bend. He said that Karl had not attempted to steer the car, or applied the brakes, which implied he had fallen asleep at the wheel. 'Millions of cars travel round that bend every day, that’s the first time this has happened,' Mr Reading said. 'If you’re awake you drive round the bend, if you’re asleep you carry on in a straight line. 'Unfortunately that’s what Karl has done, he’s carried on straight with no steering input, which is why he’s left the road.' Karl’s father David Joseph asked Mr Reading why police had taken so long to start looking for Karl. 'It was four days before they started looking,' Mr Josiah said. Collision: Investigators found Mr Josiah had been travelling at 'a speed of at least 70mph', and that he had failed to negotiate a gentle bend. (File photo) 'They wouldn’t even look, we had to send people to Newbury to verify he was even there. 'We got four witnesses to prove he was in the area, after that they agreed they would check his phone which came up at junction 10. 'They said they did not have the manpower or money to search for a young man who might have gone off to a hotel with someone.' Mr Reading said that Thames Valley Police had been informed that Karl was missing by the Metropolitan police on January 23, and they had commenced their search immediately. Mr Bedford said that Karl could have pulled over and taken a rest break if he had been tired. 'We have the fact that by his own acknowledgment he was drowsy, the fact he deliberately embarked on a long journey in the early hours of the morning,' he said. 'He was impaired by the substances in his system. 'Karl must have driven past not on but two service stations giving him the opportunity to pull over and take a break, which is well documented in the Highway Code.'

The world’s last flying Avro Vulcan will be able to stay in the skies for the public to enjoy after strenuous efforts by the plane's supporters. Enthusiastic fundraising means that the plane's wings can be strengthened in a high-precision operation to keep it airworthy until the end of this year, but more contributions will be needed to keeping it going into 2015. Famed for their role in the Falklands War of 1982, it was feared the last of the iconic planes would have to be grounded but charity The Vulcan to the Sky Trust was determined not to let that happen. Still flying: The last airworthy Vulcan XH558 soaring over Lake Windermere . Iconic: Vulcan bombers were due to be scrapped before the Falklands War in 1982 but this one is still capable of flying . Vulcan bombers were flown in the crucial attack on Port Stanley’s airstrip on May 1 in 1982 in a marathon 8,000-mile round trip. The raid, the longest bombing mission in history at the time, showed Argentina’s military dictator General Galtieri that Britain was serious about retaking the Falkland Islands. Flight Lieutenant Martin Withers captained that bomber and now is chief pilot of the last flying Vulcan. He recalled: 'We were charged with bombing a 40-foot wide target half a world away in the dark with such accuracy that the runway would be destroyed. There was no margin of error in the plan.' 'The Vulcans were going to war for the first time in their history – just months before they had been due for scrapping or museums.' Heritage: A Vulcan bomber making an approach to land at Ascension Island in 1982 during the Falklands War . Restoration: In 2007, flying the first time in 14 years after it was grounded in 1993 . Long history: The bomber first flew in 1960 but is preparing for two more years of flying at its hangar near Doncaster, South Yorkshire . Vulcans were long-range bombers first designed and built for the Cold War. This particular plane first flew in 1960 . and was the RAF’s last airworthy Vulcan until it was retired in 1993. It was . grounded from then until October 2007. 2013 was meant to be the last year it flew after its restoration project, but the plane keeps getting the support it needs to carry on flying. It is currently kept at a hangar in Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport. The . task of making the plane airworthy was made particularly difficult for heritage . aircraft specialists at Cranfield Aerospace, who also support the UK’s . last flying Avro Lancaster, because none of the original manufacturing . tools and key drawings survive. Modifications: To allow the Vulcan two more flying years requires a very precise operation by rare aircraft specialists to strength the wings . Following further testing, it will be ready to take off for another season of displays across the country. 'If . everything goes to plan, we should be able to release sufficient . additional flying hours for XH558 to complete full display seasons in . both 2014 and 2015,' said Trust chief executive, Dr Robert Pleming. Although the technology exists for the plane to be able to fly until 2015, the charity still needs to raise £400,000 by October so that it can fly into 2014 and 2015. Privately maintained by a team of professional ex-RAF technicians, the aircraft casts more than £2 million a year to keep flying. The XH558 is now enjoyed by around three million visitors every year. The team behind Vulcan XH558 needs to find £400,000 of donations to carry out the modifications to keep it flying.

In the next few days, the Supreme Court is set to weigh in on affirmative action, but it seems Americans already have. Support for the controversial programs is waning, with less than half of Americans saying they believe affirmative action is still necessary to counteract racial discrimination, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday. Only 45 per cent of respondents said affirmative action programs are a 'good idea'. Out of 1,000 Americans polled between May 30 and June 2, 45 per cent also said such programs 'unfairly discriminate against whites'. Split: In a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 per cent of respondents said they support affirmative action and 45 per cent said they felt it caused discrimination against whites . In 1991, 61 per cent of registered voters polled supported affirmative action—meaning the programs' approval has plummeted 16 per cent in 22 years. Just three years ago in January 2010, 49 per cent of poll respondents supported the programs. NBC reported the dip might be attributed to the effects of having an African-American president or 'diversity fatigue'—when companies tire of constantly fighting to diversify the workplace during a recession. 'Certainly, the election of Barack Obama as president has made a difference,' Indiana University law professor Kevin Brown told NBC. 'I did not believe America would elect a black president in my lifetime. There’s no question America is a much more tolerant, open society than 20, 25 years ago.' One poll respondent told NBC she used to support such programs. 'Right now, I feel like it’s reverse discrimination,' the respondent, a 69-year-old white Rhode Island resident told NBC. 'I did support it at first, but, gradually, because of this reverse discrimination it’s gone too far.' Support for affirmative action in the poll was racially divided. Six in 10 or 56 per . cent of whites polled do not support the programs while the majority of . black and Hispanic Americans polled do. Affirmative: The Supreme Court will hand down a decision in the case of Abigail Fisher, right, who believes she was kept out of the University of Texas at Austin unfairly because of affirmative action . Decisions: The Supreme Court is expected to rule on an affirmative action case in the next few days . The poll comes as the Supreme Court revisits the constitutionality of affirmative action. In October last year, the court heard arguments in the case of Abigail Fisher, who claims she was not chosen for admission to the University of Texas in 2008 while less qualified minority applicants got spots. 'There were people in my class with lower grades, who weren't in all the activities I was in, who were accepted into UT. And the only difference between us was the color of our skin,' Fisher told NBC last fall. The court is expected to rule on the case in the next few days, according to CNN. In 2007, the court ruled public schools could not use race as a 'tiebreaker' when determining a student's admittance to certain high school and kindergarten programs in Seattle, Wash., and Louisville, Ky. 'The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,' Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion on that case. In 2003, the court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy. That same year, 49 per cent of adults polled supported those programs, according to NBC.","Only 45 per cent of Americans polled support affirmative action, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll .

'The display team, unlike some other display teams, is not a permanent assignment; rather it is drawn from a pool of suitably qualified and experienced, operationally ready, Apache aircrew and ground crew, and uses aircraft drawn from the operational Apache Squadrons,' added Lt Col de la Rue. Harry returned to the UK in January, following a five-month tour in Afghanistan co-piloting an Apache. In an interview he confirmed that he had killed at least one insurgent on the battlefield in the war-ravaged country. Unrepentant, he said soldiers sometimes had to ‘take a life to save a life’. Lt Col de la Rue said: 'This year the pool of display aircrew has been drawn from 662 Squadron AAC which has recently returned from a very successful operational tour of Afghanistan.

Being tapped on the butt by Chad Johnson is a sign of respect, the former NFL player's lawyer has claimed. In legal documents Adam Swickle asked the Broward County Circuit judge to reconsider her decision on Monday to jail Johnson for 30 days for disrespecting her court. The court had erupted into laughter when Johnson tapped his lawyer on the butt moments before the judge had been due to sign a plea agreement. Appeal: Adam Swickle, left, has pleaded with the judge to reconsider her jail sentence for Chad Johnson . 'This [laughter] is not Mr Johnson's fault and he should not be punished for the actions of third parties,' Mr Swickle has argued. Johnson, nicknamed 'Ochocinco' for his . old football jersey number, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for a domestic . violence probation violation by Judge Kathleen McHugh. He had previously reached a deal with . prosecutors for community service and counseling to resolve a probation . violation from his no-contest plea last year to battery on his . then-wife, TV star Evelyn Lozada. However, Judge McHugh decided to jail Johnson after accusing him of not taking proceedings seriously. When she asked the 35-year-old if he was . satisfied with his attorney, Johnson . reportedly smacked Mr Swickle's backside. No joke: Former NFL player Chad Johnson was sentenced to 30 days in jail when a judge refused to accept the plea deal after he slapped his lawyer's but in court.

'The whole . courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations. This isn't a joke.' Mr Swickle said the pat was Johnson's way of showing appreciation for his attorney's work on the case. 'Mr. Johnson has been a professional . football player in the National Football League for 11 years and patting . another individual on the backside is viewed as a sign of respect and . gratitude,' Mr Swickle said in the motion. 'It is clear that the court misinterpreted Mr Johnson's interaction with his attorney.' The butt pat came as Johnson believed . he would not have to go to jail, despite skipping meetings with his . probation officer for three months. Prosecutors said Johnson's sentencing will be left to Judge McHugh, who presides over domestic violence cases. Johnson had tried to apologize to the judge on Monday. 'This is your courtroom. I have no . intent to make this a joke. It's not funny,' he said. 'My life is in a . shambles right now.'

A New York state appeals court has upheld the conviction of Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty in 2009 of siphoning off millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, philanthropist and socialite Brooke Astor .

Astor died on August 13, 2007, at the age of 105 . The parties were notified by mail last week and Marshall has to surrender for execution of sentencing on June 17. Judge Smith did not explain his decision, the New York Post reported. Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New . York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother .

Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City . Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman . Marshall also gave himself a $2million pay raise and bought a 55ft long yacht with his mother's money. The wheelchair-bound son had begged judges to spare him the jail time given his age, health, military service and lack of prior criminal history.

John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived. Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch. Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony. JJ Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father.

Marshall was found guilty of . defrauding his mother out of money she had inherited from her . third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

It all started when Ashlyn Julian, born May 16, went from quiet all the time to screaming and throwing up. ‘At that point,’ says mom Gina Julian, ‘you know something’s not right. Fearing the worst, Ashlyn’s parents rushed the tiny girl to Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas. That’s where an ultra-sound uncovered something lurking inside her brain. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Ingenious: 20-day-old Ashlyn Julian was saved when doctors improvised a way to close her aneurysm, rarely seen in infants, using surgical super glue . ‘[That’s] as far as we made it because they saw something in her head at that point in time, so they decided to transfer her to a hospital that was better equipped for what was going on,’ Julian told CNN. The decision turned out to  be a smart one, but no one could have known that the moment doctors at the second hospital diagnosed Ashlyn with an almond-sized aneurysm in her brain. The condition, very rarely seen in infants, is far more common in adults, leaving doctors in uncharted waters. ‘We did not know what the right answer was. This was not a textbook case,’ said Dr. Koji Ebersole, an endovascular neurosurgeon. Unknowns: Rare in infants, the discovery of an aneurysm in Ashlyn's tiny brain, center, meant doctors were in uncharted territory . Dr. Ebersole said the aneurysm was unlikely to close on its own and that most babies wouldn’t survive an aneurysm left untreated. ‘So we had a strong reason to develop a plan to close the aneurysm,’ he said. Unfortunately, because the condition is so rare in infants, there were no designated tools for the job. After imaging the aneurysm using an angiogram, which allows doctors to view the body’s blood vessels, Dr. Ebersole decided on his course of action: he would close the aneurysm using surgical superglue. Decision time: Dr. Koji Ebersole (left, with Ashlyn's mother Gina Julian) knew most babies wouldn't survive on their own with the condition, but there were no prescribed methods to save her, either . Improvised tools: Dr. Ebersole used a micro-catheter as thin as a hair to administer surgical glue, fishing it through Ashlyn's neck and into her brain, none of which had been done on an infant before . Ashlyn’s prognosis was impossible to determine. No one had ever used superglue on a baby in that way before. There wasn’t even a designated tool for the job. Dr. Ebersole decided to use a tiny, hair thin micro-catheter to administer the daring treatment. Going in through the baby’s neck, the doctors accessed the aneurysm and deposited the glue. And then they waited. But they didn’t have to wait long. Doctors were able to remove Ashlyn’s breathing tube the very next day. ‘I did not know that she'd be ready that fast,’ said the thrilled doctor. Ashlyn’s relieved parents will likely be able to take their little girl, who doctors say will be just fine, home in a week or so. Relief: Ashlyn's parents, pictured, were as shocked as doctors when the 20-day-old girl began to recover almost immediately. They will take her home in a week or so .","20-day-old Ashlyn Julian was born with an almond-sized aneurysm on her brain, an extremely rare condition in an infant ."
"By . Chris Greenwood . UPDATED: . 04:10 EST, 14 October 2011 . The investigation will examine how often vulnerable children are being sexually exploited by organised criminal gangs and other groups. (Posed by model) As many as 10,000 children could be the victims of gang-related sexual abuse, it was claimed last night. And the Children’s Commissioner’s Office said many more could be subjected to exploitation. It is launching a two-year inquiry aimed at lifting the lid on the scale of the shocking crimes that reach into all parts of society. The investigation will examine how often vulnerable children are being sexually exploited by organised criminal gangs and other groups. It will study the appalling phenomenon of Asian men grooming white girls for sex and how teenage girl gang members can be forced into prostitution. Experts said there is a lack of reliable  official information about the true scale of sexual abuse across England. Fears have been repeatedly raised that teachers, social workers and police are missing the warning signs when children fall prey to abusers. Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz, who is leading the inquiry, said estimates suggest up to 10,000 children could be victims. But she said available evidence suggests many more girls and boys of all ages are being abused in much larger numbers. The children's charity Barnardo's say children as young as 10 are being sexually exploited by organised gangs . Mrs Berelowitz said: ‘Right now thousands of children are being horrifically abused by gangs and in groups. Children are being failed up and down the country – in every village, town and city. Accurate data is essential so that government, police, local authorities, schools, the youth justice sector and health professionals can properly identify and protect child victims. Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz will lead the inquiry . ‘As a society we have a collective responsibility to uncover the facts and deal with the grim reality so that children can be properly protected.’ The inquiry was announced after one academic study found much more needs to be done to protect children from sexual exploitation. Experts at the University of Bedfordshire found guidance issued two years ago on safeguarding children is not being followed in three out of four areas. They found that children are coerced into sexual activity by grooming, pressure from a friend who is already a victim, or powerful neighbourhood gang members. Children in local authority care are more than four times as likely to fall victim as those in families. Earlier this year an investigation found one in four men accused of street-grooming vulnerable underage girls for sex is Asian. It followed a series of shocking cases in which white girls were lured into abuse, often with drugs and alcohol. The report was the most detailed assessment yet of the crime but the new inquiry will have a wider remit to include all types of abuse. In January, Barnardo’s said children as young as 10 are being sexually exploited by organised gangs of men. It revealed staff were working with more than 1,000 children  who have been groomed, abused and trafficked for money, and the problem is growing. The Government is due to  publish a renewed action plan later this year detailing how it will respond to concerns about child sexual exploitation. Children’s Commissioner Maggie Atkinson said the inquiry will be ‘a wake-up call for us all’. A young woman who lured two white teenage girls to be raped by three Asian men was jailed for seven years last month. Stephanie Knight (right), who was 17 at the time, told the pair they were going clubbing but instead plied them with vodka and drugs. She forced them to have sex with ‘her boys’ after driving to a derelict terraced house in Accrington, Lancashire. The two 16-year-old victims were subjected to an appalling ordeal in which both were threatened and subjected to sex attacks. Three men, brothers Amjad Hussain, 34, and Shahid Hussain, 37, and their cousin, father-of-four Tanveer Butt, 39, were all convicted of rape. They were jailed indefinitely at Preston Crown Court and must serve at least seven-and-a-half years before they can be considered for release. The case was the latest to feature Pakistani sex attackers who preyed on vulnerable young white girls. Politicians and police have repeatedly clashed over how best to tackle what some  suspect is a potentially incendiary hidden crimewave. Jack Straw, former Home Secretary, has accused some Pakistani men in Britain of seeing white girls as ‘easy meat’ for sexual abuse. Several police forces have investigations currently ongoing into gangs suspected of abusing young girls. Children’s Minister Tim Loughton has suggested that closed Asian communities have turned a blind eye to child sex grooming by gangs of men.","Two-year inquiry aims to examine scale of abuse .

An aircraft preservation group has denied a millionaire's claim that it found pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart's missing plane in 2010 but sat on the news so it could solicit him to pay for a later search. Mystery has surrounded Earhart's fate since her plane disappeared in 1937 in the South Pacific. Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932 but many experts believe she crashed into the Pacific a few years later while trying to establish a record as the first woman to fly around the world. Timothy Mellon, son of the late . philanthropist Paul Mellon, filed a federal lawsuit in Wyoming last week . against The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) and . Richard E. Gillespie, the group's executive director. Enduring riddle: American aviator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Fate: The Electra taking off from Oakland Airport at Alameda, California, on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight . Mellon, . who lives in Riverside, Wyoming, claims the Delaware group solicited $1 . million from him last year without telling him it had found Earhart's . plane in its underwater search two years earlier. Mellon's . lawsuit says the 2010 search in the waters around the Kiribati atoll of . Nikumaroro, about 1,800 miles south of Hawaii, captured underwater . images of the 'wreckage of the Lockheed Electra flown by Amelia Earhart . when she disappeared in 1937'. The . suit claims the aircraft recovery group intentionally misrepresented . the status of its exploration to Mellon last year, telling him a . discovery of Earhart's plane was yet possible if he supported the . search. The lawsuit . states Mellon contributed stock worth more than $1 million to the 2012 . search and accuses the organization of engaging in a pattern of . racketeering to defraud him. Discovery? A grainy sonar image released last month by TIGHAR off the Pacific island of Kiribati could show the remains of Amelia Earhart's doomed plane . Tim . Stubson, a Casper lawyer representing Mellon, said on Monday that he . has viewed the images from the 2010 search that the lawsuit maintains . show the wreckage of Earhart's plane. 'As . a layman, it is hard to see, unless you know what you're looking at . it,' Stubson said of the footage, which he said he couldn't share. 'Much of it relates to the landing gear and parts that are unique to the landing gear.' Stubson . said Mellon engaged experts to examine the underwater images against . parts they knew were unique to the Earhart aircraft. He . said they reached a 'definitive conclusion that that is in fact the . wreckage, and it had been discovered two years before our client paid . for another expedition'. Stubson . acknowledged that the aircraft preservation group might have had more . to gain by publicizing a true discovery of the Earhart wreckage. But he . noted: 'For whatever reason they didn't do that in this case, and they . continue to solicit funds under the pretense that they have not found . it.' Rare: The only known picture of Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Electra taking off from Lae, New Guinea for the 2,550-mile flight to Howland Island . Missing: Earhart and Fred Noonan, left, before they set off on their doomed flight. Right: Earhart as a young pilot . Bill Carter, a lawyer . in Boise, Idaho, represents the group, known as TIGHAR, and was a team . member on the 2010 Earhart search mission. He . said on Monday the organization strongly denies Mellon's claim that it . found the plane. He said it is raising funds for another search that . could occur as soon as the end of next year. 'TIGHAR . does not possess any definitive evidence as to the whereabouts of . Earhart's Lockheed Electra, and did not conclusively make any . discoveries in 2010 which it's withheld,' Carter said. 'All of its information and its research is compiled and available for public viewing on its website.' Carter . said he respects Mellon's opinion but isn't aware of any videographic . or forensic expert who has validated his conclusions. 'I . have looked at some of the underwater imagery that he's referring to. I . was, in fact, present during the 2010 expedition when that imagery was . taken,' he said. 'And I can just tell you that I don't see any of the . things that Tim sees in those images.' Carter . said he's been a member of the group for 17 years and sits on its board . of directors. He said he's been involved in the Earhart search for at . least that long. 'I would . tell you that there is no financial gain for us in hiding the discovery . of the most famous missing aviator in the history of aviation,' Carter . said. 'Just the opposite; we would want to publicize the finding to ensure that we can protect it adequately.' Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later . The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Phoenix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most wacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5million in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","Famous aviator disappeared as she attempted an around the world flight in 1937 .

Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich - who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life - threw a cell phone into a lake and then slapped her husband just before she was arrested for drunken boating, according to a police report. Brockovich, 52, appeared 'highly intoxicated' as she argued with her husband,  Eric L. Ellis, aboard a boat docked at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor on Lake Mead in Nevada last Friday, the arresting officer, Kasen Haslem, wrote in the report obtained by MailOnline. The mother of three later registered a blood alcohol content of .190 - more than twice the legal limit of .08. Haslem was fueling up his own boat when he spotted the couple around 7:30 p.m. 'I watched as she threw a cell phone form the boat into the water,' he wrote. 'She then walked by her husband and she appeared to slap him.' Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich has apologized for her drunken boating arrest last Friday . When the officer approached the . couple, Brockovich 'started the boat and began backing out of the slip,' Haslem stated. He ordered her to return the boat to the dock, at which . point Brockovich stated 'that she was not very good at driving her . boat.' Brockovich, (right), allegedly threw a cell phone into the water and then slapped her husband, Eric Ellis, (left) The officer then helped guide her vessel toward the slip and he began asking her questions about their argument. 'Her answers were very slurred,' Haslem stated. 'She also kept straying from the conversation and repeating herself.' 'I could also smell an alcoholic beverage on her breath,' he added. Haslem performed field sobriety tests . and she failed nearly every one of them, he said. She was later booked . into jail and released on a $1,000 bail. Brockovich has since apologized for . her arrest, though she denies the officer's claims that she backed her . boat away from the marina. 'At no time was the boat away from . the dock and there was no public safety risk,' she said in a statement, . denying police claims that she operated the boat in open waters. 'That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly . a big mistake. I know better and I am very sorry,' she added. 'After a day in the sun and with . nothing to eat it appears that a couple of drinks had a greater impact . than I realized.' Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a . misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the . charge. Brockovich, who married her third . husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the . 2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life. As a legal assistant she helped win a . record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of . people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the . California town of Hinkley. After suffering an injury in an auto . accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to . represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the . firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to . support her family. Boating blunder: Brockovich, famous for acting as an advocate for residents of Hinkley, California, against the Pacific Gas and Electricity Company, was recently arrested for DUI . Case closed: Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich in the movie of the same name . The law firm hired Brokovich as a . file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific . Coast's career in law and public advocacy. While organizing files for a pro-bono . real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead . to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in . U.S. history. Brokovich's investigation found that . the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley . residents for more than 30 years. Between 1952 and 1966, the company . used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to . fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which . was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern . California to the San Francisco Bay area. Brockovich is pictured in March 2000 in her home in Agoura Hills, California . The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower. The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant. Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement. For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus. Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case. Brokovich and Masry then became the . face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits . against various corporations for pollution issues. Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.' Just last year, Brockovich was back . on the big screen in the documentary 'Last Call at the Oasis,' which . explores challenges related to the planet's dwindling and increasingly . polluted water supply.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is to blame for the death of an 11-year-old boy found in a Boone, North Carolina hotel room on Saturday and the deaths of an elderly couple found in the same room almost two months ago. The body of 11-year-old Jeffrey Lee Williams of Rock Hill, South Carolina was found shortly after noon on Saturday, along with his mother, Jeannie Williams, 49, who was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. Boone Police Chief Dana Crawford told reporters that 'a presumptive test indicated elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room.' Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning . An autopsy on the boy's body found that he died from asphyxia - a severe lack of oxygen. The boy and his mother had been staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza at 840 E. King St. in Boone. Two month ago the bodies of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, of Longview, Wash., were found in the same room. Autopsies conducted soon after the couple died had been incomplete, but full-blown toxicology tests only concluded this week have confirmed that their deaths were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning. The hotel is currently closed as authorities conduct an investigation into what happened in room 225, which is located directly above a room housing a natural gas heater for the hotel's indoor pool. A March 6 Watauga County Health Department inspectors report, obtained by the Charlotte Observer, showed the pool’s pump was not approved by an industry standards group. The report also found the pool’s chemical and equipment room needed better ventilation. Boone Police Chief Dana Crawford told reporters that 'a presumptive test indicated elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room' where Jeffrey Lee Williams was found dead . 'This needs to be corrected ASAP,' wrote the county health inspector. Such heaters can produce carbon monoxide, an odorless colorless gas that can cause illness and death. The boy and his mother had gone to Boone to pick up his sister from a mountain camp. The mom, Jeannie Williams, 49, has awoken from a medically induced coma but has no memory of what happened. 'We support a full investigation into . the cause of this horrible tragedy and we will not rest until we are . satisfied with the outcome,' said the family in a statement. 'The loss of Jeffrey from our family is . immeasurable.' A family friend told CNN: 'If you had this happen one time, why in hell didn't they do something about it?' The hotel will remain closed by police until at least Wednesday, when inspectors from the State Board of Examiners of Plumbing, Heating and Fire Sprinkler Contractors are due to arrive. 'The health and safety of guests who stay at our hotel is our number one priority. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those involved. We are cooperating fully with authorities who are investigating this truly tragic incident,' said a hotel spokesperson.

Miss Weaver also presented the award for best revival of a play, which went to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? But the overwhelming hit of the awards ceremony was Kinky Boots, the musical adaptation of the 2005 British comedy film, which picked up six trophies. The wins included best musical, original score for its writer, 80s pop star Cyndi Lauper, and best leading man for actor Bill Porter.

A controversial online tournament where boys pit their female classmates against each other and vote who is the best looking is facing calls to close amid accusations of bullying and sexism. May Madness is the name of the Facebook page where the girls of Washington's Issaquah High School are judged and encouraged to 'look their finest' throughout the month of voting. The anonymous creators and operators of .

Bullying: The controversial Facebook page of May Madness allows students of Issaquah High School to vote who the hottest girl student is for 2013 . Designed to resemble the brackets of . basketball's March Madness, each girl eliminates their designated . opponent until they reach the final rounds where the winner of the . competition which has been running for five years is decided. Last year the dubious tournament was shut down when parents complained to the police about offensive comments placed under pictures of the girls, which is a crime in Washington state. However, this year the organizers have made it more difficult to post profane comments and are also exercising their 1st amendment rights by keeping the website running. District spokeswoman Sarah Niegowski said the contest 'doesn't feel good' to anyone. Issaquah High School tried to shut down the May Madness website last year - but this year the student operators have banned offensive comments and brushed up on their 1st amendment rights . 'These are pretty smart folks behind this,' Niegowski said. 'They know their First Amendment rights. They're very quiet about who it is and the group behind it.' School officials at Issaquah have said that this year they are monitoring the site for any signs it has stepped over the line - while it is doing all it can to discourage people from taking part. However, some fear that the damage has already been done. 'Almost every teenage girl has self-esteem issues,' added student Tristan Robinson to King5.com. 'And doing something like that is absolutely ridiculous.' The school has admitted that unless legal boundaries are crossed there is little they can do to stop May Madness as the tournament is held off school grounds and if the girls keep their clothes on then no dress code rules are being broken. Most students of Issaquah High School were critical of the website May Madness - believing it to be sexist and dangerous to the self-esteem of girls at the school . The website can not be shut down because the voting does not take place on school property and the girls are not in any states of undress . 'This kind of thing is sexualizing us girls like we're some sort of trophy,' said sophomore Devon Keller to King5.com. Last year, the May Madness page had a direct link to the brackets and voting, but this year that is not readily accesible to the public. Sarah Niegowski said in an interview with the Seattle Times that the concept 'preys on a lot of insecurities that already exist in adolescents'. So far, police haven't received any criminal complaints about May Madness, but aren't anticipating any either. Some stood up for the organizers of May Madness though. 'They’re (contestants) not just like these hollow, shells of women who . are just there to be objectified sexually,' said Issaquah senior Tiffany . Han to Q13Fox.com.

Then earlier this week there was a flurry of new activity as rumours that Prince Harry had confirmed that the baby was a boy swirled and hundreds of punters placed bets on the royal baby being male.

Enough shale gas to keep Britain self-sufficient for a decade is sitting untouched under the UK, experts said today. A buoyant report from America's Energy Information Administration (EIA) says the UK's 'technically recoverable' shale gas reserves are at 26 trillion cubic feet (tcf) - which is almost ten times what Britain consumes a year. Extraction has already started in the North West of England, and the UK is . thought to have significant shale gas resources in South East England, . the Midlands, Central Scotland and the Welsh border. But EIA's scientists also said today fracking has 'got off to an abysmal start' in Britain after it triggered 'two earthquakes' near Blackpool, with 'political . opposition' highlighted as the main threat to it happening. Untapped: A test drilling site for shale gas on the outskirts of Southport, Lancashire, one of the areas of Britain which could hold enough to keep the UK self-sufficient for a decade . Their study also said that for the first time shale oil could also be extracted, with an estimated 700million barrels-worth waiting to be tapped. The new figures are a shot in the arm for the industry, as estimates on obtainable volumes of fossil fuels continue to rise. In a 2011 study, the EIA said technically recoverable shale gas . resources were 20 tcf, while a year earlier the . British Geological Survey (BGS) said it was more likely a quarter of that total - 5.3 tcf. Fracking involves firing water and chemicals into rocks to 'hydraulically fracture' them, which then releases gas or oil. Heartlands: More than ten times as much gas lies under the North West of England than previously believed - and it could make the UK self-sufficient for at least 10 years. The red areas highlight where shale gas is thought to be present . Process: The controversial technique of fracking uses a high-pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock . Operations close to . Blackpool were halted in 2011 and led to an 18-month moratoriumamid concerns about the process after two . small tremors struck in the area. Problems: A test drilling site for shale gas at Preese Hall Farm near Blackpool. The area was hit by two earthquakes previously in what experts have called an 'abysmal start to fracking in the UK . The company working in Lancashire, Cuadrilla says there could 200 tcf where they are working. Only a proportion of the total volume . will be accessible to the shale gas industry but even if just 10 per . cent of the North West’s reserves can be brought to the surface it could . end the entire UK’s dependency on foreign imports for a decade. But opponents . of fracking claim that it is unsafe. They argue that drilling could . scar the British countryside and clog roads with hundreds of lorries . transporting gas and dirty water. There are also concerns that the chemical composition of the fracking fluid- which is believed to contain upwards of a hundred different chemicals- could pollute water supplies. The EIA has admitted that fracking, which is much more widespread in America, is a more complicated process in the UK. 'Compared with North America, the shale geology of the UK is considerably more complex, while drilling and completion costs for shale wells are substantially higher,' their report said. 'While the UK’s shale resource base appears substantial, commercial levels of shale production are yet to be established.' The report went on: 'political opposition to shale development is greater in the UK than in Poland', which is Europe's leader, adding: 'Hydraulic fracturing got off to an abysmal start (in Britain). The UK’s first shale production test well triggered small local earthquakes'. The word 'fracking' comes from the term 'hydraulic fracturing'. Water, sand and cocktails of chemicals are piped into shale rock formations deep underground. Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock . made up of mud that is a mixture of clay minerals and tiny fragments . particles of other minerals, such as quartz and calcite. The high . pressure injection causes the rock to fracture, creating fissures along . which previously trapped gas can flow and be extracted. The sand and the chemicals help keep the fractures open and lubricated. The first experimental use of hydraulic fracturing was in 1947 and the first commercially successful uses were in 1949. In 2010, it was estimated that 60 per cent of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured. As of 2012, 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing jobs have been performed on oil and gas wells worldwide.","U.S. Energy Information Administration ups estimate of UK's recoverable fuel .

A teacher has been sentenced to 11 years in prison today for tweets that insulted Kuwait's ruler and encouraged his overthrow. Huda al-Ajmi, 37, received the longest known sentence for online dissent in the Gulf state, according to Kuwaiti opposition groups. She reportedly faced three separate charges that included insulting the Emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, . which carries a one-year sentence in itself. Insult: Disparaging Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, carries a one-year prison sentence . Sheikh Sabah al-Sabah is described as 'immune and inviolable' in the constitution. The other two five-year prison terms were given for inciting rebellion against the regime and violating laws on public discussions. Although Kuwait is more liberal than many Gulf states, authorities are increasingly cracking down on perceived dissent over social media. Last month Mussallam al-Barrak, a former MP, was sentenced for five years for insulting the Emir but he managed to overturn the decision on appeal. Mr al-Barrak had warned the Emir in a speech that he would not be allowed to 'take Kuwait into the abyss of autocracy'. 'Inviolable': The Kuwaiti constitution describes the Emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah pictured with Barack Obama, as 'immune and inviolable' However, it is unusual for a woman to serve jail time for political crimes in Kuwait. Recently two female activists were punished with lighter jail terms but ended up with suspended sentences. Kuwait has not seen the same scale of pro-democracy uprisings as other Arab states but dozens of people across the Gulf region have been sentenced to jail for Twitter and blog posts in the past year. Unrest flared up in Kuwait in December last year after the emir changed an electoral law in the run-up to a public vote. Opposition parties said the move was intended to deny them a majority and they boycotted.

It’s the cosmetic holy grail, surely — a way to get rid of your wrinkles without needles or pain. So what if I told you that this magic ingredient not only exists, but that it’s already used in creams that are available on the shelves of your local chemist? You might think it was too good to be true. Yet researchers from Reading University recently identified Matrixyl, a chemical included in everyday skincare products, as a genuinely effective anti-wrinkle ingredient — despite its lack of publicity. Effective: Matrixyl is found in most wrinkle-busting creams but very few cosmetic companies will admit to it . Apparently, Matrixyl could double the amount of collagen produced by the skin, giving you a fresh-faced look. So how does it work? And which cosmetics products should you be looking out for when you’re filling  your bathroom cabinet? Matrixyl stimulates the body to make more collagen, a natural skin-plumping agent, and more hyaluronic acid, which also helps skin look younger. It is found in creams made by High Street brands such as Olay and Ponds, and in designer brands such as Chanel and Dior. Experts are now convinced that its inclusion is the secret behind which anti-ageing creams work and which don’t. And to test how Matrixyl performs on middle-aged skin, we asked two writers in their 40s to swap their usual moisturiser for one containing it for a month. So why haven’t you heard of this miracle substance before? It was first patented in 2000 by Sederma, a French  company that is the world leader in developing anti-ageing ingredients. The first scientific paper showing that Matrixyl stimulated collagen production and improved the texture of sun-damaged skin was produced in 2005 by scientists working for Proctor & Gamble. They performed a three-month trial involving 93 women aged 35 to 55, who were asked to put a moisturiser containing Matrixyl on one half of their face and the same moisturiser without Matrixyl on the other half. Spot the difference: Cheaper creams such as Olay contain similar amounts of Matrixyl to brands like Strivectin . The scientists then reported  a 'significant improvement and reduction in fine lines and wrinkles' in the skin that  had been treated  with Matrixyl. Olga Gracioso, of Sederma, says: 'We know Matrixyl is effective, but manufacturers want consumers to believe efficacy is coming from something else — an ingredient that is unique to their product. 'That’s why they are constantly coming up with new formulations and prefer not to highlight that they still contain Matrixyl.' In other words, cosmetic companies would rather shout about how their products contain another new ingredient than hail one that several companies use, even if that’s the one that actually makes all the difference. It’s a marketing gimmick of the highest order — regardless of scientific evidence for its efficacy, skincare manufacturers have discovered we are all suckers for something new, ‘better’ and more elegantly packaged. Whether it’s a new mineral formulation or some unique ingredient found in the depths of the ocean, some cosmetic companies will try anything to make you believe they’re onto a winner. 'Part of the problem with the cosmetics industry is that even if something works, selling more products is more important than selling (a smaller amount of) the best ones,' said one senior industry scientist, who didn’t want to be identified. 'You could argue it is a strange attitude, but for them it’s the one that generates the most sales.' And let’s not forget that the anti-wrinkle business is big business — we spend more than £2 billion on creams a year. Companies are constantly trying to come up with different fragrances, textures, serums and oils. Matrixyl has been included in these for years, but because so many cosmetic products already used it, no one tried to focus on it as a selling point. But now news of the scientific studies is out, it’s likely that we can expect a rush of new advertising campaigns from companies describing the benefits of an ingredient that has been there all along. So should we all be stocking up on Matrixyl-containing products before everything is re-packaged — and re-priced? 'There is clinical data showing Matrixyl can stimulate collagen production in ageing or sun-aged skin,' says Chris Griffiths, Professor of Dermatology at Manchester University. 'Women should seek out products that contain it, but they should also know it is generally impossible to find out exactly how much of it is contained in any one product.' At 45, I’ve always had good skin (with a few wrinkles), but anything that improves it can only be a bonus. StriVectin SD Power Serum (£79, selfridges.com) claims to boost luminosity and reduce the size, length and depth of wrinkles. Before I start using it, Nick Miedzianowski-Sinclair at the Cosmetic Imaging Studio analyses my skin in terms of wrinkles, moisture, redness and sun spots with a VISIA cosmetic imaging machine. My wrinkles score 89/100, which is good for my age — the higher the score the better. I get 31 for moisture and 42 for redness and sun spots. I return to the studio after using StriVectin SD every morning and night for four weeks. The tests reveal my wrinkles have reduced — my new score is 91/100 — even though for full results the cream should be used for another four weeks. My moisture score has gone up to 34. The only thing that has worsened is redness, but Nick explains this could be due to a change in the weather. All in all, I’m a Matrixyl convert. LUCY CAVENDISH . I’d like Matrixyl to give me my 18-year-old face back, but I’ve tried enough 'miracle' creams to limit my expectations. Before the four-week experiment, the VISIA 3D imaging machine maps my facial imperfections and I’m doing better than the average 40-year-old in the wrinkle department — 55/100. But my pigmentation and redness are bad — 20/100. I resent spending large amounts on face cream, but Olay Regenerist 3 Point Super Serum (£24.99, boots.com) contains Matrixyl, so I apply it every morning and evening. It goes on easily and although I have sensitive skin, there is none of the irritation I’ve had with other 'plumping' face creams. Four weeks later and, despite my scepticism,  the VISIA scan is astonishing. The cream hasn’t lessened my redness, but it has almost eradicated the wrinkles round my eyes — I score 95/100. My moisture levels have also increased significantly. So full marks to Olay. This is going to become a regular fixture on my shopping list.

For the author of one of this year’s most talked about books, a slot at Britain’s best-known  literary event seemed a formality. But David Goodhart has been dramatically snubbed by the Hay festival and not invited to be a speaker. Organiser Peter Florence considers his book about immigration ‘sensationalist’ and out of kilter with the annual event’s liberal audience. In turn, Mr Goodhart, director of the Left-leaning Demos think-tank and one of the country’s foremost liberals, accused Mr Florence,  educated at public school and Cambridge, of having an ‘ideological spasm’. Anger: David Goodhart, who is director of left-wing think tank Demos, says he has been excluded by Hay organisers because they don't agree with his new book on immigration (right) The writer, 56, also criticised him for declaring the book was ‘not very good’ despite not having read it. Critics have also accused organisers of suppressing free speech at the event running from last Thursday to next Sunday. At the centre of the row is The British . Dream: Successes and  Failures of Post-war Immigration, which takes a . sceptical view of large-scale immigration. The book, extracts of which  featured in the Daily Mail before its April publication, divided opinion. Opinion: Hay Festival Director and founder Peter Florence has said Goodhart wasn't invited because his book 'isn't very good' But reviewers from across the political spectrum agreed it was an important work. For example, Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: ‘Finally: a European liberal who isn’t afraid of his own shadow and a British intellectual who isn’t allergic to evidence. No intelligent person can afford not to read this book.’ So it came as a surprise to Mr Goodhart when he received no interest from the festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors to Hay-on-Wye in Powys. A forthright exchange of emails followed between Mr Florence and the author, who has attended Hay as a speaker or visitor for 15 years . Yesterday the writer told the Mail: ‘I tried to persuade him to give me a slot. He listed various reasons he was “wary” of the issue. First was that Hay is “to celebrate pluralism and multi-culturalism on a global scale – to imagine the world beyond Little Britain”. ‘Second, he said he did not like the “numerical” way the immigration debate is framed and produced an anecdote about the horrible abuse of an Afghan asylum seeker.’ In an extract he adapted from his book for the Mail, Mr Goodhart argued that among ‘Left-leaning Hampstead liberals’ like himself there was an assumption that anybody expressing alarm at the largest influx of incomers in this nation’s history was a racist. But, he said, they were wrong as mass . immigration, without integration, has had a profoundly adverse effect on . British democracy and social cohesion. Popular: Festival-goers browse the bookshelves on the opening day of the 2013 Hay Festival last week . Mr Florence. 48, who founded the Hay festival with his father Norman in 1988, also referred to a 2004 article by Mr Goodhart. It was written for Prospect magazine and said ‘to put it bluntly, most of us prefer our own kind’. Mr Goodhart went on: ‘Third was his background. He said, “I’m a second . generation Briton from a mixed marriage and I thought your 2004 essay . was unrecognisable with my experience and the experience of most people I . know”. ‘To be fair, he did acknowledge he was responding in a muddled and . emotional way. He did say he would think about giving me a slot but then . never got back, despite emails from me. ‘When it was clear he was not interested, I booked a slot at the other . Hay [HowTheLightGetsIn festival of philosophy and music] which . is where many people say the energy is now, compared to the staid main . Hay festival.’ He added: ‘Perhaps [Peter] salves his conscience by deciding against . obviously suitable books that he disagrees with –  a kind of ideological . spasm.’ Royal welcome: The Duchess of Cornwall greets school children as she and the Prince of Wales arrive at the Hay Festival last week. The couple are among 80,000 who will go this year . The row was stoked when Mr Florence  told a gossip columnist this week that Mr Goodhart’s work was ‘partial, predictable and sensationalist’. He was also quoted in The Guardian newspaper saying the writer ‘was never invited, the book isn’t very good’. Yesterday Mr Goodhart said: ‘He said to me he had not read the book in February. He may now have read some of it, though I think he probably read a short extract in the Mail. ‘He is entitled to his opinion about the book but it has been endorsed by some pretty heavyweight people. ‘Peter’s reaction is not typical of the reaction which has, in the main, been pretty sober and reasonable even on the liberal Left and shows how much healthier and more open the debate has become since 2004 when I was castigated by many. ‘I’m surprised that he allows himself to overrule what would have been a good and topical book event because of his own views. I think that’s very lazy thinking.’ Accusing Mr Florence of running the festival like a ‘personal fiefdom’, he added: ‘Peter doesn’t like it because he doesn’t agree with it but that’s not a reason if you run a literary festival. ‘I’m disappointed because I’ve been going there for so long.’ The spat has spread to Twitter, where Labour peer Lord Adonis wrote: ‘How about some free speech at the Hay Festival? Extraordinary that David Goodhart told his views on migration unacceptable for debate’. He also accused Mr Florence of ‘liberal intolerance’. But Mr Goodhart, a married father-of-four, who lives in North London, told the Mail: ‘I am not some kind of dissident! Of course, Peter has the right to exclude me – I also have the right to complain about it. A lot of people think it’s an odd decision.’ Mr Florence was yesterday at the festival and a spokesman for the event said: ‘He has no comment at all to make.’","Liberal thinker David Goodhart says the snub by organisers is ideological .

The country’s biggest parenting charity has been accused of making women feel like failures if they do not have natural births. Each year the National Childbirth Trust holds classes for 80,000 new parents, which it says provides evidence-based advice on one of life’s most critical moments. But health experts and women’s campaigners say the charity’s guidance is inconsistent and champions natural births, leaving mothers who opt for aided deliveries feeling like failures. School of thought: Former President of the royal college of Midwives, Caroline Flint (left) said most women can deliver without any interference. Professor Vivette Glover, a child stress expert at London’s Imperial College, said the charity needed to ‘tighten up’ on the advice given by its practitioners at its 300 branches nationwide. ‘It seems apparent that in the classes very inconsistent advice is being given and it is not very evidence-based,’ she said. ‘They do seem to be rather proselytising for natural births and home births, which are lovely if they work, but can’t work for everyone. ‘We very much want to help people have unaided births, which is fine, but not everyone can. It is very important not to make people feel like failures if they can’t. ‘The feedback I get is that they get very varied messages if you actually go to classes. They ought to tighten up on the practice of their practitioners. ‘The reality is it’s often painful. Often for medical reasons people need caesareans. There should be more realism in the education in the classes to prepare women for the variety of things that can happen.’ Speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival, science writer Linda Geddes said that although the NCT covered all the bases about types of pain relief, the focus on ‘natural is best’ in many classes was unhelpful. Miss Geddes, the author of pregnancy book Bumpology, said: ‘The problem is there is this real disconnect between what the NCT as a central organisation says and does and what teachers do. ‘When I went to the NCT I thought it was an evidence-based course to guide me through birth. Actually what I was getting was distorted science. Maternity ward: The charity is said to champion natural births and home births so much so that women have said they feel like failures for having pain relief . Methods of delivery: Science writer Linda Geddes said the charity's courses gave a distorted sense of the science involved in childbirth and focused too much on natural births . ‘They basically make out that the birth experience is a choice and you can make decisions about the kind of birth you can have, when in fact it is often down to your body.’ She added: ‘There needs some accountability for teachers who are not following the NCT’s central line. Because people do trust them, and pregnant women are uniquely vulnerable and they are worried and want to do the best for their baby.’ The National Childbirth Trust, formed in 1956 as the Natural Childbirth Trust, has 100,000 members. Last year it stopped telling mothers to breastfeed after concerns that its ‘breastapo’ tactics were alienating some women, particularly among the working class. Earlier this year TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, whose two sons were delivered by caesarean, dismissed its advice as ‘b*******’ and called it ‘a politicised, dogmatic and scary organisation’. Last night the trust’s chief, Belinda Phipps, said: ‘Our NCT practitioners are trained to help expectant parents prepare for all eventualities in the lead up to their birth so they are best prepared to face any challenges if events turn out differently. ‘Courses cover all subjects that are important to expectant parents, but ultimately the focus of the class is determined by the members themselves. As a result, every NCT course across the UK will vary slightly in content.’","National Childbirth Trust accused of championing natural births in classes attended by 80,000 new parents in the UK .

The Ruins include the most complete amphitheatre in Britain and the only remains of a Roman Legionary barracks on view anywhere in Europe.

The swimsuit designer who drowned in the tub of a trendy Manhattan hotel wrote her accused killer lover a lengthy and very specific to-do list demanding he get his act together not long before she was killed. Swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay died in the posh Soho House hotel in 2010 and boyfriend Nicholas Brooks, 27, is now on trial for strangling and drowning her in the room’s bathtub. Her five-page list of to-dos was presented as evidence in the first day of court that their relationship had serious problems. The list, found at the 33-year-old slain designer’s desk, was read by her emotional older brother Patrick Orlando in State Supreme Court in Manhattan Friday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Drowned: Slain fashion designer Sylvie Chachay wrote exhaustive to-do list to her lover of 6-months, Nicholas Brooks, who stands accused of strangling and drowning Cachay soon after in a posh Manhattan hotel room . Her pleas: Brooks, pictured here at his 2010 arraignment and now 27, has been characterized as a layabout partier and Cachay's 5-page list included 'get a job,' 'wake up by 10,' and 'get out of bed.' ‘Get a job,’ read the list Cachay hand-wrote to Brooks. Brooks, who was 24 at the time of Cachay’s death, has been characterized by prosecutors, as well as the press, as a layabout who spent his nights partying and days sleeping. ‘Wake up by 10 am and get out of bed,’ continued the list. Orlando sobbed, reports the New York Post, and read intimate details of Cachay’s mere 6-month relationship with Brooks. ‘Hold me after sex and say sweet things. . .’ the list read. The exhaustive list continued. ‘Do not overuse paper towels…Take me on dates!...No random over drinking or drug use . . . Every now and then spray bug spray…Seriously clean up after yourself.’ Tearful: The lengthy list of to-dos was read by Cachay's brother on the first day of the trial of Brooks as the dead designer's mother, pictured here walking into court Friday, and father listened . One item in particular spoke to Cachay’s apparent desperation to stay with the man with whom she told a friend she had ‘crazy chemistry, but way too crazy.’ ‘Show me that I should be with you,’ she wrote. But other evidence shows something other than Brooks’ laziness finally broke Cachay’s desire to be with the younger playboy. Bearing the subject line, ‘F*** you,’ Cachay wrote Brooks a furious email just 18 hours before her demise, one the prosecution is using to prove his motive for murder. The email read: 'For the past six months I have supported you financially and emotionally. The fact that u cheated on me makes me sick and you will f***ing pay.’ And she told him exactly how she would be getting her revenge. Spurned: Cachay, 33, was found strangled in a bathtub at the exclusive Soho House Hotel, pictured, in Manhattan on December 2010 hours after threatening to turn Brooks into police for stealing her credit card . 'Get a job': Soon after Cachay wrote Brooks a 5-page list of ways he needed to get his act together, she was murdered and Brooks now stands accused of strangling her in a hotel bathtub. Just prior to the murder, Cachay wrote Brooks an email accusing him of cheating and threatening to get him arrested . ‘I am speaking with the credit card company and the police and I am going to tell them that I never allowed you to use my card. I don’t care. Have fun in jail.’ Less than a day later, she would be dead and half naked, face up in an overflowing bathtub on December 9, 2010. In the hours after Cachay was found, Brooks gave several statements to New York police that could be used against him in court. He told police, after returning to the hotel after 5am, that he had had left his girlfriend at the hotel to go out drinking the night of her death and that she was sleeping - not taking a bath - when he left. Several minutes after he was seen leaving on the hotel's surveillance cameras, guests began to complain about water leaking through the ceiling from the couple's room upstairs. Day in court: Cachay's mother entered court the first day of the trial of Nicholas Brooks in the murder of her daughter in the bathtub of exclusive Manhattan hotel Soho House . Motive? Brooks has been characterized by the prosecution as a partier who was living off of Cachay and feared losing his 'meal ticket' Prosecutors say Brooks’s DNA was found on the bathtub. Before Cachay’s brother’s tearful moment in court, her father gave the trial’s first testimony and instisted he daughter never took baths, only showers. ‘Listen,’ shouted the Peruvian-born Dr. Antonio Cachay during cross-examination by the defense, ‘I know my daughter since she was born!’ It is the prosecution’s argument that Brooks forced Cachay into the tub that night, fully intent on killing her. Miss Cachay, whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities, was found, according to investigators, with had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand when her body was found. Cut down: Cachay was a promising swimsuit designer for Victoria¿s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and her own label Syla before her 2010 murder . Gruesome: Cachay's body being removed from Soho House. She was found strangled with bite marks in a bathtub by staff after complaints of water leaks December 9, 2010 . On the night of her death, Cachay and Brooks checked into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left her there to die while he went to party. Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts. She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and lastly for Syla, her own label. Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault. Joseph was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes. The younger Brooks is facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted. The trial is expected to last for several more weeks. Heir apparent? Brooks, seen here just after his 2010 arrest, was the son of Joseph Brooks, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' but who killed himself in 2009 before he could stand trial for multiple sex crimes .","Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found strangled and drowned in a Soho House bathtub in 2010 .

Akousa Sakyiwaa is one of three accused of abusing . elderly dementia patients at Whipps Cross Hospital . A ‘violent’ nursing assistant put a . sheet over a dementia patient’s head and told her she was ‘the dead one’ during a campaign of abuse, a court heard yesterday. Akousa . Sakyiwaa, 38, had already prodded 87-year-old Joan Mussett’s breasts . and told her, ‘I’m young and my breasts are better than yours’, it is . alleged. When Miss Mussett . complained, Sakyiwaa pulled the bed clothes over the elderly woman’s . head and reportedly said: ‘See, you’re the dead one.’ John . McNally, prosecuting, said the health care assistant appeared ‘to have . the confidence to ridicule the idea that anything would happen to her’, . and accused her of acting ‘towards patients not as people but as things, . there to inconvenience her’. He added: ‘The proper role of a carer was apparently alien to her.’ Sakyiwaa . is one of three carers accused of abusing dementia patients at Whipps . Cross Hospital in Leytonstone, east London. Together with Annette . Jackson, 33, and Sharmila Gunda, 36, Sakyiwaa is charged with 14 counts . of neglect and ill-treatment and two counts of assault against 11 . patients in their care. The . patients they treated on the now-closed Beech Ward were described to the . jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court as ‘vulnerable’ and ‘elderly’ ladies, . many of whom suffered from dementia. Mr . McNally described the incident in which Sakyiwaa first ‘wobbled’ her . patient’s breasts before comparing them to her own and taunted her by . wrapping her in a bed sheet when she complained. In another incident, . Mr . McNally told how Sakyiwaa told the ‘chatty’ and ‘happy’ Miss Mussett to . ‘shut up’ because she ‘talked too much’. When she continued to mumble, Sakyiwaa grabbed her patient’s mouth and held it physically shut. Sakyiwaa . is also charged with ill-treating Louise Hodges, 92, calling her ‘lazy’ for not moving herself to the toilet and then slapping her bottom when . changing her soiled bed clothes as punishment. When . Miss Hodges complained to her on another occasion,  saying ‘You nearly . choked me’, Sakyiwaa’s response was, ‘Yeah, I should have.’ Jackson . is charged with five counts of ill-treatment of her patients, including . waking patient Kathleen Cavannagh by shouting ‘wakey, wakey, Grandma’ and smacking her in the side of her head with an incontinence pad. The . shocking behaviour of the three women came to light when they were . reported by a student nurse who was appalled by what she saw on the ward . during an eight-week placement in spring 2012, the court heard. Fragile . women were allegedly pulled into and out of beds by their gowns, and on . more than one occasion were slapped or ‘whacked’ for resisting. Co-defendants: Sharmila Gunda (left) faces two counts of ill treatment and one of assault by beating against three patient and Annette Jackson (right) faces five counts of ill treatment against five different patients . Giving . evidence yesterday, Lucy Brown said she was ‘speechless’ at what she . saw and that she ‘tried not to think’ about what was happening on the . ward. Miss Brown recalled one occasion when Sakyiwaa grabbed and . painfully twisted 92-year-old Lily Oliver’s arthritic knee. She . said: ‘She was really pale and quiet and she looked at me but I looked . away because I felt so bad, I couldn’t make eye contact with her.’ The incidents are alleged to have taken place from February 27 to April 30 last year on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London . John McNally, prosecuting, told the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court that the three women were responsible for looking after elderly female patients with various physical and mental conditions including dementia . Paul . Webb, defending Sakyiwaa, put to Miss Brown that the behaviour was . simply the actions of busy staff working in difficult conditions. But . Miss Brown said: ‘I have witnessed abuse . . . you cannot smack a . patient.’ Sakyiwaa, Jackson and Gunda deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

But unlike fellow LA celebrities such as Joan Rivers, Zoe claims her secret isn't Botox: instead, she says, it's a simple de-puffing eye pad that costs just £25. Skyn ICELAND's Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gel pads contain hydrolised elastin, a substance that is believed to have an instant toning and firming effect on the delicate skin under the eyes. Top tip: Super stylist Rachael Zoe says that the caffeine infused patches give you an 'instant eye lift' Fresh-faced: The 41-year-old mother of one is famous for her youthful looks and remains wrinkle-free . The pads are also infused with acetyl hexapeptide, which is said to have a similar effect to a low dose of Botox, and ginkgo biloba leaf extract, a natural ingredient thought to reduce puffiness. 'Like a caffeine jolt to the face, they top my list as a must-have beauty necessity, achieving the effect of an instant eye lift in minutes' revealed a clearly impressed Zoe. She added: '[They're] perfectly sized if you're on the go.' Zoe isn't the only A-lister to have revealed a liking for the cooling gel pads.

Refusal: Sergio Marchionne, Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, said the company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. Chrysler is refusing to recall 3million models deemed unsafe by a government agency . Car manufacturer Chrysler has refused to recall 3million vehicles after US government safety tests concluded there was a risk in certain models of deadly fuel tank fires. The problem, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) relates to the position of the fuel tank being close to the rear meaning collisions are more likely to cause fires. To date an estimated 51 people have died in car crashes that resulted in fires in Chrysler sport utility models, according to ABC News. After its own analyses, the NHTSA asked the company to voluntarily recall Jeep Grand Cherokees from 1993 to 2004 and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007. But in a rare move, the car manufacturer is refusing to cooperate. In a statement on its website, Chrysler said it 'does not agree with NHTSA’s conclusions and does not intend to recall the vehicles cited in the investigation'. 'The subject vehicles are safe and are not defective,' the statement said, adding its vehicles 'met and exceeded all applicable requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,' including tests pertaining to fuel-system integrity. The agency said in a letter to Chrysler, dated Monday, that the placement of the fuel tanks behind the rear axle, coupled with their height above the road, was a design defect. The NHTSA's analysis found that the Jeeps' fuel tanks can be hazardous when hit from the rear and leak fuel. They can cause fires if there's an ignition source, it said. Chrysler moved the fuel tanks on the Grand Cherokee ahead of the rear axle in 2005, and did the same thing with the Liberty in 2007. Chrysler's own analysis, from over 30 years of data, found the fire incidents which are the focus of this request, occur less than once for every million years of vehicle operation. This is comparable to other vehicles produced and sold at the time, the company said. Safe? The 2003 Jeep Liberty is one of the models the NHTSA has asked Chrysler to voluntarily recall . Not being recalled: Jeep Grand Cherokees from 1993 to 2004 (Jeep Grand Cherokee 1999 pictured) and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007 are both advised for recall, amounting to 1million vehicles . The car firm has been working with the NHTSA, sharing its data with the agency, on this issue since 2010, at the request of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group. 'We believe NHTSA’s initial conclusions are based on an incomplete analysis of the underlying data, and we are committed to continue working with the agency to resolve this disagreement,' the statement said. Sergio Marchionne, Chairman and CEO of Chrysler, added: 'The safety of drivers and passengers has long been the first priority for Chrysler brands and that commitment remains steadfast. 'The company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. All of us remain committed to continue working with NHTSA to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles.' While the NHTSA can order a recall, it will have to obtain a court order to enforce it, according to ABC News. Can makers usually agree to recalls, mainly to protect their public image. In the last three years, Chrysler has conducted 52 recalls.","NHTSA review concludes risk of fire if certain models are hit from the rear .

Martine Lapworth, 41, tried to pick up a child from school after bingeing on wine, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard . A ‘very drunk’ former teacher who drove to pick up a child from school after bingeing on wine has been spared jail. Martine Lapworth, 41, was nearly four times over the drink-drive limit when she tried to collect the youngster, a court heard. But staff at the school in Boothstown, Salford, were so concerned about Lapworth’s condition that they ordered her off the premises after a confrontation. Lapworth got into her VW Polo and drove off without the child following the incident at 3.30pm on May 23, Manchester magistrates’ court was told. Helen Veitch, prosecuting, said that shortly afterwards police visited Lapworth at her home in Worsley, less than a mile from the school, and found her in a ‘very drunken state’. When tested she gave a reading of 128 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. She told officers that she had been drinking while cleaning her home, and admitted downing a mug of wine as she washed her car later. Miss Veitch said an aggravating feature of the case was that Lapworth had intended to take the child in her car and would have done so but for the reluctance of the youngster and the intervention of school staff. Lapworth pleaded guilty to driving after consuming excess alcohol and was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment suspended for a year. She was banned from driving for three years. Magistrate Bruce Westwood said that the offence merited a jail sentence. He told her: ‘What you did crossed the custody threshold. 'You had drunk a great deal of alcohol but you have shown remorse and we intend to suspend the  sentence.’ William Birtwell, defending, said Lapworth was an alcoholic whose condition had had a ‘destructive effect’ on her life. She had lost her job and her marriage had broken down as a consequence of her drinking. She now lived on benefits and was receiving treatment for anxiety,  he added. Mr Birtwell said Lapworth had sought . help in the past from Salford Alcohol Services and had  re-engaged with . them for further support in recent weeks. Lapworth was banned from driving for three years and given a 12-week suspended prison sentence at Manchester Magistrates' Court . ‘She has taken a mature stance and shown a great deal of remorse,’ he said. ‘She has not tried to minimise the . seriousness of what she has done and this has been a steep learning . curve for her. I doubt if you will see her in court again.’ Lapworth, who left the court  in tears, was ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and an £80 surcharge.","Martine Lapworth, 41, 'was four and a half times over limit' when she drove to school .

Foolish: Mitchell Gough, 24, led police on a high speed chase through residential streets as he drove to his driving test in a powerful BMW . A learner driver led police on a high speed chase in a powerful BMW -  while travelling to his driving test. Plant fitter Mitchell Gough, 24, was pulled over by police officers as he travelled to the test centre in Gloucester. But a court heard that the father-of-one 'panicked' and decided to drive off at speed. During the pursuit, Gough raced around residential areas on the outskirts of Gloucester for eight minutes with police officers in pursuit. He sped through red lights without stopping and reached 70mph over speed bumps and in 30mph zones. Finally, he drove into a cul-de-sac where he jumped out of the moving car and ran off after it crashed into a parked vehicle. At Gloucester crown court, Gough, from Quedgeley, . Gloucester, admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop for the police, . having no insurance and having no MoT. He told the court he illegally drove the BMW - which he owns -  because his mother was unable to pick him up. When police officers - investigating reports of a stolen BMW  -  checked his number plates they found it related to another . car - Gough's father's Fiat, which made them suspicious. Judge . Jamie Tabor QC gave him a six month jail term suspended for a year and . banned him from driving for 30 months. Graham Wallis, defending Gough, told the court the day started badly for Gough when his mother - who had arranged to pick him up and take him to the test centre - rang to say she could not make it because her car had broken down. 'He knew he had a driving lesson at 7am, an hour before the test, and he took the impulsive and very foolish decision to drive himself to the centre,' said Mr Wallis. 'It is something that one couldn't really make up, but there you are. 'He was very anxious to take his test. I have asked him repeatedly to try to explain why he did what he did. 'There were two bad decisions. One was to get in the car at all and much worse was to take off when the police stopped him. 'It . is all the more ironic given that he is a man of good character who has . worked constantly since leaving school, has a regular job and leaves . home every morning at 6am for his work as a plant fitter. 'All he can say is that when he was . stopped he panicked and made a decision which was totally out of . character. It is baffling that he behaved in this way. Illegal: Gough was pulled over by police officers as he travelled to this test centre in Gloucester in a high-powered BMW . 'He wishes to say how very remorseful he is for what he has done.' Prosecutor Julian Kesner said police on patrol at 6.30am on April 11 had been told to look out for a stolen BMW. They saw Gough in his BMW and decided go check it. Gough was signalled to pull in and when the officers checked his number plates they found it related to another car - Gough's father's Fiat. As an officer was telling him to open the door and switch off the engine, Gough raced off and the patrol car went in pursuit. He sped through red traffic lights without stopping and reached 70mph over speed bumps and in 30mph zones. At one point, a 'stinger' was deployed by officers but Gough carried on driving until he turned into a cul-de-sac. He flung open the driver's door and jumped out before it collided with a parked car. Sentenced: At Gloucester Crown Court, judge Jamie Tabor gave Gough a six month jail term suspended for a year and banned him from driving for 30 months . Gough was then arrested and explained he had been on his way to take his driving test but knew that as a learner he should not have been driving alone. 'He explained to the police that as he didn't have anyone to take him to the test centre he was driving himself there,' Mr Kesner added. In sentencing Gough, Judge . Tabor said: 'Your explanation for being in that car that day is that you were off for a driving lesson and your test having been let down by your mother's car breaking down,' said the judge. 'That is a tall story but I am prepared to believe it for the purposes of sentencing today. 'This was an idiotic decision and you are now sensible enough to realise how idiotic it was. 'But that decision was nothing like as idiotic as the next decision you made, which was to drive off when the police officers caused you to stop. ' The way Gough drove was 'highly dangerous' to other road users and it was lucky it was such a quiet time of day, the judge said. Judge . Tabor also fined Gough a total of . £1,100 and ordered him to pay costs of £330.","Mitchell Gough was pulled over as he drove to test centre in BMW .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:19 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:48 EST, 5 June 2013 . One of the world's oldest motorists has been driving 88 years and has revealed he has no plans to give up driving soon. Aged 105, Bob Edwards, from Ngataki, is the oldest licensed driver in New Zealand. He was born before the first Model T rolled out of Henry Ford's factory in Detroit. Determined: New Zealand's oldest driver Bob Edwards, 105, stands in front of his red Mitsubishi in Ngataki, New Zealand . He learned to drive in a French car that had a lever instead of a steering wheel. And he's still on the road, only now in a red four-wheel-drive Mitsubishi. 'In fact, I don't think I'm old,' Mr Edwards says. 'Not really.' He has no plans to give it up, just as he . intends to keep working out every morning in his home gym, and to keep . regularly cooking meals for himself and his wife, who is 91. Long driving career: The first license Mr Edwards obtained. He grew up in England and he learned to drive in his uncle's car, a De Dion Bouton aged 17 . Still on the road: Mr Edwards' current licence - in New Zealand, drivers older than 80 must have their health and vision tested every two years to stay on the road . He's been involved in just one crash in his life and has received just one speeding ticket, a citation that still gets him riled up years later. When he broke his left hip three years ago, his doctors said to stop driving for six weeks but he didn't pay them much mind. After all, he says, he drives an automatic and only needs his right leg for that. In New Zealand, drivers older than 80 must have their health and vision tested every two years to stay on the road. Many countries in Europe and U.S. states have similar requirements. While stories about elderly drivers making mistakes or causing crashes often make headlines, it's young drivers who tend to cause the most damage. 'Older drivers, on a per-kilometer-driven basis, are involved in far fewer crashes than younger drivers,' said Andy Knackstedt, a spokesman for the New Zealand Transport Agency, which oversees driver testing. Keep on going: He has no plans to give it up, just as he intends to keep working out every morning in his home gym, and to keep regularly cooking meals for himself and his wife, who's 91 . He said that for many elderly people, retaining a license helps them maintain their independence, mobility and dignity. 'Our job is really to balance that with the need to make sure our roads are safe,' he says. According to Guinness World Records, the world's oldest driver was American Fred Hale Sr. who was on the road until his 108th birthday in 1998. Edwards drives three times a week to the store 15 kilometers (9 miles) down the road. He picks up groceries on Sundays and the newspapers on other days. Occasionally, he says, he'll drive farther afield, to a medical appointment or to visit friends. He grew up in England and he learned to drive in his uncle's car, a De Dion Bouton. Youth: Bob Edwards as a younger man, left and now in his home  in Ngataki, New Zealand . 'It was something new. Cars were just coming in,' Edwards says. 'I mean, it was just marvelous.' He got his first license in 1925 at age 17. Two years later, he saw a Salvation Army ad seeking young men to work on the farms of England's colonies. 'They told me Canada was very cold, Australia was very hot, but New Zealand, they said, was just right,' Edwards says. 'So I picked New Zealand.' He eventually bought a Dodge car, converted it into a truck and started transporting the fossilized gum of native kauri trees from Snells Beach in the north to the city of Auckland. Soon he was working 16-hour days and transporting butter, groceries and gas; he bought new trucks and employed a couple of drivers. Gas rationing during World War Teo effectively ended his business. For much of the rest of his working life, he captained tourist and car ferries, fibbing about his age so he could work beyond what was then the mandatory retirement age of 60. His wife, Lesley, stopped driving about 30 years ago. Her husband always took the wheel, anyway, and he will stay with it as long as he can. 'As far as I'm concerned, driving is a part of me,' he says. 'I mean, that was me. I was a driver. And I could drive anything. Anything at all.'","At 105-years-old Bob Edwards is the oldest licensed driver in New Zealand .

Dr Michael Reid has been ordered out of the vicarage he refused to leave after he was sacked as bishop for an extra-marital affair with a member of his congregation . A bishop who refused to give up his home when he was sacked for having an eight-year affair with a choir mistress has been ordered by a court to leave. Dr Michael Reid, 69, spent 30 years as senior pastor at the Trinity Church, in Pilgrims Hatch, Essex, before the affair with Sheila Graziano  came to light in 2008. The scandal rocked the church and its congregation and led to the sacking of the bishop, who had been married to his preacher wife, Ruth, for more than 30 years at the time. But, despite signing an agreement promising to leave the adjoining vicarage, when it actually came to moving time, the former Met Police officer refused to get out. Even when the church paid out £465,000 to buy him a new home to live in rent-free for life, Dr Reid refused to go, branding it a 'hovel', unfit for an invalid and right next door to a travellers’ camp. But now, after taking the case to the High Court, the church has won an order forcing Dr Reid to give up the vicarage, known as Testimony House, and hand it over for the use of the church’s new senior pastor. 'It’s a farce, there is no justice,' complained Dr Reid as he left the court following the hearing. The church’s barrister, Paul Adams, told the court it had been trying to get Dr Reid out of Testimony House since 2009. He had been dismissed a year earlier after news of the affair hit the headlines and he had lost an employment tribunal claim over it. 'Some four years later, he hasn’t moved out and is now running a new ministry from Testimony House,' said the lawyer. 'Dr Reid has long been dismissed from his employment and Trinity is trying to get back the immediately surrounding land, which is supposed to be used for the occupation by the senior pastor.' Mr Adams said the doctor had signed a consent order last year, promising to move out and into the new house which the church was going to buy for his use. Dr Reid's affair with Sheila Graziano (left) came to light in 2008. He is pictured right with Ruth, his wife of 37 years . But Dr Reid said he had no intention of moving out, because Testimony House was 'his', the court heard. It led to the church launching a claim for 'specific performance', a court order forcing the priest to do what he had promised. Dr Reid contested the application, . arguing that the consent order had been obtained by 'undue influence'. The church and those working for it had put undue pressure on him at a . time when he was ill from having had a heart attack and his wife had . recently died, he said. Ruling . in favour of the church, Judge Peter Leaver QC described Trinity as a . church based on 'traditional Christian ethics and strong family values'. 'The . arguments advanced on behalf of the defendant, Dr Reid, are without . merit, the defence he seeks to put forward is nothing more than a sham,' said the judge. 'It’s a . great shame that a man who has given a great deal to the church over a . lengthy period should now seek to resile from an agreement he entered . into, freely and with full consent. 'In the circumstances, therefore, I propose to grant summary judgment.' The former policeman was sacked from his position as bishop after the affair came to light in 2008 . The judge said Dr Reid would have to . apply directly to the Court of Appeal if he wanted to challenge the . decision or to have it delayed. Dr . Reid was made a bishop in Nigeria in 1995 and came under the media . spotlight for his leading part in protests against the BBC’s decision to . screen the controversial musical Jerry Springer - The Opera. He founded the church as the Peniel Pentecostal Church and was head pastor from 1978. He now runs What God Can Do Ministries.

A married teacher absconded to France with an ‘infatuated’ schoolgirl half his age as their four-month relationship was about to be exposed, a court heard yesterday. Jeremy Forrest, 30, pursued his ‘vulnerable’ pupil with ‘flirtatious texts’ in a ‘gross and long-term breach of trust’, a jury was told. He seduced her for sex at secret meetings at his house while his wife was out, in his Ford Fiesta and in budget hotels where they stayed as Mr and Mrs Forrest, it was alleged. Forrest also reportedly met the girl in a local crematorium. But this was no ‘Romeo and Juliet’ story, the court was told. When colleagues repeatedly warned Forrest against encouraging the girl’s ‘obvious infatuation’, he told ‘bare-faced lies’ and denied that anything was going on, Lewes Crown Court heard. He even telephoned the teenager’s mother to complain about the effect the ‘falsehoods’ could have on his career, the jury heard. But after police were tipped off, the couple fled to France in what was described as ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’. The court heard how the runaways spent a week in Bordeaux under false names and dyed their hair to avoid being detected. They were eventually found after eight days. The fact that the schoolgirl was ‘undoubtedly a willing participant’ in the alleged abduction was no defence, prosecutor Richard Barton said. He said: ‘This is not Romeo and Juliet. This is a 15-year-old with her own vulnerabilities and a 30-year-old teacher. ‘When parents send their children to school they quite properly expect those who teach their children to care for them properly. This is a case of gross and long-term breach of trust.’ Forrest began to pursue the relationship when his pupil was just 14, and while he was teaching at Bishop Bell Church of England school in Eastbourne, the court heard. Allegations: Forrest (pictured in Lewes Crown Court yesterday) began to pursue the relationship when his pupil was just 14 years old while teaching at Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, the court heard . The teenager had confided to friends at the start of 2012 that she had a crush on Forrest and during a school trip to Los Angeles in  February she had said she enjoyed seeing him in his swimming trunks. On the flight home, Forrest sat next to her and held her hand, apparently to help calm her during turbulence. The incident sparked gossip among other pupils, and two teachers spoke to Forrest to warn him to ‘keep his distance’. But he started exchanging messages with the girl on Twitter and later gave her his private mobile phone number so that they could text each other more ‘flirtatious, intimate and inappropriate’ messages in secret, the court heard. Pictures found on the schoolgirl’s phone included one of Forrest, apparently taken by himself, in his underwear, the court heard. It was also rumoured that Forrest, a keen amateur musician, had written a song about the schoolgirl, the court heard. The schoolgirl also began to turn up early to school to visit the teacher in his room, often with other friends to ‘provide cover’. Forrest started having sex with girl around the time of her 15th birthday, the court was told. She used to slip away from her home, telling her mother she was spending the night with friends, it was claimed. Going inside: On the flight home Forrest (pictured arriving at Lewes Crown Court yesterday) sat next to the schoolgirl and held her hand, apparently to help calm her during turbulence . But when confronted again by teachers . about their concerns, Forrest became upset, and cried ‘crocodile . tears’, asking why these ‘falsehoods’ were being spoken about him, the . court heard. He even . telephoned the schoolgirl’s mother, and in an ‘utter lie’ denied the . allegations, despite the fact he was having ‘clandestine meetings’ with . his pupil, the prosecutor said. After . police were tipped off about the relationship in September, an officer . and social workers went to the schoolgirl’s home and spoke to her . mother, who agreed to hand over her phone for analysis. When the schoolgirl heard what had happened, she immediately went to see Forrest and the pair made plans to run away. Mr . Barton said: ‘Earlier in the year, when they were in the beginnings of . their relationship, they had discussed running away together but only in . general and rather fanciful terms, in a sort of forbidden love. ‘Now it seemed a more realistic and tangible possibility.’ Trial: Jeremy Forrest (pictured yesterday upon his arrival at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex), 30, pursued the 'vulnerable' pupil for months, a jury was told . That . night the schoolgirl secretly packed a bag of belongings and took it to . school the following day. Forrest booked ferry tickets in his . name and the name of his wife. The . schoolgirl arranged to spend the night with a friend and Forrest later . turned up to pick her up looking ‘ashamed’, the court was told. He told . the girl’s friends that he was ‘very sorry that he had to take her . away’. On the way to Dover she phoned a friend and said ‘Me and Jezz are going north’ in an attempt to put anyone off their trail. Hearing: The fact that the schoolgirl was 'undoubtedly a willing participant' in the alleged abduction was no defence, prosecutor Richard Barton QC told Lewes Crown Court (file picture) in East Sussex . Minutes . after boarding the ferry, Forrest sent a final text to his wife saying: . ‘Don’t worry I’ll call you tomorrow’, before getting rid of his phone. He was later pictured on the ferry’s CCTV hand-in-hand with the . schoolgirl. After dumping . the car in Paris, they travelled by train to Bordeaux, south-west . France. When Forrest submitted a false CV to an English bar in the city, . the owner recognised him from online news reports and contacted Sussex . police, the jury was told. After . liaising with French officers, police set up a sting operation which . allowed police to arrest him as he arrived for a trial shift. The schoolgirl returned to Britain soon afterwards and he was later extradited home to stand trial. Forrest denies child abduction. The case continues.

She said: 'We . all miss her terribly, she was the centre of our lives, she did so much . for us all. We now need to think of all the happy times that we all had together.' Her father Raymond, 79, added: 'We are . pleased that Daniel Day, who drove Alice to her death, has received . punishment for the way in which he drove her car. 'Nothing . will replace her and we will never recover from losing her in a . completely unnecessary accident caused by his criminally irresponsible . driving.

Tragedy: The trial heard Day approached the blind bend in his girlfriend's convertible Mini Cooper at up to 80mph (file photo) In a letter to Recorder Jeremy Wright, Day expressed his remorse and said: 'I will never forgive myself'. In . excerpts read out by the judge, he said: 'I have so much guilt and no . respect for myself. I have brought terrible suffering to her family and . shame to my family.' Mr Hicks said he believes swifter action should be taken against dangerous drivers. 'Where . responsibility is clear the individual should be arrested immediately, . and their driving licence and passport removed,' he said. 'While . all Alice’s family were suffering in deep grief, particularly on the . anniversary of her death and over two Christmases, Daniel Day was . allowed to spend the time in the bosom of his family.

More than one in five offenders who commit a serious crime are let off with a caution . More than one in five offenders who commit a serious crime get off with a caution, official figures have revealed. They show police handed out more than 18,000 cautions for sexual offences and violent assaults in the last decade. Some 22 per cent of all burglars, rapists and other violent attackers in England and Wales were given cautions. A fifth of rapists and sexual offenders avoided court. And 28 per cent of people who committed a violent assault got off with a s2339828 lap on the wrist. Thieves had a 27 per cent chance of being handed a caution. Police also issued them to 40 per cent of fraudsters and 41 per cent of drug dealers or users. The shocking figures were prepared by the House of Commons library following a Parliamentary question by Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan. They will fuel concerns that police and public prosecutors are too overwhelmed to be able to properly punish serious crimes. The information, released by police forces across England, shows there were 992 cautions for ‘indictable only offences’ in 2011. These are crimes considered so serious that they are usually tried at a Crown Court. A staggering 232 of these were for sexual offences, 137 for violence, 269 for robbery and 18 for burglary. Since 2002, a total of 18,782 cautions were handed out for indictable offences. Over the last ten years, this means sex offenders were let off 2,018 times. There were 4,364 cautions for violent assaults, 4,204 for robberies and 2,143 for burglaries. A fifth of rapists and sexual offenders avoided court altogether, according to House of Commons figures . Conservative MP Priti Patel, a . campaigner against soft justice, said: ‘These are absolutely appalling . figures which confirm the public’s lack of confidence in the criminal . justice system. They help explain the high levels of reoffending. What . sort of deterrent is there for serious offenders? ‘We need to put dangerous criminals behind bars, get them off our streets and properly protect the law-abiding public.’ Police cautions are a way of sanctioning criminals without taking them to court. Last year more than 200,000 people who committed crimes were cautioned. The vast majority received a formal warning about their conduct. Tory MP Priti Patel said the figures were 'absolutely appalling' Some receive a lesser, informal . caution – a verbal warning given by an officer which does not count . towards a criminal record. A formal caution will normally be given at a . police station by  an officer – but is not classed as a conviction. It is administered when there is sufficient evidence for a prosecution and the subject has admitted guilt. Many are concerned they are being used to deal with repeat offenders or people who have committed a serious crime. Policing minister Damian Green said the Government  has ordered a review to examine the issue. He added: ‘Serious and repeat offenders shouldn’t expect to escape with a caution. ‘You do have to give that ultimate decision over to the police officer that is involved. ‘But in terms of having overall confidence in the system, cautions should only be given for low-level or first-time offences.’ However Mr Khan said: ‘The public rightly expect that those guilty of crimes like sexual offences, drug offences and criminal damage receive the proper punishment. Dishing out cautions for serious violent and sexual crimes is wrong. ‘It means serious criminals feel they have got away with it and sends out the wrong message. If we are to maintain the confidence of victims, witnesses and the British public then the use of this cheap alternative to proper justice has to stop.’","A fifth of sexual offenders avoided court, according to Commons figures .

And when Mr Potter  returned to the Dalaman river to gather evidence more than a week . after Marmaris Rafting had lost its licence, he found it operating . illegally. He and his wife were in court as the . panel of four judges found two owners and two employees of Marmaris . Rafting guilty of causing death by recklessness. They were each sentenced to five and half years in prison by the court in Mugla, South West, Turkey. Terry and Julie Potter fought a tireless campaign to bring those responsible for their daughter's death to justice . Mr Potter . said afterwards: 'We couldn't sit back and know that there were still . children going on these death traps - and more children were going to . get killed. 'Nothing can bring back Cerys, but I . want people to realise the risks that are being taken on that river, and . do all I can to prevent another death.' 'This should put a clear message that . they can't carry on killing British holidaymakers including children . and just get away with it. 'It is sad that it has taken the . deaths of nine holidaymakers on this rafting trip to get to this stage . but we do hope that they get the message now.' The men, all from Turkey, have 10 days to appeal against their convictions. For the official investigation at the High Court in Mugla, Terence and . Julie have orchestrated witness statements and even paid for one witness . to fly to Turkey to present her statement. In an interview before the beginning of the trial Mr Potter told how his daughter had been thrown from the raft. Four adults, four children and a . guide were thrown out of the front of the raft and carried downstream, . but the four children at the back – Cerys, James, Marcus and a friend . called James – were washed to a small gap between the rock and the steep . bank. 'The water was extremely deep. Cerys was dragged down by the swell of the water and drowned,' says Terence. Terry Potter (centre white t-shirt) whose daughter Cerys died in a Turkish rafting accident, goes back to Turkey to experience white water rafting on the same stretch of river where his daughter died . Tourists and guides pulled out the . three boys. When Marcus was found unconscious, an ambulance was called . and in the pandemonium that followed, few noticed that Cerys was . missing. Terence says: 'James shouted to everyone, 'Where's Cerys?' But one of . the guides said she had been taken to safety in another raft.' Julie adds: 'I've only seen James cry once. The night after the accident, he sobbed all night, saying, “I couldn't save her.” ' Only when the party, plus 53 other tourists who had been on other rafts . along the Dalaman, were taken to base camp, was it clear that Cerys was . missing. 'The alarm was raised loudest by  a holidaymaker in another of the . rafts,' Julie says. It was only then – an hour after the raft capsized – . that the guides returned. With the river  levels lowered, they found . Cerys. Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns said the Potter family had been instrumental in ensuring justice for their daughter. He said: 'I pay tribute to Terry and . July Potter who have been relentless in their pursuit of this process in . the interests of other holidaymakers. 'The family have channelled their . energy from such a terrible tragedy to ensure no-one else experiences . the same kind of incident. 'The scale of the sentence sends a . strong message that tourist operators cannot get away with their blatant . disregard of health and safety standards.'","Cerys Potter, nine, was on holiday with her family in south-west Turkey .

A man who fell from a bridge and was declared dead was taken to a mortuary - where staff were shocked to realise he still had a pulse. The unnamed man in his 40s was certified as dead by paramedics soon after falling more than 100ft from Kessock Bridge in Inverness - a notorious suicide spot - on Friday night. He was not examined by doctors, and was instead taken directly to the mortuary at Raigmore Hospital. Fall: A man was declared dead twice after falling from Kessock Bridge in Inverness, pictured . When workers found a pulse on the supposed corpse, they summoned paramedics once again, but attempts to resuscitate the man proved unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead for the second time. An investigation has now been launched into the worrying incident. The man had been in the water for 10 minutes when he was retrieved by a lifeboat and taken to Inverness Marina. Although an ambulance crew attempted to revive him, they believed they had failed. Rescue: Paramedics attempted to revive the man at Inverness Marina, pictured, but were unsuccessful . Last night Conservative MSP Mary Scanlon called for a thorough inquiry to be undertaken and the results made public in full. 'Any death is a tragedy for the family but the circumstances surrounding this death will undoubtedly raise questions as to whether this person could have perhaps survived,' she said. 'It is a shocking story for our ambulance service who have the highest level of training and exercise quality care every day of the year. It is so shocking because it is so rare to hear of anything like this. 'A very clear explanation and a very thorough inquiry must be carried out.' The Crown Office, which is responsible for investigating suspicious deaths, confirmed that it was involved in the case. 'The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit, is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments,' a spokesman said. Sign of life: Mortuary staff at Raigmore Hospital, pictured, found a pulse but could not save the man's life . Both the Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS Highland are conducting their own internal reviews. The ambulance service insisted that every effort was made at the scene to resuscitate the man before he was pronounced dead. 'Despite active resuscitation being carried out by the ambulance crew with no response, a clinical assessment was undertaken, including ongoing cardiac monitoring, and confirmed the patient had died,' a spokesman said. NHS Highland confirmed the alarm was raised when, while checking the body, mortuary staff became concerned there were 'potential signs of life'. It said in a statement: 'The Scottish Ambulance Service and an internal cardiac arrest team attended and resuscitation was immediately commenced. Despite this, evidence of ongoing signs of life could not be confirmed.' Police are not treating the death of the man, who was from the Highlands, as suspicious.","Man in his 40s fell from Kessock Bridge in Inverness on Friday night .

Kimberly Bradbury, 24, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, died in hospital after falling ill following a river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends . Police were today investigating whether a 24-year-old mental health worker who collapsed and died following a night out is the latest victim of an ecstasy-style drug called 'Dr Death', which is thought to have claimed at least 11 lives so far in the UK. Kimberley Bradbury fell ill following an 'all-you-can-drink' river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends. The group later headed to a house in the her home town of Ilkeston, Derbyshire - where it is believed she began convulsing. Kimberly was rushed to hospital in Nottingham but pronounced dead later. A 27-year-old man has now been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs in connection with Kimberly’s death. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today. But investigators will focus on whether Kimberly had taken PMA, a party drug already linked to the deaths of two young people in Derbyshire in recent months and as many as nine others across the country. The drug - nicknamed 'Dr Death' or 'pink ecstasy' - is sold to revellers for as little as £3 a pill, and can be up to five times as strong as standard ecstasy. A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said inquiries were continuing. He added: 'We want to speak to people who saw her before her death to find out what has happened.' Before collapsing in the early hours of Saturday, Kimberly had sailed down the river Trent in Nottingham on a cruise organised by a local company. Kimberly and her friends paid £34 for an all-inclusive barbeque and drinks package on the boat, and entry to a nightclub in Nottingham. But a spokesman for East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it received a call at 5.02am on Saturday saying a woman had collapsed after taking drugs. Kimberly arrived at Nottingham’s Queens Medical Centre at 5.51am, but doctors were unable to save her. Killer: PMA, known as 'Dr Death', has been linked to a number of deaths of young people in recent months . Last month, 16-year-old Ellie Jones was feared to have become the youngest victim of PMA after she collapsed and died at a house party in Warrington . Emotional tributes have been paid to Kimberley on Facebook. The drug is often shaped like a Love Heart, and is known as 'Dr Death, 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Mitsubishi Turbos' or 'Pink McDonalds', although its scientific name is para-Methoxyamphetamine. The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet, are usually pink or white and often have the letter 'M' printed on them. It is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill - dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy, but it is five times as strong and can cause the body temperature to rise dangerously. In addition, because it takes effect relatively slowly, revellers sometimes take multiple pills to speed up its effect. As little as a quarter of a tablet is enough to significantly increase blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rates. It causes paranoia and depression in people who use the drug a lot. When mixing PMA with alcohol its effects are increased, making it more likely for users to experience its negative effects. PMA is a class A drug, meaning it is illegal to carry it for personal use, give away or sell. One . friend wrote: 'She looks beautiful and that’s how Kimbo will always be . remembered! Thank you for some amazing memories from school right up . until our adult life.' Kimberly, whose parents are separated, lived with mum Alison. Her family, and boyfriend Craig Newton, 23, were too upset to comment. But a neighbour on the street said: 'She was a lovely girl, who was very popular and enjoyed life. It is a complete tragedy.' The deaths last December in Derbyshire of student Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, and 18-year-old Dale Yates were linked to PMA. In April, Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, were found at their home at Macclesfield after it is thought they took the drug. And last month, 16-year-old Ellie Jones was feared to have become the youngest victim of PMA after she collapsed and died at a house party in Warrington. The pills - often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and stamped with a McDonald’s-style M - are made from a different amphetamine from that used in ecstasy. And they take longer to take effect - meaning revellers often take several and unwittingly give themselves a fatal overdose. Deaths in Canada, Norway and Denmark have also been linked to the drug. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Kimberley Bradbury fell ill after 'all-you-can-drink' cruise and nightclub trip .

The gadget starts to say that it is 'full' when it's at 90% - a difference that can cost users 1.2 hours' usage. The reason, says ZDNet, is that the formula used to calculate when the device is 'full' is slightly out - a safety mechanism used by Apple to prevent people overcharging their gadgets. The battery in the new iPad is 1.7 times bigger than the one in iPad 2 - and the difference means the new gadget misreports whether it is fully charged or not . All iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches misreport whether they are full - albeit at a slightly higher level around 97%, ZDNet claims. But with the new iPad's enormous battery capacity - 1.7 times bigger than iPad 2 - the slight difference in the formula used to calculate when it is 'full' makes a noticeable difference to the battery life. Ray Soneira of monitoring firm DisplayMate says that the difference is measurable on the new iPad. The display gives a claimed battery life of 10.4 hours, whereas the real figure is 11.6 hours - and the difference can leave users thinking the device is fully charged when in fact it's not. Soneira also claims that users who attempt to charge new iPad while using it could be in for a surprise - it can take up to 20 hours. Apple's iPad uses a much larger amount of power than its predecessor, largely due to the demands of its Retina screen . The problem should be easily fixable via . a software download - often used by Apple to fix battery glitches and . other teething difficulties with gadgets. His measurements lend weight to earlier complaints on Apple forums that the device has shorter . battery life and painfully long charging times. DisplayMate claims that the huge increase in power demands is due to the density of pixels on the new screen. The LED backlight needs a huge amount of power just to shine through the high density of transistors in the panels. ‘The . power consumption of the LEDs is 2.5 times that of iPad 2, and the . battery is 1.7 times larger - if you run your new iPad at full . brightness, the battery run time is less because you only put in 70 . percent more battery but you're using 150 percent more power,’ Raymond .

Michael Gove’s new GCSEs  will restore rigour and rein in ‘rampant’ grade inflation, he said yesterday. Teenagers will be made to study more British history and classic literature by authors such as Austen, Dickens and Wordsworth. And they will be expected to show a far greater grasp of punctuation and grammar. Confirming the biggest exam shake-up for a generation, Mr Gove said new GCSEs to be taught from September 2015 will be ‘more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous’. The Education Secretary told MPs that even Labour admitted grades had been inflated during its time in power. There was now ‘widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,’ he added. ‘Young people in this country deserve an education system that can compete with the best in the world, a system which sets – and achieves – higher expectations.’ His reforms prompted complaints from teaching union leaders, while other critics expressed concern that the Government had cast doubt on the achievements of pupils who will take the current GCSE over the next two years. But Mr Gove insisted an over-reliance on coursework had ‘corrupted the credibility of grades’ and warned that so many students were now achieving As and A*s that employers could not differentiate between the brightest. Labour agreed there was a need to reform exam grades, but defended the use of coursework. The new-look GCSEs, which have yet to be named but are being nicknamed ‘Gove Levels’, will include  no coursework except in a small number of areas such as science practicals. The focus will return to exams at the end of the course. They will be graded from eight to one, with eight the highest, replacing the current A to G system. In English literature, candidates will read whole texts including a Shakespeare play, Romantic poetry and modern verse, a 19th century novel and 20th century fiction. Exams will ask candidates to evaluate seen and unseen texts. English language will require extended writing to explain, argue and describe events and 20 per cent of marks will be awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar, compared with 12 per cent at present. The new history exam will feature a minimum of 40 per cent British history, up from 25 per cent at present, and require pupils to show a basic understanding of chronology. Pupils will have to undertake at least one piece of in-depth study covering either the Medieval period (from the year 500 to 1500), Early Modern period (1450 to 1750) or Modern period (1700 to the present day). At least a quarter of the course will cover the history of the wider world. Mr Gove won unlikely support from Left-wing firebrand Diane Abbott yesterday – leading him to declare that he was ‘in love’ with her. During Commons exchanges after the Education Secretary outlined his new GCSEs, Miss Abbott said: ‘Do you agree with me that an emphasis on rigorous education and an emphasis on attaining core academic subjects is not, as is sometimes argued, contrary to the interests of working class children and black and ethnic minority children? ‘On the contrary, precisely if you are the first in your family to stay on past school leaving age, precisely if your family doesn’t have social capital, precisely if you don’t have parents who can put in a word for you in a difficult job market, you need the assurance of rigorous qualifications and if at all possible core academic qualifications.’ To howls of laughter, Mr Gove replied: ‘I am in love. You are absolutely right. If I had been a member of the Labour Party, I would have voted for you for leader.’ Miss Abbott stood for leader in 2010. Mr Gove is from a working class background himself. A Tory source said Miss Abbott’s comments indicated there was a wider division in the Labour party on education policy. In maths, there will be greater emphasis on solving unfamiliar problems by drawing on a range of mathematical skills and concepts. Teenagers will have to use integers, decimal fractions and simple, proper and improper fractions as well as powers, roots and reciprocals. In biology, students will need to demonstrate they can understand cell biology, including the growth and development of cells, as well as electron microscopy, including the nucleus, plasmids and chloroplasts. They will also learn about stem cells, enzymes, the human circulatory system, the development of medicine, photosynthesis, eco-systems and human reproduction. And in chemistry, they will have to answer questions on atomic structure and the Periodic Table; the properties of metals; bulk and surface properties of matter including nanoparticles; chemical equations; acid, alkalis and the pH scale; recycling; greenhouse gases and changes to climate over time; and agricultural productivity. Education minister Elizabeth Truss said current exams were ‘not fit for purpose’. She added: ‘For too long we have pretended that students’ results are getting better, whereas actually all that has been happening is that exams have been getting easier and there has been a race to the bottom between exam boards. We need to stop that happening now.’ But Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: ‘Pupils and parents will be concerned by the uncertainty that Michael Gove has created around GCSEs. ‘We need changes to assessments in schools that will strengthen rigour and reflect the best ways of testing skills and knowledge. ‘Encouraging more shallow learning of facts alone will not help young people to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow.’ Mary Bousted, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, condemned the ‘haste with which Michael Gove is pushing through huge simultaneous changes to both exams and the curriculum’. And Brian Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘Simply making exams harder does not guarantee higher standards or mean that students will be prepared for a job at the end of it.’","Mr Gove said new GCSEs will be more challenging and ambitious .

Once, no classic afternoon tea was complete without a plump slice of Victoria sponge. These days, you are more likely to find a single muffin or cupcake on your plate. Britain’s taste in cakes is changing with individual treats like muffins and cupcakes more popular than the Victoria sponge, researchers say. New research by consumer analysts Mintel reveals that volume sales of small cakes - 139 million kilograms in 2012 - have now overtaken large cakes (116 million kilograms last year). Analysis of the UK cake market reveals that volume sales of small cakes grew by 19 per cent between 2011 and 2012, to reach a market value of £492million in 2012. However, things have gone a little stale for large cakes, with volume sales shrinking by three per cent over the same two year period - down from 120 million kilos in 2011 to 116 million kilos last year, with a market value of £390million. And it seems there is further scope for growth in small cakes, as today, nearly one in four Brits who eat or buy cakes say they would like to see more cake sold in individual portions. Emma Clifford, senior food analyst at Mintel, said: 'The proliferation of sharing formats in other categories such as chocolate confectionery and biscuits has spurred cake manufacturers into action, with new product development in small cakes easily dominating the market.' 'The fact that the market share of small cakes - such as muffins and cake bars - has now exceeded that of the larger variety, reflects the role smaller cakes have forged in modern snacking lifestyles.' While over the past couple of years Brits have gone crazy over cupcakes, the new research reveals muffins are now getting a slice of the action. Over the last two years, sweet muffins have enjoyed the sweetest growth rate in the cake and cake bar sector, with a 55 per cent volume increase. Fall: Sales of large cakes have shrunk by three per cent over a two year period . Ms Clifford added: 'The rapid growth in volume sales for sweet muffins can be partly attributed to the prevalence of mini muffins tapping into the bite-size trend and sharing occasions.' The study also found Brits are increasingly turning to baking their own cakes at home. Home baking in general seen a revival, driven by the economic downturn and the popularity of TV cooking shows such as The Great British Bake Off, with market value up by 59 per cent between 2007 and 2012 to reach an estimated £1.7billion last year. However, despite the high popularity of cakes - just six per cent of Brits haven’t eaten a cake or cake bars in the last six months - health concerns and cost reasons remain high on the public agenda.","Cupcakes and muffinsare becoming more and more popular .

Jailed: Mark Cox, 22, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to burglary, possessing a CS gas weapon and possessing a police uniform today . A police officer’s son who broke into a women's house and stole 50 pairs of knickers has been jailed for three years. Mark Cox, 22, stole a set of house keys belonging to former school friend Emma Pinches, 21, after attending a party at her Northampton home in February. The hospital porter then used the keys to let himself in to the property while Ms Pinches was out and steal her underwear. The call centre worker became suspicious when she gradually noticed items of lingerie were missing over the next couple of weeks. She only suspected Cox may be behind the thefts when she received a text from him on March 2 to ask whether she would be out with her boyfriend that evening. Police then searched Cox’s home in Northampton and found ‘vast quantities’ of women’s underwear under his bed. Officers also discovered CS gas spray as well as a police helmet, handcuffs, jacket and stab vest. Last month Cox pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, one count of possessing a weapon designed for the discharge of CS gas and possessing a police uniform. Magistrates heard he bought the police uniform as 'memorabilia' because his father and grandfather were both police officers. He has since received counselling in a bid to overcome his underwear addiction. Cox was jailed for three years at Northampton Crown Court today. Rumbled: Ms Pinches suspected Cox was responsible for the underwear thefts after he texted her asking if she would be going out with her boyfriend one night . Sentencing him, Judge Rupert Mayo, said: 'I take a very dim view of this crime. I’m not concerned about your fetish or what you stole. 'I’m concerned about how you planned this burglary by taking her keys, and how you made sure she was out when you visited her home. 'The fact this was almost a stalker-like relationship makes it altogether worse.' Cox had told the court he bought the police uniform items off eBay to use for role play sex with his ex-girlfriend. He admitted he had an underwear fetish and regularly bought knickers and bras from Ann Summers. Prosecuting Jenna Allen told the court: 'When police searched his home they found vast quantities of ladies underwear. 'Ms Pinches' DNA was found on the knickers, after Mr Cox claimed he bought them all himself. Underwear: Defence said that the actions were driven by a fetish but that he had not vandalised the property . 'When Mr Cox was questioned by police, he claimed he worked as an officer with Thames Valley police. 'This later turned out to be a lie, showing there are sinister undertones in his behaviour.' At an earlier hearing magistrates were told the items were stolen at a time when Cox was being 'driven by a fetish' for women’s underwear. Defending, Maxine Krone said: 'He knows he has done wrong and has never offended before. 'Despite his crimes I can’t see how he would pose a threat to anyone'. Speaking after the sentence Ms Pinches said: 'I’m shocked - it’s a longer sentence than I was expecting. 'I do feel sorry for his family but he deserved to be punished for what he did to me. From what police told me, Mark wasn’t remorseful when he was initially caught. 'I don’t know how he feels now, but hopefully this sentence will teach him a lesson and he won’t try it again. 'No one else should have to go through it. The idea of it still creeps me out. I’m just happy it has all come to a close and I can move on with my life.'","Mark Cox, 22, stole house keys from Emma Pinches, 21, during a party .

Apple will email all Australian buyers of its new iPad to offer them a refund, a lawyer for the company said on Wednesday. The move came after the nation's consumer watchdog accused it of misleading advertising over one key aspect of the product. The new tablet is labelled as '4G' - but the connection won't work in many countries, due to differing mobile networks. In the UK, for instance, the tablet is labelled as 'Wi-Fi + 4G', despite the fact there is no compatible network to connect to. Passers-by look at Apple's new iPad in a window display at an Apple store in Sydney. The company has now said it will issue a refund to all buyers . The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken legal action to ensure Apple makes consumers aware its third-generation iPad cannot connect to a 4G mobile data network in Australia due to technical incompatibility. Apple promoted its third-generation tablet as the iPad with Wifi+4G, but Australia has only one 4G network, operated by Telstra Corp, which operates on a different frequency to the 4G on Apple's new iPad. The consumer watchdog argues that Apple's advertising was misleading and wants the court to force the company to correct its ads, refund any affected buyers and impose penalties. Apple barrister Paul Anastassiou told the Federal Court in Melbourne that the company would send emails to all Australian buyers to date, offering the refund. The new iPad was launched in stores only this month. The new tablet is labelled as '4G' - but the connection won't work in many countries, due to differing mobile networks . While the iPad is the clear market leader, and the new version with its faster chips, fourth-generation wireless and a sharper display is only expected to cement Apple's lead, the company has hit some bumps in the road. It is waging a battle with a Chinese technology company, Proview, that claims to own the iPad trademark in China, in a long-running dispute that has threatened to disrupt iPad sales in one of its fastest growing markets.     In Australia, a small but a key launch market for Apple products, it lost a bid to ban the sales of Samsung Electronics Co Galaxy tablet late last year.     That battle is part of bruising global patent war between the two firms that spans about 30 legal cases in 10 countries.","Adverts are 'misleading' says consumer watchdog .

Cecil Coley, 72, was playing dominoes with a friend after closing time at his son's florists shop when four masked men burst in, opened fire and demanded the takings . A disabled pensioner has today revealed the terrifying ordeal he faced as he stabbed a gunman to death in self defence during a bungled robbery. Cecil Coley, then 72, was playing dominoes with a friend after closing time at his son’s florists shop when four masked men burst in and demanded the takings. A violent struggle then followed which culminated in Mr Coley stabbing raider Gary Mullings in the heart with a knife he used to cut flower stems. Mullings, 30, staggered outside and was found lying in the street outside. Neighbours tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead in hospital with two stab wounds to the chest - one collapsing his lung. Mr Coley - known as Roy - was later arrested on suspicion of murder but was freed without charge after he said he killed the gunman to save himself and acted in lawful self defence. Today at an inquest into Mullings’ death a statement from regular churchgoer Mr Coley, now 74, who was too unwell to attend the hearing was read out detailing his torment. 'I was terrified and intimidated and fighting for my life” he said in his statement. 'I was jabbing the knife wildly in the air. I was so scared I just pushed out and jabbed the knife again. 'I was thinking to myself that I was finished, that this was the last moment of my life. 'I was feeling weak and nervous and I passed out and collapsed.' The hearing was told the incident occurred at 9.40pm on July 26, 2011, as Mr Coley who helps his son run the Feathers Frills and Flowers shop in Old Trafford, Manchester playing dominoes with 67-year old Neville 'Carl' Marrett in a back room. The robbers, who were wearing balaclavas, were reportedly armed with at least two hand guns and possibly a knife as they demanded cash. Mr Coley who is registered disabled and takes 32 prescription tablets, said in his statement: 'I heard a knock at the front door and when I opened it both of us were overpowered. 'I couldn’t force them off and they came in and both of us were hit and I was hit with either a first or the butt of as gun. A man went through my pockets shouting, ""where’s the money, where’s the money""? The man took £260 from his pocket before kicking Mr Coley in his side and around the hip area. The man then pulled off the pensioner’s wedding ring and a ring belonging to his daughter he was wearing on his little finger.

'I said to him, ""if you want more money, lift me up"". There was the shop counter on my right side that had some flowers on it and a knife.' Mr Coley picked up the knife, which was used to cut flowers and prepare food and continued to walk into the rear room and switched on the light. 'I held the knife discretely by my side, the man didn’t see me pick up the knife. 'He was stood by my side as I got to the till. I pulled open the cash drawer and I spun round to the man.'

The new laws will allow people to record conversations with tradesmen to ensure they stick to their word . Families should record conversations with tradesmen on their mobile phones to ensure they stick to their word, a minister said yesterday. Jo Swinson said new laws would allow customers to enforce verbal agreements struck with everyone from builders to hairdressers. Unveiling a consumer bill of rights, she said openly recording a conversation would make it easier to resolve disagreements with rogue traders that can end with court deadlock. ‘Information from the person giving the service in advance of signing up to it, even if that information is verbal, will effectively be seen as part of the contract,’ she added. ‘It could be anyone providing a service, such as a photographer, hairdresser or a tradesman. 'If they say they will do something within a particular period of time, or they will use a particular brand of paint, type of wallpaper or brand of tiles – if they say something about how it will be done –  you will be able to hold them to that.’ Asked whether consumers should record conversations, the Lib Dem business minister said: ‘They certainly could. People will decide what the best way is for them. ‘It is significantly easier for consumers to do these days with the capability that people have on their phones. The legal force will be there, it doesn’t need to be in writing. ‘It will be the case that something that is verbal does have to be abided by.’ Miss Swinson also suggested customers might want to confirm quotes by email. The new bill of rights brings together a raft of more than 30 pieces of legislation under a simplified regime that ministers claim will give better protection to the public and give respectable businesses an advantage over rogue traders. Openly recording conversations will help resolve disagreements with rogue traders that can end up in court . Government claims law will give respectable businesses an advantage over rogue traders . Shoppers using the high street or online stores will have a ‘no quibble’ right to return a faulty item and get a refund within 30 days. This is an added layer of help for consumers on top of the Sale of Goods Act which, in theory, gives some protection for up to six years after purchase. Where a shopper accepts a repair or replacement and this then fails, they will be entitled to a full refund, rather than being fobbed off with repeated repairs. There will also be new protection related to the purchase of digital downloads, such as films streamed over the web, games, apps and other software. Where these downloads do not work for some reason, the consumer will be entitled to a replacement or refund under laws which are expected to come into force by the end of next year. Miss Swinson claimed the changes would benefit the economy to the tune of £4billion over the next decade, in terms of securing refunds for consumers and supporting honest traders. ‘The whole point of the bill is to help the economy by creating confident consumers,’ she said. ‘Where you have people who are empowered and know their rights they are more confident about making purchases. Competition can flourish, new entrants can come into the market, and that is all good for the economy.’ Where traders, businesses, retailers and others fail to abide by the new laws, consumers will be able to seek help from  Citizens Advice and trading standards units or take a legal case themselves to the county court. Miss Swinson added: ‘For too long the rules that apply when buying goods and services have been murky for both consumers and businesses. Miss Swinson (pictured) claimed the changes would benefit the economy by £4billion over the next decade . ‘It is about time consumers knew what . their rights are and businesses have clearer information on what is . expected of them when problems inevitably do arise.’ Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said: . ‘Today’s proposals are a welcome development, but streamlining existing . rules won’t be enough without urgent, strong, new tools for customers to . get fair treatment. Regulators should name and shame businesses which . refuse to put right bad practice so that customers know who they can . trust to treat them fairly.’ However, . business leaders said the idea of people following traders around and . recording their conversations was a recipe for conflict. ‘This has problem stamped all over it,’ said Robert Downes, of the Forum of Private Business. ‘The . idea that conversations would need to be recorded for a particular part . of the consumer rights bill to work suggests it needs more thought, and . no doubt most consumers and service providers alike would agree. It’s . hardly practical or realistic for either party to accept.’ Brian .

Stripped of his honour: James Crosby, the former HBOS Chief Executive, has had his knighthood cancelled after a scathing report into his handling of the financial crisis . Former HBOS chief executive James Crosby has been stripped of his knighthood after a scathing parliamentary report into his handling of the banking crisis. Mr Crosby asked to have the honour removed after the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards claimed he was the 'architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster' in his handling of the bank. The decision to cancel his knighthood, bestowed on him back in December 2006, was . announced in the London Gazette. The Gazette, the official journal of record, said: 'Letters Patent dated 11 June 2013 have passed the Great Seal of the Realm cancelling and annulling the Knighthood conferred upon James Robert Crosby on the 6 December 2006 as a Knight Bachelor.' Following the commission's report back in April, Mr Crosby announced he would give up 30 per cent of his £580,000-a-year pension and stood down from roles with catering firm Compass Group and private equity firm Bridgepoint. He was given a knighthood after leaving HBOS in 2006, but following the report said he believed 'it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal'. Responding to the report in April he said it made for 'very chastening reading'. He added: 'Although I stood down as CEO of HBOS in 2006, some three years before it was taken over by Lloyds, I have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened.' He added: 'I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS.' For a knighthood to be withdrawn, the Honours Forfeiture Committee has to make a recommendation to the Prime Minister, who then passes it on to the Queen for a decision. Honour: Mr Crosby had originally been given a knighthood after leaving HBOS back in 2006 . Shamed: Former RBS head Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his involvement in the financial crash last year . Whitehall sources had said earlier this . year that mandarins would have no choice but to recommend that the Queen . remove honours from bankers in charge during the financial crash. Whitehall's Forfeiture Committee stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood last year. It was understood that the Forfeiture Committee would consider the honours of Sir Victor Blank, former chairman of Lloyds bank, who presided over the takeover of HBOS and that of Lord Stevenson, the former HBOS chairman. The Banking Commission ruled that responsibility for the near-collapse of the bank ‘lies particularly with Lord Stevenson’. While he cannot be stripped of his peerage by the committee, the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk. But insiders admit it will be ‘much more difficult’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking. So far Peter Cummings, head of HBOS corporate banking from 2006 to 2008, is the only man to have been punished over the HBOS scandal. He was fined £500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the City.","James Crosby was made a knight back in 2006 when he left HBOS .

Lecture: Rt Rev Richard Chartres, 65, accuse his own generation of taking too much from society . Baby boomers should take less from society because they are now ‘absorbing’ too much taxpayers’ money, a senior Church of England cleric has said. Those born in the post-war period are the ‘fortunate generation’ because they enjoyed huge improvements in standards of living during their lifetimes, said the Bishop of London, the Rt Rev Richard Chartres. But there were ‘severe questions’ about the share of government spending allocated to the group, he said. At the age of 65, the Rt Rev Chartres . is a classic member of the very group he criticises, but he said that . many now believe the best times could be ‘behind us’. He said the first years of the 21st . century had seen a dramatic transformation and likened them to the . unstable period in the run-up to the First World War. Making his comments in a lecture . organised by religious broadcaster and publisher Premier Christian . Media, the Bishop added fuel to the debate over whether the elderly can . be protected from further austerity cuts. Last week Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls . sparked fury when he announced that Labour would cap state pensions. Bishop Chartres took as his theme for the lecture the meaning of William . Blake’s Jerusalem, arguing that the poem’s image of building a better . future ‘in England’s green and pleasant land’ could still be achieved, . but not necessarily in purely economic terms. ‘Much of that is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which I belong in ways which raise questions – severe questions – of intergenerational equity,’ he said. ‘The world is being rebalanced: economic . and military’s power is shifting eastward, the period of unchallengeable . western hegemony after 250 years is at an end. ‘Previous periods marked by the rise of new powers have led to war. Lucky generation: The Rt Rev Chartres said baby boomers are the fortunate ones thanks to the huge improvements in life quality they have enjoyed . ‘We only have to think back to the disastrous European civil war of 1914-1918 to realise the truth that even the interdependent character of the modern global economy is no insurance against mutually destructive conflict.’ He added that in current times the Government’s financial clout remains ‘massive’, with public spending rising from around £26 billion in 1997 to nearly £695 billion last year. But figures published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last year showed that while elderly people make up about 15 per cent of the population in the leading economies, they account for 40 per cent of all public social spending. Welfare for British pensioners accounts for about £110 billion of the total £165 billion spent on benefits. In contrast to the bishop’s views, a study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by Saga, concluded that over-65s are aiding economic recovery. It argued that, rather than draining resources, the ‘silver pound’ pumps billions into the economy.","Rt Rev Richard Chartres accuse baby boomers of 'absorbing' tax money .

Intel employee Harvey Palacio said the 'prank' left him feeling ashamed and upset him so much that he cried on the way home. According to the lawsuit filed in Albuquerque, co-workers at the Rio Rancho Intel plant laughed hysterically as they kicked him during the stunt in August.

It's normally an end of year rite of passage that departing pupils get their own back on their teachers for years of homework and detentions. But a group of teachers at a school in Devon decided to turn the tables this year and play a practical joke on Year 11 students on their final day of school instead.

A U.S. drone strike killed a Taliban commander, his deputy and eight others in northern Pakistan, intelligence sources and tribal leaders said Thursday. Maulvi Nazir Wazir, also known as Mullah Nazir, an important commander from the Wazir tribe, was killed on Wednesday night when missiles struck a house in Angoor Adda, near the capital of Wana, South Waziristan, near the Afghan border, seven intelligence sources and two residents from his tribe said. His deputy, Ratta Khan, was also killed, three sources said. Strike: A U.S. drone has reportedly killed a leading Taliban commander in Pakistan, according to intelligence sources . He favoured attacking American forces in Afghanistan rather than Pakistani soldiers in Pakistan, a position that put him at odds with some other Pakistan Taliban commanders. Nazir was wounded in a bombing in November, widely believed to be as a result of his rivalries with other Taliban commanders. Shortly after the bombing, his Wazir tribe told the Mehsud tribe, related to Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, to leave the area. The Pakistani army has clawed back territory from the Taliban since launching a military offensive in 2009. Intensified drone strikes have also killed many senior Taliban leaders, including Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, in 2009. Drone strikes have dramatically increased since U.S. President Barack Obama took office. There were only five drone strikes in 2007, peaking at 117 in 2010, then down to 46 last year. Debate: U.S. drone strikes are a source of intense controversy in Pakistan. Some say they infringe the nation's sovereignty, while others point out they have crippled Taliban numbers . Most of the strikes hit militants although civilians have also been killed. Rights groups say that some residents are so afraid of the strikes they don't want to leave their homes. Data collected from news reports by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism say that between 2,600-3,404 Pakistanis have been killed by drones, of which 473-889 were reported to be civilians. It is difficult to verify civilian casualties because Taliban fighters often seal off the sites of drone strikes immediately. Some Pakistanis say the drone strikes are an infringement of their national sovereignty and have called for them to stop. Others, including some residents of the tribal areas along the Afghan border, say they are killing Taliban commanders who have terrorised the local population. The strike took place in south Waziristan, a troubled tribal area along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan .","An unmanned drone is believed to have killed Mullah Nazir in Pakistan .

Trial: Jeremy Forrest (pictured yesterday upon his arrival at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex), 30, pursued the 'vulnerable' pupil for months, a jury was told . The runaway schoolgirl described to a court yesterday how she fell in love with her ‘mature’ teacher Jeremy Forrest, seven months before they fled to France. The 15-year-old told how they exchanged flirtatious messages and a clear ‘atmosphere’ developed when they were together before they started a sexual relationship. But she told police how she ‘panicked’ last September, when her mother called to say the police and a child protection officer had come to visit her home. She said: ‘I didn’t want to face it basically seeing my mum when she found out. ‘Obviously he didn’t want to get caught. He was scared.’ Her former teacher Forrest wept and held his head in his hands in the dock as the video of a police interview with his pupil conducted shortly after she returned home from France was played to Lewes Crown Court. The schoolgirl told how a crush turned to love on a school trip to Los Angeles in February last year. She said: ‘I was drawn to him, I was attracted to him. We had similar interests. 'I hadn’t felt the way I felt about him before, that’s why I use the term falling in love. There was an attraction from me to him without him having to do anything.’ The schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in court as a witness via video link. Wearing a plain sleeveless black dress, she fiddled with her necklace as the judge spoke to her. It was the first time her former maths teacher had seen her since he was arrested by police in France last September, after they spent eight days together on the run. Forrest briefly raised a smile as he watched the schoolgirl telling interviewers how she initially didn’t like him when he first taught her when she was 13. Hearing: The girl spoke of their relationship at Lewes Crown Court (file picture) in East Sussex . She began to develop a crush on the teacher – who she called ‘sir’ or ‘Mr Forrest’ at school – around Christmas 2011, she said. ‘That was when it was more than a teacher-pupil crush, I found him attractive,’ she said. ‘I had had boyfriends and crushes on other people but he was older, it was a lot more different, I liked that he was older and mature. I think I kind of led it but he followed up to what I was doing.’ She added: ‘You could feel the atmosphere... it was pretty obvious.’ During the trip to LA she was embarrassed by him seeing her in her bikini in the swimming pool. She also told how he gave her a hug and that they held hands on the flight home because they were both frightened. She began paying more attention to him in class and the pair began texting each other increasingly amorous messages last year. ‘But we didn’t start a relationship until the end of May and we decided that it was what we wanted to do. ‘Around this time, we began to meet up outside of school. There were a few times when I would go over to his house ... and after that things got even more serious.’ ‘The school warned us a bit but never really did a full investigation. Things stayed like that until the summer holidays when we began a sexual relationship.’ She said at that point they began to plan seriously running away, something they had previously discussed but only as a ‘fantasy’.

Growing change: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson wants rules relaxed on GM crops for UK farmers . UK ministers want the European Union to relax restrictions on the cultivation of genetically-modified crops. Owen Paterson wants to make it easier for farmers to grow GM plants for human consumption, even though critics lambast the idea as ‘Frankenscience’. In a speech next week, the Environment Secretary is expected to cite growing scientific evidence that GM foods are safe, as well as surveys showing a relaxation of the rules would be supported by the majority of farmers. Mr Paterson will say there is a need for a new approach to GM to ensure Britain ‘is not left behind’ in agricultural science. However, any such move will be in the teeth of much opposition. A survey by YouGov out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology, while 35 per cent opposed it. Yesterday science minister David Willetts supported calls for controls on GM crops to be weakened. ‘We believe GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable, by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,’ he said. Whitehall sources told the Independent newspaper that ministers are increasingly concerned that the potential moral and ethical benefits of GM are being ignored by costly and bureaucratic licensing regulations. A twelfth of global arable land is under GM cultivation, and ministers fear Britain – the birthplace of the 18th century agrarian revolution that modernised the world – faces being left behind. GM crops can be engineered to grow faster, increase their resistance to weeds, pests and pesticides, produce extra nutrients or survive harsher weather. But while they are widely grown in the Americas, they are effectively banned in the UK and Europe where they are considered on an extremely strict case-by-case basis. Ministers argue that GM technology has . the potential to improve crop yields, help the agricultural industry and . provide benefits to human health through vitamin fortification. It . could also help combat diseases such as ash dieback and help in the . development of new medicines. Genetically improved? Minsters believe GM crops could 'make agriculture more efficient' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the UK . A source told the Independent: ‘The point about GM is not simply about food production. ‘There are wider potential environmental and economic benefits to the technology both in the UK and internationally. ‘What we want to do is start a dialogue within Europe on GM, based upon the science.’ Mr Paterson wants to build support in Brussels for a relaxation of GM rules and hopes powerful Germany will come on side. But others will be opposed. In April, Poland became the eighth EU member state to ban the cultivation of GM crops. A poll of more than 600 British farmers found a considerable shift in their stance toward GM over the past year. Nearly a third said they would be more likely to grow the crops now than they were a year ago. Martin Haworth of the National Farmers’ Union said: ‘Farmers are becoming more and more aware that climate change doesn’t mean a gradual rise in temperatures but rather a stream of extreme weather events. GM technology is one possible way of mitigating this.’","Environment Secretary wants UK farmers to grow GM crops for humans .

It's officially British summertime and for millions of women that means the inevitable countdown to baring it all on the beach. But struggling into a skimpy bikini after a winter of comfort food and covering up is rarely a moment women look forward to. It comes as no surprise then that the classic one-piece has been voted the number one swimsuit of choice this summer, with over half of insecure Britons opting for the more conservative style. Covering up: Like Rihanna, Sam Faiers and Amy Childs, over half of Brits are now opting for one-piece swimsuits over bikinis this summer . In comparison just 8 per cent of us would dare to bare in a two-piece bikini style and a tiny 1 per cent of Brits confirm they wouldn't brave it with a thong shaped swimsuit. One fashion e-tailer has seen sales of swimsuits soar 80 per cent over the last month as the warm weather hits and holiday fever sets in. Following in the footsteps of celebrities such as Rihanna and Amy Childs, sales of one-piece swimsuits on Bay.co.uk Fashion Gallery have shot up by 110 per cent, with sales of tankinis not far behind, rising 60 per cent since this time last month. The research also found that over a quarter of Brits only start preparations to perfect their beach bodies just a few days ahead of their holiday and over a third of Brits admitted that they carry out no preparation at all. So despite what your gloating Facebook friends are telling you, only one in 10 kick start their beach body routine six months or more before hitting the pool side. Style watch: The triangle/halter neck bikini is most favoured in Wales, while a bandeau style would most likely be spotted on Londoners . According to a 'Swimwear map of Britain' put together by the e-tailer, Yorkshire . ladies are the most daring when it comes to their choices in swimwear, . with one in five of those surveyed from the area opting for a push-up . bikini. Women from Northern Ireland are the most conservative, with a massive 73 per cent opting for a one-piece style. The triangle/halter neck bikini is most favoured in Wales with 17 per cent opting for this look. A bandeau style is most likely to be spotted on Londoners with one in 10 women from London choosing this option.

A new non-invasive blood test to detect whether or not an unborn baby has Down's syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy is to go on trial next month (file picture) A new non-invasive blood test which can reliably detect whether or not an unborn baby has Down’s syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy is to go on trial at two hospitals next month. The test, which analyses a baby’s DNA present in its mother’s blood, could be an improvement on current screening methods, according to researchers. Down’s syndrome, and other chromosomal disorders characterised by an additional chromosome, is currently tested for between the 11th and 13th weeks of a pregnancy, using an ultrasound screen and a hormonal analysis of the pregnant woman’s blood. Those deemed at high risk of carrying a baby with such a disorder are then given a definitive test involving chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. But this is invasive and carries a risk of miscarriage. A study carried out at the Harris Birthright Centre at King’s College London is the first to look at the feasibility of screening for the chromosomal disorders - known as trisomies - using foetal cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a pregnant woman’s blood. The tests, carried out at the 10-week stage on 1,005 pregnancies, were found to be more sensitive at detecting Down’s syndrome and returned fewer 'false positive' results than the initial combined tests usually carried out between the 11th and 13th weeks. Researchers found that up to 98 per cent of cases of Down’s syndrome could be detected. Invasive testing was then needed for confirmation in less than 0.5 per cent of cases. The test costs £400 so will not be offered across the NHS at this stage, but it will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at two hospitals - Kings College Hospital in London and Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. The test will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at King's College Hospital, in London (pictured), and Medway Maritime Hospital, in Kent . The authors of the study, published in the Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology journal, said: 'This study has shown that the main advantage of cfDNA testing, compared with the combined test, is the substantial reduction in false positive rate. 'Another major advantage of cfDNA testing is the reporting of results as very high or very low risk, which makes it easier for parents to decide in favour of or against invasive testing.' The authors added: 'Screening by cfDNA testing contingent on the results of an expanded combined test would retain the advantages of the current method of screening, but with a simultaneous major increase in detection rate and decrease in the rate of invasive testing.'","New non-invasive test to go on trial at hospitals in London and Kent .

A new virus which has claimed the life of a second Briton is potentially more deadly than Sars, scientists have warned. The mysterious coronavirus, which has emerged in the Middle East, attacks the respiratory system and was only identified six months ago. So far there have been 11 deaths - with the World Health Organisation this week saying a second British man has died. Killer: A new virus which has claimed the life of a second Briton is potentially more deadly than Sars, scientists have warned. This image shows a microscope image of coronavirus . New research has found that unlike Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome  - the new virus affects many different organs in the body, killing cells extremely quickly. Speaking to the South China Morning Post,  microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung,  said if the virus mutated further it could cause a deadly pandemic. 'It could be more virulent [than Sars]', he said. 'The Sars coronavirus infects very few human cell lines. But this new virus can infect many types of human cell lines, and kill cells rapidly.' Seventeen cases have been announced . since the WHO issued an alert in September last year, most of them with . links to the Middle East. This week it was announced that a 73-year-old man from the United Arab Emirates had also died from the virus. He was flown to hospital in Munich last week and died on Tuesday, the World Health Organisation said. Source: Experts believe the coronavirus originated in bats . It also confirmed a British man with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan had died in a British hospital. The source of coronavirus is not known, but experts believe it originated in bats. Animals which could host the virus include monkeys, pigs and even rabbits . Scientists say the new virus is from the same viral family that causes the common cold and also triggered the outbreak of Sars which swept the world from Asia in late 2003, leaving 775 dead. Symptoms of coronavirus - which doctors say spreads rapidly around the body within 48 hours of infection - include severe breathing difficulties, fever, coughing and pneumonia. It can also attack the kidneys, according to health experts. In a statement issued late on Tuesday, the WHO said it was encouraging governments to watch for all severe respiratory infections and especially for any unusual patterns they might take. For the moment, the U.N. agency said, it was not advising countries to set up any special screening for the virus at entry points and was not recommending any of the travel or trade restrictions introduced during the SARS epidemic. The first reported case of infection by the previously little-known virus was a Qatari man who had also traveled to Saudi Arabia. Earlier in 2012, a 60-year-old Saudi national was believed to have died from it.","New research shows coronavirus affects many organs and kills quickly .

If you're hoping to lose a few pounds before you hit the beach in a bikini this summer then you might want to ditch regular trips to High Street coffee chains. Many shop bought coffees have the equivalent calories to a fast food feast, with Starbucks in particular a repeat offender against dieters. And while many may now be up to speed with how calorific hot drinks such as full fat lattes are, they may find they're not doing their waistlines any favours by instead opting for a cold drink from coffee shop summer menus. A sensible swap? Ditching a full fat latte, left, for a strawberry frappuccino with cream won't make you slimmer this summer . It may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but a large Starbucks strawberry frappuccino contains  a massive  459 calories because of its cream and full-fat milk content. That's almost as many calories as a McDonald's Big Mac. The Starbucks peppermint mocha frappuccino in verdi with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories. Costa's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories -  that's the same as having a MacDonald's burger and fries. Meanwhile, Caffe Nero's whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories, the equivalent to two large glasses of white wine and some pretzels. Sales rising: More people are now turning to herbal teas as a healthier alternative to coffee shop drinks . Now that brands are under more pressure to display nutritional information on their products, consumers are becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees. As a result, sales of herbal tea is on the rise as people see them as a healthier alternative for a hot drink. Herbal tea brand Higher Living has reported an increase in sales of 36 per cent in recent months, with customers citing that they were keen to embrace the low calorie benefits of teas. Most herbal teas only have a trace amount of calories while some flavours rarely exceed 35 calories. A Higher Living spokesman said: 'It's clear that ordering your favourite coffee can have a significant . impact on your waistline. 'Herbal teas bridge this gap between calories . and taste. There's nothing wrong with the occasional coffee shop splurge, but keep . calories low by mixing things up once in a while.' A study by Mintel found that herbal tea drinkers believed they gained numerous health benefits from their choice of refreshment over coffee consumers. More than half (57 per cent) said that drinking herbal tea helped them to relax while 64 per cent believe in their health benefits.","Large Costa strawberry cooler is 653 calories .

A Tory MP accused of trying to lure his lesbian housemaid into a threesome with his wife yesterday told of his relief after her 'cynical' case was thrown out. Richard Drax said the allegations had been 'extremely stressful' for him, his wife Elsebet and his four children with his ex-wife, the sister of former Royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock's case was dismissed after her former lover told an employment tribunal that she had falsely accused a previous employer of sexual assault and had been awarded £16,000. The 'manipulative' serial litigant also received two other payouts after bringing claims against former bosses in the last 15 years. In her latest claim, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock, 53, alleged the MP for South Dorset and his wife groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her as they drank wine in the sitting room of their Elizabethan stately home. She told the tribunal she felt  suicidal after the alleged assault and claimed that a few weeks later she was told to leave the house and her £24,000-a-year job. She also claimed Mr Drax, 55, used to walk around the house naked in front of her. The MP, a Harrow-educated former Coldstream Guards officer whose full name is Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, had always denied the claims and described himself to the hearing as a 'courteous gentleman'. Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock's claims were dismissed after her former civil partner – who is currently divorcing her – told the tribunal she believed the housekeeper had  'concocted' the stories for financial gain and to 'satisfy a grudge'. Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock said her former partner's attitude when she was in a dispute was one of 'I have an issue with that person, how can I get them back?' She told the hearing that before they had met her partner had brought a successful claim involving an alleged sexual assault against her former employer, the Royal Mail. 'She admitted to me that she had been in a tussle of some sort with a colleague and that she had invented an allegation that he had touched her breast,' she said. Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock received £15,960 after bringing the claim. She received another payout from the Royal Mail after alleging she had hurt her shoulder after the company overfilled a bag. 'In fact it was an injury she had had for many years which was unrelated to her work,' her civil partner said. She also received a £3,000 payout from a store where she was working after yet another dispute. Her ex-partner added said she believed the case against the MP was another attempt to 'extract money from an employer'. 'Humiliated': The woman claiming for sexual discrimination, wrongful . dismissal, unfair dismissal and unpaid holiday pay - all of which were . rejected by the chairman of the panel . 'She knows Mr Drax is a public figure and I imagine she thought he was in a strong position to secure a settlement from him as I know she has done from previous employers. 'I believe she concocted the allegations in her claim to cause embarrassment to Mr and Mrs Drax and their family in the expectation that she would receive a financial settlement.' The tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the Drax ancestral home, Charborough House, after previously working there as a groom. She claimed that in August she was in the staff kitchen when Norwegian-born Mrs Drax invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room. She claimed when she entered the MP and his wife began to French kiss. Mrs Drax then started rubbing her crotch and her husband grabbed her thigh, she alleged. The housekeeper said she was 'extremely upset and scared' by their approaches and fled to her room and barricaded the door. A few weeks after the alleged assault, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock said the MP told her she had an hour to leave, citing a series of fallings out she had had with other members of staff. She said he gave her £300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up. The housekeeper's former partner told the tribunal that when she spoke to her after she had been sacked by the MP, she boasted she had something 'big' on him. The housekeeper had claimed sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and for unpaid holiday pay. Mr Drax wiped his eyes as he sat holding his wife's hand as chairman of the panel, Judge Roger Peters, rejected her 'utterly incredible' claims. Outside, the MP said. 'This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue. 'These allegations have been extremely stressful for my wife and I, and my children, and my family. We are all now relieved that we can put these matters behind us.' A spokesman for the Forum of Private Business said: 'It is wrong that one angry employee can humiliate her boss, even if there are no grounds. 'We think the culture needs to change where somebody is to blame – and that is always the employer.' Outside court, the housekeeper's solicitor said: 'We are sorry that she has not been able to prove her case at this tribunal and we will be considering an appeal.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Richard Drax said the allegations had been 'extremely stressful'

Esther Williams, the swimming champion-turned-actress who starred in glittering and aquatic Technicolor musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, has died. She was 91. Williams died early on Thursday in her sleep, according to her longtime publicist Harlan Boll in Los Angeles. Following in the footsteps of Sonja Henie, who went from skating champion to movie star, Williams became one of Hollywood's biggest moneymakers, appearing in spectacular swimsuit numbers that capitalized on her wholesome beauty and perfect figure. Picture perfect: Ester William with Howard Keel in the 1955 movie Jupiter's Darling. She passed away today, aged 91, according to her Hollywood publicist . 'Million-dollar mermaid: Williams with Jimmy Durante in the 1947 film This Time For Keeps . Bathing beauty: With her good looks and athleticism, Esther Williams was popular with movie audiences in the 1940s and 50s . Such films as Easy to Wed, Neptune's Daughter and Dangerous When Wet followed the same formula: romance, music, a bit of comedy and a flimsy plot that provided excuses to get Esther into the water. The extravaganzas dazzled a second generation via television and the compilation films That's Entertainment. Williams' co-stars included the pick of the MGM contract list, including Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Red Skelton, Ricardo Montalban and Howard Keel. When hard times signaled the end of big studios and costly musicals in the mid-'50s, Williams tried non-swimming roles with little success. After her 1962 marriage to Fernando Lamas, her co-star in 'Dangerous When Wet,' she retired from public life. Life in the movies: Esther Williams met her husband Fernando Lamas (right) on a film set . She explained in a 1984 interview: 'A really terrific guy comes along and says, ''I wish you'd stay home and be my wife,'' and that's the most logical thing in the world for a Latin. And I loved being a Latin wife - you get treated very well. There's a lot of attention in return for that sacrifice.' Going swimmingly: All of Miss Williams film hits involved getting the former swimming champ in a bathing suit . She came to films after winning 100-meter freestyle and other races at the 1939 national championships and appearing at the San Francisco World's Fair's swimming exhibition. As with Judy Garland, Donna Reed and other stars, Williams was introduced in one of Mickey Rooney's Andy Hardy films, Andy Hardy's Double Life (1942). She also played a small role in A Guy Named Joe before Bathing Beauty in 1944 began the string of immensely popular musical spectaculars. Among them: Thrill of a Romance, Fiesta, This Time for Keeps, On an Island with You, Take Me out to the Ballgame, Duchess of Idaho, Pagan Love Song, Texas Carnival, Skirts Ahoy, Million Dollar Mermaid (as Annette Kellerman, an earlier swimming champion turned entertainer), Dangerous When Wet, Easy to Love and Jupiter's Darling. Williams in a bathing suit became a favorite pinup of GI's in World War II, and her popularity continued afterward. She was a refreshing presence among MGM's stellar gallery - warm, breezy, with a frankness and self-deprecating humor that delighted interviewers. She laughed as much as anyone over an assessment by Fanny Brice, the original Funny Girl: 'Esther Williams? Wet, she's a star. Dry, she ain't.' After leaving MGM, she starred in two Universal dramatic films, The Unguarded Moment and Raw Wind in Eden. Neither was successful. In 1961 Lamas directed her last film, The Magic Fountain, in Spain. It was never released in America. When she published her autobiography in 1999, she titled it The Million Dollar Mermaid. Esther Jane Williams grew up destined for a career in athletics. She was born August 8, 1921, in Inglewood, a suburb southwest of Los Angeles, one of five children. Pick of the co-stars: Esther Williams on screen in Dangerous When Wet in 1953 with Tom and Jerry .

While there, she was spotted by an MGM producer and an agent. She laughed at the suggestion she do films that would popularize swimming, as Henie had done with ice skating. 'Frankly I didn't get it,' she recalled. 'If they had asked me to do some swimming scenes for a star, that would have made sense to me. But to ask me to act was sheer insanity.' She finally agreed to visit MGM boss Louis B. Mayer, and recalled that she took the job after her mother told her: 'No one can avoid a challenge in life without breeding regret, and regret is the arsenic of life.'

After Lamas' death in 1982, Williams regained the spotlight. Having popularized synchronized swimming with her movies, she was co-host of the event on television at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. She issued a video teaching children how to swim and sponsored her own line of swimsuits. 'I've been a lucky lady,' she said in a 1984 interview with The Associated Press. 'I've had three exciting careers. Before films I had the experience of competitive swimming, with the incredible fun of winning. ... I had a movie career with all the glamor that goes with it.

Night Stalker Richard Ramirez turned 'a shocking shade of green' before his death from liver failure on Friday. Ramirez, 53, spent 24 years on Death Row after a spree of demonic murders in California. The serial killer, who left satanic signs at murder scenes and mutilated victims' bodies, died reportedly after 'sitting up in his bed doing stretches' just the day before at Marin County Hospital. Ramirez, 53, had been taken from San Quentin's death row to a hospital before his death. Richard Ramirez, center, with attorneys, Randall Martin, right and Daro Inouye, left in a San Francisco courtroom Oct. 5, 1990. Ramirez died on Friday. He was convicted of 13 killings . Richard Ramirez, center, known as the Night Stalker, is pictured at his murder trial in 1985 . A source told the New York Post that the self-proclaimed Satanist's skin turned to the ghastly hue on Thursday and was up and moving around his hospital bed. 'He was the color green,' said the Post's source. 'He looked like a green highlighter pen.' It appears the killer was showing signs of severe jaundice in the final throes of his illness. The skin and eye whites of a sufferer can change color when bilirubin - a yellow substance - builds up in the body. Bilirubin is formed when haemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen round the body, breaks down. It is usually flushed out of the body in urine or faeces, but a build-up of the waste product in the bloodsteam can lead to the change in skin color. Ramirez had been housed on death row for . decades and was awaiting execution, even though it has been years since . anyone has been put to death in California. He was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders, five . attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries, which . terrorized Southern California in 1984 and 1985. His charges included . rape, sodomy and oral copulation. Though he died of liver failure, the exact cause of the ailment has not been released due to federal patient privacy laws. At his first court appearance, Ramirez raised a hand with a pentagram drawn on it and yelled, 'Hail, Satan.'

Their two dogs were found in such poor health they had to be put down by the RSPCA. The images show the weak and starving dogs in their last days. A veterinary examination rated both dogs' body condition at the worst possible . Serious neglect: One of the dogs cowers in the corner of a wooden kennel with no bedding . The dogs, Ebby, a collie cross and Kizzy, a Rottweiler, had been living in an outdoor kennel and pen with no bedding and surrounded by faeces. RSPCA officers found Ebby to be so emaciated and riddled with arthritis that she was unable to stand. Kizzy had a piece of bone wedged in her mouth which prevented her from eating, causing a tetanus infection. A veterinary examination rated both dogs' body condition at level one; on a scale of one to nine with one being the worst. Emaciated: The dog has a protruding ribcage and matted fur . The dogs were said to be in severe pain from arthritis. Their muscles were so wasted, they struggled to stand . Kevin Campbell, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said that when inspectors arrived at the couple's home they found Kizzy in a 'collapsed and almost rigid state'. He said: 'The dog was struggling to breathe; it would die without immediate vet's attention.' Mr Campbell said that officers returned to collect 16-year-old Ebby, who was later found to be suffering from an organ ailment known as Cushing's disease. Mr Campbell said: 'She (Ebby) would have been in severe pain and had muscle wastage and arthritis. 'She should have been on pain relief long before the vet saw her.' The dog would have died within a few days.' Unclean: The dogs had been living in poor conditions. Mr Sams said when they tried to put bedding in the kennel it would just get shredded . Mrs Sams, who appeared tearful, said she had not noticed the piece of bone wedged in Kizzy's mouth and thought that Ebby was just old. Mr Sams, said that both dogs had been eating well and that when they tried to put bedding in the kennel it would just get shredded. He told the court that he always cleaned out the dogs' living area, but had been in London for several days before the inspectors visited so had not been able to do it that week.

But it took only seconds for the two towers of the Haitian Hotel to be reduced to rubble. The five star hotel, one of the oldest in its province, was considered elderly by modern standards and was ordered to make way for a younger model. It was demolished this morning before rush hour in a controlled explosion so it would not damage neighbouring buildings in Qingdao in China's eastern Shandong province. Scroll down for video . The five star Haitian Hotel in Qingdao was demolished at 5am today before the rush of the morning commute . The hotel's two towers collapsed on themselves following the detonation of explosives . At 27 years old, the Haitian was considered to be elderly by modern building standards so has been blown up to make way for new developments . For more videos, please go to Youku.com and Ku6.com . Residents were kept well away from the demolition by a 200m exclusion zone around the former hotel as a safety precaution. The detonation of the explosives was planned to beat the rush hour traffic, happening between 5am and 6am today. A five foot-wide trench dug six feet deep reduced the impact of shockwaves from the blast, according to Best News. Explosives were carefully positioned around the building made sure the towers collapsed on themselves, keeping things as neat as possible. The hotel had more than 600 rooms overlooking the sea before its closure and had last been renovated in 2003, according to eLong.com. Guests could play tennis on the . hotel's own courts or swim in its pool before enjoying massages and spa . facilities. They could choose from Chinese, Korean, Japanese or Western . cuisine, the site said. The towers stood 26 and 14 storeys high respectively over Qingdao in Shandong province, eastern China . The demolition of the hotel buildings has left a gap in the Qingdao skyline but they will soon be replaced by new developments . When it's not possible to knock a tall building over into an empty space, explosives experts have to plot devices at specific points around the building to make sure it collapses into its own footprint. The blasts on the building's support structure make levels crash down on top of each other. Planting explosives at some of the higher levels helps the building to break into smaller pieces on its way down. This leaves a pile of rubble, which is easier to clear away. Often, the workers will ensure the internal support columns are destroyed first, so the outside walls fall into the centre and minimise damage to surrounding buildings. To prepare for the blast, walls that don't bear a load are usually removed. Sometimes workers may try to make support walls weaker by hitting them with sledgehammers. Dynamite stuffed into holes takes care of concrete, while steel structures need an explosive called RDX, which explodes at up to 27,000ft per second, according to How Stuff Works. Once a safety cordon is in place, it's time to detonate, where all that preparation results in blasters needing only seconds to bring the building down. A team of explosive experts planned the blast so that other buildings in the area would not be affected . Dirt and dust from the explosion clouded over the site, where traffic measures kept people away for safety .","The five star Haitian Hotel in Qingdao, eastern China, was reduced to rubble in seconds this morning .

Countless celebrities have gorged on creepy crawlies and bizarre sea food as part of torturous tasks on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. But . what was once viewed as something of a punishment may become a culinary treat if Ángel León's new menu is anything to go by. The chef from a tiny beachside village near Cádiz in Spain has created a new menu based on his life-long obsession with the ocean. His main ingredient? Plankton. Would YOU eat this? A chef (R) from Spain has introduced a new 21-course tasting menu using plankton (L) as the main ingredient . While plankton is most commonly known as a mealtime treat for fish and whales, Ángel León has created a 21 course tasting menu based on the sea-based bacteria, which he is serving up at his Michelin-starred restaurant for a tasty 105 euros. Unsurprisingly, plankton isn't recommended for human consumption and even León has made himself sick when cooking with it in the past. Speaking to Modern Farmer about his bizarre culinary experiment, he said: 'Ever since I started cooking, plankton has been on my mind and it has always been a challenge to recreate its flavors for my dishes.' The self-proclaimed 'Chef of the Sea' teamed up with scientist Carlos Unamunzaga back in 2007 to begin cultivating plankton. Experimentation: The self-proclaimed 'chef of the sea' believes that plankton have a vital role in the food chain and make the fish that eat it tastier. (R) An example of one of his quirky seafood dishes . León reveals that the secret to culinary success is to keep the alga lyophilized (freeze-dried) and then bound with sterilized sea water just before served to keep it fresh. Plankton are any organisms that live in the sea and can't swim against a current . They are a vital food source for fish and whales . These organisms include drifting animals, archaea, algae, or bacteria . Many plankton are microscopic in size but some are as large as jellyfish . One of his new signature dishes is Alkalinity- a recreation of oyster and lemon but his quirky interpretation replaces the oyster with plankton. León's experimentation's with plankton have led him to champion its role in the food chain because he believes fish that eat plankton have a fuller flavour. Feeding fish with plankton also puts less pressure on the environment. And León isn't stopping at just plankton. The adventurous chef is determined to open our tastebuds to a new variety of fish, including species that are usually thrown back into the ocean called 'bycatch.' He added: 'I’ve always been obsessed by the sea and I have been on many different kinds of fishing boats. 'It was on one of them that I was struck by the amount of fish that were thrown into the sea for not having a trade name, which led me to start working to bring these poor ""no-name"" fish to haute cuisine.'","Ángel León has created a 105€ tasting menu based on the bacteria .

The Church of England yesterday expressed deep concerns over David Cameron’s plans to overturn centuries-old laws that govern succession to the throne. Senior bishops share the worries of the Prince of Wales that legislation to give princesses equal rights to princes in line of succession is rushed, risky, and could lead to unintended constitutional crises. Concern in the Church centres on the Prime Minister’s plan to remove the 312-year-old ban on members of the Royal Family from marrying Roman Catholics. Monarch and clergy: The Queen with former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams last year. The Church of England yesterday expressed deep concerns over plans to overturn centuries-old laws . Even though the Coalition’s Bill stipulates that the monarch must be Anglican, a Roman Catholic married to the monarch or an heir to the throne must, if they follow the doctrines of their church, bring his or her children up as Catholics. That raises the prospect that an heir to the throne would be raised as a Catholic. Leading clergy believe the planned changes will bring confusion and complication to the historic rule that the King or Queen must be a member of the Church of England in order to become its Supreme Governor on  taking the throne. Reforms that undermine that principle threaten the established status of the Church and could ‘unpick the constitution’, they said. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said yesterday: ‘The reported concerns of the Prince of Wales need to be listened to very carefully. We must not have any ill-thought-through proposals because of the potential to upset a delicate constitutional balance. ‘The Government’s instincts to allow female heirs to succeed are wholly right but to avoid any unintended consequences of the proposals for the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church there must be much greater consultation and discussion.’ Officials at Lambeth Palace, where the Right Reverend Justin Welby takes over as Archbishop of Canterbury next month, said there had been talks with ministers over the issue. How yesterday's Mail covered the story . They also pointed to remarks made by Dr Rowan Williams, who stepped down as Archbishop  last month, in a little-noticed interview with Vatican Radio late last year. In it Dr Williams said any heir to the throne would have to be raised in the Church of England – and not as a Catholic – which could pose problems if the child had a Catholic parent. Dr Williams said: ‘If we’re quite clear that, so long as the monarch is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, there needs to be a clear understanding that the heir is brought up in that environment.’ Prince Charles has voiced serious concern about 'rushed' plans to change ancient laws governing the royal line of succession . Prince Charles is understood to have raised a series of questions over the impact of reforms on the constitutional relationship between church and State. Mr Cameron’s reforms, drawn up under the supervision of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in a Succession to the Crown Bill, will remove the ancient rule of primogeniture that says boys take precedence over girls in line to the throne. The law is set to be fast-tracked through Parliament with minimal debate. It will mean that should the Duchess of Cambridge give birth to a daughter, she will have first claim to succeed to the throne, in preference to any son born later. The rules will also remove the requirement, dating to the Act of Settlement of 1701, that the heir to the throne and senior royals do not marry Roman Catholics. The issue was given fresh significance by the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy . The law will, however, keep the Act’s paragraphs which say the monarch may not be a Catholic him or herself. The changes to allow a daughter of William and Kate to take the throne is widely popular, and Roman Catholics have long resented the anti-Catholic discrimination in the 18th century succession law. But the CofE leader in the House of Lords, Bishop of Leicester the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, has previously warned that the 26 bishops in the Upper House would vote against reforms. Dr Stevens said: ‘If the heir to the throne is brought up as a Catholic, and therefore, under the present disciplines of the Roman Catholic Church, is not able to be in communion with the Church of England, it effectively renders a Catholic heir incapable of being the Supreme Governor of the Church, so clearly that’s a more complicated issue than it appears at first sight.’ He added that any threat to the established status of the Church of England was something bishops ‘would have to resist’. The Church of England’s most important protestant faction, the Reform evangelical group, also indicated its unease yesterday. Its chairman, Plymouth vicar the Reverend Rod Thomas, said: ‘I would see a problem if a child was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church. That would threaten to unpick the constitution and unravel the whole basis on which our constitution has been built.’ By CATHERINE OSTLER . The Duke of Buccleuch, whose fortune is reckoned at £200million . The removal of the precedence of boys over girls in line to the throne threatens arguments and upheaval in other families where titles and inheritance are handed down by ancient hereditary principles. The reforms would throw a question over the inheritance rights of the Prince of Wales’ own Duchy of Cornwall, which is currently the automatic property of a male heir to the throne. A new law must therefore affect the Duchy of Cornwall and introduce equal rights for girls into its practices. But that leaves the question of whether more than 20 other dukedoms may also be compelled to follow the new system. The removal of the primogeniture law from the Royal succession leaves titled families exposed to legal challenge if they persist with the tradition of male inheritance. Families which do not opt to follow the new rules for the Royals could see their inheritance arrangements tested in the courts, with frustrated daughters and their descendants looking to win a greater share. A number of the most prominent aristocratic families may be involved in the process. Among those affected may be the Duke of Buccleuch, whose fortune is reckoned at £200million. The eldest child of Richard Scott, the 10th Duke, is a girl, 20-year-old Lady Louisa. David Manners, 11th Duke of Rutland and owner of Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, has three daughters older than the male heir to the title. Lady Tamara Grosvenor, eldest daughter of the Duke of Westminster, the country’s wealthiest aristocrat, is married to Prince William’s friend Edward van Cutsem. She and her sister are both  older than the male heir to the dukedom.","Church of England expressed deep concerns over plans to overturn laws .

A BBC manager nicknamed ‘The Pimp’ helped to procure women for Stuart Hall and filmed the TV star having sex with them in his dressing room, it was claimed last night. A former studio worker has told The Mail on Sunday that floor manager Peter Barlow had them brought to the BBC’s Manchester studios for fake auditions. The source claims that the women were lured to a room where Barlow filmed them having sex with the It’s A Knockout host. Golden boy: Stuart Hall pictured while working as a presenter for the Look North news programme . The new accusations increase pressure for an inquiry, similar to the Jimmy Savile investigation, into how bosses turned a blind eye while Hall molested girls at BBC studios. The latest incidents were said to have happened in Hall’s dressing room, next to the office of news editor Tom German and regional manager Ray Colley. On one occasion it is claimed Hall and Barlow even approached the studio’s production team to have the films processed. The allegations echo an account of one of his victims, Susan Harrison, who told how when she was 16 the presenter picked her out at a school speech day and persuaded her to visit him at the BBC on the pretext of recording a song. He later got her drunk and molested her in his car. Detectives believe other BBC staff may have helped Hall, now 83, trick girls seeking fame into visiting him. Last night the former employee said the abuse took place at the studio for regional news programme Look North from the late 1970s until the show moved offices in 1981. Shamed: Broadcaster Stuart Hall pictured outside Preston Crown Court on Thursday . The ex-staff member said: ‘It was an open secret that Stuart Hall used to film sex videos in his dressing room with women procured for him by Peter Barlow. Peter’s nickname was The Pimp and he was very close to Stuart – he used to drive him to Look North and It’s A Knockout. ‘Peter would tell women to come into the Look North studio for an audition and the pair would pretend to film the women while they presented the weather forecast. ‘Afterwards they would take  them to Stuart’s dressing room and Peter would film him having sex with them. ‘On one occasion they approached the processing team to process a video but they point-blank refused, they wouldn’t go near it. ‘Women would come by Stuart’s dressing room on a daily basis. 'Stuart liked the women aged about 18. He would meet them on It’s A Knockout, some of them were score girls, or he also picked up the pageant winners from beauty contests he used to judge. ‘Everyone knew what was going on but no one did anything about it because he was the golden boy. As far as the bosses were concerned, as long as he read the news he could do what he liked. It was total mismanagement by the BBC. 'Next to Stuart’s dressing room were the offices of Tom German and Ray Colley. They weren’t stupid and it was obvious these women were having sex in Stuart’s office. This all needs to be revealed, as it was with Savile. ‘I felt sick when I found out Stuart had been abusing underage girls. It’s awful because we used to visit schools around Lancashire and get children to take part in cookery competitions. 'It’s awful now to think back and know that probably helped him do those disgusting things. ‘There were odd things about Stuart. We used to collect tins for charity. Presenter: Stuart Hall pictured in 1968. Detectives believe that other BBC staff may have helped Hall trick girls into visiting him . 'I remember getting some salmon and Stuart kept it because he said the pensioners we were collecting for wouldn’t know what to do with it. It’s little things like that that really tell you about someone’s character.’ MPs and Hall’s victims have called on the BBC to investigate his behaviour after he admitted assaulting 13 girls, the youngest of whom was nine, between 1967 and 1986. In the aftermath of his guilty pleas, it emerged the married father of two told staff that girls he took to his dressing room were his ‘nieces’. Peter Barlow died aged 86 in 2007 and Tom German died aged 66 in 1992. When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colley, 83, said: ‘While Stuart Hall is awaiting sentence it would be inappropriate to comment.’ Honour: Hall pictured receiving the OBE for his services to broadcasting and charity last year . The BBC has no plans to set up a separate inquiry into Hall, saying it has passed any information on to the Dame Janet Smith Review, which is looking at practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse. However, last night Conservative MP Rob Wilson said: ‘My gut instinct is the BBC are not using the Smith Review to get to the truth and are instead using it to do the minimum necessary to carry on as before.’ A spokesman for The National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘It’s disgusting the BBC gave Hall unfettered opportunities to carry out his abuse. ‘The BBC owes it to his victims to open a new inquiry that can scrutinise his behaviour and the colleagues who may have helped him.’ Hall and the BBC are facing potential compensation payouts after six victims contacted solicitor Alan Collins, a partner at the law firm Pannone who is also pursuing the BBC over the Savile scandal. The BBC said: ‘All allegations that have been made to the BBC in relation to Stuart Hall have been passed on to the police or the Dame Janet Smith Review.’","Studio floor manager Peter Barlow lured victims with fake auditions .

It is a tradition which began more than 200 years ago, when George III was on the throne and Britain was at war with France. But living on Spurn Point is no longer possible for the families of the brave lifeboatmen who have helped stricken sailors in and around the Humber Estuary. Life on this remote peninsula in East Yorkshire, buffeted by winds and tides, has become so isolated that the families of Britain's only full-time lifeboat crew will leave their homes and move inland later this year. End of an era: Humber lifeboat coxswain David Steenvoorden and his wife Karen are preparting to leave their home on Spurn Point, where families of lifeboatmen have lived for more than 200 years . Out on a limb: Spurn Point, which has been home to lifeboatmen and their families since the early 19th century, is a 20,000ft spit of land at the mouth of the Humber Estuary . Remote: Families living on the peninsula have become increasingly isolated as it has been buffeted by winds and tides and affected by erosion . The lifeboat crew will then begin a new shift system with five members working six days on and six days off. Families have lived in houses on the remote 20,000ft spit of land since the early 19th century. The lifeboat station was founded in 1810. It now keeps one of the busiest of the RNLI's all-weather vessels, dealing with more than 50 incidents a year. Moving on: Karen Steenvoorden, pictured with husband David, said the lifeboatmen's wives had taken the decision to leave 'really hard' But increased erosion has caused the road leading to the peninsula's tip to become impassable at times as the wind blows sand across. High tides frequently make it impossible for children to get to school and two families had to stay in a hotel last year when a sea surge cut off the road. The lifeboat crew must be available . for call-out 24 hours a day, which makes life difficult for spouses who . must plan ahead for even the simplest of tasks. The nearest shop is a 16-mile round trip from their homes. Humber . lifeboat coxswain Dave Steenvoorden, 54, said: 'I am going to be gutted . when I leave. I think they have made the absolutely right decision to . move the families but I have been here 21 years and love it.' His wife Karen said: 'The wives have taken it really hard. If you could bottle what Spurn is and sell it you’d be a millionaire. 'It’s very laid back. We don’t lock doors. We are going to find it so strange going out into the big wide world.' Six families are on the move, and the last is due to leave Spurn Point on August 20. Their homes will be converted into dormitories and offices. Andy Clift, the RNLI's divisional inspector, said the station was so remote that it was difficult to staff with volunteers. The lifeboat will remain with a fully professional crew and the RNLI has recruited four new members to work the shift system. An RNLI spokesman said: 'Our crew . make many sacrifices to enable them to save lives at sea - a role they . would be unable to carry out without the full support of their families - . and the RNLI has a duty of care to both its crew members and to the . families. 'Gutted': Dave Steenvoorden said he would find it hard to leave his home on the peninsula . History: A lifeboat station has stood on Spurn Point since 1810. The site is currently home to one of the RNLI's busiest all-weather lifeboats . Changes: The lifeboat crew will begin a new shift system with members working six days on and six days off . The way they were: The 1900 lifeboat crew, pictured with their vessel at Spurn Point . Past residents: Former members of the lifeboat crew at Spurn Point . Tradition: Lifeboat crews have been operating from Spurn Point since 1810 . 'We want to ensure our crew members have a satisfactory work-life balance, with appropriate time off from operational duty and their place of work. 'The current way of working means this is impossible to achieve. 'It has also become increasingly clear that the continuous erosion of Spurn Point and regular breaching of the road will make it difficult to sustain community life for much longer. 'Travel for the crew members' families to and from work, school, the shops et cetera can be difficult and sometimes dangerous. 'As the RNLI can no longer guarantee the safety and comfort of the families living on the Point, it has become imperative that we progress plans to move them away from the lifeboat station.' Place by the sea: Families have lived in a cluster of homes on the peninsula for more than two centuries, but the current residents have been beset with difficulties caused by winds and tides .

One of Albert Einstein's stranger ideas has led to the identification of a new planet twice as heavy as Jupiter, orbiting a star some 2,000 light-years from Earth. ‘This is the first time that this . aspect of Einstein's theory of relativity has been used to discover a . planet,’ said Tsevi Mazeh, of Tel Aviv University. The discovery made use of the beaming effect which occurs when light from the parent star brightens as its planet tugs closer to Earth, and dims as the planet pulls it away. Einstein's planet, formally known as Kepler-76b, is a 'hot Jupiter' that orbits its star every 1.5 days. The planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth . The warping of space-time caused by this . motion forces light particles into a narrower, more focused beam that . looks brighter than it really is. The newfound world, nicknamed ‘Einstein’s planet’, orbits its star every 1.5 days. It is located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The discovery made use of Einstein's relativistic 'beaming effect' which occurs when light from the parent star brightens as its planet tugs closer to Earth, and dims as the planet pulls it away . Formally known as Kepler-76b, the planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. As a result, Einstein’s planet broils at a temperature of about 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. The team found strong evidence that the planet has extremely fast jet-stream winds that carry the heat around it. This is the first time optical observations have shown evidence of alien jet stream winds at work. Detection of planets via the beaming effect was predicted in 2003 by Professor Avi Loeb at Harvard University and Professor Scott Gaudi, now at Ohio State University. Back then, the idea was met with scepticism.David Latham, a Harvard astronomer who collaborated on the discovery, originally doubted it was even possible to do. ‘I thought it was silly,’ he told Time magazine. ‘I thought the effect was so small we’d never detect it.’ The technique requires measurements of changes in brightness as small as a few parts per million, which could not be achieved a decade ago. But since the NASA’s Kepler spacecraft went into orbit in 2009, the researchers had the extremely detailed observations necessary to put theory into practice. The diameter of Einstein's planet is about 25 per cent larger than Jupiter and it weighs twice as much. It orbits a type F star located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus . Alongside Einstein’s beaming effect, the team looked for signs that the star was stretched into a American football shape by gravitational tides from the orbiting planet. The star would appear brighter when observed the football from the side, due to more visible surface area, and fainter when viewed end-on.  The third small effect was due to starlight reflected by the planet itself. ‘We have been searching for this elusive effect for more than two years, and we finally found a planet. It is amazing that already a decade ago Loeb and Gaudi foresaw this happening,’ said Mazeh. Einstein's planet, formally known as Kepler-76b, is a ‘hot . Jupiter’ that orbits its star every 1.5 days.

Number one: Mathematician Alan Turing's theory for a 'universal machine', which forms the basis for all modern computing, has been voted the greatest British innovation of the 20th Century . Mathematician Alan Turing's theoretical basis for all modern computers known as the 'universal machine' has been voted the greatest British innovation of the past century in a new poll. The famous computer scientist came up with the theory, on which all modern computing is based, in a paper 'on computable numbers' in 1936. He described a device that would read symbols on a tape and proposed that the tape could be used to program the machine. However it was not until later that Turing’s ideas were realised as practical machines. The 'universal machine' came top of a poll to find the greatest British innovation of the past 100 years. More than 50,000 votes were entered with Turing's theory securing 18 per cent - just one per cent ahead of the BMC Mini. 'We owe him a huge debt,' said Stephen Fry, who has championed Turing’s innovation throughout the vote. 'His Universal Machine idea laid the logical and mathematical foundations of the technology you're using to read this.' Turing studied mathematics at King’s College, University of Cambridge. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he became head of a code-breaking unit at Bletchley Park, home to the Government Code and Cypher School. He used his profound mathematical skill to design, with colleague Gordon Welchman, a series of huge electromechanical code-breaking machines known as ‘bombes’. Changing the course of history: After the war, Alan Turing created the first practical designs for a stored-program computer called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), pictured . The 'universal machine' theory laid the foundations for the first ever practical design for a stored-program computer which is still used today . Following the war, Turing moved to the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. There . he revisited the ideas proposed in 1936 and devised one of the first . practical designs for a stored-program computer, called the Automatic . Computing Engine or ACE. Groundbreaking: Alan Turing also invented the code breaking naval Enigma machine, pictured, which cracked the Nazis' coding machine and stripped U-boats blockading Britain of their cover . Turing's invention was one of 100 to be shortlisted for the national vote. X-ray crystallography – which revealed the hidden atomic structure of compounds and celebrates its centenary this year – took third place. Leading figures, including Prime Minister David Cameron, Professor Jim Al-Khalili and presenter Evan Davis, championed their favourite innovations and sparked heated debate across Twitter. 'The vote has been an exciting battle between the tangible products of British ingenuity, such as Mallard and the Mini, and innovative ideas, such as Turing’s Universal Machine,' said Roger Highfield, Director of External Affairs at the Science Museum Group. 'We’ve started an interesting public debate about innovation, particularly how creativity and technology feed into scientific discoveries.' Ionic liquid chemistry was voted as the innovation most likely to shape the 21st century. 'We are delighted to win, as this will shine a very public spotlight on how a team of chemists can dramatically improve the quality of the environment for everyone,' said Professor Ken Seddon, Director of Queen's University Ionic Liquid Laboratories.

Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich - who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life - has apologized for her drunken boating arrest last Friday as it's revealed that her blood alcohol content was twice the legal limit. 'At no time was the boat away from the dock and there was no public safety risk,' she said in a statement, denying police claims that she operated the boat in open waters. 'That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly a big mistake. I know better and I am very sorry,' she added. 'After a day in the sun and with . nothing to eat it appears that a couple of drinks had a greater impact . than I realized.' Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich has apologized for her drunken boating arrest last Friday . Brockovich, 52,  was booked into jail . around 10 p.m. on Friday after game warden in Lake Mead, Nevada spotted . her struggling with her boat at a marina. Brockovich had been out on the boat with a male companion but was alone when she tried to dock it. Edwin Lyngar of the Nevada Department . of Wildlife said her blood alcohol content was over twice the legal . limit of 0.08 when she was arrested. 'She . was obviously struggling to put the boat in the slip, and if you’ve had . any experience, it’s a simple enough operation,' Lyngar said. 'This incident is an important reminder that boating under the influence is on par with driving under the influence,' he added. The mother of three, who has an estimated net worth of $42 million, had slurred . speech and was unsteady on her feet as she tried to dock the boat. She . failed a sobriety test and was taken to jail, where she was later . released on a $1,000 bail. Boating blunder: Brockovich, famous for acting as an advocate for residents of Hinkley, California, against the Pacific Gas and Electricity Company, was recently arrested for DUI . Brockovich is pictured in March 2000 in her home in Agoura Hills, California . Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a . misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the . charge. Brockovich, who married her third . husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the . 2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life. As a legal assistant she helped win a . record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of . people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the . California town of Hinkley. After suffering an injury in an auto accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to support her family. Case closed: Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich in the movie of the same name . The law firm hired Brokovich as a . file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific . Coast's career in law and public advocacy. While organizing files for a pro-bono . real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead . to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in . U.S. history. Brokovich's investigation found that . the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley . residents for more than 30 years. Between 1952 and 1966, the company . used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to . fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which . was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern . California to the San Francisco Bay area. The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower. The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant. Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement. For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus. Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case. Brokovich and Masry then became the . face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits . against various corporations for pollution issues. Brockovich was released from jail after posting $1,000 bail . Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.'

The sellers might have expected to sell their ‘pleasant but unremarkable’ Highland hideaway for a few thousand pounds over the odds. But then Eddrachilles House has a value-added element – the most dramatic panoramic views in the whole of Britain. Room with a view: The bungalow, 20 miles south of Cape Wrath, overlooks Badcall Bay and charmed one buyer into shelling out £530,000 . Stunning: The single storey house in the north west Highlands' view was what drew buyers to the property . And that has persuaded one extremely ‘determined’ house hunter to offer 80 per cent over the asking price. The sale price of just over £530,000 for a modern, single-storey property valued at £300,000 is unlikely to provoke a housing boom in the north-west. But, according to experts, it has sent a ‘frisson of excitement and hope’ through the market. Eddrachilles House is situated at the heart of a crofting community in Sutherland, lying 20 miles south of Cape Wrath, the most north-westerly point on the British mainland, in an area described by all who know it as ‘magical’. The house is not large – it has two reception rooms, a conservatory and two bedrooms which are en suite. Flurry of offers: The house was put on the market by Strutt & Parker, who recorded an 'immediate surge of interest' Must-have property: The highest bid was from a buyer who was 'simply determined' not to be outbid, the estate agent said, and missives were concluded at the weekend .

"By . Claudia Connell . PUBLISHED: . 17:47 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:37 EST, 11 June 2013 . Strawberries and cream... bread and butter... tea and biscuits... some things just go together. But cheese and compression bandages? Yoghurt and head torches? Not so much. Of course, this hasn’t deterred staff at the Walton-on-Thames branch of Aldi from displaying them proudly, side-by-side. It’s fair to say the shop’s displays don’t make much sense — but then there’s not much about the German discount supermarket that does. New territory: Claudia Connell does her grocery shop at her local Waitrose. This week, she went to her nearest branch of Aldi to see what all the fuss is about . From the bizarre items they stock (‘Would you like a bicycle saddle with your baguette, Madam?’) to the chaotic layout and infuriating lack of assistants, Aldi seems, at first glance, to offer a gruelling shopping experience. It is certainly a far cry from the glossy Waitrose store I usually frequent. Yet now seems the time to sweep supermarket snobbery aside and give Aldi a chance. For last week it emerged as the overall winner in a taste test of own-brand foods conducted by trade magazine The Grocer. Aldi came out top in 16 categories — more than Waitrose and M&S combined — with gold medals for everything from its bacon to its brioche. With praise such as this, not to mention bargain prices, it’s no wonder the middle classes are hot-footing it there in droves and that Aldi, which originally targeted more socially deprived areas, is now opening up in Newbury, Winchester, Ely and Cowes on the Isle of Wight. With no branches near my home in South London, I head off to a store in Walton-on-Thames, the sort of town where ladies lunch and gents play golf. There, standing out like a sore thumb beneath the shadow of 12th-century St Mary’s church, lies Aldi. It looks like the sort of council-run place where you’d go to get a verruca removed. The inside isn’t much better, with strip lighting that fails to lift the gloom and piles of stock in the middle of aisles making it hard to navigate my wobbly trolley. At 9.30am, the twinset and pearl shoppers are nowhere to be seen. Instead, the store is full of pensioners all making a beeline for the famous ‘special buy’ section, where you can get all sorts of strange stuff (such as the aforementioned compression bandages and head torches). But I have to admit the food is impressive. A 200g punnet of cherries — a fruit that usually costs more than gold — is £1.79, and they look impossibly juicy. As well as the cherries, there’s English rhubarb for 69p, a pack of four avocados at £1.49 and on-the-vine tomatoes for 69p. Middle class destination: Shoppers who favour Waitrose are heading to Aldi to buy alcohol . Illogical: Aldi is known for scattered and confused displays, that mix clothes, toiletries and fresh food together . Bagged salad is also good value. A generous bag of baby leaf salad is just 79p, as is the rocket. There . are plenty more middle-class staples available too: brie, Parma ham, . chorizo, houmous and fresh pesto are all present and correct in the . chiller cabinet. In most . cases, there’s only one type of each — but there’s actually something . quite liberating about not having to dither over 16 different . varieties. The choice of . teas, coffees and breakfast cereals is similarly limited but includes . Diplomat teabags — one of the lines Aldi has just won an award for. At £1.39 for 60, they’re nearly half the price of the Twinings Everyday Tea I usually drink. Aldi . has also been much praised for its bread and baked goods, and I have to . say the range is not only impressive but crazily cheap. Four . delicious-looking all-butter croissants are only 55p, while the gold . medal-winning French Marble brioche looks irresistibly fluffy. All shoppers have their items that they are just not prepared to skimp on — and for me it’s chicken and loo rolls. At £3.99 for four breast fillets, the chicken is the cheapest I’ve seen for a long time — but it just doesn’t look very nice. It’s not free-range, and I suspect that by the time it comes out of the oven the pumped-up breast will have shrunk to a bite-size dog treat. As for the loo roll, well let’s just say I’ve seen sandpaper that looked softer. I try to remind myself that beggars can’t be choosers, and that while I’m not exactly on the breadline, I could do with trimming back my food bill. Although I live alone, I spend around £85 on my weekly shop at Waitrose — and that rarely includes red meat or alcohol. Aldi has been found to be 40 per cent cheaper than Waitrose — and an annual saving of £1,700 isn’t to be sniffed at. That’s two weeks in Spain. An hour into my Aldi shop, I am beginning to spy the odd well-heeled Surrey wife: their immaculately blow-dried hair, J Brand jeans and Tod’s loafers are a dead giveaway. Appeal: The middle classes are said to be rushing to Aldi for wine and gin. Bottles of £3.69 red wine don't stay on the shelves for long. The wine has been voted one of the best in the world . Taste the difference: Aldi has won an award for its Diplomat teabags. But Claudia Connell still prefers Twinings . However, rather than buying their entire weekly shop at Aldi, they are nipping in for one item. Booze. Heading to an aisle stacked high with wines, beers and spirits, I feel I’ve uncorked the secret to Aldi’s success. Alcohol . is something that Aldi does well. When their £3.69 Spanish red wine . Toro Loco Tempranillo was voted one of the best in the world last year, . you couldn’t get it for love nor money. Today they have a supply in but . it’s going fast. I grab a . bottle and get chatting to 66-year-old Gillian Jones, who has come . straight from her tennis lesson and is still dressed in her whites. ‘I only come in for the gin,’ she tells me. ‘It’s the best I’ve ever tasted, and so much cheaper than brands like Gordon’s.’ She’s . right about the gin. In blind taste-tests, Aldi’s Oliver Cromwell . London Dry Gin (£9.65) was rated better than brands like Hendricks and . Bombay Sapphire, which are twice the price. For the most part, Aldi sells their own ranges, interspersed with a handful of famous brands such as Haribo and Marmite. They’re also notorious for doing ‘lookalike’ ranges — products cunningly designed to look like well-known brands but at a fraction at the price. At last I feel ready to head for the chaotic central ‘special buy’ aisles to see if there’s anything I’m missing out on . But as I’m not currently in the market for a two-man tent, a catering-sized jar of pickled eggs or a 35-piece set of spanners, I leave the bargain hunters to it and make my way to the tills. There are only three checkouts and the shortest queue has 14 people in it. When I finally reach the front, the assistant scans my food so fast his hands are a blur. He stacks it in a huge tower, and even though it’s apparent I’m struggling to keep up, he doesn’t slow down and several items fall to the floor. Back home, and with my blood pressure restored to its normal rate, I’m keen to see if the taste of these gold medal winning foods makes up for the hassle of buying them. Things don’t start well with the Diplomat teabags, which produce a weak and tasteless cuppa, although the Belmont Jaffa Cakes are indistinguishable from McVitie’s ones, which are double the price. The brioche is as delicious as it looks, but I’m disappointed in both the chocolate and the lemon and mascarpone cheesecake that were singled out for praise. To my palate, they taste processed, not homemade. Just as I am reaching the conclusion that shiny Waitrose is still my true love, I remember the wine and cherries. I almost want the cherries to be dry and bitter, but they’re sweet and juicy — and the perfect accompaniment to my large glass of Toro Loco Tempranillo, which must be smoothest wine I’ve ever tasted. How on earth can it have cost just £3.69? Suddenly I’m regretting not having snapped up a whole box of the stuff — and a load of that award-winning gin to boot. Aldi, I have a feeling I’ll be joining the Surrey housewives and weaving my way — perhaps a little unsteadily — down your aisles once more.","Aldi's own brand products are highly-regarded, such as award-winning tea and wine .

After a Senate committee revealed last month that Apple skirted billions in taxes by stashing cash in offshore tax havens, the company quickly became the poster child of big businesses that take advantage of dramatically lower corporate tax rates around the world. But it turns out Apple isn't alone - according to a new report, 18 of the largest companies in the U.S. avoid paying U.S. taxes in the exact same way, dodging an estimated $92 billion, collectively. According to the report, conducted by the tax-advocacy organization Citizens for Tax Justice, 18 of the U.S.' Fortune 500 companies - like Nike, Microsoft, American Express and Oracle - disclose information in their annual financial reports that indicates that they keep billions of dollars in profits offshore where corporate tax rates can be in single-digit percentages. In the Bahamas, for example, the corporate tax rate is zero. If the companies were to keep their money in the U.S., they would be subject to corporate tax rates ranging from 30-percent to 39-percent. Apple CEO Timothy Cook explains to Congress how the company stashes billions of dollars in profits to avoid paying U.S. corporate income tax . The CTJ says places like Bermuda and the Caymen Islands are likely the locations of choice for many of the tax-skirting corporations to stash their money. Under current U.S. tax code, large corporations can indefinitely defer paying U.S. income taxes on their offshore profits. It's not until the money is repatriated that the U.S. can apply any taxes to any corporate profits - and that's assuming that these corporations ever bring the money back to the U.S. Even when the money is brought back into the country, corporations rarely pay the full corporate tax rate on profits they've kept offshore to the U.S. - companies are allowed a “foreign tax credit” against their U.S. tax when . and if the profits are subject to U.S. tax. This means that a company that pays a 25-percent tax rate on income it's kept offshore - to a foreign government - would only have to pay a 10-percent tax rate if it brings the money back into the United States. Cha-ching! But the CTJ also found that 22 companies that don't disclose where they keep their money hold an estimated $720 billion in un-repatriated income. Topping that list is General Electric, which holds roughly $110 billion in places like the Bahamas, Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore. Pfizerr got the number two spot, with $73 billion spread between Ireland, Bermuda, the Caymen Islands and several other low-tax nations. Because stashing money in places that have low corporate income tax rates isn't illegal, and because the CEOs of these companies report to stockholders, business experts have said that for a company to not squirrel money away in places with low tax rates would be the equivalent of corporate malpractice. But lawmakers are attempting to fix the loopholes that allows these companies to duck paying taxes. Several of the corporations on the CTJ's list have suggested granting a holiday on taxes for companies that want to repatriate their income that's currently being kept overseas.","Some of the U.S.' largest corporations keep much of their profits in places like Ireland, the Bahamas and the Caymen Islands, where corporate tax rates can be as low as zero .

Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has reached a settlement with the auction house that was sold a collection of his memorabilia by his own mother. The star was also locked in an ongoing legal battle with his mother Pamela, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia without his permission. But he has reached an undisclosed deal with Ken Goldin, owner of Goldin Auctions in New Jersey, for the sale of the six basketball items, which will be sold between June 17 and July 19, ESPN reported. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home . He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off . Last month, a judge issued a . temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction . house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school . championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full . hearing. Bryant's attorney also claimed his . mother, Pamela Bryant, wasn't authorized to sell the items, which where . given to her as a gift from her son. Amidst the family feud, the auction . house then sued Kobe and asked for proof of his ownership of the goods, . because Goldin had paid $450,000 to his mother in advance for the items . in January - which Pamela used to buy a house in Nevada. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around $1.5million. Goldin is 'thrilled' that the pair have reached a settlement - which has not been fully disclosed.

'On behalf of Loeb & Loeb's client Kobe Bryant, we are pleased to . announce that a settlement has been reached in the dispute involving his . mother, Pamela Bryant and Goldin Auctions over the proposed auctioning . of Kobe Byrant sports memorabilia. 'The terms of settlement are confidential.' For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is pictured .

'We apologize for any . misunderstanding and unintended paid we have caused out son and . appreciate the financial support he has provided over the years. 'We also apologize to Goldin Auctions for their inadvertent involvement in this matter and thank them for their assistance.' In May, Mr Bryant said: 'I never told . my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it . for public auction.' According to the complaint . filed in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting . guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was . never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false . statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said . to her, ""Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the . memorabilia."" 'Her response . was, ""Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either."" Of course, this is . untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia . several years earlier.' Bryant said in . a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute go back . to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he . was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’  to his . children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

A Premier League footballer told his tenants they would have their gas and electricity cut off if they did not leave his property within two weeks. Southampton forward Lee Barnard, 28, and his fiancee Tonya French who he is due to marry today, bought the 14-bedroom townhouse in Chelmsford, Essex recently. Barnard, the landlord, wrote to the 11 residents telling them to get out because he wants to renovate the property. The former Tottenham player offered a £100 'incentive' to the . tenants - including vulnerable people as well as those on housing and . disability benefits - to move out quickly. The tenants, who have individual flats in the large detached house, should legaly have been given two months to quit. Sandra . Keeble, who has been living in the property for five years, said: 'We . are being completely bullied. I think it is abhorrent and horrible. 'We were told to get out with our belongings but there was no chance of us finding the money within two weeks. 'Nobody . has a way to contact the new owner - we tried the number at the bottom . of the letters but it goes straight to voicemail and no-one replies to . the e-mails we have sent.' A charity which helps people who have been made homeless has been helping the families look for new accommodation. Ray Ellis, 52, is on disability benefits and was shocked by the demand to leave so suddenly. Fiancée: Barnard is engaged to marry model Tonya French, pictured, who has posed for Playboy . He said: 'I have asked for more time to find somewhere else to go - we are not finding it easy to find an alternative.' Three of the residents have moved out since the demands were made last month. Officials from Chelmsford Borough Council have told the residents they are legally allowed to stay. Barnard blamed the situation on a 'mix up' and said he had been cooperative throughout. 'We wrote to the tenants when we found out that the notice period was not long enough,' he said last night. 'We were happy to extent the notice period and have been in regular contact with the council as well. 'I . have not been trying to bully the tenants - I bought the property, I . think it is quite run-down and needs a lot of work and I am within my . rights to serve the notice period and that is now a sufficient one.

When Roger Hargreaves’s six-year-old son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like, he went to his desk in the sitting room of their riverside home and drew a round orange character and named him Mr Tickle. That was in 1971, and at that point the Mr Men were born. Within three years, a million copies of the books were sold. Roger was able to give up his job in the advertising industry and write not only more Mr Men characters but also create the Little Miss series for his twin daughters Sophie and Amelia. Today, one of his books sells every 27 seconds. Colourful past: The extensive riverside property south-west of London has six bedrooms, a balcony and large conservatory . The house where the characters came to life was built in 1956 for Hargreaves and his wife Christine in the style of a Japanese minka, or simple country retreat, on the banks of the Thames at Lower Sunbury, 14 miles south-west of London. Hargreaves, who died in 1988, sold the house – he named it Minka – in the mid-1970s and moved to Guernsey, but today it is back on the market. ‘Back in the 1950s, it became very popular among people who lived in London to build a holiday home on the river, particularly in this area and on the islands around Shepperton,’ says Owen Miles, manager of Curchods, which is selling the six-bedroom house for £3.6 million. In 1956, Minka was a fairly modest chalet-style house, but it has been transformed into a light, bright, family home with five reception rooms, two kitchens and two guest apartments and makes best use of the fabulous south-facing back garden and its 190ft river frontage. It is currently owned by airline executive Xavier Van der Doncht and his partner Nick Franklin, a surgeon, who ten years ago swapped their former home, a Queen Anne house less than a mile away, with Minka’s previous owner, Mike Noble, a record industry boss. Birthplace of men: The front room at the property where the very first of the Mr Men, Mr Tickle, was created in 1971 . Water view: Minka, on the market for £3.6million, is located by the river near Sunbury on Thames . ‘There was a narrow corridor and a guest toilet and ironing room at the front of the house, and no real views on to the front garden, so we opened it all up,’ says Xavier, 48. ‘In the dining room, we put folding glass doors, which we can open and make it feel as though we’re eating outside. ‘It’s a great house for entertaining. When Mike Noble owned it, he had parties for rock stars and Joan Armatrading spent a lot of time here.’ Noble added the splendid galleried library with its beautiful Art Deco staircase, which has a bannister in the style of a ship’s rail. There is plenty of space for guests, and the riverside annexe, with a bedsitting room, bathroom and kitchen, would make a wonderful study or artist’s studio. There is also a self-contained one-bedroom flat with its own terrace – and even that has river views. Xavier and Nick, 47, have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the house in the ten years they have owned it. They spent £90,000 alone on the hand-made solid wood kitchen, which includes Circotherm, steam and combination microwave ovens, gas and induction hobs and an integrated coffee machine. Giggle: Mr.Tickle, is the first book in the Mr. Men series by Roger Hargreaves which have sold millions . There is also a second, smaller kitchen, which is used by caterers when the couple throw parties. The stunning conservatory, which stretches across the width of the sitting room and kitchen, cost a further £100,000. The house is also remarkably private: A high wall and electronic gates hide the front gardens, in which Nick and Xavier keep a flock of rare hens, and at the back the peace is disturbed only by the occasional pleasure boat passing on the river. ‘It is incredibly quiet here, especially when you think we’re so close to Central London,’ says Xavier. The couple used to have a boat, which they sailed to Windsor and Richmond and once took on a shopping trip to Kingston. ‘John Lewis has its own mooring so one Christmas, when the roads were very busy, we sailed over, did all our Christmas shopping and sailed home again,’ says Xavier. Now the pair are looking for somewhere smaller nearby that they can once more leave their own stamp on. At £3.6 million, the asking price is a far cry from the £2,000 an average house cost back in 1956. But the Mr Men empire has seen a similar stratospheric rise in value. In 2004, Roger’s widow Christine sold the franchise for £28 million, and two years ago it changed hands again – ironically to a Japanese firm – for a sum believed to be more than twice as much. lCurchods, 01932 230033 .","Property where Roger Hargreaves created the Mr Men on the market .

And he finds the giant collection surprisingly easy to maintain. The retired tool hire businessman has spent the last 26 years becoming a master of topiary. A cut above the rest: Retired businessman David Edwards tends to some of his huge topiary creations . Passion: Mr Edwards first began practising topiary when he moved to his home in the Isle of Wight in 1987 . For the chop: The collection of topiary animals includes a cat, a swan, a dinosaur, a horse and a rabbit . Intricate: Each sculpture takes Mr Edwards years of growing and trimming to perfect . The 70-year-old from Ryde, Isle of Wight, said his interest was first sparked by a neighbour's horse. He said: 'In 1987 I moved to a house with many hedges and a large garden. 'My son, Christopher, had taken up horse riding and I became fascinated with the shape and dimensions of horses. 'Luckily a neighbour's horse, Pampas, . was prepared to model for me for the modest fee of a few carrots and I . was able to attempt life-size topiary.' The topiary horse was created by reshaping an existing hedge into the main body and head. Then the front legs were planted separately and grown to join into the body. During the four years it took to . create the horse it was suggested that the it needed a rider, so a man . was grown, leaning against the opposite gatepost. Inspiration: The idea for creating animals was sparked by Mr Edwards' interest in a neighbour's horse . Patience: The triceratops is 12ft long and 6ft high and took six years to complete . Work in progress: Mr Edwards is currently in the midst of creating a huge human face . The life-sized man, a watchful jockey, stands at the front of Mr Edwards' house. Since then, more pieces have appeared including a swan, cats, rabbits and a human face is currently being carved. But Mr Edwards says he is most proud of a 12ft-long triceratops which took six years of craft. He said: 'The strange thing is that I initially started carving a cow - but then changed my mind halfway through its completion. 'I'm glad that I changed my mind as the dinosaur is a lot more unique and people are amazed when they first see it.' The plant that he uses is a Lonicera Nitida, which grows very quickly and is very tolerant and easy to root. He added: 'Topiary is a relaxing and rewarding pastime and everyone can do it. 'The advantage of topiary over other types of sculpture is that, unlike carving wood or chiseling marble, if a bit too much is accidently lopped off, it will regrow next year.'","David Edwards, 70, has spent 26 years creating garden menagerie .

An instructor at an Army medical training school at a military base in Texas was wounded Monday when a fellow service member shot her outside her office, authorities said. The suspect later surrendered to police, and authorities say no one else was ever in danger. Col. Jim Chevallier, vice commander of 502 Air Base Wing, would not give the identity of the shooter or victim or discuss any possible relationship between the two. But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told the San Antonio Express-News that the victim and shooter were involved in a relationship. Shooting at military base: The shooting took place Monday afternoon at the Fort Sam Houston Army Medical Department Center and School. The victim was an instructor and the man who shot her a fellow serviceman . The incident took place at Fort Sam Houston's Army Medical Department Center and School at about 2:50 p.m. Authorities said the shooter was a soldier who came into the victim's office and began talking to her. The pair then continued a discussion on a veranda outside the building, where the shooter eventually fired multiple shots from a handgun, Chevallier said. It was not clear how many shots were fired. The victim's co-workers are medical professionals, and they were the first to attend to her wounds, Chevallier. She remained hospitalized on post late Monday and was in stable condition. 'It started as a conversation,' Col. Randy Anderson said. 'He came into her office space, and then she took him out of the building. It occurred there.' Chevallier said the shooter got in his car and drove away from the medical center. He later parked and try to flee on foot while still within the base, but thought better of it. Victim in stable condition: The victim, was shot up to nine times, was last reported in stable condition at the San Antonio Medical Center . Assailant caught: The shooter fled the scene in his car and was about to run on foot when he instead called his lawyer. He is currently in police custody . Matt Barido, deputy director of the 502 Wing Security Forces, said the shooter then called his lawyer, who contacted the San Antonio Police Department and told them where to find him. The suspect is in custody at Fort Sam Houston, but authorities wouldn't say if he's been charged. Authorities locked down the base for about two hours while military police cleared the building where the shooting took place. Fort Sam Houston is one of the oldest U.S. military bases still in operation and is located in central San Antonio. Besides hosting one of the nation's top burn units, most army medics undergo training there. In November 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, 13 soldiers and civilians were killed and more than two dozen wounded when a gunman walked into the Soldier Readiness Processing Center and opened fire. Asked if the Fort Hood shooting rampaged led to more training for shootings on bases, Brig Gen. Robert LaBrutta, commander of the 502 Air Base Wing, responded: 'The bottom line is that we train for this. We're prepared for this.' This was the first shooting at the post in 20 years. 'The last active shooting incident was in 1993,' said Phil Reidinger, a spokesman for the center and school in an interview with the Express-News. 'An employee held a supervisor hostage, and after many hours of negotiation, the hostage-taker surrendered and the employee was not harmed.'","Shooting occurred Monday afternoon - only one person was injured and no others were in danger .

A builder has been made to pay more than £12,000 after he caused a house to collapse into a trench while building an extension. Paul Astbury, 50, was digging the foundations when the neighbouring house sank into the hole he had created. The builder, who runs Astbury Design and Build, had filled the trench with concrete - but dug it 60cm lower than next door and overnight the house partially collapsed. The house (left) collapsed into the trench dug during preparatory work for an extension next door (right) Fortunately, no-one was in the house at the time of the collapse in February last year. The front and side walls of the semi-detached property in Wolverhampton crumbled into the hole leaving the upstairs bedroom and downstairs dining room exposed. Astbury was fined £7,500 and ordered to pay £4,500 in costs along with a £15 victim surcharge when he appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates Court on Tuesday. District Judge Graeme Wilkinson branded Astbury's building methods 'potentially catastrophic'. Paul Astbury (left) was fined after causing a house (right) to collapse into a trench while building an extension . He told him: 'It strikes me as laughable they can describe your work as of the highest possible standard. 'This was potentially catastrophic. The work done was not of a high standard, you must have known that. It is pure blind luck the people living [next door] were not present. 'Companies have to learn that when they take shortcuts there will be real financial hardship for them.' District Judge Graeme Wilkinson said Astbury's building methods were 'potentially catastrophic' Astbury, a former marine, pleaded guilty on behalf of his firm  to failing to conduct excavations in such a way that residents were not exposed to risks under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Prosecutor Gareth Langston told the court: 'The case is based on the risk created, not the outcome, but it did create substantial property damage. 'The tenant at the property moved out and the owner has had to have it substantially repaired and rebuilt.' The damage was caused while foundations were being dug for a kitchen extension next door . Analysis of the company accounts during the case showed it was 'effectively bankrupt' as Astbury had finished the extension work free of charge during the past year. At the time of the collapse, the owner of the house where the work was being carried out, Yogie Kumar, 41, who had been renting out the property, said he was 'shocked and upset'. He said: 'The inspector said he had never seen anything like it. I am still in shock. The house had to be 'substantially repaired and rebuilt' after it collapsed into a trench . 'The neighbours said they woke up after hearing a noise like an earthquake, and when they came out to check they saw the massive cracks in the walls.' He said the woman who had been renting the house, who was believed to have been living there with two children, was visiting relatives when the collapse happened. Sarah Froggatt, defending, said he felt morally responsible for the damage. Builders survey the damage after the collapse of the house in February last year . She added: 'Mr Astbury wants to assure you he isn't hiding anything in his accounts. The company will be paying for the civil proceedings. 'Liability has never been an issue. He feels he has a moral obligation to put right what went wrong that day in February. 'The house didn't actually collapse and was demolished safely. He's mortified that this is a health and safety matter and his reputation will be known to potential customers.'","Paul Astbury fined more than £12,000 after causing house to collapse .

The Kardashian sisters love to keep things in the family, and recently mother-of-two Kourtney admitted that she would be happy to be breastfeed sister Kim's baby daughter. Pregnant Kim isn't convinced by the idea, calling it 'disgusting', but the idea of wet nursing is actually an age-old parenting method that dates back to the ancient Greeks. Sisters Bunty Rowe and Kyle Aldridge have seven children between them and often breastfeed their neices and nephews. They are both members of the pro-breastfeeding group Lactivist and say that cross-feeding is natural and convenient and has even brought their children closer together. Scroll down for video . Sisters Bunty Rowe and Kyle Aldridge have practised 'nipple sharing' for over four years . 26-year-old Bunty (l)  says that cross-feeding gives her 'emotional comfort' and 30-year-old Kyle (r) has started a Facebook group for women who need to wet-nurse because of illness or emergency . On This Morning today the two women from Cam in Gloucs explained why 'nipple sharing' works for them. Bunty, 26, who has two daughters Mabel, four, and Ede, two, said: 'We enjoy breastfeeding, at the end of the day its all about choice. It's a convenience thing as well as emotionally comforting. I didn't want to give my children formula, that's just a choice I made, so it gave me great emotional comfort to know that if my sister was looking after my daughter she could feed her.' Her sister Kyle, 30, who has five children, explained: 'There was never any big conversation about it it happened naturally  when my sister went out one day and was nervous [about leaving her daughter] and I said if she cries shall I feed her?' 'How often and how much has varied over time. It's all about meeting the needs of the children.' The two women have been breastfeeding each others children for the past four years. Kyle, a full-time mother to Jai, 13, Lottie, 11, Levi, seven, Judah, four, and Elijah, two , will sometimes breastfeed friends' children too. She has started a wet nurse Facebook group in the UK to connect mothers who need breast milk due to an emergency or illness . The women appeared on This Morning to defend their lifestyle on Thursday . She said: 'Breastfeeding is only a small part of your parenting ethos. Infant feeding is a bonding process but it's a small part of a big picture. In a recent interview with The Sun student midwife Bunty said: 'We’re like one family unit really,' Kyle, who is in the process of becoming a registered childminder, added: . 'It’s natural. I see breastfeeding my baby and my sister’s baby as part of motherhood — and sisterhood. 'If Kim and Kourtney do decide to breastfeed each others babies, they won’t be the first and they definitely won’t be the last.' For for more information visit the This Morning website . When a woman breast-feeds someone else’s baby it is called ’wet-nursing’. It was an ancient occupation mentioned in many early medical texts, including those by Aristotle and Ibn Sina. Wet nurses might act as foster parents for motherless babies or those whose mother was simply ill or not able to produce enough milk.Wet-nursing in Europe increased steadily from the 1000s onwards as urbanisation increased. Country women, usually from farming families, were preferred to town women. Foundling hospitals, which took in abandoned babies, became an increasing source of income for wet nurses. The traditional wet nurse was expected to have a strong body, good milk and to be sympathetic, clean and tidy, active and of good character. She would wet-nurse the infant until it was weaned from breast milk, and might then remain long enough to become the child's nanny. The wet nurse was sometimes considered a member of the family.Country areas were not immune to plague or to smallpox, and epidemic diseases gradually increased the risks of wet-nursing. By the 1800s British doctors were strongly opposed to wet-nursing on moral and scientific grounds. The practice was still common in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Russia but was opposed by campaigns encouraging women to breastfeed their own children. By the 1940s ‘wet-nursing’ normally meant expressing milk using breast pumps, which went into ‘milk banks’ for premature or sickly babies.Wet-nursing is still used in some communities where older traditions are still in place, but is no longer widely practised. - www.sciencemuseum.org.uk .","Bunty Rowe, 26, and Kyle Aldridge, 30, have cross-fed for four years .

Sean Benschop was wanted on six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of risking a catastrophe. Authorities believe the 42-year-old had been using an excavator on Wednesday when the remains of the four-storey building gave way, killing two employees and four customers, and injuring 13 others. Wanted: Sean Benschop covers his face with a red jacket as he turns himself in to Philadelphia police . Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison told The Associated Press a toxicology report showed evidence that Mr Benschop was high on marijuana.

Dangerous: Zhou Bo managed to prevent the boy from suffocating by holding him up by his feet while also balancing on stool perched on a window sill . He said: 'I went there, and saw a boy dangling in the air, as his head was stuck in between the window grid.' Zhou could see that the boy was suffocating as his feet had nothing to stand on. He dashed inside and raced up to the flat but found the door locked. He then went one floor below but discovered that the gap between that window and the dangling boy was too great. Zhou said: 'Without help, the boy would be suffocated soon, or he has the danger of dropping down'. So Zhou found a chair and balanced it precariously on the third-storey window ledge before standing on it and supporting the trapped boy's feet from underneath. 'I felt time froze, and my arms went numb but firemen still didn't arrive,' said Zhou. Finally, firefighters arrived 40 minutes later and were able to break into the apartment and pull the boy, who had been left home alone, to safety.

Rescue authorities have given up hope of finding any survivors after an asylum seeker boat carrying at least 55 people to Australia capsized in the Indian Ocean. The boat's submerged hull was spotted by air Friday, and bodies, life jackets and debris have been seen near Christmas Island, an Australian territory nearer to Indonesia than to the mainland. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority called off the air and search Sunday night based on medical advice that no one could have survived that long in the sea, a statement said. Horrifying: Australian authorities assist asylum seekers who survived their vessel capsizing - there are now 55 people feared dead . The authority and border protection officials decided Monday not to mount a new search to recover the bodies due to other demands on resources. Border Protection Command said its vessels and aircraft were busy with 'a range of high priority operations' near Christmas Island and elsewhere. It did not detail those operations. 'Our priority is responding to other vessels which may require assistance and preventing any further loss of life,' a border protection statement said. 'If operations permit, Border Protection Command will, where it remains feasible and without further risk to life, endeavor to recover any bodies which may be relocated,' it said, adding the likelihood of recovering bodies would diminish over time. Tragic: The boat's submerged hull was spotted by air Friday, and bodies, life jackets and debris have been seen near Christmas Island, an Australian territory nearer to Indonesia than to the mainland . The capsized boat was seen 120 . kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Christmas Island, which is 500 . kilometers (310 miles) south of Jakarta and 2,600 kilometers (1,600 . miles) from Perth, the nearest major Australian coastal city. A total of 13 bodies have been spotted, but ships did not interrupt the search for survivors to retrieve the dead. The . boat was stationary but appeared to not be in distress when it was . first spotted by the crew of an air force plane on Wednesday afternoon, . officials said. It was then 52 kilometers (32 miles) north of Christmas . Island, where Australia runs a detention camp for asylum seekers. The air crew counted 55 people on deck. They were mostly men, but also women and children, officials said. Many asylum seekers hope for a better life in Australia and surrounding territories - sometimes with devastating consequences. This boat was driven on to the rocks surrounding Christmas Island in December 2010 . At least 27 people died when this boat was smashed against rocks by the waves off of Christmas Island in 2010 . Their nationalities are unknown. The maritime authority's spokeswoman, Jo Meehan, said there could have been as many as 60 asylum seekers and Indonesian crew aboard. Hendra Sudirman, chief of operations at Jakarta's Search and Rescue Agency, said he had no information about the reported asylum seeker boat. He said a separate group of 48 migrants were spotted four days ago on Pecang island in the Sunda Strait. The group, which included Iranians, Afghans and Somalians, was rescued along with two Indonesian crewmen. The asylum seekers were then taken to an immigration detention center in Banten province on the western end of Java island. Because of Christmas Island's close proximity to Indonesia, it's the most popular destination for asylum seekers who pay people smugglers to take them from Indonesian ports to Australia in overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. Many of the asylum seekers come from Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka. Several of the voyages have ended in tragedy with the loss of hundreds of lives as the boats have come in increasing numbers in recent years.","The boat destined for Australia capsized in the Indian Ocean on Friday .

"and have an initial mass production of 10 tons a year starting in 2015 . By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 27 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:28 EST, 27 May 2013 . A Japanese company has created an electric blue dress made of synthetic spider silk. The company, named Spiber, have made the garment to demonstrate the different ways that the incredibly strong yet lightweight material can be used. Their artificial fibre based on spider silk is called Qmonos, from the Japanese word 'kumonosu' meaning ‘spider web’. Scroll down for video . Dressed to thrill: The striking blue dress uses synthesised genes which coax bacteria to produce fibroin, a structural protein found in spider silk . Gram for gram spider silk is five times stronger than steel and it is more flexible than nylon. If the silk was used to make body armour, it would be at least three times stronger than Kevlar, depending on the spider. Silk begins in the spinning gland as a random coil of proteins before it is passed through ducts in precise conditions of acidity, water content and chemical concentration. It is then pushed out of the spider’s body through a spinning wart. The fibre that emerges is water-resistant, partly crystal and partly coiled. The silk has been used in wound dressings, as it has antibacterial properties. Looks are deceiving: Despite its fragile appearance, spider silk is incredibly strong. The silk is composed of a complex structure of fibrils which, gram for gram, make it stronger than many metals . Spiders secrete their silk through a special gland called a spinning wart. The fibre that emerges is water insoluble, partly crystal and coiled . The high-collared cocktail dress, on display at the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, was created to demonstrate the technology behind Qmonos, according to a report by cnet. Scientists are increasingly interested in the silk because they believe it could be used for everything from parachute cords to artificial blood vessels. But the territorial nature of spiders makes it very difficult to farm spiders like silkworms. In the absence of prey they will readily resort to cannibalism too. Spider silk (the synthetic version pictured here, on reels) is five times stronger than steel and if it was used to make body armour, it would be three times stronger than Kevlar . Spiders also only produce minute amounts of silk, spinning only what they need for a web, then consuming any excess it has 'spun'. The blue dress is not the first garment . to be made from spider silk. Last year an exhibition at the . Victoria and Albert museum showcased a yellow cape made from the silk of . a Madagascar Golden orb Spider. The spider, from Madagascar creates orb-shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than Kevlar. Juvenile males also weave spider webs, but once they become adults, they abandon this behaviour and instead direct their energies solely to sex. For survival, the Darwin's bark spider relies in part on its mottled, jagged appearance, which camouflages the spider against trees and-along with Charles Darwin-inspired its name. An analysis of the Darwin's bark spider's silk indicates it's the toughest biological material discovered to date. In nature, spider silk is spun into threads, but in laboratory conditions the same proteins have been rearranged into spheres, thin films and capsules. One team of American scientists even tried to make spider silk by genetically modifying goats to produce spider silk protein in their milk. Spiber have created a manmade version using synthesised genes which coax bacteria to produce fibroin, a structural protein found in spider silk. Spiber then uses the technology to culture the microbes efficiently and weave the fibroin into fabric. The company, a spinoff from Tokyo's Keio University, has applied for 16 patents on its spider silk technology. It is also teaming up with car parts maker Kojima Industries to build a plant that can turn out about 220 pounds of the synthetic silk a month. Spiber hopes to have an initial mass production of 10 tons a year starting in 2015. ‘This fabric can be used in various industries, such as automobiles and medicine,' Spiber President Kazuhide Sekiyama told The Asahi Shimbun newspaper. ‘It is a major first step toward a manufacturing process that does not depend on petroleum.’ Even in the minute quantities in which it can be gathered, it has found a number of uses - as a fishing line, or in the crosshairs of optical instruments.","Spiber have created the silk using synthesised genes which coax bacteria to produce fibroin, a structural protein found in spider silk .

A mother of eleven children has told how she feels misrepresented by a TV documentary after she and her husband were portrayed as pub-goers who live on takeaways. Amanda and Tony Allan of Sunderland starred in the Channel 4 programme '16 Kids  and Counting', which highlights the lives of big families. After filming with the production company Lion Television for eight months, Amanda, 42, a former auxiliary nurse, was shocked when the programme was aired recently.

She said: 'They recorded us on holiday in August, and down at Seaburn beach,' 'The crew would come up for days and film us doing the school runs, and me cooking meals. 'Then when it was edited, all it showed was us at the local pub - which we wouldn't call our local - having takeaways and buying socks' 'They said that the Welcome Tavern is our favourite venue, but we haven't even been going in that long because we only moved here a few months ago. 'I've never said it was my favourite venue, and we don't even go out very much.' Amanda, who has six children from her first marriage, and five to second husband of seven years, Tony, said last Tuesday's documentary portrayed their city in a bad light and focused on moments of filming that didn't reflect their real lives. Amanda said: 'I thought it would show how well we cope with a big family and how well behaved our children are.

'My 18-year-old, Laura, who was on the show with her fiance Daniel Selvey, jumped in to say that my kids would like me to have another, but they cut that out, and she was really annoyed. 'They said it would be a heart warming documentary about every day life, I don't think it was that at all. 'We haven't said anything to Channel 4, but me and Tony have said to each other that we don't think we would be in it again.' When contacted, a spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'The documentary is a fair and accurate portrayal of what programme makers experienced during filming with the family.

They faced harsh reviews when they dropped the Yves and the calligraphy-style font during a major rebrand. And now French giant Saint Laurent come under fire again - this time for extraordinarily high pricing. First it was revealed last month that the luxury fashion house reportedly priced a jacket at £40,420. And now it has been discovered that the embellished babydoll dress Cara Delevingne wears in its latest Fall 13 campaign is being sold for an eye-watering £48,830. The mindboggling price was reported by Style.com in an article about the opening of a new Saint Laurent store in New York's Soho. The jacket cost £43,000, and the cut is based on the Le Smoking suit style form the 1960s . A photograph of an original vintage Le Smoking Look suit - approximately sold for £349 altogether at the time . The jacket was available to buy on . the British Saint Laurent site up until three weeks ago before it disappeared. After the price was reported on multiple fashion sites, reporters from the Fashion Spot say that they made contact with YSL's . personal shopper service and were told the jacket was not in stock . anywhere in Europe. They were not able to find a record of the garment . ever having been sold in the US, and it was not known whether the jacket was removed, or had simply sold out. The item description for the expensive leopard print jacket calls it an 'open jacket in grain de poudre wool' - the luxe wool Saint Lauren use to make their Le . Smoking suits. But the item contains only 10 per cent of this fabric. The rest is made up of 80 per . cent polyester and 10 per cent satin. Saint Laurent Paris currently sells Le Smoking tuxedo trousers made entirely from grain de poudre wool for less than £1,000. The jacket, while composed of fancy sequin embroidery in Saint Laurent's signature babycat leopard print, is made almost entirely of synthetic fibres. One web user, named fashionista-ta said in the Fashion Spot's forum thread: 'I can understand needing to cut costs on this piece, but what about non-virgin wool instead of polyester?? Even (perhaps especially) filthy rich people sweat.' Cara Delevingne, wearing the £40,000 dress, lets out her inner grunge rock chick in the new campaign . Showing off the embellished dress, the three minute advert focuses on this item in particular . Recent reports say prices at luxury . brands are determined by analysts whose interest lies in creating giant profit margins, sometimes even against a designer's . wishes. They decide on costs to consumers according to what they think customers are willing to spend on high fashion, not what it . costs to produce it. And with shoppers willing to pay the price, it looks as though these kinds of high price points might just be the new norm at the fashion house. ShopStyle fashion expert Sian O'Flaherty told the MailOnline: 'Obviously, the average person could never afford a £43,000 dress (are we sure those 000's aren't a typo?!). 'That said, the artistry that has been put into high-end designer pieces is what makes them so unique, and is why I am so  inspired by the fashion that comes out of the high-end designer labels.' The Fashion Spot enquired with the . Saint Laurent press office for information on the production of the . jacket and how the brand determined the price, but have not heard back. We contacted Saint Laurent this morning with similar questions and are yet to hear back from them. Dana Thomas, the journalist who wrote Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster, an exposé about how luxury became a global, multibillion dollar industry, answered some of the Fashion Spot's questions about how brands determine price: . 'When it comes to brands in major groups, the sole motivating factor is profits. The designers can dream up beautiful designs, but the number crunchers will cut costs wherever they can to raise the profit margin. 'I also know that at times, designers like to use cheap fabrics not because they don't cost much but because of the effect they cause creatively. But even if the fabric costs $2 a metre, and the dress costs $50 to produce, the number crunchers will price it at $3,000 retail. Because they can. 'One designer told me a case where this happened and he even protested the high price. And the number crunchers didn't care. Their argument: consumers will pay it. And they did.​'","Jacket made of 80% polyester has price of £40,420 .

Costly: More than 900 doctors surgeries around the UK still have 0844 phone numbers - with many taking a cut of the call charges to their patients . Hundreds of GPs are still making patients pay just to call for an appointment – despite the practice being banned three years ago. The Department of Health has outlawed the use of premium rate 0844 numbers for NHS services but more than 900 surgeries are still using them. Calling a family doctor on an 0844 line costs up to 41p a minute from a mobile and 5p a minute plus a 13p set-up fee from a BT landline. Most surgeries using such lines take a slice of the call charges run up by patients, which generally range from 2p-7p a minute. This means patients are effectively subsidising their family doctors. David Hickson, founder of the Fair Telecoms Campaign, which fights for consumer rights, said: ‘The NHS is funded by taxation. ‘It is unacceptable that GPs take an additional tax on our calls. That tax by telephone is unacceptable. ‘The fundamental principles of our NHS do not permit providers to fund services at the expense of patients.’ His research shows that 839 surgeries in England, plus 40 in Scotland, 38 in Wales and 21 in Northern Ireland are still using 0844 numbers. This defies official regulations issued in April 2010 ruling that NHS bodies, including GPs, should not charge more for a call than the cost of dialling a local number. Many GPs were encouraged to install expensive state-of-the-art systems by telecom companies on the basis the cost would be covered through call charges to patients. Mr Hickson said this was a poor decision and doctors should carry the cost instead of passing it on. Customers of Virgin Mobile are charged . 41p a minute to call an 0844 number while the figure is 40p with Orange . and T-Mobile. A ten-minute call, which includes being put on hold, could . cost as much as £4.10. Unfair: The Fair Telecoms Campaign argues that NHS GPs are funded by Government taxation - and they do not have the right to impose an additional levy on patients calling their surgeries (stock image) ‘GPs were given 12 months from April 2010 to change their numbers but they did not do it,’ said Mr Hickson. ‘This needs to stop now.’ He said the surgeries should switch to 03 numbers, which carry the same charges as 01 and 02 with no extras. New rules from Ofcom will require organisations such as GP surgeries to reveal how much they receive per minute from premium rate lines. Campaigners hope this will shame the culprits into action. The British Medical Association said many of the GPs involved will have to wait until long-term  contracts with telecom firms end. Dr Laurence Buckman said surgeries had been encouraged by officials to sign up. ‘Services have improved as a result but it is understandable patients are irritated,’ he added.","More than 900 surgeries around the UK are still using costly 0844 numbers .

A senior Navy Commander in San Diego has been fired after he asked female sailors to send him sexy photos of themselves and to give him 'a good back massage' in a string of sleazy cell phone messages and emails. Commander Allen Maestas, the No. 2 officer being groomed to take over the city's Naval Beach Group 1 unit, was relieved of his position on May 16 after complaints from his female staff sparked an investigation into his 'inappropriate' conduct. The incriminating text messages, released by the Navy on Tuesday, include a series to one sailor under his command in which he wrote 'weekends sorta suck cause I don't get to see you until Monday' and 'I'm jealous u r in (pa)jamas. I wish I could join u.' Fired: Commander Allen Maestas, pictured, was fired on May 16 following an investigation that found he'd been sending inappropriate text messages to female sailors . He also sent the same woman messages requesting she send photos of herself to him in shorts or 'in any pose' and wrote 'Sure wish U could give a good back massage.' The executive officer repeatedly mentioned another female sailor's truck and even offered to wash it if her boyfriend couldn't do it. According to U-T San Diego the sailor was so uncomfortable she sold the vehicle to avoid further remarks from Maestas. The explosive messages were made public in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from U-T San Diego. More than one woman said the messages Maestas fired off made her uncomfortable, according to the investigation report. The report also found Maestas used smiley faces after offensive remarks to women so he could later claim that he was joking. Headquarters: The No. 2 officer was being groomed to take over the city's Naval Beach Group 1 unit, located at the San Diego naval base, pictured . Initially, the executive officer, whose decorations include a Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, and five Navy Commendation Medals, denied any wrongdoing in an interview with investigators. However, later the same day he admitted that problems at home had led him to let his professional standards 'slip' at work. 'I started allowing myself to have conversations with my subordinates that I wouldn't normally have,' he wrote in a statement contained in the FOI documents. 'I was looking for someone to talk to.' Any further information relating to his family situation was redacted from the report. According to U-T San Diego, investigators concluded Maestas inquired about the personal lives of his female staff because he was genuinely interested in helping them. But they said he used this as a pretext for 'improper familiarity.' San Diego's Naval Surface Forces spokesman Commander Tamsen Reese told MailOnline on Wednesday that the messages were 'inappropriate and unprofessional and did not respect the senior-subordinate relationship.' 'Sailors deserve an environment where they feel comfortable in the work place,' she said, adding that the Navy held its leadership to a high standard and Maestas' treatment was an example of that. Maestas served in the enlisted ranks before he graduated from the University of Utah and was commissioned in 1995. He has served several ship-board deployments and also a year in Afghanistan to assist in training the Afghan army.","Commander Allen Maestas was the No. 2 officer at San Diego's Naval Beach Group 1 unit .

These days I see no light I wake up not wanting to wake up. There was a time I saw my life with you, a future with you. But you shattered my dreams. I feel dead inside. I've never given so much of myself to someone or cared so much. You returned my love with cheating and lies. It didn't matter how many gifts I gave you or how beautiful I looked for you. I was scared of getting pregnant but I gave myself completely. When I first met you I was driven, ambitious and disciplined. Then I fell for you, a love I thought would bring out the best in me. I don't know why destiny brought us together. After all the pain, the rape, the abuse, the torture I have seen previously I didn't deserve this. I didn't see any love or commitment from you. I just became increasingly scared that you would hurt me mentally or physically. Your life was about partying and women. Mine was you and my work. If I stay here I will crave you and miss you. So, I am kissing my 10-year career and dreams goodbye. I never went with anyone else. I am a loyal person. No other woman will give you as much as I did or love you as much as I did. I can write that in my blood... You never even met my sister. I bought your sister presents... You never appreciated my love, kicked me in the face... The Goa trip was my birthday present but even after you cheated I still spent on you. I aborted our baby when it hurt me deeply... I wish you had loved me like I loved you...

A transgender girl and an elementary school that required the fifth-grader to use a staff bathroom instead of the girls restroom clashed before Maine's highest court today. The judge will decide whether Nicole Maines' rights were violated, a case that lays bare the difficult decisions facing school administrators. The 15-year-old student is a biological male, who has an identical twin brother Jonas, but from an early age Nicole identified as a girl. Identical twins: Jonas Maines, left, and his transgender sister, Nicole Maines, stand outside the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor, Maine - they were born twin boys . The family and the Maine Human Rights Commission sued, but a judge in the state's lower Superior Court ruled that the Orono school district acted within its discretion by requiring her to use a staff bathroom after there was a complaint about the student using the girls bathroom. After Wednesday's hearing, the student, Nicole Maines, who's now 15 and attending a high school in southern Maine, said she wouldn't wish her experience on anyone else and hope the justices hear her out. 'I hope they understood how important it is for students to be able to go to school and get an education and have fun and make friends, and not have to worry about being bullied by students or administration, and be accepted for who they are,' the sophomore said. At issue is whether the school violated the Maine Human Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation. But state law also requires separate bathrooms for boys and girls in schools. Fighting in human rights case: Nicole Maines, right, stands with her brother Jonas Maines, and her mother, Kelly Maines, during a hearing before the Maine Supreme Court after she was made to use staff bathrooms at school . Court hearing: Chief Justice Leigh Sauffley of the Maine Supreme Court, speaks during the hearing of arguments over a school district's handling of Nicole Maine's restroom needs . Melissa Hewey, lawyer for the school and school district, said afterward it should be up to the Legislature to clarify the issue. 'To the extent that the people in Maine decide that this law in Maine should be changed, then that should be done. But right now the law is what it is, and our school district didn't violate it,' she said. The case goes beyond just the bathroom issue to the broader question of what's best for transgender students, said Jennifer Levi, director of Transgender Rights Project for the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders. 'At the core of this case is whether the promise of equal educational opportunities for transgender students is realized,' she said. It's a topic that school administrators are grappling with nationwide. Policies about transgender adults are . still evolving, and the thinking about how to handle children who . identify with the gender opposite of the sex they're born with is even . more complex. Last year, the American Psychiatric Association removed 'gender identity disorder' from its list of mental health ailments. Emotional case: Nicole Maines is a biological male who from an early age identified as a girl . Attorney's statement: Jennifer Levi, attorney for transgender student Nicole Maines, second from left, speaks to reporters outside the Penobscot Judicial Center . And the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics filed a brief urging that transgender children be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. School officials initially allowed her to use the girls bathroom in her school, but the policy was altered after the grandfather of a fifth-grade boy complained to school officials. Maines' attorneys said she felt like she was singled out by having to use the staff bathroom. The family and their child are not identified in the lawsuit alleging discrimination under the Maine Human Rights Act. But they've since been identified Wayne and Kelly Maines and their identical twins, Nicole and Jonas. Wayne Maines struggled to maintain his composure as he gave a brief statement outside the Penobscot Judicial Center, where the Maine Supreme Judicial Court heard the arguments. 'It has been extremely difficult, but I'm pleased to be here and to have our case heard, and I'm very hopeful for a good outcome,' he said, with Nicole, Jonas and his wife at his side.","Nicole Maines, 15, is a biological male but identifies as a girl .

The biggest trial ever held in Germany of Neo-Nazis since WW2 will get underway in Munich today. Security will be unparalleled for the trial of Beate Zschaepe, a female member of an extreme right-wing terror cell which killed nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period. The 38-year-old Miss Zschaepe has been dubbed the ‘Nazi Mare’ by the German press. Charged with participation in all 10 executions, 15 robberies, setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons, Zschaepe could expect, under normal German law, to be out after 15 years if convicted. But prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called “particularly grievous guilt” which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever. Sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court, snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout Bavaria has been cancelled. Zschaepe, idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread “right-wing propaganda,” is branded by Germany’s federal prosecutor Harald Range as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders. But the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop her and her group, which was composed of Zschaepe and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers. German police and intelligence agencies are braced for an outpouring of public scorn as their collective failings are set to be exposed. No link was ever made between the National Socialist Underground group and the killings, despite a vast covert intelligence network. Victims of the far right terror group NSU.

It has led to charges that certain police and intelligence chiefs wanted to protect the NSU because they admired them, although claims of a conspiracy have been fiercely rejected. The group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-Nazis who dreamed of a Fourth Reich. During the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made; the assassins hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into Germany’s immigrant population who would begin leaving en-masse. They went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country. The cell imploded on November 4 2011 when her male accomplices Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt botched a bank raid. In a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture, Mundlos shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself. Zschaepe, as instructed, blew up their hideout in the east German city of Zwickau. But the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence, including videotapes in which the trio boasted of their crimes. Days later, as a massive manhunt stretched across the country, she turned herself in.","Beate Zschaepe, member of extreme right-wing terror cell, today faces trial .

An outbreak of hepatitis A linked to a frozen berry mix sold at Costco has grown to 87 people across eight states. Illnesses have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Washington, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Food and Drug Administration and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have linked the illnesses to Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend, a mix of berries and pomegranate seeds produced by Townsend Farms in Oregon. Outbreak: Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend of frozen berries sold through Costco stores . The company recalled the product from stores last week. So far the illnesses have only been linked to the berries sold at Costco. Craig Wilson, director of food safety at Costco, said the store is providing vaccinations for people who ate the berries within the last two weeks and is reimbursing others who have gotten the vaccine elsewhere. The store has contacted about 240,000 people who purchased the berries at one of their stores, Mr Wilson said. The company knows who bought the berries because purchases are linked to a membership card that customers present when they check out. The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the cause of the outbreak. Infection: Costco, pictured, has pulled Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend products from its shelves . The CDC said the strain of hepatitis is rarely seen in North or South America but is found in the North Africa and Middle East regions. Townsend Farms has said the frozen organic blend bag includes pomegranate seeds from Turkey. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that can last from a few weeks to a several months. People often contract it when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand hygiene. The CDC said that food already contaminated with the virus can also cause outbreaks, as is suspected in this case. Contaminated: Frozen berries, pictured, have been linked to an outbreak of hepatitis A . Illnesses occur within 15 to 50 days of exposure to the hepatitis A virus, CDC said. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, abnormal liver tests, dark urine and pale stool. Vaccination can prevent illness if given within two weeks of exposure, and those who have already been vaccinated are unlikely to become ill. CDC said the illnesses date back to mid-March. The same genotype of hepatitis A was identified in an outbreak in Europe linked to frozen berries this year as well as a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt. The agency said there is no evidence the outbreaks are related. Lawsuits have already been filed against Townsend Farms in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Washington state, with more expected in the other affected states, according to a spokesman for Seattle-based food safety lawyer Bill Marler. The class action lawsuits ask for compensation for the treatment and also reimbursement for the vaccines.","87 people infected, at least nine of them hospitalized .

The support team for Australian endurance swimmer Chloe McCardel says she has ended her attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida. A news release Wednesday night says the swim ended after 11 hours due to a 'debilitating' jelly fish sting. She was trying to become the first person to swim across the Straits of Florida nonstop without a shark cage. Scroll down for video . Australian swimmer Chloe McCardel had to abandon her plan to swim from Cuba to Florida after 11 hours due to a 'debilitating' jelly fish sting . Just 11 hours earlier, McCardel had jumped feet-first into calm, balmy waters off Cuba and began stroking steadily out to sea in a bid to make a record swim . from Havana to Florida without a protective shark cage. She was smiling, upbeat and had arrived in . the morning at a rocky jetty in Havana's Hemingway Marina in a pink . 1950s Chevy convertible. She . carefully adjusted her black swim cap and goggles while her husband . applied grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing. McCardel had expected to spend about 60 hours in the sea before reaching the Florida Keys, a little more than 100 miles to the northeast . 'As confident as I can be. I think it's all going to work out well,' the 28-year-old said at the time. 'It'll be tough, though. It's not going to be an easy ride, but we'll get through it as a team.' McCardel had planned to take about 60 hours to get to the Florida Keys, a little more than 160 kilometers (100 miles)  to the northeast, braving sharks and jellyfish along the way. The current weather report for that window is clear. The sea off Havana was flat and glassy Wednesday, precisely the ideal conditions that McCardel's science team had forecast. Australian swimmer Chloe McCardel adjusts her earplugs as her husband applies grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing . The Florida Strait has been busy the last three summers, with fellow marathon swimmers Diana Nyad and Penny Palfrey making four failed attempts at the crossing between them since 2011. Australian Susie Maroney successfully made the swim in 1997, though she did it with the benefit of a shark cage. 'It is the hardest swim in the world today,' McCardel said earlier at a news conference in the Cuban capital. 'No one has been able to achieve this. It's possibly harder than winning the World Cup or getting a gold medal.' The challenge also outstrips by far, at least in terms of distance, anything she's done before. McCardel, who has twice made a double crossing of the English Channel, said the most time she's spent in the water continuously is 25 hours. She is swimming under English Channel Marathon rules, which means she cannot touch her support boat or hold onto anything. Nor can she wear a full-body wetsuit, which would help protect against exposure and jellyfish stings, or use a shark cage. This is the moment McCardel jumped into the water at Hemingway Marina to start her swim to Florida from Havana, Cuba . McCardel puts on her goggles as she prepares to jump into the water and start her swim to Florida from Havana, Cuba . A piece of equipment called a Shark Shield creates an electromagnetic field around her in the water, discouraging the predators from getting too close. McCardel had planned to stop every half-hour or so to sip an energy drink, preferring that to solid foods. She and her team have spent the last nine and a half months planning the trip and studying others' attempts to try to figure out why they were unable to complete the swim. They picked June for their bid in a bit of a tradeoff: While seas are warmer later in the summer, this month typically sees lower concentrations of box jellyfish, whose dangerous stings have scuttled past attempts. They even took the lunar cycle into account. Moonlight attracts jellyfish to the surface, and that should be less of a problem as she sets off under a new moon. McCardel said she believes she can succeed where others fell short because she has assembled an unprecedented team that includes scientists on land who are experts on the Gulf Stream current that flows through the straits. They will be crunching data in real . time and feeding information to her support boat, a 44-foot catamaran . dubbed the 'Sunluver,' so the mission can dodge things such as the . powerful eddies that have swept others off course. 'The advantage that this gives us is that we can foresee 10, 20, 30 kilometers ahead,' she said. 'So if we can slightly change our . course to avoid things in the future, we're less likely to get picked up . by an eddy off the Gulf Stream and pushed in the wrong direction.' Still, she acknowledged there's no way to guarantee nature's cooperation. 'The Gulf Stream... it's like a wild animal,' McCardel said. 'You cannot predict it that much in . advance, so you cannot take historical data from Penny Palfrey or Diana . Nyad's swim and say, well, this is what happened to them, therefore if . we don't do exactly the same then we'll have a better outcome.' Map: the treacherous route from Havana to Florida that McCardel will take for the 160-km swim . It would seem an unlikely dream for a woman who didn't even learn to swim until she was 10 years old. McCardel, who makes a living doing . first-aid training, and her husband took out a second mortgage on their . Melbourne home to fund the $150,000 in costs associated with the swim. So far they have made about half of . it back through sponsorships, and leaned heavily on volunteers on . donations. She's also hoping to raise money for cancer research and to . support people who suffer from the disease. At the marina Wednesday morning . McCardel was just about to hop into the water when suddenly she turned . around and called out for her husband, Paul. 'I love you,' she said, giving him a quick kiss. 'Thank you. Bye!'

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . PUBLISHED: . 05:42 EST, 11 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:42 EST, 11 June 2013 . Strauss-Kahn had been charged by judges over alleged involvement in a vice ring that procured prostitutes . Dominique Strauss-Kahn was today on course to avoid all criminal charges relating to a prostitution ring because of ‘insufficient evidence’. The former International Monetary Fund chief had been facing prison for ‘aggravated pimping’. It was alleged that he and a number of other powerful Frenchmen had organised sex parties all over the world, using the Carlton Hotel in Lille as their base. The so-called Carlton Affair saw Strauss-Kahn admit to attending many of the orgies, but he denied knowing that any of the women were prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn spent a night in prison during the enquiry, but prosecutors have now recommended that the case against him is dismissed. It is the latest in a string of legal victories for Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to rape women in both New York and Paris. The 64-year-old, who was once tipped to become the Socialist President of France, figures prominently in the 6,800-page dossier into the Carlton Affair, but the judge in the case is now set to accept the prosecutors’ recommendation that there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution, and let him go. In 2011 Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her. Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was consensual, but Strauss Kahn was forced to step down from his $500,000-a-year job at the IMF. Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of which have never been disclosed. Last October, a French prosecutor dropped a criminal investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible gang rape in Washington DC. A Belgian woman withdrew her allegations, and said she would not press charges, despite initially insisting she had been attacked by Strauss Kahn. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape two years ago when Tristane Banon, a young Paris writer, said he had tried to rape her in 2003. But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a counter claim in France, alleging slander. Earlier this month, Strauss Kahn was involved in a fresh sex scandal, as claims emerged that he tried to assault an Italian television journalist in the late 1990s. Myrta Merlino was forced to fight off the former IMF chief in a hotel room in Davos, it is alleged. The allegations come just as the shamed economist begins to rehabilitate his damaged image. Since his 20-year marriage to French journalist Anne Sinclair came to an end last year, Mr Strauss Kahn has been regularly seen with Moroccan-born TV press officer Myriam Aouffir, who is 20 years his junior.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn faced charges related to 'aggravated pimping'

A wave of car bombings rocked central and northern Iraq today killing at least 57 people during the deadliest eruption of violence to hit the country in years. Attackers initially targeted market-goers early yesterday, then turned their sights on police and army posts after sunset. Security forces scrambled to contain the violence, blocking a key road in central Iraq and imposing a curfew in the former Sunni insurgent stronghold of Mosul after the blasts went off. Increasing violence: Civilians gather at the site of a car bomb attack at Jadidat al-Shatt in Diyala province, 40 km north of Baghdad, yesterday . Killing in Iraq has spiked to levels not seen since 2008. The surge in bloodshed, which follows months of protests by the country's Sunni Arab minority against the Shiite-led government, is raising fears that Iraq is heading for another bout of uncontrollable sectarian violence. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks - as has been the case for much of the violence in recent weeks - but coordinated car bombings in civilian areas and against security forces are frequently the work of al Qaida's front group in Iraq, known as the Islamic State of Iraq. The deadliest single attack hit Diyala province when three parked car bombs exploded virtually simultaneously around a wholesale fruit and vegetable market at the height of business in the town of Jidaidat al-Shatt. The town is just outside the provincial capital of Baqouba, about 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. The blasts killed 15 people and wounded 46. Soon after the explosions, security forces sealed the roads linking Baqouba to Baghdad in an apparent effort to prevent further attacks.

Shortly after midday yesterday, another car bomb went off near a fish market in the northern Baghdad suburb of Taji, killing seven shoppers and wounding 25, police said. In the northern city of Tuz Khormato, police said a parked car bomb exploded near a small outdoor market just before the sunset, killing three people and wounding 22. The town is about 130 miles north of Baghdad. The three car bombs used in the attack near Baqouba were deployed in different locations in and around the market in order to inflict the most damage and casualties, police said. One of the vehicles was a pickup truck loaded with produce that was parked inside the market. Last Friday, Diyala was the site of another deadly bombing. A suicide attacker drove an explosives-laden car into a bus carrying Iranian Shiite pilgrims visiting holy shrines in Iraq, killing 11 and wounding more than two dozen. The attack took place in the town of Muqdadiyah, about 60 miles north of Baghdad. Bombing at Jadidat al-Shatt in Diyala province was one of numerous attacks to hit northern and central Iraq . Last night, a rapid-fire wave of car bombings erupted in the volatile northern city of Mosul, killing at least 14 and wounding dozens. Police in Mosul said one suicide bomber rammed his car into a police post, killing seven police and one civilian. In another attack, a bomber detonated his vehicle at a security checkpoint, killing three. A similar attack on another checkpoint killed three police. A suicide car bomber also struck a security checkpoint near Madain, about 12 miles southeast of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and wounding 10 others, according to police. Four others were killed when a bomb exploded near a cafe in the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City in Baghdad. Police said the blast injured 12. Another explosion in the al-Ameen neighborhood in southeastern Baghdad wounded six. Hospital officials confirmed the death tolls.","Bombers targeted market-goers before attacking police and army posts .
