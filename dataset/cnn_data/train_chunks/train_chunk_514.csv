A flamboyant aristocrat who left a £1million island to the National Trust of Scotland has had his gift rejected. Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, whose bed-hopping, colourful life was said to be the model for James Bond, wanted to leave ownership of Little Bernera off the coast of the Isle of Lewis to the nation, but a rare decision the NTS rejected the offer. The conservation charity said they rejected the island because Little Bernera is not 'significant' enough to warrant the cost it would take to keep. Island aristocrat: Count Robin preferred his small farmhouse on the Outer Hebrides island of Great Bernera, which he owned, to a castle. He served as a 'cover identity' for fiction's most famous spy .

Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook . Only a few weeks ago, the NTS described the bequest as ""an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life.' However, a spokesman for the Trust, confirmed that in recent years it has not taken charge of heritage properties without an endowment to help meet their maintenance costs. 'With regret, the Trust is declining the generous bequest of the island of Little Bernera made by the late Count Robin Mirrlees,’ he said. 'We have taken this decision having made a full assessment of the island in terms of its heritage significance. 'Whilst it is of undoubted value, it would not bridge any gaps within our existing portfolio of nationally important properties and would incur significant cost obligations. Unspoiled: The beach on the island of Little Bernera which the National Trust of Scotland have rejected after being left it in the will of Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees . 'The property did not come with an endowment and we would have had to draw resources away from other, more significant sites to meet those obligations. 'This is not to say that we do not welcome bequests of property but we had no prior warning of the count's intentions and if we had, we might have been able to propose different alternatives in his lifetime. 'If anyone is considering leaving a historic property or landscape to the Trust, we would always urge them to make contact with us at the earliest stage. Picturesque: The view over the islands just off the Isle of Lewis . 'It is our understanding that, in accordance with Count Mirrlees' will, Little Bernera will now be subsumed within the rest of his estate and be passed on to a family member as per his wishes.' However a group of crofters has been preparing to launch a community buy-out of the uninhabited island - and neighbouring Great Bernera where the count was laird of the 230-strong community. Crofters hope to use right-to-buy legislation to take ownership of the 250-acre island and the larger Greater Bernera, which has been left to the count's grandson Cyran. However, Stornoway-based solicitor Ken MacDonald, whose office has been dealing with the count's estate, said there are no current plans for sale. The count's son Patrick de la Lanne - the 50-year-old mayor of Delmenhorst in Lower Saxony - from a long relationship with Duchess Margarethe of Wurttemberg, a granddaughter of Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, was disinherited by his father. Clear blue sea: The uninhibited island of Little Bernera donated to, but rejected by the National Trust . Count Robin, who once acted as the Queen's Herald - and was a descendant of King Louis-Phillipe I of France - died at the age of 87 in June. He left instructions for Little Bernera to be gifted to the NTS. The close friend of 007 author Ian Fleming once jokingly promised in a radio interview to leave the island to Prince Harry. In 1996 the Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne explored the island and dined by the sea during a cruise of the Western Isles aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia. The island, which has been referred to as 'one of the last specks of land before North America', boasts fertile soil, golden sandy beaches and a ruined church which, according to folklore, has its own resident spectre. In 2000 the Count touted the isle to TV producers as the ideal place to film a reality show featuring castaway city-dwellers. Playboy: Count Robin's success with glamorous, well-heeled women was also mirrored in the Bond novels . But it was in August that solicitor . Ken MacDonald, who has been dealing with the estate of the count, . revealed that Little Bernera would be given to the Edinburgh-based NTS. NTS officials, who already maintain the islands of Canna and St Kilda in the Hebrides, were astonished by the development. Bill . Gardner, the Trust's development manager for legacies, said then: 'This . is an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an . extraordinary life. 'Once we . receive official confirmation we will assess the island's ecology and . landscape as to how it can be best conserved for the nation in the light . of any conditions attached to the bequest.' However . NTS has also come under recent criticism for its stewardship on Canna . where since 2010, 20 residents - five sevenths of the population - have . left or declared their intention to leave. Little Bernera has been uninhabited for more than 150 years. Influence: Count Robin was deeply involved in helping Ian Fleming (left) research James Bond’s adventures for the novel On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The film starred George Lazenby (right) as 007, who posed as genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, a cover inspired by the count's job as heraldic researcher at the College Of Arms in London . The . Count, an Oxford graduate and World War 2 veteran, took part in the . Queen's coronation in full regalia in his role of Rouge Dragon . Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary and was later invested as a Knight of . Honour . A legendary womaniser, his sole marriage, aged 45 - to a nurse half his age - lasted less than one week. He assisted Fleming with research for On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Bond's cover role in the story - a heraldic researcher at the College of Arms in London - was based on the aristocrat, who served in that post between 1952 and 1967. The Count also came up with the phrase 'The world is not enough', which became the spy's motto, and many years after Fleming's death, the title of a Bond movie. In 1993, the one-time multimillionaire briefly put Little Bernera up for sale after discovering his fortune was fast evaporating. A newspaper advert claimed it would be possible to build residential accommodation for intrepid holidaymakers and concluded: 'What an excellent opportunity is now afforded to purchase a part of dear old Scotland'. He was persuaded to hold on to the island and dedicated his final years to meditating and reading tracts on Buddhism and 'mystic philosophy'. The count also had a worldwide property portfolio - including residences in France, Sicily and Inchdrewer Castle in Banff. Count Robin, formerly known as Robin Ian Evelyn Stuart Grinnell-Milne, Comte de la Lanne-Mirrlees, titular Prince of Coronata-Gualtieri, bequeathed his assets in a will registered in the Books of the Lord Council and Session after his June 23 death.","Island was rejected by NTS because there was no money for maintenance costs .

Iain Duncan Smith said Barack Obama's White House had seen the national debt rise from $500billion to $1.3trillion . Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith appears to have taken sides in the US election, less than 48 hours before Americans go to the polls. In an apparent break with impartiality before polling day, the senior Conservative defended Republican Mitt Romney from claims he is ‘stupid’ while warning Democrat Barack Obama’s economic strategy had created a ‘very worrying picture indeed’. The comments from a senior member of the UK government less than two days before voting takes place are likely to raise eyebrows on both sides of the Atlantic. The Conservatives are aligned to the Republicans, but David Cameron has played up his relationship with Mr Obama who remains hugely popular in the UK. British ministers of all parties have traditionally avoided commenting on foreign elections, because their government will have to work with whoever wins, particularly when the result is too close to call. But Mr Duncan Smith used a radio interview to hit out at the ‘appalling demonisation’ of Mr Romney while warning Mr Obama’s presidency had seen the US deficit had rise ‘gone from something like $500billion to $1.3trillion or so’. However, Downing Street today appeared to distance itself from the remarks. Asked whether David Cameron shared Mr Duncan Smith's concerns, the Prime Minister's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: ‘I don't think it is appropriate for me to be commenting on the US and the US economy and the record over the last few years this week.’ Mr Duncan Smith insisted he did not know Mr Romney personally, and was not necessarily a ‘fan’. But the Work and Pensions Secretary told BBC Radio 5Live: ‘The demonisation of Mitt Romney over here has been appalling really. He may have faults. All politicians have faults. But this is a guy who ran a state very well. ‘He got their debts and deficit down. He's turned around businesses. Whatever else you may say about him, he is not stupid, and he is made out to be stupid over here.’ David Cameron has garnered positive publicity from his relationship with Barack Obama including hosting a Downing Street barbecue in May last year . Mr Romney’s visit to the UK this summer was dominated by gaffes, including questioning preparations for the Olympics saying it was ‘hard to know just how well it will turn out’. He also described ‘looking out of the backside of 10 Downing Street’ and referred to Ed Miliband as ‘Mr Leader’. Mr Romney faced fifficult questions when he visited Downing Street in July . But Mr Duncan Smith blamed the British . media: ‘I think sometimes our reporting ... particularly the print media . have tended to convey a very shallow two-dimensional fight. ‘The American election has been appallingly reported, I think, in the UK. It has been misrepresented, the whole nature of it.’ He went on to cast doubt about on Mr Obama’s attempts to turn the US economy around by borrowing more money. ‘We don't want the American economy to go off the edge of a cliff, but at the same time, we can't sustain the level of debt that America is piling up with its increased deficits. ‘The present administration, they've gone from something like $500billion to $1.3trillion or so, so there comes a moment when these have to be paid back. 'So while we want America to grow, we also don't want it to grow though on just simply stacked up borrowed debt.’ Highlighting the importance of an American recovery to Britain's prospects, Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The fact that it (the US economy) hasn't bounced back from this recession, arguably for the first time since the war, makes it a very worrying picture indeed - with unemployment really historically very high in the US and really not a lot of serious new economic activity taking place.’","Work and Pensions Secretary breaks with the convention of British ministers not commenting on foreign elections .

Homeless families could be sent hundreds of miles away from the areas of London they hail from because councils are desperately trying to save money. As the Government prepares to cap housing benefit allowances at £400 per week from April, local authorities in the capital are buying or renting houses in places like Manchester, Merthr Tydfil and Hull, it has been revealed. Council bosses say rising rental costs in their areas coupled with Coalition cuts are forcing them to send the homeless to places nowhere near their own neighbourhoods. Dispossessed: Families from London are being sent all over Britain because their councils will not house them nearby (file picture) So instead they are acquiring properties in counties around London like Kent, Essex, Sussex and Berkshire as well as much further afield. But the Government has said clearly that 'as far as is reasonably practicable' they must offer housing in their own area. This was because it was discovered that . Newham Council, one of the Olympic boroughs, had decided to relocate . people to Stoke-on-Trent, to the fury of then housing minister Grant Shapps. But critics have said London councils have no choice. Angry: Former Housing Minister Grant Shapps was furious when it was revealed that councils were considering sending families across the country . Alison Garnham, chief executive, of the Child Poverty Action Group told the Guardian: 'Families are facing the . impossible situation of being told to move to cheaper accommodation that . just doesn't exist with London's rising rents. London boroughs are . staring at a black hole in their budgets as a result, with costs . transferred from central to local government. 'There's still time for government to do the sensible thing and think . again when these reforms are debated in parliament before thousands of . London's families find themselves uprooted, overcrowded and thrown into . turmoil.' London councils have acquired rental properties in Luton, Northampton, Broxbourne, Gravesend, Dartford, Slough, Windsor, Margate, Hastings, Epping Forest, Thurrock and Basildon in preparation for welfare cuts, the Guardian has found. 'It is going to be practically impossible to provide affordable accommodation to meet our homelessness duties in London,' Ken Jones, director of housing and strategy at Barking and Dagenham council in east London told the paper. 'As the pressures increase we will be looking to procure well out of London, and even out of the home counties.' One cabinet member for housing in an inner city borough added: 'Let's . face it, a lot of people with more than two or three children, and who . are dependent on benefits in this borough are not going to be here for . very much longer.' Olympic borough: Newham, the home of the Olympic Park, was accused of trying to send people to Stoke-on-Trent . The 33 London councils were asked if they were already placing people outside of London and more than half said told the Guardian they already were. But the Coalition insists that councils do not need to do this. 'It is neither acceptable, fair nor necessary for local authorities to place families far away from their area. The law is already clear that local authorities must secure accommodation within their own borough so far as reasonably practicable, and new rules will reinforce this,' a housing spokesman said. 'Our reforms restore fairness to a system that was allowed to spiral out of control under the previous government. It's not right that some families living on benefits should be able to live in areas of London that hard-working families could simply never afford to stay in.'","Local authorities say sky-high rental costs in the capital, combined with the incoming benefits cap has forced them to send people miles away from home .

Changes: Criminal Justice Minister Damian Green is scrapping committal hearings to cut cases by up to six weeks . Criminals are to be brought to justice 'within weeks not months' under new plans to abolish committal hearings - the first stage of the court process. Around 60,000 of the short hearings happen every year, where magistrates decide whether the accused has a case to answer. These will now be axed in 29 areas of England and Wales, cutting the length of a case by up to six weeks. Criminal Justice Minister Damian Green says it will be trialled outside of London, including in Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham. But some solicitors are worried that removing a tier of justice could be damaging - although it is very rare that a case is ever thrown out at this stage. 'Abolishing committal . hearings is another one of the steps we are taking to make justice . swift and sure and to ensure our courts run efficiently and effectively . for victims, witnesses and the taxpayers who fund them,' Mr Green said. 'The justice system needs continued improvement, and this announcement is an important step forward.' Committal hearings are usually used to officially transfer a case . from magistrates courts, where less serious crimes are dealt with, to the . Crown Court, which handles the most serious offences. They were abolished in 2001 for 'indictable only' offences like . murder, which have to be heard at a crown court because of their . seriousness. But now committal hearings for 'either-way' offences, like some . burglaries and drugs cases, which can be dealt with either at the magistrates of crown court, will also be scrapped. Cuts: Losing Committals will mean more than 60,000 hearings will go each year, saving time and money . This will be replaced by new 'sending' procedures, where magistrates . will make a decision on where the case will be heard in full without the . need for a hearing. But experts say that the changes could in fact slow the courts process, not speed it up. “I do have concerns that the sending procedure for either-way offences . may result in delays in the crown court while evidence is served, and I . would not like to see this becoming a case of ""more haste, less speed"",' Michael Jones, chairman of the Criminal Law Solicitors’ Association told The Times. John Fassenfelt, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, added: 'We . believe that there is every opportunity for the evidence to be tested, . both by magistrates on paper and, of course, by judges in the crown court when cases come before them for a plea and directions hearing. But . we would also like to see more cases coming through the magistrates’ courts and would like to see our sentencing powers increased to 12 . months’ custody.' Other changes will include courts operating beyond the traditional 10am . until 4pm, including weekends and evening sessions, as well as more . video links between courts, prisons and police stations to save on time . and costs.","Cutting committals, where magistrates decide if there is a case to answer, will cut legal process by up to six weeks .

After winning the trophy and £2,500 cash prize, Mr Gallen admitted he was, for once, nearly lost for words. But only after he secured his winning word - 'neonates' - that means newborn child.

A former victor says competitive players are using computer programmes to calculate what words are likely to appear . He said: 'It feels surreal. I am delighted. It is something that I have always wanted to win ever since I started paying Scrabble.' The 26 year-old, who only took up the popular boardgame seven years ago, said he was proud to be the first ever Northern Irishman to win the national title in its 41st year. However, the avid Newcastle United football fan admitted he didn't know the meaning of many of the mind-boggling words he played to win the championship. He said: 'Hirudin was one of the best words I played, but I don't know what it means. 'It is really a game of maths - you are just taking on extra work by trying to learn all the definitions. 'I do try and learn a few of the definitions to give the words some life, but hirudin is quite a low probability word. 'I hope that my win encourages people in Northern Ireland to come out of the woodwork and play Scrabble.' The battle is displayed on a larger board for Scrabble enthusiasts to follow the action . No hard feelings: The contest was tight but Paul emerged the victor, helped along by a 71-point word in the final game . Mr Gallen is no stranger to winning . tournaments. He was the proud winner of the television show Countdown . Champion of Champions in 2006 before turning his attention to Scrabble. He said: 'The secret to my success? It probably comes from watching Countdown and writing down all the words from dictionary corner and then learning all the words with Z's and Q's which are useful.' Phenomenon: The game is sold in 121 countries and there are 29 different language versions. Approximately 150million sets have been sold worldwide . Collecting his trophy in front of an audience of around 60 Scrabble enthusiasts in central London this afternoon, the new champion said he would spend his £2,500 winnings on whisking his girlfriend Nicole Thompson off for a romantic holiday . He said: 'She has been cheering me on back home in Belfast so I will probably take her on holiday. But it isn't reallly about the prize money, it is all about the title.' More than 400 Scrabble lovers, aged from 10 to 90, entered the competition to be named the country's greatest wordsmith. And Mr Gallen was put to the test in eight rounds before beating his opponent, Liverpudlian accountant Olawale Fashina in a nail-biting final game, beating him 419 points to 356. Championship organiser and former four times UK scrabble champion Philip Nelkon said Scrabble is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as youngsters now play the classic boardgame on their smartphones . However, he said true aficionados spend hours poring over computer programmes to brush up on the probability of high scoring words. Mr Nelkon added: 'The standard goes up every year and that is chiefly because of the development of computer programmes to help people learn words and study moves. 'Thirty years ago you had to learn words straight out of the dictionary, but now you can use computer programmes to brush up on the probability of certain words.

Almost immediately, the family became sick, complaining of sore throats, stinging eyes and congestion. Mrs Edgel said her two-year-old daughter was the sickest. Scroll down for video . Unaware: The Edgel family, from Utah, relocated to Texas and moved into a home which had previously been used as a marijuana greenhouse . Luxury: The 4,000 square foot home in Cypress, Texas was rented to the young family but they were not informed of its previous use as a cannabis greenhouse . The family were completely unaware that the luxury, four-bedroom, 4,000-square foot home had been raided on August 21 as part . of a massive drugs bust involving 50 homes. No one had been living at the home but it had been used by drug dealers to grow 400 plants. Mrs Edgel told TV station KRIV: 'My eyes were burning. My throat was burning. My chest felt heavy. 'Then I became very congested. My youngest daughter started getting green goop in her eyes, and she would cough until she threw up.' It was then that Mrs Edgel discovered mould growing all over the house, in particular in her youngest daughter's bedroom. Busted: In August, a sting operation uncovered 400 plants being grown at the home by drug dealers . Behind closed doors: The suburban home was raided by narcotics officers in August where 400 cannabis plants were found inside . The sickly conditions appear to have been caused by the 'greenhouse' conditions of the marijuana factory. The heat in the house was kept high and water sprayed, making the atmosphere damp and humid. Along with her concerns for her family's health, Mrs Edgel was also worried what the environment would do to irreplaceable family heirlooms such as the 1930s grand piano she inherited when her grandmother died last year. Although landlords must tell prospective tenants if the home has previously been used to cook methamphetamine, they are not obliged to reveal if the property has been used to grow marijuana.

Mystery: A researcher at an ancient monastic site in Cheshire has found this man, who died 750 years ago, was probably murdered with a single sword blow . Call in the Cold Case team - a 750-year-old murder has been unearthed at an ancient monastic site in Cheshire. Skeletal remains of a 13th century knight buried at Norton Priory show that he died after being slashed by a sword. The mystery man, who lies in a grand stone tomb at the site, had been examined before and was believed to have died naturally. Shirley Curtis-Summers from the University of Liverpool says that several vertebrae were severed, which may have caused damage to connecting muscles and nerves. By examining the skeleton, PhD researcher Mrs Curtis-Summers discovered the injury, which would have left him alive for several hours, stricken and unable to walk, before a very painful death. A battlefield injury might be expected for a knight of this period but Medieval weapons expert and TV presenter Mike Loades suggests a more sinister incident. He said: 'It seems almost inconceivable that a wound of this nature could be caused to anyone wearing armour. The slice would have had to cut through the armour for the entire length of the wound. 'This is not possible which suggests this wound was not received in battle. The possible scenarios that first occur to me are: assault by robbers or caught out, unarmoured, in an attack on his home or a private affray or murder.' It seems a tragic end for a man who was evidently an important man and great benefactor of Norton Priory. Buried in a stone coffin with a lid bearing two carved shields that once would have borne his heraldic device, he took pride of place in the nave of the Priory church. Burial site: The undercroft of Norton Priory is the 13th century knight's final resting place - and he could be a man called Geoffrey Dutton . Curator Lynn Smith said: 'One character stands out as a strong possibility for being the occupant of this prestigious grave. 'That is Geoffrey Dutton, son of Adam de Dutton. We know he was born about AD 1170 and from skeletal evidence that he was 48 or over when he died.' Whoever this poor man was, his story is one of many at Norton Priory which is the largest excavated monastic site in Europe. A new research programme is hoped to reveal many more such stories. The skeleton is now back on display at Norton Priory Museum.","The man died in the 13th century and was buried at Norton Priory in Cheshire .

An Oscar-winning screenwriter accused of strangling a . young actress with his belt during a sadistic sex session is reportedly trying to dismiss the $5 million civil lawsuit she brought against him. Amanda Jencsik, 26, claimed in the suit filed in March that she feared . for her life during an abusive four-month relationship with Moonstruck . writer John Patrick Shanley, 61. Miss Jencsik alleged he slapped her and held his hands over her mouth and neck during their . encounters at his Manhattan apartment, and he often asked her if she felt like he was raping her. Now his lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss her lawsuit, arguing that she willingly returned to him for sex, the New York Post reported. Lawsuit: Aspiring actress Amanda Jencsik, left, has claimed screenwriter John Patrick Shanley, who is 35 years her senior, strangled her with a belt during sadistic sex sessions at his apartment . A representative for Jencsik's attorney told the Post that a motion to dismiss the suit was argued a month ago, yet lawyers are still waiting for a decision from the judge. The spokesperson added: 'Our client is a student and an actress. She kept going back to Shanley's house because he had control over her, he would brag about all the people he knew and how he could help her career. 'She looked up to him as a mentor and he continued to take advantage of her.' A lawyer for Shanley, who wrote the 1987 Cher . film, did not return a request for comment. His other work includes the play Doubt, which won a Pulitzer Prize before he directed a movie version starring Meryl Streep in 2008. 'Impressionable': Jencsik claims she repeatedly returned to his apartment as Shanley had control over her . Success: Shanley is pictured left in 1988 with his Oscar for Best Screenplay for Moonstruck. Right, he is pictured with actresses Amy Adams and Meryl Streep at the premiere of Doubt in October 2008 . In her suit, Brooklyn-born Jencsik . claimed their rough sex sessions were so violent that she believed Mr . Shanley was trying to kill her and grew light-headed when he wrapped the . belt around her neck. She said she suffered severe physical . and psychological trauma, but did not report him to the police 'due to . her mental state'. She continues to undergo therapy, her lawyer's . representative said. Miss . Jencsik's statement says the pair met via Facebook in October 2009, . with Mr Shanley striking up the correspondence by asking her about her . hair colour. They did not meet in person until a dinner date in January 2010, she claims. She alleges that, after a second date later that month, she followed Mr Shanley to his apartment and they had sex. He invited her back the next day but was not home when she arrived, the suit says. When he eventually showed up he was drunk, Miss Jencsik alleges, and once inside he 'forcibly turned [her] over onto her stomach' and sodomised her. Award-winning: Shanley won an Oscar for his 1987 romantic comedy Moonstruck, starring Cher . Though she told Mr Shanley he was . hurting her he laughed, the suit says, and afterwards he complained that . his sheets had been left stained with her blood and makeup. The third and final time they had sex, she says, Mr Shanley sodomised her again - this time looping the belt around her throat. After she split up with him in April 2010, Jencsik claims she was in pain but too scared to seek medical help. It took her a year to approach a doctor, who diagnosed her with a bowel obstruction, the suit said.","John Patrick Shanley says actress willingly returned to him for more sexual encounters over four-month relationship .

Florida, was last seen on November 17 dropping her three-year-old twins . off at her ex-fiancé Dale Smith's home, with whom she had a tumultuous . relationship. Smith has been revealed as a suspect in her disappearance, but he is yet to be charged. Mystery: About 150 volunteers conducted a new search in Lake Nona for Michelle Parker, left, who was last seen in November 2011 . Missing: Family members reported Ms Parker missing after she didn't show up for work as a bartender at a local restaurant. Police later found her abandoned Hummer SUV . Ms Parker's disappearance came right after she had discussed her broken relationship with Smith on an episode of The People's Court. About 150 showed up in Lake Nona on Sunday in a revived search for the woman, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Her father Brad Parker told the Orlando Sentinel that some bones were found during the search, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether they belonged to a person or an animal. The Orlando Police Department was notified about the remains, and will conduct an investigation. In a statement posted to the .

Apple Inc. paid an income tax rate of only 1.9 per cent on its earnings outside the U.S. in its latest fiscal year, a regulatory filing by the company shows. The world's most valuable company paid $713 million in tax on foreign earnings of $36.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 29, according to the financial statement filed on Oct. 31. The foreign earnings were up 53 per cent from fiscal 2011, when Apple earned $24 billion outside the U.S. and paid income tax of 2.5 per cent on it. Penny earned: Apple Inc., a store in Hong Kong pictured, paid a rate of only 1.9 per cent income tax on its earnings outside the U.S. in its latest fiscal year . The tech giant's foreign tax rate compares with the general U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 per cent. Apple may pay some income taxes on its profit to the country in which it sells its products, but it minimizes them by using various accounting moves to shift profits to countries with low tax rates. For example the strategy known as 'Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,' routes profits through Irish and Dutch subsidiaries and then to the Caribbean. Other multinational corporations also use such tax techniques, which are legal. Like other big companies, Apple leaves cash overseas. If it brought it home to the U.S., it would have to pay U.S. corporate taxes on the money. Great escape: The world's most valuable company paid $713 million in tax on foreign earnings of $36.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 29 . The cash that Apple has left overseas as of Sept. 29 has mounted to a stunning $82.6 billion, up from $74 billion as of June 30. Where Apple does differ from other companies is that it sets aside a portion of the foreign profits, marking them as subject to U.S. taxes sometime in the future. When Apple reports quarterly results, it records that portion of the taxes as a liability, which is subtracted from its profits even though it hasn't actually paid the taxes. Tax experts say the company could easily eliminate these 'phantom' tax obligations. That would boost Apple's profits for the past three years by as much $10.5 billion, according to calculations by The Associated Press reported in July. While investors might rejoice if Apple suddenly added $10.5 billion to its profits, unilaterally erasing a massive U.S. tax obligation could tarnish its reputation as a relatively responsible payer of U.S. taxes. Instead, the company is lobbying to change U.S. law so that it can erase its liabilities in a less conspicuous fashion. Overall Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple had net income of $41.7 billion, or $44.15 per share, in fiscal 2012. That was up 61 per cent from $25.9 billion, or $27.68 per share, in fiscal 2011.","Of Apple's $36.8 billion in foreign earnings they paid $713 million in taxes in their latest fiscal year .

"Mother of three Lisa Kaley tried to tell officers she was 'too weak from chemotherapy' to attack anyone . Despite being told her condition meant she would be dealt with as a priority,  she was locked in a cell from 11am until 5.30pm . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:30 EST, 5 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:30 EST, 5 November 2012 . Nightmare: Cancer sufferer Lisa Kaley was locked in a cell for six and a half hours after she was falsely accused of assault by her ex boyfriend . A cancer sufferer was arrested and locked up in a police cell for six and half hours after her ex partner falsely accused her of assault. Lisa Kaley, a mother of-three, tried to explain to officers that she actually had a five year restraining order against former boyfriend Gary Swann  following a conviction of criminal damage after he tried to break into her home. But police told 39 year old Ms Kaley, from Stanford-le-Hope, in Essex, . there was nothing they could do because the allegation had been made . against her. She was then arrested on suspicion of assault and was taken to Grays Police Station, in Essex, where she was then finger-printed and left alone in a cell for six-and-a-half hours despite claims that she would be dealt with as a priority. After a short interview, she was finally told she was free to go home and no further action would be taken against her. Speaking from her home Ms Kaley said: 'It was a nightmare from start to finish, I was the one who was treated like a criminal - there was simply no need for it at all. 'One look at what I have been through should have been enough for those officers to realise they could have at least approached the matter with some discretion. 'It was all so heavy-handed. 'I am meant to be trying to reduce stress because of my cancer so this was about as bad as it gets. 'They could have used some discretion and perhaps arranged to come and see me - but to be carted off to the police station, leaving my children wondering what was happening to mummy was hard to take. 'I was sitting in the police cell, feeling like I had hit rock bottom and I just felt so helpless and scared.' Ms Kaley claims she ran into the Mr Swann after she dropped her daughter, Georgia, four, off at school and was making her way home through a local park. After an angry exchange, where she claims she was verbally abused, she went into a nearby supermarket where she had a cup of tea and tried to calm down after the upsetting confrontation. But shortly after she got home two police officers arrived at her front door and said she was to be arrested on suspicion of assault. Proof: The paperwork which shows Ms Kaley's partner was under a restraining order (left) and the notification that no further action would be taken against the mother of three (right) She added: 'The police were saying to me, why didn’t you phone us there and then when it happened but I was upset. 'I started to show them all the paperwork, the history of what had happened yet it was like they were on autopilot. 'They were saying to me - ‘we are here to arrest you because an allegation has been made’ - I was getting upset, asking them for some understanding, saying it was simply a malicious allegation.' The two officers explained that because of her illness, Lisa would be dealt with as a 'priority'. Yet despite being placed into a cell at about 11am , it was 5.30pm when she was finally interviewed. Before the cancer: Ms Kaley is currently undergoing chemotherapy for the stage four cancer. The tearful mother explained to officers that her cancer means she can be very weak and the idea of being able to attack anyone was simply 'ludicrous'. Despite a long history of alcohol-fuelled violence against Lisa - including throwing a brick through her window and breaking into her home - it was Lisa who felt like the criminal. When she was finally told she was being released without charge, police made no effort to apologise for what she had been through. She added: 'I am using all my energies to battle the cancer and am undergoing chemotherapy, so to be thrown into a cell was very hard to take in. 'When the police dealt with me at my home and I explained that I had cancer, they just ignored what I was saying - it was like trying to reason with robots.' Lisa was handed a formal letter from police confirming no further action would be taken due to a lack of evidence. An Essex Police spokesman said he was unable to discuss the specific details of the incident. But he added: 'We are sorry to hear this lady feels aggrieved and would invite her to contact our professional standards’ department should she want to complain formally to us. 'We would always hope to treat people with the dignity and care which is appropriate to their position and if they are vulnerable we would hope to treat them very carefully indeed.'","Mother of three Lisa Kaley tried to tell officers she was 'too weak from chemotherapy' to attack anyone .

Iran, the ship also passed through the strategic Strait of Hormuz ten . times, a figure that Carter said is more than double the typical amount. The U.S. Navy has had a boat named Enterprise since the American Revolutionary War. The first Enterprise belonged to the British before it was seized by America in 1775. Seven boats carried the name Enterprise until in 1954, Congress agreed to build the world’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Eight nuclear reactors were needed to power the giant ship - a new but dangerous approach because it required reactors to be harnessed together which had never been done before. Enterprise was built with 60,000 tons of steel; 1,500 tons of aluminium; 230 miles of pipe and 1,700 tons of welding rods. More than 800 companies provided materials for the boat which was worked on by 900 engineers. Four years later, the ship, nicknamed The Big E, was set to launch and in October 1962, saw its first international action during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A blockade was placed on October 24 until after a tense four days, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev agreed to dismantle nuclear arms in Cuba. Following the 9/11 attacks, Enterprise headed to the North Arabian Sea to take a central role in Operation Enduring Freedom. After returning home to Norfolk, Virginia to have extensive repairs, Enterprise deployed for the 21st time in January 2011 and carried out multiple anti-piracy missions. November 25, 2011 marked the remarkable boat's 50th anniversary, making it the oldest ship on duty in the U.S. fleet. The . Enterprise has been a frequent traveler to the Middle East over its . career. It was the first nuclear-powered carrier to transit through the . Suez Canal in 1986, and it was the first carrier to respond following . the 9/11 attacks, changing course overnight to head to the Arabian . Sea. An entire room on the ship serves as a . museum to its history, which includes a large photo of the burning Twin . Towers placed in a timeline that wraps around a wall. The . Navy will officially deactivate the Enterprise on December 1, but it will . take several more years for it to be decommissioned as its reactors are . taken out. About 15,000 people are expected to attend the deactivation . ceremony, which will be its last public ceremony after several days of . tours for former crew members. Those who have . served on the ship have a unique camaraderie. It is the second-oldest . ship in the Navy after the USS Constitution, and its age has frequently . shown. Sailors who work on the Enterprise have a saying: 'There's tough, . then there's Enterprise tough.' Things frequently break down, and spare parts for a ship that's the only one in its class aren't made anymore. 'She's . just old, so you got to work around her,' said Petty Officer 2nd Class . Danielle Almaraz, an electronic technician. 'We have to make our own . parts sometimes because it just doesn't exist.' Those . deployed on the Enterprise knew life wouldn't be easy at sea, a fact . highlighted last year when former commanding officer Capt. Owen Honors . was fired for airing raunchy videos that he said were intended to boost . morale. During a hearing in which Honors was trying to avoid being . kicked out of the Navy, he and his lawyers frequently referenced the . difficult conditions on board. Honors was found to have committed . misconduct, but ultimately allowed to stay in the service. He is . retiring in April. Some of the ship's original . crew members from 51 years ago - known as plank owners - were among the . 1,500 civilians who joined the Enterprise for its last two days at sea, . known as a Tiger Cruise. 'This is the end of . an era that I helped start, so I was just honored that the captain . invited me on board. There's no way I'd turn that down,' said original . crew member Ray Godfrey of Colorado Springs, Colo. The . aircraft carrier is the eighth U.S. ship to bear the name Enterprise, . with the first one being confiscated from the British by Benedict Arnold . in 1775. Current sailors and alumni like Godfrey are lobbying to have a . future carrier also named Enterprise. The ship's crew created a time . capsule to be passed along to each Navy secretary until a new ship . carries its name.

The men will be expected to bunk five to 10 to a room. ‘It’s going to be tight. It’s not ideal,’ one Air National Guardsman told the New York Post. The armory is home to the 69th Infantry Regiment, part of the New York Army National Guard and known as the ‘Fighting Sixty-Ninth’. The regiment aren’t complaining too much about the models moving in because they owe a debt of gratitude to the producers of the fashion show. Along with the rest of lower Manhattan, the armory lost power on last Monday after Sandy hit. Fortunately, the Victoria Secret’s producers had hauled in eight massive 500 kilowatt generators which were then used to heat and light the armory until power was eventually restored on Friday. The Lexington Armory is home to the 69th Infantry Regiment and the Victoria's Secret runway fashion show . Victoria's Secret favorites Alessandria Ambrosia and Lily Aldridge will be appearing at the armory show on Wednesday . ‘We were dead in the water until Victoria’s Secret showed up,’ Capt. Brendan Gendron, the Regiment’s operations officer, told Wired. The Victoria's Secret team also loaned a forklift which was used in the food distribution effort. As they have done for the past three years, the lingerie company is holding its annual television event at the historic armory, located at 25th street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. Wednesday’s show will feature Victoria's Secret favorites Lily Aldridge, Doutzen Kroes, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, and Adriana Lima. Brazilian beauty Alessandria Ambrosia has recently had a baby, has been chosen to model the coveted Fantasy Treasure Bra worth an estimated $2.5 million. Members of National Guard have been handing out supplies throughout storm-ravaged parts of New York . The historic armory is located at 25th street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan . Victoria’s Secret Angel Lily Aldridge has recently tweeted her excitement about the forthcoming event and her concern for the victims of Superstorm Sandy. Wednesday's show will be aired on CBS on December 4, last year's event was watched by over 11.5 million viewers. Last night, about 150 of the guardsmen were crammed into a space meant for 50 as Victoria’s Secret workers moved in equipment and set up temporary dressing rooms. The military workers will be allowed to return to their armory digs on Thursday.

But now Barack Obama has revealed that he is just being honest with people - because that’s the way he really is. The President said that he refused to fake emotions as he wanted to be ‘authentic’ with the American people. I am who I am: President Obama, pictured in August, revealed he refuses to fake emotions as he wanted to be 'authentic' with the American people . Routine: He always wears the same thing every day - blue or grey suits - to save brain power for other matters . If people think he is too detached then...that’s because he is too detached, he admitted. In an interview Mr Obama also claimed he is so focused his job that he has delegated even the most basic tasks - like deciding what he eats. He always wears the same thing every day - blue or grey suits - to save brain power, like Jeff Goldblum’s character Seth Brundle in the 1986 sci-fi horror The Fly. Since the President took office, commentators have repeatedly criticised him for his inability to connect with voters and claimed he is too cerebral. He has been compared unfavourably to former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush who most people would feel more comfortable going for a beer with. Authentic: The president said 'I'm absolutely positive that I'm serving the American people better if I'm maintaining my authenticity' Speaking to Vanity Fair magazine, however, Mr Obama said he would be lying to himself and everyone else if he tried to be too emotional. He said: ‘I feel it is an insult to the people I’m dealing with. For me to feign outrage, for example, feels to me like I’m not taking the American people seriously. 'I'm absolutely positive that I'm serving the American people better if I'm maintaining my authenticity. I'm at my best when I believe what I am saying.' ‘I’m absolutely positive that I’m serving the American people better if I’m maintaining my authenticity. ‘And that’s an overused word. And these days people practice being authentic. But I’m at my best when I believe what I am saying.’ Mr Obama, who is known for his love of basketball and golf, said that he has to exercise ‘or at some point you’ll just break down’. He said that day-to-day he has to ‘routinize’ himself so as not to waste brain power on the little things so keeps lists of things he needs to get done. He said: ‘I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Unwinding: Mr Obama, pictured playing with family dog Bo on the White House lawn in 2009, said he needs to unwind by exercising . ‘Because I have too many other decisions to make. You need to focus your decision-making energy.‘You can’t be going through the day distracted by trivia’. The Obamas’ first night in the White House was bizarre, he added, and that it took him a week to get his head around it. Me and Obama: The entire interview appears in the latest issue of Vanity Fair . Mr Obama said: ‘The first night you sleep in the White House, you’re thinking, All right. I’m in the White House. And I’m sleeping here. ‘There’s a time in the middle of the night when you just kind of startle awake. There’s a little bit of a sense of absurdity. ‘There is such an element of randomness in who gets this job. What am I here for? Why am I walking around the Lincoln Bedroom? That doesn’t last long.’ Being president comes with a high price, and Mr Obama misses being able to ‘wander around’ without an entourage of Secret Service bodyguards. He and wife Michelle love to sit out on the balcony as it is the closest they come to being normal people. Mr Obama said: ‘It’s much harder to be surprised. You don’t have those moments of serendipity. You don’t bump into a friend in a restaurant you haven’t seen in years. ‘The loss of anonymity and the loss of surprise is an unnatural state. You adapt to it, but you don’t get used to it - at least I don’t.’ Another bizarre side-effect of being President is that he has got used to ‘a character people see out there called Barack Obama’ that isn’t him. Mr Obama said that the strange duality forced him to filter some things out, but not so much that he ended up living in a ‘fantasy land’.","President said in Vanity Fair interview that he must be 'authentic'

Religious headliner: Rabbi David Wolpe, who head's Los Angeles' Sinai Temple, has known Monica Lewinsky and her family for decades . Monica Lewinsky's former rabbi who publicly condemned Bill Clinton during the sex scandal gave the benediction minutes after the former President took the stage at the Democratic National Convention tonight. ABC News reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because Rabbi David Wolpe is such a well-known figure in the Jewish community. Time may not have healed all wounds, however, as Rabbi Wolpe was very critical of Mr Clinton throughout the scandal and wrote an op-ed three years ago reiterating those feelings. The Lewinskys attended the Rabbi's Sinai Temple in Los Angeles for years and Monica went to its affiliated Sinai Akiba Academy religious school before heading to college, and eventually, the White House. As the then-22-year-old intern's name became a national buzzword for having repeated sexual  encounters with the then-President, her Rabbi came to her defense and criticized Mr Clinton. 'He was a brilliant, talented, extraordinary child, and for the leader of the United States we need an adult,' the Associated Press reported Rabbi Wolpe saying in a synagogue service around the time of the 1998 scandal. That ferocity dimmed slightly in the following decade, but it didn't disappear completely. In a column about another politician's affair, Rabbi Wolpe brought up Clinton again saying that it was more the cover up and slander that brought the disgrace with that instance. Former fling: President Bill Clinton, seen here in August, was impeached over his affair with then-22-year-old intern Monica Lewinsky (right) while he was in office . The affair: Lewisnky and Clinton, seen hugging in 1996, had nine sexual encounters that did not involve intercourse . 'During the Lewinsky scandal, it was the . lying and smearing of Monica Lewinsky that marked the low point of the . event, not the sex, which was primarily an issue for the individuals and . families involved,' he wrote in The Washington Post. Mr Clinton spent the years following his two terms working with his philanthropic organization the Clinton Global Initiative, writing his autobiography, and accruing goodwill. In June of this year, the former President had a 66 per cent favorability rating which was certainly higher than President Obama's. By granting Clinton the coveted second-night-headlining post at the Convention, it shows that Obama sees the value in having his predecessor in a prominent spot to attract undecideds. Keep moving: President Obama arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday and is expected to attend the convention tonight before speaking on Thursday . Military arrival: The theme of caring for military families was a present one in Tuesday night's speeches, and in keeping with that, the President arrived at the Air National Guard base . While Clinton's speech- which he is said to have written himself- will be an attack on the Republicans, asserting that 'they built' the country's $16trillion national debt, the topic of Democratic support for Israel has aleady been raised today. During the day on Wednesday, delegates approved revisions to the convention platform to include a mention of God and declared Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. Considering President Obama has been criticized for what many Jewish supporters view as tepid support for Israel, the move was undoubtedly seen as a strong show of allegiance. The same goes for the decision to give Rabbi Wolpe such a prominent position in the convention schedule, though it may end up being an awkward selection in the end. Taking the stage: Michelle Obama headlined on Tuesday and former President Bill Clinton will take the stage in Charlotte, North Carolina Wednesday .","Rabbi David Wolpe has known the Lewinskys for years and criticized Clinton during the scandal .

But as these eerie yet now familiar-looking photographs show, it is not the first time that the city has been left to find its way in the dark. In the summer of 1959, New York suffered a similar blackout - although the consequences were far less devastating that those wreaked by Sandy. On August 31 that year, a 500-block radius around Central Park in Manhattan suffered a black-out - believed to have been caused because the grid could not cope with so many people using increasingly popular refrigerators and air conditioners in a heatwave. The power was cut just as night fell, . leaving New Yorkers to do their best to make their way to cafes and bars . where people crowded around candles as shown in the atmospheric but . gloomy photographs taken by LIFE nearly half a century ago.

Fortunately for New Yorkers back then, their power cut lasted just 13 hours. The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy was far more devastating. The ferocious storm killed at least 113 people and two million remain without power as the bitter November cold sets in. Last week, the lower half of Manhattan was almost in complete darkness after power was cut off when an electrical substation blew up due to surging flood waters in the East River. Although the situation has vastly improved on the island, about 1.9million homes and businesses remained in the dark for the seventh night in devastated communities up and down the East Coast - with Staten Island, Long Island, New Jersey and parts of Brooklyn some of the worst hit.

The British economy is set to power ahead of the rest of Europe, with some countries at serious risk of descending into social breakdown, according to a think-tank. The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicted that UK output would shrink by 0.1 per cent this year, before rebounding in 2013 and 2014. Its forecasts suggest that even Europe’s strongest economies will be left behind by the resurgence, with growth of 0.8 per cent expected next year and 1.4 per cent in 2014. Dangers: Experts fear growing economic turmoil in the EU would provoke a rise in civil unrest, similar to that seen in Greece, where anti-austerity protesters regularly clash with authorities . This would put Britain in first place among major European nations, including Germany, with expected growth of 1.2 per cent in 2014, and France on 0.2 per cent. Italy and Spain are predicted to remain in recession throughout the two-year period, prompting the CEBR’s economists to warn that Europe is on the brink of civil unrest. ‘The economic situation in some parts of Europe is moving from bad to catastrophic,’ said Douglas McWilliams, CEBR chief executive and co-author of the Global Prospects report. ‘There is a danger that the economic problems will spill over into social breakdown in many areas of Europe as unemployment soars and governments run out of money.’ He cited anecdotal evidence of destitute people in Greece turning to desperate measures such as burglary and prostitution to make ends meet. Business Secretary Vince Cable, right, has rubbished Lord Heseltine’s suggestion that foreign take-overs of British firms be subjected to a public interest test. In a report on how to promote growth, commissioned by Chancellor George Osborne, Lord Heseltine said ministers should do more to protect firms from foreign buyers who ‘destroy value’. But Mr Cable dismissed the idea, saying regulation to prevent takeovers from abroad –such as the £12billion buyout of Cadbury by US firm Kraft Foods – would amount to ‘economic nationalism’. ‘I’ve told Michael we’re not going down that road,’ said Mr Cable. ‘We’re open for business. ‘Some of our industries have been turned around by foreign investors. ‘The car industry wouldn’t be successful without them.’Mr Cable did say he was looking at ways to make it harder for British firms to be swallowed up by overseas predators. ‘We’re moving to a situation that hasn’t happened to a Western economy in peacetime,’ he said. He warned the upheaval witnessed in Greece could be replicated in other countries such as Italy, and austerity would ‘just make things worse’. The best thing for Europe’s struggling economies might be a break-up of the single currency, despite the initial pain it would cause, he said. ‘The only future for southern Europe is a low exchange rate,’ Mr McWilliams added, pointing out that this could not be achieved while the continent’s economic basket cases remain in the single currency. David Cameron will fly to the Middle East today to drum up £6billion of arms sales. He will visit Dubai and Abu Dhabi . before travelling on to Saudi Arabia tomorrow in an effort to secure the . sale of 100 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold secret talks with Gulf leaders about the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme. The British economy emerged from the double-dip recession in the third quarter of the year, with a boost from the London Olympics helping economic output up 1 per cent. By contrast, the CEBR expects the eurozone economy to shrink by 0.7 per cent this year and 0.4 per cent next year, before returning to ‘only  marginal’ growth of 0.4 per cent in 2014. The report warns the global economy is on a knife edge, with the outlook at risk of  deteriorating rapidly in the event of political disruption in the Middle East, or a collapse in the eurozone. The assessment forced the CEBR to downgrade its worldwide forecast for economic output from 2.6 per cent this year to 2.4 per cent. Next year’s forecast was also cut, from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.","Fears grow that economic problems will spill over into social breakdown in Europe .

Breaking the glass ceiling: Women are being urged to take advantage of childcare for the sake of their jobs (file photo) Women's careers are being held back by the feeling they have to spend as much time as possible looking after their families,  a professor has claimed. Professor Uta Frith says women with successful careers should be prepared to spend heavily on childcare to allow them to scale the corporate ladder. She criticised the idea that women have to be able to do everything and said: 'I have one piece of advice... throw money at it.' She told the Independent: 'Spend every penny you've got on getting proper childcare, because I'm really convinced that this is something that holds these high-flying women back.' The neuroscience and psychology expert is no stranger to success herself, being a a Fellow of the Royal Society, British Academy and the Academy of Medical Sciences. Her comments come in the wake of reports that the glass ceiling is still very much in place as it emerged that just two of the top 100 FTSE-listed firms have female directors. Women do not need to go down the path of juggling work and home commitments and can find alternative methods of both rearing a family and excelling in their chosen field, said Professor Frith. Don't hold back: Working mothers should not feel guilty about devoting time to their careers, said Professor Frith (file photo) 'They think they have to be these . stay-at-home mothers to some extent. There is a funny burden there... you carry it with you,' she added. Upon being made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2005, the autism expert set about encouraging other women to follow suit as females made up just six per cent of the fellowship. She also founded UCL Women, a network which holds monthly meetings to allow professional women to network and share their experiences.","Scientist says 'spend every penny' on a good nanny .

The family of Kristen Fonseca, the 16-year-old girl killed in a jet-ski accident by an Australian tourist while they vacationed in Hawaii spoke of their anger as he was released today. Tyler Dagley, 20, pleaded no contest to third degree negligent homicide charges - a misdemeanor - and will be released due to time served following the August 5th accident when his jet ski collided with Fonseca's resulting in her death the next day. Speaking before the judges' decision was announced, Fonseca's step-father Mario Cantone said: 'We have a huge hole in our family, and all taken away from us in a split second by an individual who was negligent.'

Tyler Dagley, 20, was with his girlfriend vacationing in Oahu, Hawaii when his jet ski collided with Kristen Fonseca's on August 5th, resulting in her death the next day. Police in Hawaii said Dagley, 20, was standing up on his jet ski and posing for videos and photographs for his girlfriend before ramming the pretty teen on August 5. They also said he was going 40 miles per hour - four times the speed Kristen was traveling as the collision caused the teens head to ricochet off the steering column of her jet ski, throwing her into the water. Appearing at Oahu county jail today, Dagley was faced with members if Fonseca's family, including her mother and father. The tragic 16-year-old's head was fatally cannoned off the front steering column of her jet ski in the collision with Dagely . Horror: Kristen's parents witnessed the fatal crash and were upset at the decision to only press third degree misdemeanor charges against Tyler Dagley in a court in Oahu, Hawaii . 'Our family's life is turned upside-down. We are unable to function at home. We go to sleep crying, wake up crying,' said Mario Cantone, Fonseca's step-father. Unhappy that no felony charges were pressed against Dagley, the Fonseca family spoke of their grief and anger at their sudden loss. 'I cry in the morning, I cry before I go to sleep, I cry randomly during the day looking for justice,' said Evangelina Fonseca, the 16-year-old's mother. 'I mean I'm not trying to make this guy suffer, but I need for him to understand that there's a consequence to every decision we make. 'That's the kind of daughter my daughter was, a very forgiving child, and so I know that it's what she would want me to do.'

Kristen Fonseca's poem wonders out loud if she will ever have children and how she wants to be a doctor when she grows up. Tyler Dagley reportedly cried as he heard his victim's words and will be asked to pay $78,000 in restitution to the family for his actions. Monique Sanchez, Kristen's sister told ABC News she witnessed the crash that killed her sister. 'He was just speeding really fast and then just came up and just slammed right into her,' said Sanchez. The tragic teen's step-father Mario Cantone also spoke to ABC News of what he saw when the accident occurred. 'I then saw her head lunge forward, and hit the steering wheel. Kristen then fell forward, fell back and then fell into the water,' said Cantone. Dream holiday: Australians Tyson Dagley, left, and Natasha Ryan, right, had saved up for their dream trip . 'As far as I'm concerned that is not enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40. The family is now suing Dagley, claiming they 'have suffered horrible emotional pain, suffering and distress' after witnessing the horrific crash, which took place at Keehi Boat Harbour on the southern coast of Oahu, about five miles from Waikiki Beach. They are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, including medical and funeral expenses. According to investigators, Dagley was standing on his rented watercraft before it hit the teenager's jet ski from behind. He was allegedly looking at his girlfriend, who was taking photos and filming him, and not paying attention to where he was going. Dagley's girlfriend Natasha Ryan, 21, is charged with hindering his prosecution after she told investigators he was sitting down and looking straight ahead before the collision, and that she didn't see the crash. However, a forensic computer examiner recovered two deleted videos from the memory stick in Ryan's camera which showed the crash. Evangelina Fonseca told the court of her daily grief since the death of her 16-year-old child . Court documents said that in the video, Dagley appears to be standing on the watercraft and that someone is heard yelling 'watch out.' Ryan was released on $500 bail and is shown in her mug shot to be extremely distressed and she will appear in court this Friday. Dagley, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death. 'Ever since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who has now been in custody a week, said in court. Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.' Crash scene: The accident took place at Keehi . Boat Harbor, pictured, on the southern coast of Oahu about five miles . from Waikiki Beach . In a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts to the pair, as a defendant. The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly. An employee who rented the jet ski to Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the papers state. Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home. 'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said. Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen. 'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox. Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'","Kristen Fonseca, 16,  was killed following a jet ski collision with Tyler Dagley, 20 off the coast of Oahu, Hawaii in August .

Greedy landlords and hotel owners looking to make a quick buck from the thousands without power or displaced by Hurricane Sandy were exploiting people's desperation by demanding outrageous prices for a shelter. As of yesterday morning Craigslist was full of posts for costly rooms, with one ad promising people the luxury of a single bedroom apartment with electricity for a 'mere' $700 per night. 'Stay in comfort and style until the power comes back on,' the Post reported. It wasn't just Craigslist vultures. The Red Carpet Inn in Bushwick typically charges $99 for a Friday but was asking $500 via hotels.com, according to the New York Post.The New York Palace Hotel in Midtown had also jacked its rates $100 per night to $600. Marathon weekend is one of the busiest times of the year Hilton Garden Inn . The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan jacked its prices from $100 to $600 . A manager at that hotel insisted to the Post that they weren't taking advantage of the hurricane's aftermath. 'We aren't charging them extra,' the unidentified manager said. 'It's just because of the hurricane we had high occupancy, and when we have high occupancy, the rates go up.' As power was restored to lower Manhattan and the New York City Marathon was cancelled, prices quickly began to drop. Hotels in midtown recently claimed to be fully booked were suddenly offering rooms at close to their regular rates. As late as Friday tourists trying to book rooms in New York City via travel website were being referred to New Jersey hotels. Even with the opportunity to squeeze every last penny out, there were still people trying to do the right thing. One Staten Island hotel owner refused to evict storm victims so he could book marathon runners with reservations. The New York City Marathon is one of the busiest weekends of the year for the Hilton Garden Inn in Bloomfield, said owner Richard Nicotra. But with thousands without power and temperatures plummeting, Nicotra gave the rooms over to storm refugees. Vultures: Some people advertised rooms for a ¿mere¿ $700 per night to people displaced by Hurricane Sandy . 'These are my neighbors,' Nicotra told ABC News. 'Am I going to kick out my neighbors who lost everything, who have not a place to go, for someone who's travelling here to run a race?' He even hosted a local resident's wedding at the hotel. Contracts with the NYC Road Runners Club – official sponsor of the marathon - are lifeblood of Nicotra's business but his bosses still supported him in his decision. Nicotra called both the club and individual guests to explain the situation, amounting to a total of 180 guest cancellations. 'Well they weren't happy about it, obviously,' he said. 'But we asked them to look on the TV, look at what is going on in Staten Island.' Though he couldn't offer them rooms, Nicotra promised a free cot, free meals, and a free shuttle to the starting line as an alternative. 'This was bigger than all of us,' Nicotra said. 'But we told them, 'Come and we will take care of you.'","Craigslist clogged with rooms going for hiked prices .

The Georgia woman battling a rare bacterial infection that caused her to lose her hands and feet has died in hospital today after her school teacher husband was denied the time off work to be with her. Hannah Rinehart, 32, who had battled through three bouts of cancer before being struck down with an infection caught from her puppy on July 3rd, passed away from multiple organ failure at Northside Hospital in Cumming in the early hours of Wednesday. Spending nine weeks in a medically-induced coma after going into septic shock, Rinehart's passing was announced by her husband Mark as he wrote on his Facebook page, 'At exactly 0415 this morning, Hannah Johnson Rinehart went to be with the Lord.' Scroll Down for Video . Hannah Rinehart has passed away at Northside Hospital in Cumming in the early hours of Wednesday after battling a rare bacterial infection. Her husband Mark (right) was at her side . Hannah Rinehart's story had made national headlines earlier in the month when her husband battled to extend the 20 days of sick leave he was entitled to annually. Anticipating that his wife would need round the clock care if she recovered, Mark Rinehart was ultimately denied any exceptions and was told that he would have only have 20 days. This was despite his co-workers offering to donate their own sick leave time to him so that he could be be by his wife's side during her convalesence, but they were told they could not do that. In late August, Mark Rinehart did return to work for the start of the new academic year, calling it a 'difficult, but necessary decision.' Hannah Rinehart suffered multiple organ failure as the sepsis she suffered from her bacterial infection caused damage to her heart and lungs . Fighter: Hannah was more susceptible to the . infection as her immune system was weakened by two bouts of cancer - . Hodgkin's lymphoma - and subsequent bone marrow transplants . Updating his Facebook on Tuesday to say that he was taking the 20 days from that point on, tragically his wife died less than 24 hours after he made that decision. It is thought that Rinehart contracted capnocytophaga, an infection usually found in the saliva of dogs. Her husband Mark said he did not know if their one-year-old dog, Brownie, bit her. 'It was basically like being struck by lightning,' Mr Rinehart told the Gwinnett Daily Post. 'It doesn’t happen.' As the sepsis set in doctors were forced to amputate the nurse's hands and feet after her body went into shock and she suffered circulatory problems. Staying in a medically induced coma for over two months before her death, the effects of her illness had ravaged her body. Battle: Hannah Rinehart, pictured with her . husband Mark and their dog Brownie, had both hands and feet removed . after she caught a rare infection from the puppy's saliva . 'The doctor wanted to meet with the entire family, and my assumption was that the meeting would be very difficult,' said a Facebook update from Mark Rinehart yesterday afternoon. Hannah Rinehart became ill after contracting capnocytophaga. It had a significant effect as her immune system had been weakened by cancer and two bone marrow transplants.The rare infection is only usually a danger to elderly, infirm or those with underlying diseases.Capnocytophaga is found in the throat of mammals and can be passed to humans through bite wounds.The bacteria can cause septicemia, meningitis, rare eye infections and endocarditis - an inflammation of the heart.Symptoms often include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle pain or malaise. It can also bring on septic shock.When discovered, it can be treated with anti-microbial medications. 'The family’s immediate reaction to the meeting was a sigh of relief, as no new decisions needed to be made. 'However, the message from the doctor was clear; Hannah is in critical condition and she has been in ICU for 9 weeks. As such, Hannah is very, very tired. 'Unfortunately, Hannah’s current circumstances are limiting our options. 'Many people have asked if Hannah is a candidate for lung transplant. 'Although we all wish that Hannah could be a candidate for transplant, the truth is she is not. 'Even prior to our trip to the ICU in early July, Hannah’s heart condition from her cancer treatments (cardiomyopathy – ‘weak heart muscle’) would prevent her from being a candidate.' Hannah Rinehart had beaten cancer three times since the age of 18; she suffered from Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission for seven years. She underwent two bone marrow transplants, which weakened her immune system and made her more susceptible to the bacteria, MyFoxAtlanta reported. Despite these struggles, her husband, a schoolteacher and national guardsman, said she has always been upbeat. 'You see people around who have had a tough time and are bitter about it,' Mr Rinehart told WXIA. 'She's not; she's always excited about living. She's a fighter, I married a fighter. 'It's just another stage in our life. I know when she comes out of this she's going to be smiling just as big as she was before.' He added to Fox: 'She's got a passion for living and she was grateful for every day she had after [cancer] and she's going to be grateful for every day she has after this.' Her father, Doug Johnson, said it has devastated the family but they have come together to fight it.

'We are very deeply saddened to learn of Hannah Rinehart’s passing,' Andy Copeland told the AJC. 'She and Mark and her family have been ever present in our prayer lives. We had hoped and prayed for her full recovery, but there’s no rhyme nor reason for her suffering and untimely passing.

An eccentric aristocrat who inspired James Bond author Ian Fleming has posthumously donated a remote island to the National Trust for Scotland. Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, who died in June aged 87, stated in his will that the island of Little Bernera be given to the trust’s Scottish division. The trust has accepted the gift but Count Robin’s other Scottish island, Great Bernera, will remain in private ownership. The former Queen’s Herald was best known for his work helping Fleming to research his 1963 James Bond novel On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. And like 007, the count wooed a succession of socialites .

He served as a 'cover identity' for fiction's most famous spy . Unspoilt: A pristine beach on the Outer Hebridean island of Little Bernera, which has been donated to the Scottish National Trust . In the book, Bond’s cover as genealogist . Sir Hilary Bray was based on Count Robin, who was then the heraldic . researcher, appointed by the Queen, at the College of Arms in London. He . served as a 'cover identity' for fiction's most famous spy, played in the film by George Lazenby on his only outing as Bond. Bill Gardner, Development Manager at the NTS, said the gift of the uninhabited 250-acre Outer Hebridean island, worth an estimated £1million, had stunned his team. He said: 'This appears to be an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life. 'We have not been contacted directly as yet regarding the bequest, but it is not unusual for there to be a gap of several months before legal papers are received following public registration of the will. 'Once confirmation is received we will assess the island’s ecology and landscape as to how it can be best conserved for the nation in the light of any conditions attached to the bequest.' Little Bernera is worth an estimated £1million. An international playboy who spoke . several languages, Count Robin won the hearts of debutantes including Fiona . Campbell-Walker, a top model who married one of the richest men in . Europe, Baron Thyssen. After several years of ill health, his colourful life came to an end in the Western Isles at the Blar Buidhe . nursing home in Stornoway, Lewis. The Oxford-educated nobleman turned his back on his life as a . French-born aristocrat to be laird of a Hebridean island, off Lewis. He had suffered two strokes in recent years . and had been poorly for some time.

The film starred George Lazenby (right) as . 007, who posed as genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, a cover inspired by the . count's job as heraldic researcher at the College Of Arms in London . Count Robin lived there for the second half of his life, latterly moving . into a warden-run community care unit when staying alone in . his crumbling croft house got too much. He was born Robin Ian Evelyn Grinnell-Milne in January 1925 to Captain . Duncan Grennell-Milne, a highly-decorated First World War RAF pilot and . French Countess Frances de la Lanne. His parents divorced and his mother later married Scots war hero Major General William Mirrlees. Taking a liking to her new husband’s surname, her son changed his name . by deed poll twice, in 1958 and then 20 years ago to Robin Ian Evelyn . Milne Stuart le Prince de la Lanne-Mirrlees. Count Robin became a captain in the Royal Artillery serving in India . during the Second World War and was later a herald to the Queen and . attended her coronation. He also held numerous foreign knighthoods. And in 2005, he took up his title of Prince of Incoronata, an Adriatic . archipelago, bestowed upon him in the 1960s by the exiled King Peter II . of Yugoslavia, to whom he had been adjutant and confidant. Fact following fiction: Telly Savalas stars as Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which the head of Spectre seeks to claim the title of Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp. Ironically, Count Robin had the title Prince of Incoronata bestowed upon him in 1967 by the exiled King Peter II of Yugoslavia - four years after Fleming wrote his Bond novel . After he moved to Great Bernera, islanders grew extremely fond of the likeable, charming man they called their laird. He supported many local causes and readily released land for community use, building a bond of trust between laird and crofter. After the Lloyds insurance syndicates crash in the 1990s, Count Robin had to sell off his assets to pay £2million of losses. But Great Bernera was never put on the market. He also refused to sell . Inchdrewer Castle in Banffshire which he bought as a ruin and partially . restored in 1971. At the behest of islanders, he withdrew a clutch of uninhabited islands . off Great Bernera – including Little Bernera – from the market. But . other grand properties had to go, including a £400,000  chateau in . France – his mother’s former home – a flat in Paris and Ratzenegg Castle . in Austria. Many of his prized collection of antiques and paintings were also auctioned off. Count Robin won the hearts of debutantes including Fiona Campbell-Walker (pictured), a top model who married one of the richest men in Europe, Baron Thyssen . Later on, the crash in prices of farmed salmon also hit his finances and . he was forced to sell his seven-bedroom mansion in Holland Park, . London, and his Swiss apartment. He was highly regarded on Great Bernera, which has a population of just 350, as a benevolent man. Fellow islander Rhona Macleod said in 2005: 'He may be a prince, but to us he will always simply be Robin. 'He's had two castles in his life, but he must be the only prince who preferred a croft house on Bernera. That says it all. 'He also must be the only prince who joined a local lottery syndicate - but after Lloyds he needed the money.' Count Robin was married once, at the age of 45 to a nurse half his age, but it fizzled out after a week. He had a long-term relationship with a German duchess, Margarethe of . Württemberg, and is survived by their son Patrick de la Lanne, 50, the . mayor of Delmenhort – a town of 74,000 people near Bremen in north . Germany – and three adult grandchildren. In his later years the count was best known for being an eccentric figure who had an . aggressive dislike of the Prince of Wales, whom he called 'an absolute . disgrace' in 2003. And in the late 1990s he provoked opposition when he proposed to open a drying-out clinic for alcoholics on Great Bernera, which he wanted to call a 'personal rediscovery centre'. During February 2004 he was admitted to Hammersmith Hospital in London after suffering a stroke and while he was there, he contracted MRSA. He was convinced he had been infected by bacteria on doctors’ ties and demanded that the neckwear should be banned.","Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees romanced a string of socialites .

A woman has been jailed for abusing three young boys in her care, beating them with bamboo sticks and forcing the youngest to brush his teeth with dog excrement. Stephanie Chibnall, 45, had been in ‘temporary care’ of the brothers, now aged nine, ten and 13, since 2008. She was sentenced to 20 months in jail over the abuse, which saw her regularly punish the children for the most trivial reason, such as failing to find her cigarettes or not having enough home work. Jailed: Stephanie Chibnall, 45, was found guilty at Maidstone Crown Court over her abuse of the three brothers in her care . The abuse came to light when a teacher . at the boys’ school reported that one had turned up looking like he had . been ‘in a car crash’. Ms Chibnall, from Gravesend, Kent, who has been looking after the boys since their mother had a mental breakdown in 2008, was found guilty of three counts of cruelty to a person under 16. She will also be banned from working with children, Maidstone Crown Court heard. During an earlier hearing the court was told she regularly beat the brothers with her fists, sticks and an electric fly swatter - leaving them covered in severe cuts and bruises. On one occasion she made the youngest boy brush his teeth with dog faeces as punishment for having a dirty toothbrush. During the sentencing, judge David Griffith-Jones QC called the act ‘depraved and sadistic’. Sentencing: Judge David Griffith-Jones QC called Ms Chibnall's acts sadistic . Anthony Prosser, prosecuting, told the . court previously how an investigation in Ms Chibnall began after one of . the boys - who cannot be named for legal reasons - turned up at school . with a huge bruise from his knee to his hip. Teachers reported the injury, saying it looked like the boy had ‘been in a car crash’. The abuse, which took place . between 2008 and March 2011, saw the boys ‘frequently beaten with sticks’ for not having any homework or for being unable to find Ms Chibnall’s cigarettes. One of the boys told of one occasion where he was beaten so hard the bamboo stick broke. Mr Prosser said: 'He [the boy] said she demanded to know why he didn’t always have homework. 'She picked up a stick she used to threaten dogs with and hit him on the leg and arm. 'He cried because it hurt. She told him he was being a baby.' Another time she asked him why his room was messy and struck him, causing the boy to hit his head on the window sill. He was left with a scar about half an inch long. Mr Prosser added: 'He went to A&E and the cut was glued. She told him to tell the nurses he had fallen off his skateboard. Another told how he was punched in the mouth when he said he did not have any spellings for homework. He had a couple of days off school and told teachers he had been hit by a swing. He said she told him not to tell anyone or she would hit him again. Sentencing Ms Chibnall to prison, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC, told . her: ‘I cannot ignore the lasting damage you are likely to have caused . to these three young boys. ‘I cannot ignore, on the face of it, the depraved and sadistic feature involved in the incident with the toothbrush.’ Ms Chibnall denied ever assaulting the youngsters but said she had made them stand in the corner with their hands on their heads to discipline them. She claimed the stick was to control her dogs and she did not hit the children with it. She claimed to know nothing about a toothbrush incident.","Stephanie Chibnall, 45, was jailed for 20 months for abusing three young boys in her care .

One prisoner every week has been freed by mistake from British jails including murderers and sex offenders, alarming new figures reveal. Officials blamed the blunders on errors such as inmates having the same name as others who were supposed to be freed, incorrect documents and prison sentences calculated wrongly. A staggering 369 prisoners have been released by mistake since 2005, according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice following a Freedom of Information request by MailOnline. One prisoner every week has been freed by mistake - including seven prisoners from London's high security Belmarsh prison, pictured . While most of the prisoners have now been recaptured – a worrying 34 of these were still on the run in July this year. Ten of those released by mistake in total were convicted sex offenders – though seven of these were returned to custody. At least 18 of these prisoners were held in Category A prisons, holding prisoners deemed to be highly dangerous to the public or national security. Many prisoners in Category A prisons will be in there for life sentences, including for murder, rape, or acts of terrorism. Although just because they were held in Category A prisons, does not mean they were classed as Category A prisoners, according to the Ministry of Justice. But the department admitted earlier this week that one Category A prisoner was among eight prisoners still on the run currently after escaping from British jails. Sadiq Khan MP, Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary, lambasted the figures as ‘shambolic.’ He told the MailOnline: ‘The safety of communities up and down the country is being placed at risk as one prisoner a week is wrongly released. ‘If it wasn't bad enough that these prisoners are being wrongly let out, what makes it worse is that so many aren’t being recaptured.’ The figures, which exclude immigrants being detained and include both convicted prisoners and those on remand, show that from 2007 to 2010, the number of prisoners released in error from jail doubled from 36 a year to 72. In 2011 this figure dropped to 41. Seven prisoners have escaped from London’s high-security Belmarsh prison since 2007. One of these prisoners was released wrongly just last year. The prison reportedly currently holds terror preacher Abu Qatada and in the past serial killer Peter Tobin amongst other high profile inmates. 14 prisoners were wrongly released from jails across the country in the first three months of this year – more than one prisoner every week. 10 of these have still not been returned to jail. One prisoner was released wrongly from Belmarsh prison last year - a high-security prison - which reportedly currently holds terror preacher Abu Qatada and in the past held serial killer Peter Tobin, right, amongst other high-profile inmates . The total figure for prisoners released by mistake covers from 2005 up until March this year and the figures of those still on the run refer to those still on the run in March. The Ministry of Justice refused to give details of the nature of the crime committed by a Category A prisoner who was released in error in November 2008, because they said it risked identifying the individual. Javed Khan, Chief Executive of Victim Support, said: ‘Victims and witnesses of crime expect justice to be done and for sentencing to prevent reoffending. ‘Clearly, this cannot happen if prisoners are released early by mistake. ‘These errors undermine public confidence in the justice system, and represent a failed opportunity to turn more offenders into law-abiding citizens.’ In 2009 Jason Bethell was released from Chelmsford jail by mistake after being remanded in custody on a charge of murdering John Smith, 58, in Essex. He later handed himself in to police before appearing at Chelmsford Crown Court where he was found not-guilty and cleared of the charge. Former murder suspect Jason Bethell, left, was released by mistake before he handed himself into the police and was cleared of the charge and right, Anthony Joseph, who killed Richard Whelan, hours after being released in error . Terence Clegg was released from prison in Durham in October 2008 instead of his father, who shared the name and was held at the same jail. Raheem Ahmed was wrongly freed in Birmingham in August 2007 after serving a week of a six-month sentence for violent affray. The late delivery of a photograph was blamed. Anthony Joseph stabbed to death Richard Whelan on a bus in Islington, North London, hours after being released in error from HMP Forest Bank in July 2005. Child abduction charges against him had been dropped as officials were unaware of an outstanding warrant for his arrest for burglary. The prison that released him, in Manchester, was unaware there was an arrest warrant out for him. And the police holding the arrest warrant, just a few miles away in Liverpool, did not know he was in custody because computer records had not been updated. Bobby Phipps had been released from Manchester’s Strangeways jail in November 2004 after only four days on remand when facing six charges of attempted murder. He was released after a prison officer failed to update paperwork correctly. The 22-year-old was rearrested and given a life sentence. The Ministry of Justice said not all of the prisoners released in error were required to be returned to custody. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ‘We take public protection extremely seriously and this type of error is a rare but regrettable occurrence. ‘The Prison Service has developed robust procedures to deal with such situations and the majority of those who are released in error are returned to custody very quickly.’","A staggering 369 prisoners have been .

The incoming New York Times C.E.O Mark Thompson will be grilled within days about his knowledge of the pedophilia scandal engulfing the BBC - the organisation which he was head of for eight years. An internal investigation run by the BBC is due to report by the end of the month on the decision by the British public broadcaster to pull a planned news report into the long serving television personality Jimmy Saville. Since his death last year, Saville has been at the centre of countless allegations of sexual abuse towards young women and the internal review will seek to discover if Mr. Thompson knew of the allegations the current affairs program 'Newsnight' was planning to make. Drawn in: Incoming New York Times chief . executive Mark Thompson (left) initially denied having any knowledge of a BBC . programme's investigation into alleged sexual abuse by television host . Jimmy Savile (right) It is not known whether Mr. Thompson will be interviewed by telephone or in person and it is understood that he will be offered legal representation during the course of his questioning. At the heart of the matter is what Mr. Thompson knew about the planned report and the incoming New York Times chief has already amended his story after recalling a journalist mentioning the allegations against Jimmy Saville at a party. Mr.Thomson originally said that he was not aware of the sexual abuse allegations that were planned to be made. While the BBC has maintained it did not have the proof to run the allegations, the organisation will also be examined to see if the information they did have warranted being handed over to the police. This new development ramps up the pressure on Mr. Thompson with his future employees already questioning his suitability for the top job. Last month Margaret Sullivan questioned the . integrity and ability of the man who was director general when a report . that would have exposed Jimmy Savile as a predator who targeted young, . vulnerable girls, was axed. Writing in a blog post yesterday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself said: 'How likely is it that [Thompson] knew nothing?' 'His integrity and decision-making . are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly. It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, . given this turn of events.' Paedophile: Police have described the late Top Of The Pops presenter Jimmy Savile as one of Britain's worst sex offenders . 'No knowledge': Mr Thompson said that, during . his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations . or received any complaints about Savile (pictured) Jimmy Saville who died in October 2011 is now acknowledged to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers with over 300 possible victims. Mr Thompson, who left the BBC after eight years last month, has said he would be happy to give evidence to British politicians investigating the scandal. He said he only learned about the planned documentary at a party last December when another journalist told him: 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation.' Mr Thompson said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic reasons'. He added that he did not ask what allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC. After Savile died, BBC journalists for the Newsnight programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east England. Controversial: Margaret Sullivan (far left) was . the first journalist at the New York Times to question Mr Thompson's . fitness to take the top job . They spoke to at least four women who claimed they had been abused or knew about abuse at the school, but the programme never aired. More allegations came to light when a rival British broadcaster, ITV, aired a programme about Savile's behaviour. British police have received a flood of claims since the ITV documentary was shown, and more than 200 alleged victims have come forward. In a letter to the Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Mr Thompson described the claims about Savile as ‘exceptionally grave’ but said that the Director-General very rarely became involved in investigations before they were broadcast. He said: 'Given the many hundreds of investigations the BBC does every year, the personal involvement of the DG (Director-General) in a given investigation would inevitably be unusual and noteworthy and could therefore have a distorting or chilling effect on the journalism involved.’ The Newsnight expose was also not in a list of 'potentially sensitive programmes' drawn up as part of BBC’s editorial policy as far as he could recall, he said. Mr Thompson added that, during his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Savile, adding: ‘His name scarcely came up at all.’ He said he finally heard about the claims when the ITV programme was publicised last month, after he had left the BBC.. This was despite reports about the BBC's decision to drop the Newsnight investigation having previously appeared in five newspapers, including the Daily Mail.","Mr Thompson stepped down as head of the BBC in September .

Thousands of teachers and other public sector workers are employed by off-shore firms in a scheme described as ‘the next big UK tax scandal’. Taxpayers are losing out on millions of pounds in national insurance contributions because of the controversial arrangements, a BBC investigation has claimed. Schools and councils which hired the teachers could now be forced to foot the bill for the unpaid tax. Thousands of teachers and other public sector workers are employed by off-shore firms in a scheme described as ¿the next big UK tax scandal¿ (file picture) One firm based in Sark, one of the Channel Islands, employs more than 24,000 temporary agency workers in the UK, mostly supply teachers, according to the investigation by BBC 5 Live. The staff are recruited by UK-based recruitment agencies, which insist they use the services of the Sark-based firm, International Subcontracting Solutions, to handle the payment of their salaries and expenses. It means the teachers are technically employees of ISS, which claims to work with more than 900 UK recruitment agencies. The firm ensures the teachers pay tax and employee national insurance contributions but since it is based offshore, does not pay the employer’s contribution to national insurance. The BBC said the UK agencies that place the teachers are not paying employers’ national insurance either, leaving a huge tax liability. HM Revenue and Customs warned that schools and councils, or the recruitment agencies, could be forced to cover the shortfall. Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, told the BBC that the growth of ‘umbrella companies’ such as ISS was ‘the next big UK tax scandal’. He said: ‘The UK can’t afford this tax loss and it can’t afford so many households being put at tax risk. This is a scandal waiting to break.’ Crawford Temple, director of tax consultancy Professional Passport, said he wrote to the Treasury in July 2011 to warn about the use of off-shore companies to employ public sector agency workers. But he told 5 Live Investigates, which airs at 9pm tonight, that ministers failed to respond. Mr Temple said schools or councils could end up paying out twice as much as they need to. One Channel Islands firm employs more than 24,000 temporary agency staff, mostly supply teachers, according to a BBC investigation (file picture) This is because schools pay a rate to their recruitment suppliers that covers all relevant tax and NI contributions. The rate is the same where the supply teacher is employed via an offshore provider.If HMRC enforces collection of employer’s national insurance and goes to schools for it, they would effectively pay double, he said. On its website, ISS says it is ‘an employment business, often referred to as an umbrella company’. It adds: ‘ISS is able to provide contractors with a more tax effective salary package than an agency. ISS operates a… tax efficient payroll structure, which allows you to maximise your pay, while maintaining a full UK tax record.’ ISS could not be reached for comment but told the BBC the company is ‘meticulous in complying with HMRC codes on taxes and expenses’. It also said HMRC had no grounds to challenge either its employees or business partners. In a statement, HMRC said: ‘These kinds of arrangements are not compliant with tax and national insurance legislation and the end client or the employment businesses may be liable for any underpaid tax and national insurance.’","Schools and councils which hired the teachers through off-shore firms could now foot the unpaid tax bill .

'Bored': Bradley Wiggins has admitted he was once a 12-pints-a-day man - thanks to an unlikely obsession with Belgian beer. He is pictured with his wife Catherine . It is hard to imagine super-fit champion cyclist Bradley Wiggins having an alcohol problem. But the Tour de France winner says he was once a 12-pints-a-day man – thanks to an unlikely obsession with Belgian beer. The supremely disciplined athlete, who this year became the first Briton to win cycling’s toughest challenge, started drinking in his 20s. Short of money, despite having won three medals at the Athens Olympics, and bored sitting at home while his wife Cath was at work, he started a new hobby – collecting all 365 varieties of Belgian beer. In his new autobiography, to  be published this week, Wiggins recounts how he regularly set off for Brussels and returned home with a van-load of local brews. He would sit at home, admiring his collection, and then start drinking it. Before long he would be standing outside the pub, waiting for the doors to open, and by the end of the day he would often have consumed a dozen pints. ‘I was just bored s***less and didn’t know what to do,’ he told the Guardian yesterday. Disastrously for an athlete, he rapidly put on weight during his nine-month bender. ‘I got quite big. I was probably 83kg [just under 13 stone].’ He weighed in at 69kg (10st 8lb) for this year’s Tour de France. Wiggins is not the first prominent personality to admit to a drink problem in their youth, with Foreign Secretary William Hague boasting he used to drink 14  pints a day as a teenager. No longer a beer-drinker, Wiggins says the birth of his first child was the main reason  he returned to sobriety. The Olympic gold medallist, who earned an estimated £5 million this year, said: ‘We had a baby. So it was a case of, well, I’ve got to earn some f***ing money and the responsibility takes over.’ Historic: Bradley Wiggins, centre, is pictured after winning the Tour de France this year .","Short of money and bored sitting at home while his wife was at work Wiggins started a new hobby – collecting all 365 varieties .

Federal inspectors will be carrying out checks this Saturday to Liberty Island, and its neighbour Ellis Island, although a quick examination showed no damage to the statue or the Ellis Island museum.

Designed by Frederic Bartholdi, the statue is a neo-classical sculpture based on the Roman Goddess of Freedom, Libertas. She was a present to the US from France to celebrate independence and was erected in 1886 in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island. Bartholdi's inspiration for the statue was a comment made by politician Édouard René de Laboulaye in mid-1865. He stated: 'If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort - a common work of both our nations.' She makes for a truly exhilarating sight for anyone entering New York. The main body of the statue stands at 151ft high, but with the pedestal included, reaches 305ft. She has been featured in several Hollywood films such as Independence Day, Cloverfield, The Day After Tomorrow and Planet Of The Apes, where she appears buried in a beach.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt: The new measure mark a victory for patients . Patients could sue the NHS if they are forced into mixed sex wards under a revamp of the NHS constitution, it emerged yesterday. The patients' charter will also enshrine in law the need for patients and families to be consulted before a patient is put on an 'end of life' pathway. Both moves by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt herald a major victory for patients and follow separate Daily Mail campaigns over the indignity of mixed sex accommodation and the controversial end-of-life treatment plans. A ban on mixed wards comes nearly two decades after an initial pledge by then Tory Prime Minister John Major.  Just last year, half of all NHS trusts in England admitted they had placed patients in mixed rooms. Since then, the Department of Health has introduced fines of £250 per patient, per day for hospitals still doing so. But the new NHS constitution will leave patients in no doubt about their rights.  It will declare: 'If you are admitted to  hospital, you will not have to share sleeping accommodation with patients of the opposite sex.' It will also give reassurances to vulnerable patients, saying: 'You have the right  to be involved fully in all discussions  and decisions about your health  and care, including in your end of life care, and to be given information to enable you to do this. Where appropriate this right includes your family and carers.' 'The right to be involved':The patient's charter will leave them in no doubt about their rights . Lib Dem Care Services Minister Norman Lamb said the new obligation would make 'clear and explicit' to patients and their families that they would be kept informed over end-of-life treatment. He added that although there had been a 'very substantial' reduction in the number of patients on mixed sex wards, all patients had a right to expect single sex rooms. Mr Lamb made clear that all  providers of NHS care would be legally bound to take account of the NHS constitution. 'Ultimately, there could be a legal challenge if a provider was systematically failing to take account of the constitution,' he added. 'It provides much greater  force and again it restates the principle that you should have single-sex accommodation if you have NHS care.' Respect for staff - or no treatment . You should treat NHS staff and other patients with respect and recognise that violence, causing a nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises could result in prosecution and that abusive or violent behaviour could result in you being refused access to the NHS. Prompt apology if things go wrong . To ensure that if you are harmed while receiving healthcare you receive an appropriate explanation and apology, delivered with sensitivity and recognition of the trauma you have experienced, and know that where mistakes have been made, lessons will be learned to help avoid a similar incident occurring again, and to ensure that the organisation learns lessons from complaints and uses these to improve NHS services. Decisions on end-of-life care . You have the right, to be involved fully in all discussions and decisions about your healthcare, including in your end of life care, and to be given information to enable you to do this. Where appropriate this right includes your family and carers. Single sex wards . If you are admitted to hospital, you will not have to share sleeping accommodation with patients of the opposite sex, in line with details set out in the Handbook to the NHS Constitution. He also explained that care providers would be obliged to consult patients on end-of-life care. '[The constitution] will now specifically refer to the importance of involvement, so I think it really does genuinely strengthen the obligation,' he went on. But Marie Curie Cancer Care argued that the Government should go further and called for the next independent national audit of the end-of-life Liverpool Care Pathway to be brought forward. Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, said he was disappointed that patients would still not be given a choice of whether to die at home or in a hospice. He added: 'While these changes are good as far as they go, I would like to see much more ambition from the Government on end-of-life care. 'Far too many families in England find themselves spending their final hours with a loved-one in a hospital. Many would much rather be together at home or in a hospice. This more personal approach can also cost much less. The Mail has highlighted concerns about relatives not being consulted when their loved ones are being put on the LCP. The pathway means patients deemed close to death are sedated and denied nutrition and fluids by tube – but many families have come forward to complain that this happens without discussion with relatives of those involved. Last month the family of Margaret Kibble, 95, told how hospital staff allegedly removed all her drips and feeding tubes without any consultation after she was admitted to hospital in Lewisham in January 2011. When family members heard her begging for water they demanded that doctors put the great-grandmother back on food and fluids. Nearly two years later, she is still alive and back home. Last night her son Graham Satchell, 57, welcomed the announcement and said: 'We applaud any changes that mean hospitals talk more with families. In some cases the Liverpool Care Pathway is the right thing to do, but families need to be told the fors and against.' Former nurse Jane Taylor, 57, claims that she only found out that doctors had sedated her mother and withdrawn food and fluids when she caught a glimpse of her medical notes on a windowsill. But it was too late to stop the process and 83-year-old Phyllis Nicholls, who was being treated at a hospital in Surrey, died. Last night Mrs Taylor said: 'This is a very good idea because older people are scared of going into hospital at the moment.' But Imelda Redmond, director of policy and public affairs at Marie Curie, said: 'The Liverpool Care Pathway has enabled thousands to experience dignified care in the last days of life. We have become increasingly concerned about the media coverage which reports negative experiences of people in hospital and the end of life. 'That is why we are calling for the next independent national audit to be brought forward so that we can identify as soon at possible where these failings are taking place.' Abusive patients face being thrown out of hospitals and denied treatment under reforms to the NHS 'bill of rights'. Repeat offenders will be barred from trusts or doctors' surgeries in a similar way to unruly pupils who are excluded from school. Some 60,000 NHS workers a year are violently assaulted. But almost 70 per cent of the attacks involve patients who are not responsible for their actions due to underlying conditions such as mental health problems. Proposed changes to the NHS constitution will allow staff to refuse to treat violent patients but only 'if it is safe to do so'. Care minister Norman Lamb said: 'It is important to understand we have responsibilities as well as rights and we should be treating professionals with respect. It is a two-way street.' Fewer than one in 40 attacks on NHS staff end in prosecution. Hospitals and GPs can already ban abusive patients according to their local policy but this is the first time a national guideline has been put in place. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing union, said: 'We agree with the sentiment in principle but it is another thing putting it into practice. We are not going to fling out a person if they have a very major ailment and they are being abusive.'","Complaints must be answered in three working days, single sex wards must be the norm and there will be a right to an apology .
Patients and their families must also be consulted about the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway for people who are dying ."

Parish councillors have pulled the plug on a Christmas lights switch on ceremony in a decision described as ‘health and safety gone berserk’. The event, which usually attracts several hundred people every year, was axed by councillors in Bishop’s Cleeve, Gloucestershire who feared the village green would become overcrowded. Instead, the lights will be quietly switched without fanfare. Christmas is cancelled: The Christmas lights switch-on at Bishop's . Cleeve last year. The event usually attracts several hundred people but has been . cancelled this year over health and safety fears . Peter Badham, vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce, said the decision was ‘health and safety gone berserk’. He said: ‘We’re talking about responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that. I think it’s a perfect location. This year the switch on has been cancelled, the lights will be turned on quietly . without fanfare. Pictured is last year's switch on. ‘In terms of space, we’ve looked at it and we think there’s more than enough room for everybody to come and have a great time. ‘There is nowhere else to go now. The parish council has really let the community down.’ In previous years, the ceremony has been held in a local supermarket car park with Santa’s grotto inside the community centre but this year the Bishop’s Cleeve Parish Council withdrew permission for the use of the centre because organisers failed to ‘sign in’ everyone who entered the building. To resolve the issue, the chamber, which has organised the switch on for the last 11 years, suggested the event be held on the village green. But the parish council blocked those plans on health and safety grounds. Chair of the parish council, Peter Lightfoot said: ‘The plans we voted against were using our little green area. The key reason for that is it’s quite a small area and normally we get hundreds to the light switch on. ‘I think the problem is that they approached us with about four weeks to go and essentially held a gun to our head and said “either you let us use the green or it won’t happen”. ‘We just can’t see how they could fit it on that particular piece of land. ‘We’re in favour of the lights. We’re just not in favour of holding it on the parish green.’ Previous fun of the fair: Crowds in the town are kept entertained but there will be no similar scenes this year after they feared too many people would turn up to the village green . Peter Badham from the chamber of commerce said it was 'responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that' Concerns were also raised about event . licences, the lack of stewards, the weight of the fairground roundabout, . notices for road closures, adequate risk assessment and insurance to . parish council property. Mr Lightfoot said of the plans: ‘We are concerned as we have dry-stone walls, a fountain and a rockery and an adjacent main road. Our concern is that it is just totally unsafe and unsuitable. ‘As far as I know the Christmas lights committee has not scheduled another place to hold the switch-on.’ The Christmas lights, which cost £3,000 to install and maintain, were due to be lit on November 24 but they are now likely to be switched on without an official event. Mr Badham said: ‘If the parish council doesn’t want to co-operate, then we will just turn the lights on without the event. ‘The council is supposed to be . working with the community, not having all this in-fighting. ‘They have . also given us nothing in terms of cash. ‘It’s truly a highlight of the year in the village - it’s a delightful event. ‘It’s . all about the community, it’s all about the children and for those . children who come, it’s absolutely wonderful and marks the start of . Christmas.’ Health and . safety guidelines for public events state that organisers need to have . crowd management, planning for emergencies and event stewards.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:02 EST, 5 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:23 EST, 5 November 2012 . David Cameron today ordered an independent investigation - likely to be led by a judge - into whether an inquiry ignored claims a senior Tory was involved in child abuse in North Wales. The Prime Minister said he would ask an independent figure to review the Waterhouse Inquiry into into abuse at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in the 1970s and 1980s. It follows allegations that a senior unnamed Conservative was among those involved in abusing children but were not properly investigate at the time. Allegations: The former Bryn Estyn children's home in North Wales . The Home Office and Wales Office are among departments which have been asked to look into fresh claims of abuse. Speaking on a trade visit to the Gulf, Mr Cameron announced he would review the Waterhouse Inquiry to see if it was 'properly constituted'. He also announced Welsh Secretary David Jones will meet Mr Messham. The PM wrote on Twitter today: 'Child abuse is a hateful crime. Snr figure to lead independent investigation into claims of care home abuse in Wales - will report urgently.' He later told reporters: 'Child abuse is an absolutely hateful and abhorrent crime and these allegations are truly dreadful and they mustn't be left hanging in the air, so I'm taking action today. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is on a trade visit to Dubai, is taking a 'close interest' in the child abuse allegations . 'So I am taking . action today, first of all to make sure that Mr Messham can meet . urgently with the Secretary of State for Wales so he he can hear his . allegations and his points directly. 'Secondly, I am going to be asking a senior independent figure to lead . an urgent investigation into whether the original inquiry was properly . constituted and properly did its job and to report urgently to the . Government. 'But third, I would also urge anyone who knows anything about these . matters to go to the police. That is where evidence should be taken so . that action can be taken and we can deal with this dreadful, dreadful . issue.' Downing Street said Mr Cameron was . taking a ‘close interest’ in the issue, as ministers face calls to meet . victims who have spoken out. It comes after Mr Messham claimed in an interview with BBC’s Newsnight that he was taken out of Bryn Estyn and ‘sold’ to men for sexual abuse at a nearby hotel. He wants to meet the PM discuss his own experiences at the home and his claim that a senior Conservative Party figure was among those involved in abuse. Mr Messham said a senior Tory from the time, who was not named by the programme, had been involved. But Labour MP Tom Watson, who last month claimed there was evidence linking a former No.10 aide to a paedophile ring, urged Mr Cameron to go further. Writing an open letter on his blog, Mr Watson said: 'My advice to you as Prime Minister – and from one father to another – is that you need to order a special police investigation, outside the affected forces, with proper resources, to review all relevant police files and those of the intelligence services. 'If they have documents suggesting politicians in the Commons and Lords or others in positions of power were involved in child abuse then they should make them available to a new inquiry team.' He claimed police forces in London, Surrey, West and South Yorkshire, West Mercia, Dorset, Kent, Essex, North Wales, Suffolk and Sussex could all be implicated. Mr Watson has also made allegations involving child abuse and a former cabinet minister. Mr Watson added: 'Your advisers will tell you to be wary of “opening the floodgates”. They are wrong. Their decorous caution is the friend of the paedophile. Narrowing the inquiry equals hiding the truth. That is the reality and it is not what you want.' Downing Street said there was to be a separate process to consider the police response at the time of the original North Wales allegations. Earlier, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman told a briefing of journalists in Westminster that the allegations had to be properly investigated. ‘On this issue, it is something that we are looking at actively. The Prime Minister has taken a close interest in the reports and the allegations that have been made,’ the spokesman said. ‘We are very clear that those allegations need to be properly investigated and we need to get to the bottom of precisely what happened.’ Steve Messham claimed on BBC's Newsnight that he was abused by a Tory politician . Asked who within Government was looking into the allegations, the spokesman replied: ‘The Government is looking at this issue. These issues relate to a number of departments, so clearly it is something we are discussing with the Wales Office and the Home Office is involved in these issues too. ‘There are a number of departments that are involved and we at the centre are taking an active interest in the issue and looking at it very closely.’ Children’s Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler was today expected to write to Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones to demand an inquiry into the latest allegations. Mr Towler said at the weekend: ‘I would support a full inquiry. The fact that we have someone on camera now who was clearly a victim of appalling abuse in Bryn Estyn children’s home back in the 1970s and 80s, saying that what he wanted to say was outside of the terms of reference, and people told him that he could not say these things and he couldn’t talk about people who had abused him, is clearly wrong. ‘The fact that he is now saying that and he has now said it so publicly means we have to respond to that.’ Today Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said he had requested 'urgent advice' on the original remit of the Waterhouse Inquiry, to help him determine whether a further investigation is needed. Mr Jones added in a statement: 'An extensive inquiry into North Wales child abuse - the so-called Waterhouse Report - was published in 2000. 'It . was commissioned - before devolution began - by the then secretary of . state for Wales William Hague and reported to Paul Murphy, as secretary . of state, in 2000. It made extensive recommendations for improving child . protection, many of which were subsequently implemented by the Welsh . Government. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones today announced he would meet Children¿s Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler . 'I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse Inquiry at the time when it was set up. 'I need to understand fully what was included in those terms of reference and what was excluded. In due course that will enable me to consider, with others, whether any further inquiry might be necessary. 'One of the key recommendations of the Waterhouse Report was the establishment of a children's commissioner for Wales. I have invited Keith Towler to come in and see me tomorrow so that I can hear his thoughts directly. 'Finally, I would like to repeat that any victims of child abuse who feel their cases were not fully investigated, should come forward to the appropriate authorities which means the police or to the children's commissioner, not to political parties.' The original tribunal into the abuse at Bryn Estyn in the 1970s and 80s heard evidence from more than 650 former residents of some 40 children’s homes between 1974 and 1990. It published its report in 2000. The inquiry identified 28 alleged perpetrators but they were never identified. It was also claimed a second senior Tory was named but a court order prevented it from being made public. Bryn Estyn’s deputy head, Peter Howarth, was jailed in 1994 for ten years for sexually abusing boys. He died in jail.

A Northern Illinois University freshman was found dead in a fraternity house bunk bed on Friday, after a booze-fueled college party. David Bogenberger, 19, was unresponsive when police arrived at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house at 10.14am and was pronounced dead about half an hour later by DeKalb County Coroner Dennis Miller. An autopsy performed on Saturday failed to determine why the sports-loving business student died, but toxicology tests should show whether alcohol played a role. Mr Bogenberger, a triplet, graduated from Palatine High School in June. His father, Gary Bogenberger, said his son lived in a campus dormitory but was pledging the fraternity. He told the Daily Chronicle he found it 'tragic' that his son died alone. 'I am so surprised at the number of comments and well-wishes on his Facebook page from so many of his friends,' he said. 'He was such a nice kid that everyone liked. I just video-chatted with him Wednesday night, and he seemed so happy, doing great in his classes and looking so forward to life. 'It's tragic that he died alone.' David's mother, Ruth Bogenberger, added that the family was 'shocked and distraught' by Mr Bogenberger's mystery death. His sister, Megan, changed her Facebook profile to a photograph of her and David on Friday, with the caption, 'you were the best brother a girl could ask for.' Condolences from friends and family members flooded in over the weekend, with Andrew Sutter writing: 'Megan and alex im sry (sic) for ur loss dave was a great guy, he knew how to make everyone laugh its a tragedy to say that he is gone i pay u my respectes (sic) and once again im sry for ur loss.' Triplet: David Bogenberger, left, was a triple and his sister Megan, right, said on her Facebook on Friday that he was 'the best brother a girl could have' DeKalb Police Lt. Jason Leverton said there were no obvious signs of foul play and no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Bogenberger's death. Officers found evidence of alcohol use near Mr Bogenberger's body, and they know he was one of several students invited to the fraternity house on Thursday night. But they won't know whether binge-drinking or some form of fraternity initiation was responsible until toxicology samples are returned, which could take up to two weeks. Frat: Mr Bogenberger, pictured right, was pledging the fraternity, his dad said . Lt. Leverton said they wanted . to interview more than 20 people who had been at the fraternity house . around that time to help piece together what happened. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with David's family and friends as they cope with this difficult loss,' NIU President John Peters said. 'Please know that your grief is shared collectively by the NIU community.' The university is offering counselling and support to help students deal with the freshman's death. President of the NIU Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, Alexander Jandick, said the chapter has ceased operations and was fully cooperating with the police investigation.

Puerto Ricans voted toward statehood on Tuesday aiming to potentially become the United States' 51st state. In a two-part referendum 75,188 or 53 per cent voted to change Puerto Rico’s 114-year relationship with the U.S. with 65 per cent voting in favour of statehood among alternatives of greater autonomy or independence. Despite the 4 million citizens in the U.S. island territory unable to vote in the U.S. presidential election, many were excited to participate in the referendum. Voting for unity: Men enthusiastically hang out a moving car's window while waving a Puerto Rican flag as the people voted in favour of statehood . Rejoice: Supporters of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wave flags after casting their vote to elect the local government and participate in their fourth political status plebiscite . Among the 243 of 1,643 precincts reporting on late Tuesday, 47 per cent, or 67,304 voters, supported the status quo. On the second question, opposing the statehood vote, 31 per cent cast their ballots for sovereign free association and 4 per cent for independence. Both President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney said they supported . the referendum, with Obama pledging to respect the will of the people if . there was a clear majority. Any change would require approval by the . U.S. Congress. Car horns blared and party flags waved after polling stations closed following what election officials said was a high voter turnout. During the day, many voters carried umbrellas against the blistering tropical sun as temperatures neared 90 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius). Gubernatorial: With votes dually cast for governor people from the pro-statehood New Progressive Party are seen reacting to Alejandro Garcia Padill lead and eventual win . Shared votes: A voter for statehood waved an American flag, left, while another held her Puerto Rican flag while cheering toward the gubernatorial election's race . Status quo: Followers of the Popular Democratic Party, favouring the island's current political status that earned 47 per cent of votes, play in front of their party after casting their vote . 'Puerto Rico has to be a state. There is no other option,' said 25-year-old Jerome Lefebre, who picked up his grandfather before driving to the polls. 'We're doing OK, but we could do better. We would receive more benefits, a lot more financial help.' But 42-year-old Ramon Lopez de Azua said he favoured the current system, which grants U.S. citizenship but prevents Puerto Ricans from voting for president unless they live in the United States, and gives those on the island only limited representation in Congress. 'Puerto Rico's problem is not its political status,' he said. 'I think that the United States is the best country in the world, but I am Puerto Rican first.' Withstanding: Voters wait in line to cast their ballots at a polling station in San Juan, during the day many voters carried umbrellas against the blistering tropical sun as temperatures neared 90 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) Excitement: The U.S. island territory's 4 million citizens were unable to vote in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday but many were excited to participate in the referendum . Tight race: Claudio Manuel Cepeda Ayala, 75, is seen casting his vote to elect the local government narrowly won by Alejandro Garcia Padilla, whose Popular Democratic Party favours the status quo . Puerto Rico held non-binding referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998, with statehood never garnering a clear majority and independence never obtaining more than 5 per cent of the vote. The island also was electing legislators and a governor, with Gov Luis Fortuno of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party seeking a second term. Gov Fortuno, a Republican, was challenged by Alejandro Garcia Padilla, whose Popular Democratic Party favours the status quo. With 817 of 1,643 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Garcia had 427,604 votes, or 48 per cent, while Gov Fortuno had 422,506 votes, or 47 per cent.","65 per cent voted for statehood on Tuesday .

'Mr Abdur-Raheem, your conduct is despicable,' Judge Ferencz fired at the man while mutually calling him 'narcissistic and self-centered.' 'You're not a good person,' he added. Abdur-Raheem told the judge he . comprehended the horrific effect his actions had taken and sympathized . with the additional victims it created. 'I commiserate with everyone involved . in this. I obviously believe a human being is the world's most valuable . resource. It is sad every time a life is lost,' he said, adding that he . 'wonders every time what my daughter would look like and what she could . have done.' In early September Abdur-Raheem was . criticized for showing no emotion during his conviction for murder, . kidnapping and endangering the welfare of a child while the girl's . mother, Venetta Benjamin openly wept during her testimony along with his . verdict. Taken: Zara Malani-Lin Abdur-Raheem, left, was just three-months-old when her father, right, tossed her off a New Jersey bridge to her death after a physical fight with her grandmother . Speaking again on Wednesday Zara’s mother emotionally expressed her ensuing loss to the judge: 'I lost the best part of me. 'I'll never get to experience what . other mothers have. I mourn the loss of my child. [Her death] has left a . void that can never be filled.' With Abdur-Raheem’s verdict on . September 7 he was also found guilty of two counts of simple assault . after attacking the baby's grandmother over the head and then again with . his car during the February 16th kidnapping. The infant's mother had custody of . the child at the time of the attack with a restraining order filed . against Abdur-Raheem that same day. In September she thanked all those 'who have worked tirelessly on this case and verdict, to ensure justice for my daughter', adding: 'God is good.' New Jersey’s attorney general lauded the verdict, saying it was 'a chapter in a tragedy, but a chapter that needed to be written', in a case that prompted an overhaul of the state’s rules on issuing missing child alerts. Abdur-Raheem admitted during the trial that he threw three-month-old Zara Malani-Lin Abdur-Raheem off a Garden State Parkway bridge into the Raritan River but said he didn't know why. But he claimed he believed the child already was dead from injuries she suffered during a fight with the baby’s grandmother. The jury acquitted Abdur-Raheem of attempted murder of the baby’s maternal grandmother, Leno Benjamin. The grandmother had been caring for the infant at her East Orange apartment after the child’s mother obtained a restraining order against Abdur-Raheem. Abdur-Raheem testified that during a struggle with the child’s grandmother, the baby fell and hit her head. But a state forensic anthropologist testified the skull fractures found on the baby were made at or about the time of death and that they were caused by a significant fall and not one of four feet or less. During his testimony, Abdur-Raheem said he placed the infant in a knapsack, and pushed her out the passenger side window and off the Driscoll Bridge, into the river more than 100 feet below. 'I tossed my daughter off the bridge,' he said. 'I don’t know why.' Family members said at the time of the baby’s disappearance that the couple, who never married, had a bumpy relationship since they started dating as freshmen at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. Abdur-Raheem, of Galloway Township, wore a suit, tie and glasses in court, and showed little reaction during the proceedings in front of State Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz. Abdur-Raheem’s mother and father, both present in court for the verdict, declined to comment. His attorney, Michael Priarone, did not comment following the verdict, and did not return a call seeking comment. Deputy Attorney General Andrew Fried, who prosecuted the case, said he appreciated that jurors seemed to have taken their time because they were taking the case seriously. The jury deliberated for four days and made several requests for clarification on legal points and to have testimony transcripts read to them. 'People came up to me and said: ""Why isn’t there a verdict?"" Obviously this jury wanted to be very, very careful, and they took it very seriously, and obviously came out with the right verdict,' Fried said. Abdur-Raheem faces a minimum of 40 years in prison on the murder and kidnapping charges and up to life in prison when he’s sentenced November 7, Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said. The case prompted changes to the state’s procedures for issuing Amber Alerts, information about a missing child broadcast on television and radio stations and posted on electronic highway message boards. No alert was issued between the time Zara went missing and Abdur-Raheem was arrested because state law then discouraged use of the alerts in suspected domestic cases. Now, state police issue the alerts even in cases of suspected parental involvement in a child’s abduction.","Shamsiddin Abdur-Raheem, 24, received an extra 30 years to his life sentence for the baby's kidnapping .

The California man who created an anti-Muslim film that roiled the Middle East was sentenced Wednesday to a year in prison for violating his probation from a previous arrest. Wednesday's sentence stems from a 2010 bank fraud conviction by lying about his identity, and has nothing specifically to do with the outrage that the film 'Innocence of Muslims' caused internationally. None of the violations had to do with the content of his film, which depicts the Prophet Mohammad as a religious fraud, pedophile and a womanizer. The movie sparked violence in Libya and other parts of the Middle East, killing dozens. Arrested: Filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, pictured on the set of Innocence of Muslims, is accused of violating the terms of his probation . Jailed: Nakoula was ordered to be detained without bail due to the risk he could abscond . Defence: His lawyer said he risked violent reprisals from Muslim inmates if sent to prison . U.S. District Court Judge Christina . Snyder immediately sentenced Mark Basseley Youssef after he admitted to . four of the eight alleged violations, including obtaining a fraudulent . California driver's license. Youssef, 55, was arrested in late . September, just weeks after he went into hiding when deadly violence . erupted in Libya and other parts of the Middle East in response to the . movie. Enraged Muslims had demanded severe . punishment for him, with a Pakistani cabinet minister even offering . $100,000 to anyone who kills him. The 14-minute trailer was . posted to YouTube in July, but the violence did not break out until . September 11 and has spread since, resulting in the death of Chris . Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, alongside three other Americans. Subterfuge: Nakoula was accompanied by U.S. marshals and a police convoy after his hearing on Thursday . Custody: Nakoula was taken for questioning on September 15, after his film provoked riots in the Muslim world . In hiding: The filmmaker was driven away by police from his home in Cerritos, California . The trailer still can be found on . YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to . take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not . violate its content standards. Federal authorities were seeking a two-year sentence for Youssef, who remains held without bail. Youssef served most of his 21-month . prison sentence for using more than a dozen aliases and opening about 60 . bank accounts to conduct a check fraud scheme, prosecutors said. After he was released from prison, . Youssef was barred from using computers or the Internet for five years . without approval from his probation officer. He also wasn't supposed to use any name other than his true legal name without the prior written approval of his probation officer. At least three names have been associated with Youssef since the film trailer surfaced - Sam Bacile, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and Youssef. Bacile was the name attached to the YouTube account that posted the incindiary video, and the name by which he introduced himself to the actors and producers of the film who signed on to the project not knowing that he intended to rework it to be anti-Muslim. Flames: The reaction to the video led to the sacking of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, pictured . Suing: Cindy Lee Garcia says she was misled over the role she would be playing in the controversial video . Court documents show Youssef legally . changed his name from Nakoula in 2002, though when he was tried, he . identified himself as Nakoula. He wanted the name change because he believed Nakoula sounded like a girl's name, according to court documents. Among the violations Youssef denied . were obtaining a fraudulent California driver's license, telling federal . authorities that his role in the film was limited to writing the script . and using the ""Nakoula"" name throughout his bank fraud case.

Vice President Joe Biden has declared that ‘America is coming back’ and delivered a powerful personal appeal for he and President Barack Obama to be re-elected to continue ‘a mission we will complete’. Biden, known for his verbal miscues, stuck closely to a script in which the White House had helped draw up with the aim of his offering personal testimony about Obama’s character, determination and dedication. ‘Folks, tonight, I want to tell you about Barack Obama,’ he said. ‘The Barack Obama I’ve come to know. I want to show you the character of a leader - who had what it took, when the American people stood at the brink of a new Depression. A leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years - to a future as great as our people.’ Speech: Vice President Joe Biden delivered a fiery speech to the Democratic National Convention . Congratulations: Second Lady Jill Biden joined her husband on stage at the end of his speech . Hug: The couple have been married for 25 years and have raised three children . Obama, he said, had rescued America from a depression. ‘Day after day, night after night, I sat beside him, as he made one gutsy decision after another - to stop the slide and reverse it.  I watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down choices of enormous consequence. Most of all, I saw what drove him: His profound concern for the American people.’ He continued: ‘Folks, I’ve watched him. He never wavers. He steps up. He asks the same thing over and over again: How is this going to work for ordinary families? Will it help them? ‘And because of the decisions he’s made, and the strength the American people have demonstrated every day, America has turned the corner.  After the worst job loss since the Great Depression, we’ve created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 29 months.’ Biden, who served in the United States Senate for 36 years before becoming vice-president in 2008, also drew a sharp contrast between Obama and his rival Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee. Fierce: Mr Biden delivered an aggressive speech in defence of the Obama administration's record . Arena: The speech was moved from a nearby stadium, apparently due to concerns about the weather . Tribute: Mr Biden devoted a large part of his speech to standing up for his boss, President Obama . Talking about Obama’s successful bailout of the car industry, Biden took the opportunity to castigate Romney for opposing for it and for his work heading up the venture capital firm Bain. ‘When I look back now on the President’s decision, I also think of another son of an automobile man - Mitt Romney,’ he said. ‘Mitt Romney grew up in Detroit. His father ran American Motors. ‘Yet he was willing to let Detroit go bankrupt. It’s not that he’s a bad guy. I’m sure he grew up loving cars as much as I did.  I just don’t think he understood - I just don’t think he understood what saving the automobile industry meant to all of America. I think he saw it the Bain way. Balance sheets. Write-offs.’ Biden also spoke extensively about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden in May 2011. He said: ‘In 2008, Barack Obama made a promise to the American people. He said, “If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, we will take him out. That has to be our biggest national security priority.” Supporters: Michelle Obama joined her mother Marian and Jill Biden to watch the Vice President's speech . Earlier: Mrs Biden told the convention about her ongoing career as a teacher in Virginia . Nomination: Mr Biden's son Beau gave the speech officially nominating the Vice President for re-election . ‘Barack understood that the search for bin Laden was about a lot more than taking a monstrous leader off the battlefield.  It was about righting an unspeakable wrong, healing a nearly unbearable wound in America’s heart. ‘He also knew the message we had to send to terrorists around the world—if you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the ends of the earth. Most of all, the President had faith in our special forces--the finest warriors the world has ever known. ‘We sat for days in the Situation Room.  He listened to the risks and reservations about the raid. And he asked the tough questions. But when Admiral McRaven looked him in the eye and said, “Sir, we can get this done”, I knew at that moment Barack had made his decision. His response was decisive. He said do it. And justice was done. ‘But Governor Romney didn’t see things that way.  When he was asked about bin Laden in 2007, he said, and I quote, “It’s not worth moving heaven and earth, and spending billions of dollars, just trying to catch one person”. ‘He was wrong. If you understood that America’s heart had to be healed, you would have done exactly what the President did. And you too would have moved heaven and earth--to hunt down bin Laden, and bring him to justice.’ Summing up the Obama-Biden campaign message in bumper-sticker style, he said to resounding cheers: ‘Osama Bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.’","Vice President plays 'attack dog' role as he tears into Republican plans .

William Powers, Sullivan’s 90-year-old partner, suffered multiple injuries including a broken pelvis and lung damage in the May 27 2010 accident. He died six weeks later. More than two years since the crash, Powers’ family are suing Sullivan’s doctor arguing that he should have initiated the process to strip Sullivan of her driving license as he was treating her for dementia. Wrongful death: The family of William Powers, left, are suing Dr Arthur Daigneault, right, for wrongful death. Powers died after his 85-year-old girlfriend, Lorraine Sullivan, crashed their car. Powers' family argue that Daigneault should have taken steps to remove Sullivan's driving license as he treated her for dementia . Dr Arthur Daigneault, who practices near California’s Orange County retirement community Laguna Woods Village, had been treating Sullivan for dementia in the two years before the crash, reported the Los Angeles Times. Powers’ children, Craig Powers and Andrea Wooldridge, launched the wrongful death lawsuit believing that Daigneault should have alerted authorities that Sullivan may need to have her licence taken away. The case questions at which point doctors have a responsibility to alert the DMV that their elderly patients may have a problem with driving. California law requires doctors to report patients with 'disorders characterized by lapses of consciousness' to local health authorities, who then notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Under this law, doctors use their own judgement as to whether a patient is too impaired to be behind a wheel. In December 2007, Sullivan told Daigneault that she was suffering from memory loss, reported the L.A. Times. Tests showed declining memory loss over the next year and, in June 2009, Daigneault prescribed her an Alzheimer’s drug. Tragic: Craig Powers, left, is suing a doctor for wrongful death of his father, right, who died in a car crash aged 90 in 2010 . The doctor changed her prescription to a different dementia drug when Sullivan reported that her memory getting worse. Two weeks before the accident, Daigneault saw Sullivan but did not consider her memory problems severe enough to report. Sullivan’s daughter testified that her mother was the same capable woman she had always been and said she was unaware her mother had been diagnosed for dementia, even though the two saw each other weekly. Powers himself had stopped driving early in 2010 on his family's insistence. However, his family didn’t express concern about him being a passenger in Sullivan’s car, according to court records. On May 27, Sullivan and Powers were headed home when Sullivan took a wrong left turn and a Mercedes smashed into the passenger side of the Toyota Corolla. Powers died from his injuries six weeks later. Sullivan, who suffered head injuries in the crash, has not driven since the accident. Wooldridge said that she hoped the case will take drivers with dementia off the road and prevent further accidents. Daigneault’s lawyer, Michael Trotter, said that doctors take the issue seriously - adding that it was not a ‘black and white’ issue. Trotter argued that there was no evidence that dementia played a role in the fatal crash. He also argued that there was no evidence that the DMV would have taken away Sullivan’s license if she had been reported. Last year, the DMV stripped 26,428 people of their licenses for medical reasons; a breakdown of their ages and medical conditions was not available, reported the L.A. Times.

A dozen former Taliban militants laid down their arms today as they surrendered to an amnesty programme in Afghanistan. Reports state the 12 fighters renounced their Taliban ties as the handed weapons over to the government during a ceremony in Herat. For more than a decade Taliban-led militants have been waging a bloody war against Afghan and NATO forces, often infiltrating security forces and carrying out deadly attacks. Amnesty: Former Taliban fighters display their weapons after they joined Afghan government forces during a ceremony in Herat . Surrender: The amnesty comes as foreign combat troops prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014 . But those who renounced all ties today did so to Afghan President Hamid Karzai and NATO leaders who launched the well-funded Taliban amnesty program in the past few months. The promise to surrender links to the terrorist network is said to be in return for free care of war wounds, temporary housing, a job and an empty plot of land. The latest U.S. backed bid to persuade militants to hand over their weapons comes after a similar initiative, In 2007, lured several thousand Taliban fighters renouncing the insurgency. Along the lines of the Sons of Iraq program that persuaded thousands of Sunni Muslims to give up the Iraq insurgency - it is hoped many more continue to come forward. Heavy weaponry: Some of the weapons handed in as part of the amnesty included hand grenades . Weapons: The amnesty program was relaunched by President Hamid Karzai in the last couple of months . Despite its apparent early success however, the news of the 12 fighters surrendering themselves over to the government came on the same day as a roadside bombing in southern Afghanistan killed a district police chief. Officials said the attack came as insurgents targeted Afghan security forces amid the drawdown of foreign troops. Ahmadulah Nazik, who is the administrator of the Dand district in Kandahar province, said Rahmatullah Khan died while trying to reach a police outpost under Taliban attack. Turning a new leaf: It is hoped the dozen Taliban-led militants will spark more surrenders as part of the amnesty . Ceremony: Governor of Afghanistan's Herat Province, Daud Shah Saba (right) attends a ceremony where militants surrender under a US-backed Afghan government amnesty . The killing comes a day after four policemen were shot dead in southern Helmand province by their own colleagues. The US-led Nato coalition is continuing its drawdown towards a planned withdrawal of the majority of combat troops in 2014. Insider and other attacks have thrown doubt on the capabilities of the Afghans to maintain control after the transition.

A groundbreaking device that can diagnose cancer in just 20 minutes is being developed by British scientists. The world's first tumour profiler, as it is known, will allow doctors, nurses and pharmacists to quickly identify all known types of cancer while the patient waits. It is hoped the device, which will also gauge the correct drug to prescribe cancer sufferers, will be used across the NHS within the next three years. A British company has developed a device that can diagnose cancer in just 20 minutes - and decide the best drug for treatment . The device has been invented as part of a partnership between private firm QuantuMDx, Newcastle University and Sheffield University. Scientists say the Q-Cancer device will have a dramatic impact on the rapid and accurate diagnosis of cancer. Company officials said the device has the potential to prolong the lives of the 12 million newly diagnosed cancer sufferers around the world. It will enable surgeons to immediately remove most, if not all of the tumour, and allow cancer specialists to prescribe the correct treatment regime according to the type of cancer developed. The device makes use of advanced . nanotechnology, analysing submicroscopic amounts of tissue to work out . the type of cancer, its genetic make-up and how far it has developed. Professor John Burn (left), a renowned geneticist, and Jonathan O'Halloran, both of QuantuMDx, the company developing the device . Professor Sir John Burn, the Newcastle University academic who is also medical director of QuantuMDx, said: 'We have a world leading position to deliver complex DNA tumour testing to the routine pathology lab or even to the operating theatre. 'A low-cost device requiring no technical expertise will extract, amplify and analyse tumour DNA to make sure the patient gets the right treatment first time and without delay.' Chief executive Elaine Warburton said: 'Currently tumour samples are sent away to a centralised sequencing laboratory, which can take several weeks to turnaround results, usually at a very high price which is not routinely affordable to many economies. 'As far as we are aware, QuantuMDx’s current underlying technologies, which can break up a sample and extract the DNA in under five minutes represents a world first for complex molecular diagnostics. Cancer experts now believe that 42 per cent of Britons will get the disease in their lifetime. Of the 585,000 people who died in the UK in 2008, 246,000 had been diagnosed with cancer at some point. Dr Emma Smith, Cancer Research UK’s senior science information officer, said: 'Using lhe latest technology to analyse tumours quickly and cheaply could make a real difference to cancer patients and we will watch these developments with interest. It will need thorough testing to show it meets the standards required for routine use in the NHS.'","World's first tumour profiler will identify .

A bar owner who raped three girls after serving them alcohol until they passed out has been sentenced to 100 years in prison. Werner Fajardo, 35, assaulted the three girls, two 14-year-olds and a 12-year-old, after he poured them drinks at his closed tavern El Cuervo, in Huron, South Dakota last year. Third Circuit Judge Jon Erickson said it was one of the worst rape cases he had seen in 35 years behind the bench when he sentenced Fajardo on Tuesday. 100 years in prison: Werner Fajardo, pictured being led from jail in November last year, has been jailed for raping three girls after serving them alcohol . The three friends were meant to be babysitting when they met up with Fajardo, who drove them to his bar and began pouring the girls drinks including vodka shots and mixed vodka drinks, police said. After drinking several drinks, the girls passed out or become so woozy they could not move, according to court documents. Fajardo, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota allegedly touched one of the girl’s genitals and another woke to find her pants and underwear down, and a condom wrapper on a table nearby, authorities said. Until they passed out: Fajardo took the three girls, two 14-year-olds and a 12-year-old, to his closed tavern El Cuervo (pictured) pouring the girls drinks including vodka shots and mixed vodka drinks . The 12-year-old girl told police she woke up to find Fajardo having sex with her on October 30, last year. Michael R. Moore, Beadle County's state attorney, said last year: ‘They all told a similar story of what happened that night, that they drank this alcohol and then passed out. ‘They all had similar memories of what happened, but none of them were able to say what happened to the other person.’ Police said in an affidavit: ‘The bar was closed but the defendant started mixing drinks for the girls.’ Memories of that night: Michael R. Moore, Beadle County's state attorney spearheaded the charges against Fajardo last year and said that the girls 'all told a similar story of what happened that night, that they drank this alcohol and then passed out' One of the 14-year-old girls told her parents about the assault on November 11 and police began investigating Fajardo and uncovered allegations of underage drinking at the bar in Huron, a town with a population of about 13,000 people. The Huron Police Department found 11 minors at the bar when they conducted their first ever alcohol licence compliance check at El Cuervo. State regulators revoked Fajardo's liquor license in January and the bar was closed.

Government air strikes across Syria have taken death and destruction to new levels in the country’s 19-month-conflict. Strikes by war planes have intensified on suburbs of the capital Damascas that have fallen under rebel control, and on Aleppo and Homs. Civilians have been the main victims, activists say. Footage posted by the opposition shows scenes of carnage, with mangled bodies and houses reduced to rubble. Destruction: Damaged cars and buildings are seen in Juret al-Shayah in Homs on Thursday . The activists say that while the air raids target the rebels, they also aim to inflict maximum damage to drive a wedge between the opposition and the civilian population, who bear the brunt of suffering when the fighters slip away. Syrian rebels killed more than 75 soldiers on Thursday, about half of them in attacks on military checkpoints in the north just hours after a wave of bombings hit the Damascus area, activists said . The strikes on Damascus have zeroed in on the densely populated Sunni Muslim areas known as the Eastern Ghouta, a stronghold of rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Activist Moaz al-Shami said Assad's forces had resorted to heavy aerial bombardments after failed attempts by ground troops to seize back the suburbs. State media has said the military is ‘cleansing’ what it describes as terrorists from the area. Attack: Black smoke rises up from bombing by a Syrian forces warplane in Taftanaz village, Idlib provence of northern Syria . Destroyed: Men walk on rubble of damaged buildings, near curtains erected as protection from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Homs . Violence: An eight-year-old Syrian girl struggles for life at a hospital after she arrived badly injured by an aerial attack by government forces in Aleppo . ‘The regime has tried to control the Eastern Ghouta several times and each times it had to withdraw because the rebels slipped away then came back to attack its forces,’ Shami said. ‘Now it is trying to annihilate it from the air.’ Shmai has documented the bombardment with videos and interviewing families of the dead. The footage is graphic. A man sobs as he pulls the severed torso of a woman from under the rubble of a house. A father runs with a child wounded in the head by shrapnel. An old woman cries in front of destroyed homes. Ruin: Syrians inspect shops and a mosque, which were damaged in shelling by Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar Assad, in Idlib . In the Zamalka neighborhood in the . east of Damascus, footage showed dozens of people searching through the . rubble of a building at night with the help of a bulldozer and . floodlights. ‘Here was a . five-storey building that is now leveled by MiG fighter jets. We have . already found four dead and dozens of wounded,’ Mohammad Abdallah, a . member of the opposition Revolution Command Council, said in the video. Opposition . campaigners said the planes were also bombing farmland in the Ghouta . from where rebels have been launching guerrilla operations against . government forces. The . Ghouta is an area of old farms and orchards that has become built up . over the last few decades as economic hardship forced people to sell . homes in the capital and rural migrants came to the city. Most of the population has fled the . bombardments to the suburb of Jaramana or to Sunni towns to the north. But a significant proportion, too poor to afford to leave, have . remained. ‘The problem . is that lots of refugees have taken shelter among the trees and the . fields of the Ghouta and are getting bombed. Ordinary farmers who eke . out a living on the land have been killed,’ said Ahmad Thaer of the . opposition Irbin Coordination Committee. Footage showed the aftermath of an air strike on farmlands near the eastern suburb of Hammouriya. Dozens of adults were shown running with their children away from destroyed houses. Reduced to rubble: A block of flats in Juret al-Shayah in Homs is ripped apart by a bomb blast . Conflict: Rebel fights watch over their enemy's position as they prepare themselves to shoot a shoulder-fired rocket towards an army tank in Aleppo . Emile . Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic . Studies in London, said the strategy was designed to destroy large . areas, disrupt rebel movements, turn the population against them and . prevent the opposition from forming alternative adminstrations in . rebel-held areas. ‘The . regime is adopting a very brutal strategy. It is terror. It creates a . lot of confusion about what the right thing is to do among the civilians . population. It places a huge burden among the rebels who need to defend . more than attack,’ he told Reuters. ‘The . point is not to regain territory but to inflict enough suffering to . fragment the opposition and contain them enough and so they would not be . able to stand on their feet.’ The . authorities have not commented directly on the air campaign but a . military statement this week said an ‘iron fist’ was needed against what . it described terrorists bent on destroying Syria. The . goverment has increasingly relied on air power as the uprising against . Assad, an Alawite whose family has ruled the Sunni Muslim-majority . country for four decades, degenerated from peaceful street protestS to . civil war. Fleeing: Syrians who fled with their family from violence in their village, use a wood fire to heat water in a refugee camp, in the Syrian village of Qatma, near the Turkish border with Syria . Air raids have been stepped up on other rebel-held areas in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Idlib and in the desert region of Deir al-Zor in the east, holding back advances by the poorly-armed rebels. Maarat al-Numaan, a town strategically situated on the Damascus-Aleppo highway, has been bombed almost continuously since rebels took it over two weeks ago. The IISS's Hokayem said the strategy could backfire as the bombardments was strengthening the resolve of the Sunnis, who largely see themselves as victims of the ruling elite. ‘The more this kind of regime response continues the more people will perceive the airforce first and foremost as an Alawite instrument and they will perceive themselves as the Sunni victims of an Alawite regime,’ he said.","Hundreds killed as war plane strikes intensify .

She then says they went back to the hospital the next two days running but was sent home and told to take Calpol each time. Freya eventually got the treatment she needs but her mother says the delay means she now fits even more than before. Claire said: 'The registrar didn’t even ask us what kind of brain condition Freya had. I don’t know what he was thinking. Perhaps he thought it was a bit too much paperwork. 'Her fits have got worse and she needs a new drug. I think it would have been prevented if the registrar had taken notice from the beginning.'

David Pinion, 24, lay in agony for 90 minutes after suffering extensive internal bruising in the crash as a paramedic at the scene desperately tried to organise an ambulance. But the paramedic was eventually told that the ambulances en route had to be diverted to 'more serious' incidents nine times and it would be best if the patient made his own way to the hospital. Crash scene: David Pinion, 24, lying at the side of road underneath . blankets while his brother tries to help him up to take him to the . hospital . It is unclear how many ambulances had been dispatched. Mr Pinion, whose waist had ballooned from 42in to 48in because of the swelling, was forced to ask the paramedic to call his brother to pick him up from the scene of the accident in Ely, Cambridge on October 14. The injured biker then had to be lifted off the road by his brother Robert and friend Chris Boon who drove him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Mr Pinion also suffered damage to his pelvis and ankle and was given morphine by hospital staff to ease his pain. Mr Pinion, from Prickwillow, Cambridge,said: 'The rapid response paramedic who got to me first was brilliant. 'She couldn't have done any more for me, but the people on the radio said they couldn't get an ambulance to me. 'They kept diverting them to more incidents because I was deemed not serious enough.

Cash-strapped motorists were given some pre-Christmas relief  as supermarkets sparked a price war by slashing up to 2p a litre at the pumps. Asda said it would be reducing petrol and diesel prices by 2p a litre from Thursday as Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco said they would match the cut from the same time. Motoring groups welcomed the news. Cutting prices: Asda has slashed the price of petrol and diesel by 2p per litre from Thursday . It comes after new research showed that motorists are paying a record 81p a litre in tax - both duty and VAT – to the Treasury putting pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to freeze a planned 3p per litre tax hike planned for January. Asda said its reductions would mean motorists paying no more than 131.7p a litre for petrol and 137.7p a litre for diesel. Asda petrol trading director Andy Peake said: ‘Today's move shows that we are once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pump. ‘Unlike other retailers, our price cuts benefit everyone across the country, meaning that no one filling up at Asda will be forced to play a postcode lottery.’ Relief: Morrisons has said it would match Asda's price cut from Thursday - in addition to its existing offers to higher spending shoppers . Sainsbury's head of fuel, Richard Crampton, said: ‘With Christmas on the horizon we know that this can be an expensive time of year so we're delighted to announce that from tomorrow we will be lowering our petrol and diesel prices by up to 2p per litre.’ Morrisons said its 2p per litre cut would be in addition to existing offers to higher spending shopper. The reduction  also comes  into force from Thursday morrow morning and will be up to 2p-a-litre off unleaded and 2p-a-litre off diesel at all Morrisons petrol stations giving motorists a potential 17p-per-litre saving at the pumps. Persuaded?: Pressure is on Chancellor George Osborne to postpone next year's planned duty increase . Mark Todd, Petrol Director for Morrisons, said: ‘We’re always keen to offer motorists the best value we possibly can and it’s great to be offering these savings in the run up to Christmas.’ Morrisons has 305 petrol stations across the UK and  is also running a ‘Fuel Britannia’ offer giving a 15p a litre discount  to customers who spend £60 in store until Sunday 11th November 2012. A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘Tesco is dropping the price of unleaded and diesel by up to 2 pence per litre from tomorrow morning.  As Britain’s biggest petrol retailer with 490 forecourts, more motorists will make savings at the pumps at Tesco than at any other fuel retailer.’ AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ‘This is excellent news. Yet again the supermarkets are leading the pack in cutting the price at the pumps. Let’s hope others follow their lead.’ Motorists are paying a record amount of tax from petrol to the Government – 81p on every litre,  new figures reveal today. Campaigners say the strain on the UK’s 33 million drivers add to the pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to postpone next year’s planned duty increase. For a typical litre of petrol costing 138.3p at the pumps, some  81p goes to the Treasury in the form of  fuel duty and VAT, according to figures obtained from the House of Commons Library. Fuel duty is paid at a flat rate of 57.95p per litre. But VAT is levied on the base cost of the fuel AND on the duty – making it a ‘tax on a tax.’ Matching the cut: Sainsbury's also reduced petrol and diesel prices to help consumers over the Christmas period . The 81p  tax equals a record set earlier this year which helped persuade the Chancellor to postpone an earlier proposed tax increase. Ministers will not discuss in advance the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement which takes place on December 5  although sources  point out that ministers had cancelled or postponed several previous duty increases. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government recognises that the rising price of petrol is a significant part of households’ day-to-day spending. ‘Since coming to office the Government has listened to the concerns of motorists about high pump prices and acted. Fuel is now 10p a litre lower than under the previous government’s plans.'","Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco all to cut petrol and diesel prices by 20p a litre from Thursday .

The wettest summer on record lead to an increase in the number of beaches breaking clean water standards. The latest water quality tests found that 93 per cent of England’s bathing spots reached the mandatory minimum levels, compared to 98 per cent in 2011. Around England, 29 coastal sites failed to make the minimum grade, up from just nine spots last year, figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) showed. Strong winds and high seas have continued to batter the country throughout the summer, including this scene from Selsey in West Sussex . And only 59 per cent met tougher “guideline” standards for water quality, a large drop on 2011 when almost four-fifths (79 per cent ) reached the higher level. Across the UK as a whole, the number of beaches meeting water standards also fell, with those meeting guideline standards dropping from 77 per cent last year to 60 per cent in 2012 and those achieving the minimum grade falling from 98 per cent in 2011 to 94 per cent this year. The fall came as the UK suffered the wettest summer for a century, with heavy rainfall washing pollution from cities and the countryside into rivers and down to the sea. Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: 'While the majority of England’s bathing waters continue to be of good quality, I am disappointed that a number have fallen short of the tighter standard due to the heavy rainfall we experienced during the summer. It is crucial that we continue to work with the Environment Agency, water companies and stakeholders to continue to address the effect that pollution is having on bathing water quality in some areas. 'Having quality bathing water and beaches is not only good for the water environment but also for tourism and local economies.' Heavy rain and thuderstorms in June battered parts of central and northern England, leading to flooding in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside . Lord Smith, chairman of the Environment Agency, said: 'Bathing water quality has improved significantly over the past two decades, but this year heavy rainfall over the summer has affected results. 'During intense rainfall, pollution from farmland, roads and drains is washed into rivers and coastal areas. 'Water companies also operate combined sewage overflows to prevent sewage from backing up and flooding people’s homes.' He warned that the very wet conditions highlighted that more needs to be done by water companies, businesses, farmers and local authorities to improve water quality on beaches and meet the more stringent EU standards coming in by 2015. According to monitoring of 575 bathing spots around the UK , the number of beaches in Wales which met the current minimum standards fell from 99 per cent in 2011 to 97 per cent this year while the number passing in Northern Ireland fell from 100 per cent to 96 per cent . But the situation in Scotland improved, with 98 per cent of beaches making the mandatory grade, up from 95 per cent last year.

Hoax: The boy, Alexander Jordan, never existed, and photos posted on a Facebook page were actually of a young South African cancer victim, pictured . When students at a Colorado high school heard about a nine-year-old boy who was dying from leukemia they wanted to help, raising money and dedicating a football game to the brave youngster. But it has since been revealed little 'Alex Jordan' never existed and was instead an elaborate hoax a 22-year-old woman allegedly created to dupe an entire community. Students at Eagle Valley High School in Gypsum thought little Alexander was battling terminal leukemia, and a special Facebook page detailing hospital visits and treatments suggested this was the case. It all began two weeks ago when Briana Augustenborg told colleague, Holly . Sandoval, the mother of an Eagle Valley High football . player, of the fake child's ordeal. Teary-eyed, Ms Sandoval offered to get a signed football for 'Alex' who was supposedly a huge football fan. 'I . dragged my son into this and I feel terrible about it,' Ms Sandoval . told the Vail Daily. 'I just wanted this little boy to be happy if these . were his final days.' The story quickly spread that the nine-year-old was desperate to see an Eagle Valley High football game, so the school dedicated its October 26 match to the youngster. 'It was such a big thing to support this little kid that was near death,' student Jayden Mosness told 9News. The entire student body and the football team - the Devils - donned orange to honour the boy, but he never made it. Students were told he'd died the day before the big game. 'The football players had orange socks and orange stickers on their helmets,' Mr Mosness said. 'For the dance team, their dance at halftime, they spelled out Alex's name on the field.' Spread: The story quickly spread that the 10-year-old was desperate to see an Eagle Valley High football game, so the school dedicated its October 26 match to the youngster . An obituary appeared in the local newspaper that read: 'Out beautiful angel Alexander Jordan lost his two-year battle with leukemia on Thursday at the age of 9. Alex was born in Denver to Peter and Karen on November 2, 2002. He is Survived by his brother Nick and honorary brother Zeke.' But after the no-show, some local residents became suspicious and took the story to Eagle Police Department on Friday where investigators quickly determined 'Alex' didn't exist by searching for his death certificate. Photos of the boy posted on the Facebook page, which by Saturday had more than 1,000 likes, were actually revealed to be a young South African cancer suffer who is still alive.

A vandal who sprayed graffiti over a valuable Pablo Picasso painting has been handed his own art exhibition. The Cueto James Gallery in Houston sparked outrage among the art community by offering a show to 22-year-old Uriel Landeros. In June this year Landeros was charged with felony graffiti and felony criminal mischief after allegedly defacing Picasso's 1929 artwork 'Woman in a Red Armchair', worth several million dollars, as it hung on a gallery wall at Houston's Menil Collection. A video posted on YouTube showed a man holding a stencil up to the work of art and spray-painting it, leaving behind an image of a bullfighter, a bull and the word 'conquista,' Spanish for conquest. Cueto James Art Gallery owner James Perez said he found the incident 'inspiring' and expects a full house for tonight's opening of 12 works by Landeros. He said: 'It made me happy that someone could evoke this kind of emotion in people,' Perez said. 'It's just taking something and making it your own. I like what Uriel did. That it makes it yours.' But the claim that act was in itself a work of art has provoked fury among the arts community.

One painting is of a half-skeletal person. Landeros, who Perez says is in Mexico, posted a video on YouTube in August in which he explains that he didn't intend to 'destroy Pablo's painting or to insult the Menil.' He said if he wanted to destroy it, he would have slashed it with a knife or burned it. Landeros also claimed the Picasso could be restored with 'a little bit of Windex.'

A 13-year-old football fan has been banned by Millwall FC after admitting to racially abusing a player during a match last month. Millwall have offered the boy a place on a . 'Millwall for All' educational programme, instead of imposing a full life ban, 'in the hope that we can change . his outlook on equality, racism and life in general'. The incident occurred during Millwall's . 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers at the New Den on October 6. An investigation involving both clubs and the Football Association started after the teenager verbally abused Bolton player Marvin Sordell. Millwall today confirmed the teenager had admitted abusing the player and has subsequently issued a written apology to Sordell. The club's statement was released in conjunction with notices from the FA and Bolton. 'Firstly we would like to put on record how grateful we are for the support and co-operation we have received from Bolton Wanderers and The FA in resolving what has been a challenging and topical issue over the past four weeks,' the statement read. 'Having completed our investigations into the incident, we have identified and interviewed a 13-year-old boy who admitted a verbal exchange with Marvin Sordell in which abuse was used. 'The individual has been banned from Millwall matches for the foreseeable future, but as a club we also felt, given the boy's age and background, we had a duty to play our part in attempting to educate and rehabilitate him. 'Accordingly, we have offered to put him through one of our education programmes, run by Millwall for All (formerly the Millwall Anti-Racism Trust) in the hope that we can change his outlook on equality, racism and life in general. 'In the meantime, the boy has written a letter to Marvin Sordell offering his apology, which has been accepted.' While tackling the individual responsible, Millwall also went on to critique the media response to Sordell's complaint. The club believe the scale of the abuse was overplayed in some quarters and did little to mask their frustration. 'We would also like to put on record how disappointed everybody at Millwall FC was in the way in which the initial allegations were reported in some sections of the media,' the statement continued. 'These reports were made with no knowledge of the facts and created the impression that Bolton players were subjected to racial chanting or systematic abuse by more than one individual. Millwall FC have offered the teenager a place on their community education programme . 'We trust that, now the facts have emerged, certain individuals will reflect on the reports they made. 'Finally, it is our hope that all of us within football, including governing bodies, clubs, players, fans and the media can continue to work together to build on the progress that has been made over many years in effectively tackling the issue of racism in our game, rather than merely sensationalising, and thereby trivialising it.'","Teenager offered education programme instead of a full life ban .

Three councils in some of the most expensive parts of London are drawing up plans to build ‘middle class’ housing estates. The boroughs of Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea want to be allowed to borrow billions of pounds to build affordable homes for well-off professionals who struggle to get on the housing ladder in the capital. Councillors warn parts of London are becoming ‘polarised’ between the very wealthy and those in subsidised council housing. The councils say too many people on middle-incomes cannot afford to buy homes in expensive parts of London like Mayfair . Using public money to build homes for middle class families would help preserve the community ‘mix’ in areas where the average family home can cost more than £1million. Under the plan, due to be presented to ministers today, the councils want to borrow against the £2.4 billion value of their existing stock of 32,000 homes to build more houses. Middle-class families who move into the new homes would then be charged higher rents than those on lower incomes. Cllr Jonathan Glanz, responsible for housing in Westminster, said: ‘This proposal is all about giving those hard working people on average salaries at least some chance of living in Westminster. ‘At present they are simply priced out, so Westminster – like other parts of central London – becomes a property world polarised between the very wealthy and those in affordable housing. ‘We need to continue ensuring that we provide for a wide range of people and maintain mixed communities, including middle class people on middle-range salaries.’ The councils want Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to give them more freedom to borrow against their assets to pay for new homes . The Government has already given councils extra freedom in how they manage their housing stock, but the councils want to go further. Today they will present plans for a pilot of 300 homes in Westminster to Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Today they will submit their plan for a pilot scheme of 300 homes on a new “middle-class” estate to the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles. In this business case, we have shown how such a programme (based upon incremental investment of £53 million) could: . The £53million scheme would generate a surplus of £500,000 in rents in the first decade, generating 7,000 jobs in construction.The councils want changes to be made to the Housing Revenue Account rules limiting what local authorities can borrow. The business case states: 'The opportunity is to use a housing portfolio valued at some £2.4billion not only to meet the current housing needs of the poorest members of society but also to support people’s aspirations to improve their careers and housing choices. 'Many families are squeezed out of the area as suitable accommodation is unaffordable to people on middle incomes – especially if they want an ownership stake in their home. 'Despite the abundance of jobs in the area, there are pockets of entrenched worklessness, particularly in areas of social housing, where residents become locked into welfare dependency and unemployment becomes the norm.'","Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea draw up plans for affordable homes for professionals on middle-incomes .

Officials on Monday said voters who had received the letters so far are white, registered Republicans who consistently vote in elections. The bogus letters claim to be from county supervisors of elections but are postmarked from Seattle .

Voters in more than 20 counties have received fraudulent letters impersonating supervisors of elections . Inside the letter is the resident's supervisor of election's name, the resident's name and address, and a warning that doubts the voter's citizenship, saying the resident is not eligible to vote unless a letter is returned in an enclosed form within 15 days. 'It creates confusion, it's just a big distraction,' said Linda Tanko of the Orange County Supervisor of Elections Office, which has received multiple letters. Some voters said it's easy to be fooled. 'It looks official,' a Central Florida resident said. 'I would think they were full of it because I would ask for someone to prove it,' said another voter when showed a copy of the fraudulent letter. East Naples resident Wayne Hoss said he received his letter on Saturday and immediately knew it was a hoax because he was born in the United States. Hoss says the letter included a form seeking personal information, including his Social Security and driver's license numbers.

Thousands of women each year endure gruelling, unnecessary treatment for breast cancers that were not life-threatening, a British review has found. The findings have raised fears that many women in the US are also undergoing needless treatment. For every life saved by early detection, three women have therapy they do not need, according to the most definitive investigation of breast cancer screening so far. Nearly all are given aggressive treatments – including chemotherapy, radiotherapy or having a breast removed – even though they might never have experienced any symptoms during their lifetime because their cancers were slow growing or non-aggressive. Unnecessary: Thousands of women every year have gruelling treatment for breast cancers they do not need . These treatments can involve months of agony and have a severe impact on a woman’s quality of life. Under the NHS screening programme, . which cost £75million last year, women are invited for mammograms every . three years between the ages of 50 and 70, although this is set to be . extended to include those aged 47 to 73. In the U.S., a government-appointed task force of experts recommends women at average risk of cancer get mammograms every two years starting at age 50. But the American Cancer Society and other groups advise women to get yearly mammograms from the age of 40. Nearly 227,000 U.S. women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, according to the National Cancer Institute, and more than 39,000 women will die. In the UK, over 99 per cent of those diagnosed with breast cancer will have surgery; of which 25 per cent will have a mastectomy and 75 per cent an operation to have a lump removed. At the same time, 87 per cent of patients are given hormonal drugs that can cause hot flushes, mood changes and sickness, while 80 per cent have radiotherapy. This can cause tiredness for months and swelling or damage to skin, while a very small number experience side-effects including damage to the lungs or heart. One in four has chemotherapy, which commonly causes tiredness, lower immunity, sickness and hair loss. Although the new study stressed the programme saved around 1,300 lives a year, it also led to an estimated 4,000 women being ‘overdiagnosed’. The dilemma for doctors is that it is not possible to distinguish between those for whom the disease could be fatal, and women who have cancer ‘under the microscope’ but are unlikely ever to  experience symptoms. The review concludes that although screening does more good than harm, it  is a closer call than previously thought. It said the programme remains worthwhile even though less than 0.5 per cent of women screened will have their life extended in the next 20 years. However, the authors stressed that  the estimated two million women who undergo testing each year must be given ‘clear and unbiased’ information about the pros and cons – something which is currently lacking. More than 99 per cent of those diagnosed with breast cancer will have surgery; of which 25 per cent will have a mastectomy and 75 per cent an operation to have a lump removed . At present, a ‘patronising’ leaflet tells them they could be affected by overdiagnosis – but does not quantify the risk. The review, led by public health expert Professor Sir Michael Marmot and published in the Lancet medical journal, was ordered by the Department of  Health after mounting controversy about whether women were getting the full picture on breast screening. A succession of studies had claimed the programme did not save lives and could lead to unnecessary treatment for non life-threatening cancers. It was brought to a head last year by an open letter from Professor Susan Bewley, consultant obstetrician at King’s College London, to the National Cancer Director calling for women to be told of ‘genuine doubts’ about the programme. She said NHS leaflets ‘exaggerated benefits and did not spell out the risks’. Researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre have also repeatedly questioned the benefits of organised screening, suggesting the dramatic fall in breast cancer deaths is due to changes in risk  factors and improved treatment. Professor Sir Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, said: ‘I welcome the fact that the review clearly recommends that breast screening should continue. ‘But the key thing is we communicate this information to women so they can make an informed choice.’ Dr Harpal Kumar, of charity Cancer Research UK, which jointly commissioned the review, said: ‘This review shows screening saves lives. We recommend women go for screening when invited.’","Study finds 4,000 women a year in UK receive needless treatment, prompting fears number could be significantly higher in the U.S.

A mother died two days after a ‘do not resuscitate’ order was put on her medical notes against her will, a court heard yesterday. Janet Tracey had already made doctors remove the instruction once but they are accused of reinstating it ‘in her best interests’. The doctors say consent was given by the 63-year-old’s family – an assertion her four daughters dispute vehemently. Patient: Janet Tracey, pictured with her husband David, was being treated in Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge when doctors issued not one but two DNR notices, apparently without her consent . The family says Mrs Tracey, who was . being treated for terminal lung cancer and a broken neck, told them that . hospital staff wanted to ‘get rid of her’. Her husband David has launched a . landmark case at the High Court against Cambridgeshire University . Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for defying his wife’s wishes and ‘acting . unlawfully’. Mrs Tracey, a care home manager, was . involved in a head-on collision last February – just two weeks after she . was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 18 months to live. She was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge where she picked up pneumonia. Described as a strong woman with a . ‘thirst for life’, Mrs Tracey responded to treatment and was horrified . to be told of the DNR notice, which stated that her family had . consented. Legal battle: Mr Tracey stands outside the Royal Courts Of Justice with his daughters Kate Masters (second from right) and Alison Noeland (right) and solicitors Sophie Turner (left) and Merry Varney (second left) Mrs Tracey received treatment, and died, at Addenbrooke¿s Hospital in Cambridge . Fears: Mrs Tracey told her family that staff 'wanted to get rid of her' In a statement read to the court, Mr . Tracey, 65, said: ‘I found her in tears, so distressed. It was horrible. She told me the doctor had told her about the DNR and the decision had . been made. I told her neither I nor the girls would do that to her. ‘We managed to reassure her we hadn’t agreed to this. ‘At one particular point, she did say they were trying to get rid of her. ‘I told her not to be so silly, which proved to be a mistake.’ The order, issued on February 27, was . cancelled on March 2. Her family claims she was then ‘badgered’ by staff . when she was alone to make a decision about resuscitation options. On March 5, a second DNR was issued . with the notes: ‘The patient does not want to discuss resuscitation.’ It . was claimed three of her four daughters had agreed to it. When Mrs Tracey died two days later, her daughter Alison Noeland found the note and raised it with staff. She says she had specifically told the . doctor who issued the second DNR that they had refused consent for it . on March 5. Mr Tracey, a retired engineer from Ware, Hertfordshire, . said: ‘My girls told me they found a second DNR on mum’s notes and the . notes said I had agreed.I was disgusted and shocked. I would never have . agreed to something against my wife’s wishes.’ The family also claim that Mrs Tracey, . who had seven grandchildren, was placed on the controversial Liverpool . Care Pathway without her consent or knowledge, although this will not be . dealt with during the court hearing. The LCP involves the withdrawal of lifesaving treatments and means patients are sedated and denied nutrition and fluids by tube. Mrs Justice Nicola Davies is hearing . evidence to determine the facts before a judicial review in February, . which will seek to clarify whether there is a legal duty to inform . patients about a DNR notice. Edward Faulks QC, representing the . hospital trust, said doctors had issued the DNRs after consultation with . senior staff, Mrs Tracey and her family. A DNR notice tells staff not to try to restart a patient’s heart, saving them traumatic and often pointless pain.

These breathtaking pictures show the magnificent Glastonbury Tor appearing like a beacon above a glittering landscape in the early morning light. The view over the Somerset Levels was truly remarkable, as much of the UK awoke to frost covering the ground and temperatures well below freezing. Only a few dog walkers were visible outdoors as the sun rose on a bitterly cold day, bracing themselves against what is one of the coldest starts to November in years for many towns. Revellers at Bonfire Night parties last night wrapped themselves in coats and scarves in the biting cold to watch fireworks sparkle in the chill night air.

"By . Harriet Cooke . PUBLISHED: . 06:03 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:15 EST, 6 November 2012 . Retired teacher Patrick Gallagher, 64, suffered a heart attack after arguing with neighbours over their loud music . A retired teacher died of a heart attack after neighbours placed a ghetto blaster on his doorstep and played 'a terrific volume of music', an inquest has heard. Patrick Gallagher, 64, was found lying face down in a pool of blood in the doorway of his home in Healey, near Rochdale, after he rowed with his neighbours over the volume. His wife of 32 years, Susan Gallagher, told an inquest into his death that the tragedy happened after she heard her neighbours playing music and went outside to investigate. She told the hearing in Rochdale that after she had realised the noise was coming from neighbour John Butterworth’s house, she returned home and discussed with her husband whether they should call the police. The couple were then interrupted by even more noise. Mrs Gallagher said: 'We were both still in the living room. 'Suddenly there was a terrific volume of music immediately outside the house. 'It was the sort of volume you would experience in a fairground.' In a written statement, Mrs Gallagher . said that her husband had witnessed a woman placing what appeared to be a . ‘ghetto-blaster’ outside their door. He then went out to investigate when he was confronted by neighbours John Butterworth and Stephen and Sharon Maloney, the inquest was told. Mrs Gallagher said: 'I heard voices. I heard him saying, ‘What are you playing at?’ He wasn’t especially angry. It was, if you like, said in a teacher’s voice.' Mrs Gallagher said Mr Maloney repeatedly warned Mr Gallagher not to ‘make an enemy’ out of him before lunging at him on the doorstep. She said Mr Maloney was then grabbed by his wife, causing him to stagger sideways. Tragic: The middle house belonged to Mr Gallagher, who died in the doorway . At this point, she said, she ran upstairs to ring the police. When she returned, the inquest heard, everyone had disappeared from the doorstep and the music had been switched off. She told the inquest: 'I made the 999 call and left the receiver off because the call handler asked me to go downstairs and see what was happening. 'All music and everything had been switched off. It was a strange atmosphere.' Mrs Gallagher then saw her husband collapsed in the doorway. He was taken to hospital shortly after the incident, at 10pm on August 14, and died three days later after suffering a series of irregularities with his heart. Giving evidence at the inquest, pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said Mr Gallagher had suffered a heart attack and collapsed after developing a blood clot due to the stress of the argument. Dr Carter said: 'When someone is involved in a stressful event, it’s a common experience that your heart beats faster. 'The reason that he developed the blood clot and collapsed when he did is as a direct result of this incident in its entirety.' Five people were arrested in connection with the incident but were later released without charge. The inquest continues.","Inquest heard how Susan Gallagher found her husband Patrick, 64, lying in a pool of blood .

A widow told of her heartbreak today after she sold her home and handed over £105,000 to a smooth-talking conman she fell in love with. Beverly Healey, 69, fell in love with handyman Jamie Evans, who did odd jobs around her home in Brislington, Bristol, and over two years he persuaded her to hand over money using a string of lies including being beaten by loan sharks, even brandishing bruises to back up his claims. Ms Healey sold her house and gave him £52,000 from the proceeds to appease loan sharks, leaving her with just £17,000. When she agreed to give him the money, Evans proposed to her before vanishing. Fell in love with a conman: Beverly Healey gave more than £105,000 to Jamie Evans after she fell in love with him and he persuaded her that he needed money using a string of lies . She now lives day-to-day on her pension in a small flat and her remaining savings of £2,000. Using the alias James Price, the separated father gained her trust and convinced her he was being pursued by loan sharks and needed money to pay them off. Ms Healey said: ‘I fell in love, we were planning to spend our life together, at the time the money didn’t matter, I was going to be with him. ‘He had such a way of telling you these stories that you couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. He was very clever. ‘I felt I knew him well and we got on famously. He took me in. 'Unscrupulous': Evans convinced Ms Healey to sell her house (pictured) and she gave him £52,000 of the proceeds to pay loan sharks he claimed were beating him . ‘He is a cruel man, a cruel, cruel man. I’m very wary now, especially of males. ‘No words can explain it. I have learned from it and I won’t trust anyone again, ever.’ Evans, 38, appeared before Bristol . Crown Court last week where he pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud . and was handed eight months in jail, suspended for a year. Mrs . Healey met ‘James’ in August 2008 after she was widowed in 2002 when . her postman husband of 15 years, Norman, died of a stroke, aged 79. The pair developed a relationship and . Evans began asking her for money, claiming a transit van he used for . work  had mysteriously broken and needed to be replaced. Ms Healey, a retired Crown . Prosecution executive officer, dutifully handed over £2,000 to help buy a . new van and when that one broke, she handed him the same amount to buy . another. Evans, who lived . on a caravan park in Cardiff, pleaded for money to take his children to . Disneyland Paris and Ms Healey gave him £7,500. 'Never trust again': Ms Healey said Evans was a 'cruel, cruel man' for his deception and he pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud at Bristol Crown Court . She said: ‘He told me he would like to . take his three children to Disneyland because he wanted a week away . without family pressures. ‘I knew by this time how much he owed to . the loan sharks and he told me he would find it very difficult to pay . me back straight away but because I thought we were going to be together . I told him it didn’t matter about the time, just to pay me as and when . he could. Hard lesson: Ms Healey now lives on her pension and her remaining £2,000 of savings . ‘I loaned him about £7,500 for the weeks holiday and he got his daughter to ring me to say thank you, I don’t know if that even was his daughter.’ She also gave him £8,000 when he claimed his flat had been burgled and all his possessions stolen. Evans then began turning up at her house covered in bruises in August 2009 and claimed he had suffered the injuries at the hand of loan sharks who he could no longer afford to pay. Ms Healey said: ‘I told him that I had given him all my money and that the only money I had left was tied up in the house. ‘He told me that we were going to be together but I said I didn’t want to lose my security and needed time to think. ‘The next time he came back with awful bruises and I said that it couldn’t go on like this, I was worried they were going to kill him, so I put my house up for sale. ‘It sold in three weeks and we got a flat together.’ Despite landing the huge windfall from Ms Healey’s house, Evans continued his deceit and later claimed he had been arrested while on a trip to France and that French police were demanding £8,000 to lessen his sentence. When he disappeared and she was unable to trace him, she reported him to police in June 2010. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Mercer told Evans: ‘You took advantage of Mrs Healey in an unscrupulous, unkind and utterly dishonest way.’ Ms Healey said she was disappointed Evans was not jailed but now wanted to put the past behind her. She said: ‘I’m just going to get on with my life and put it all behind me. What a way to learn. ‘Don’t be taken in by all the charm, it’s easy to see through it now, I used to read all about these things and think what a silly person, but when it happens to you, you forget all that. ‘I don’t know any evil people and I believed him.’ Evans was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for a year, as well as 100 hours of unpaid work and a three-month curfew grounding him from 7pm to 7am.","Beverly Healey fell in love with handyman Jamie Evans .

A driver who snorted 70 lines of cocaine before mowing down an innocent passer-by was jailed for life today. Stephen Freye, 22, climbed into his car to go looking for a victim to run over late at night and spotted a young chef walking home. Father-of-one Kyle Griffith, 25, was on the pavement on the way home from his restaurant when Freye aimed his car at him - killing him instantly. Stephen Freye, left, snorted 70 lines of cocaine before he drove at and killed Kyle Griffith, 25, right, as he returned home from work . Freye claimed he was hallucinating after sniffing a bag of 10 grammes of cocaine over a weekend. Cardiff Crown court heard Freye confessed to police at the scene: 'I was told to kill a stranger.' Freye, of Roath, Cardiff, denied murder but was found guilty following a two week trial. A judge jailed him for life and said he would spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars. Mr Justice MacDuff said he had read victim impact statements from Kyle’s mum, step-dad and sister. He told Freye: 'They make for harrowing reading - Kyle was a thoroughly lovely and worthwhile man whose life has been wasted. 'He was an innocent man, a young man and father and was walking home after a night in town and minding his own business when you ran him down. 'You were in a psychotic state, hallucinating and hearing the voice of your drug supplier telling you to kill. 'You had voluntarily taken drugs over three days when you knew full well the effect they had on you. 'You were tempted by your addiction but the decision was yours and you bare the responsibility. 'Kyle was a fine young man, who was greatly loved and had a promising life in front of him. Killed: Kyle, a father, was described as a lovely man whose life had been wasted . 'He was hard working and bared no animosity to anyone, he had a young daughter who he adored and he touched many lives. 'His sister had to celebrate her 21st Birthday four days after her brother’s death. You turned that event, a celebration, into one of mourning. 'You told the jury you were truly sorry, you were sorry, but only for yourself. Your words were hollow and your attitude in the dock today shows no contrition. 'You will have to live with your actions for the rest of your life.' Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'Freye had taken cocaine and had suffered hallucinations shortly before he drove straight into innocent Mr Griffith. 'He told police that at the exact moment he saw his victim, the voices told him his own family would die if he didn’t drive at him. 'He said he didn’t even think, he just assumed that if he ran him over, everything would be okay. 'He deliberately drove at him and his intention was to kill or cause serious injury.' Mr Griffith was a chef at Cardiff Arts Institute and father to a four-year-old girl called Emma. The jury was shown home movies made by Freye in his flat taking cocaine and apparently searching for the voices he claimed he could hear. The films, made in the dark, show him sitting staring at the camera and looking around the room. Freye claimed he was driving to a police station in his Fiat Cinquecento to tell them about the voices when he saw Kyle on the roadside in January this year. He denied murdering Kyle but admitted manslaughter claiming he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time. Freye told the jury: 'The coke was so irresistible that when I got it from the dealer, I started snorting it from the bag on the way back. 'I was just totally a slave to it. 'The voices had complete control of me. As soon as I saw him, the voices spoke. 'And as soon as I heard them, I turned the car - I didn’t have time to think.' Speaking outside court a spokesman for the Kyle’s family said: 'No punishment given could ever bring Kyle back nor ease the pain of his tragic and sudden death. 'However we are pleased that some justice has been done today.'","Stephen Freye, 22, climbed into his car to go looking for victim to run over .

France are the frontrunners to be England's second opponents during next summer's tour to Brazil. Roy Hodgson takes his side to South America for a mini-tour in June to acclimatise to the conditions ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Out there the national side will two matches: one against five-time world champions Brazil with the other likely to be against France, although Uruguay have been mooted as an alternative to the French. England's playing schedule is clear next summer, with no World Cup qualifying ties to play and the FA believe the trip will be a valuable experience for the squad, coming 12 months before the World Cup. We're off to Brazil! England are set to go on tour to South America next summer . It is England’s first trip to Brazil since 1984, when John Barnes hit a wonder-goal in a 2-0 win. The FA have also ensured the fixtures in South America will be completed in time for the players to have a decent close-season break, before the start of the new campaign and a qualifier against Moldova on September 6, 2013. The Three Lions will fly out to South America the day after playing a friendly at Wembley on May 29 as part of their 150-year celebrations as a national association. Should England qualify for the World Cup without the added difficulty of the play-offs, they will play two friendlies at Wembley in November 2013 as well as two further home clashes in March and May 2014. But Hodgson warned: ‘Brazil has got a major logistical problem on its hands. It’s a vast country, I don’t think we realise quite how vast. ‘There’s going to be enormous difficulties for the teams that qualify, according to where they are drawn. ‘You’ve got to remember it’s the Brazilian winter, so it’s not going to be a particularly sun-bathing time unless you happen to find yourself in Rio.’ What a goal: England have not played in Brazil since John Barnes waltzed through the home defence to score in a 2-0 win at the Maracana in June 1984 . England have slipped a place to sixth in the FIFA rankings, with Northern Ireland the only of the home nations to improve their standing. Euro 2012 finalists Italy, the side who eliminated England in that competition, replace Roy Hodgson’s side in the top five. England played two World Cup qualifiers in the eligibility period, with a regulation 5-0 win over San Marino and 1-1 draw in Poland. Spain and Germany remained unmoved in first and second, with Argentina climbing into third above Portugal, who slip to fourth following their surprise home draw against the Northern Irish. Michael O’Neill’s men enjoyed a leap of 17 places thanks to that result, moving to 100 in the standings. The Republic of Ireland slipped eight spots to 36th after a 6-1 hammering by Germany. Scotland, who sacked Craig Levein as manager this week, have dropped below Wales after being beaten 2-1 in their head-to-head match last month. Scotland drifted by 14 to 70th while a 2-0 defeat in Croatia meant Wales also dropped from 57th to 66th. Elsewhere Fabio Capello’s Russia have moved into the top 10 after a strong start to their World Cup qualifying campaign.","Hodgson's team to play two fixtures in Brazil .

Dawn French made headlines last year when she shed seven-and-a-half stone from her famously roly-poly figure. Now she has admitted putting two stone back on, blaming a weakness for bread, pasta and potatoes. But far from feeling mortified about the gain, the 55-year-old comedy star says she has accepted that she will always be on the large side. Before and after: Comedienne Dawn French pictured before her weight loss in 2007, left, and after shedding seven-and-a-half stone in 2011 . ‘I am perfectly happy with how I look and I always have been. I’ll always be a fat girl and I am happy with that,’ she said. Miss French was 19 stone before she went on a strict diet that included cutting out chocolate and carbohydrates. In interviews at the time she said that entering her fifties had made her more health conscious. The Vicar Of Dibley star divorced comedian Lenny Henry in 2010 after 25 years of marriage. The Vicar of Dibley star, pictured earlier this year, says she has always been happy with her weight . She has been in a relationship with twice-married charity executive Mark Bignell, 49, for nearly a year. Miss French has said that falling in love has given her a new lease of life, and hinted in an interview with Woman magazine that she started to put the weight back on following a romantic trip to Paris with Mr Bignell. ‘I’ve lost seven-and-a-half stone since I started making an effort and recently put about two back on,’ she said. ‘I lost the weight by denying myself quite a lot of things and recently I haven’t denied those things as much. Bread and pasta and potatoes are my weakness. ‘I went to Paris recently and I wasn’t going to not eat bread!’ But Miss French, who has a 20-year-old daughter, Billie, added that since losing the weight, she is conscious of following a healthier lifestyle because her body has been one of the hallmarks of her success. ‘Generally I eat much more healthily and I eat less, probably half as much as I did before,’ she said. ‘I am very fond of this body – it’s served me well and it’s never disappointed me. I understand it, I know it and I even like it now it’s all saggy, it’s a mark of my journey this far.’ Mr Bignell, whom Miss French has described as a ‘remarkable man’, is chief executive of a Plymouth-based charity which helps drug and alcohol abusers reintegrate into society.","Vicar of Dibley star had lost seven-and-a-half stone after cutting out carbs and chocolate .

An influential astrophysicist hired by DC Comics to pinpoint the location of Superman’s home planet, Krypton, has done just that. The fictional planet Krypton would have orbited a red dwarf star called LHS 2520, says Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium in New York City. As reported by SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall, the star is 27.1 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Corvus, also known as ‘The Crow’, says Dr. Tyson. The star is cooler and smaller than our sun. On Screen: Actor Bryan Singer in 'Superman Returns.' Star struck: Astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson helped DC Comics, home of the Superman comics, find a plausible star to be the host of the superhero's home planet, Krypton. Star vision: A hypothetical terrestrial planet and moon orbiting the red dwarf star AU Microscopii. The coordinates of LHS 2520 are: . Right Ascension: 12 hours, 10 minutes, 5.77 seconds . Declination: -15 degrees, 4 minutes, 17.9 seconds . Proper Motion: 0.76 arcseconds per year, along 172.94 degrees from due north . ‘This is a major milestone in the Superman mythos that gives our super hero a place in the universe,’ DC Entertainment co-publisher Dan DiDio said in a company statement. ‘Having Neil deGrasse Tyson in the book was one thing, but by applying real-world science to this story he has forever changed Superman’s place in history,’ he said. ‘Now fans will be able to look up at the night’s sky and say, “That’s where Superman was born.”’ The man: Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium in New York City. The planetary details will be encompassed in a new Superman book titled, ‘Star Light, Star Bright,’ which comes out on Wednesday. Dr. Tyson, who has a history of applying science to entertainment, will appear in the comic, aiding Superman on his adventure. In real life, Dr. Tyson made headlines in April after getting film director, James Cameron, to alter the night’s sky as seen in The Titanic due to inaccuracies. The correction was made and can be seen in the re-release of Titanic 3-D.","Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, determines actual location of Superman’s home planet Krypton .

Women have branded its latest clothing ranges unfashionable, poor-fitting and confusingly sized. So perhaps it is little wonder that Marks & Spencer’s clothing division  has reported its worst sales performance for three years. The high street giant admitted a string of mistakes with its womenswear was behind the 10 per cent fall in profits. Poster girls: Myleene Klass and Twiggy are just two of the famous faces who promote the M&S range . The disappointing performance was . highlighted by a surge in sales by budget fashion chain Primark, with . hard-up consumers flocking to its cut-price clothing. Primark said its rise in profits was . thanks to the increasing numbers of middle-class converts – customers . who might usually turn to M&S for their clothes. Responding to M&S’s fall in . pre-tax profit to £289.5million for the half-year from £321million in . the same period the previous year, chief executive Marc Bolland said he . had inherited a list of problems from his predecessor, Sir Stuart Rose. He said these included the retailer’s . computer systems, which were ‘not fit for purpose’ and the stores . themselves, which ‘lacked inspiration’. Feeling the heat: M&S chief executive Marc Bolland is under pressure to deliver improvements . The Dutchman also said M&S’s . website was poor, while its supply network was ‘complex and inflexible’ – . resulting in stores running out of stock on popular items. On its website – which allows . customers to leave reviews of the clothing they have bought – there are a . string of complaints about the quality of some of the fabrics used in . the clothing, and the ‘inconsistent’ sizing which has left many women . confused. Some styles are also branded ‘uncomfortable’, ‘frumpy’ and ‘unflattering’. Yesterday M&S said it had taken decisive action to turn the clothing division around and back key fashion trends. Mr Bolland said a lingerie range . designed by supermodel and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had shifted . more than 100,000 pieces since the end of August, making it one of the . fastest-selling ever. Big drop: Marks and Spencer saw their half year profits fall to the lowest point for three years . Mr Bolland has also overhauled the . retailer’s clothing team, hiring former Debenhams and Jaeger boss . Belinda Earl to revitalise womenswear and Janie Schaffer – who formerly . worked at Victoria’s Secret – as the new director of lingerie. He made a barbed jibe at Primark’s . success – saying M&S would focus on quality when it launches its own . version of ‘fast fashion’, adding: ‘We are not interested in disposable . clothing ranges.’ But Primark supremo George Weston, . buoyed by a 15 per cent rise in sales to £3.5billion for the year, . snapped back, saying: ‘We don’t look on ours being disposable either – . what makes us difficult to compete with is our quality which is good, . particularly on basics like T-shirts, underwear, nightwear and towels. Our quality stands in comparison with anyone out there.’ Mr Weston, boss of Primark’s owner . Associated British Foods, said he had even had to increase the number of . tills by a third in Primark stores to take shoppers’ cash. But both retailers warned recent . trading had been tough, with Mr Bolland warning the market was . ‘volatile’ and the second half of the year would be tough as retailers . tried to outdo each other with price-cutting promotions. Critiqued: Drop-a-Dress-Size Floral-Print Silhouette Stretch Dress is a bad fit, customer reviews say . M&S customers’ dissatisfaction with many of the retailer’s products is shown in the reviews they have written on its website, which include: . Bootcut Denim Crystal jeans £32.50 ‘They dragged on the ground when I walked and the hem was about two to three inches wide and very heavy. I used to have perfect length fit from jeans from Marks and Spencer, what has happened?’ 2-Pack: Assorted  Padded T-Shirt Bras £22.50 ‘Does anyone try these on at the design stage? These look great and are the right size BUT, and it’s a big BUT, the straps are so far out towards your shoulders they cut into your arms. Unless you walk around behaving as though you have a coat hanger down the back of your shirt, they are really uncomfortable.’ Drop-a-Dress-Size Floral-Print Silhouette Stretch Dress with Secret Support £59.00 ‘Really like the style but the 8 was too tight and the 10 too big. Had to return.’ Body-Shape Denim Lana Straight-Leg Jeans £25.00 ‘I don’t know how I managed to get these so wrong! I’m usually a 12 medium but when I tried these on they were two inches too short, low on the waist so gave me a muffin top where I don’t really have one.’ ‘A great fit... for about two hours. After four hours of wearing them they were falling down and I quite literally stepped out of them without undoing them... needless to say they have gone back. Come on Marks, get it right! Try some quality-control before you put them on the shelves.’ Per Una Abstract-Print Gathered Pleat Dress £39.50 ‘This had to be returned as it didn’t fit correctly. Disappointed with the sizing – no continuity! Two other dresses ordered with this one, all different styles and all three had to be returned as didn’t fit.’ Per Una Gathered-Waist Paisley Print Dress £45.00 ‘The dress was very nice but didn’t fit me well, was large across the top so the neck hung awkwardly at the front. I went into the store and tried a size smaller, but although it was a bit too tight, the neck part was still too loose.’ Limited Collection  Contrast Trim Blouse £29.50 ‘Lovely blouse but cut very straight and I found it gaped too much around the bust area.’ Per Una 3D Appliqué Pencil Skirt £45.00 ‘This is not good; the fabric has a very “man-made” feel to it; it is rather unflatteringly clingy and the so-called appliqué is not! It is devoré and not well done. I was disappointed and it went straight back.’ Per Una Slash-Neck Paisley-Print Dress £39.50 ‘I had high expectations for this dress [pictured right], but was so very disappointed.

The ex-wife of the Washington D.C. sniper has revealed how she spent years living in terror after he threatened to kill her. Ten years after John Muhammad and his accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot dead 10 people in a murderous three-week rampage, Mildred Muhammad has spoken out about her life of fear. She revealed how he threatened to hunt her down after their 2000 divorce, snatched her three children and took them to Antigua for two years before they were finally tracked down by police. And she has also told how, years later when their father was executed for his crimes, the children broke down in tears as he never called them to say goodbye. Standing strong: Mildred Muhammad (right) was married to John Muhammad, known as the Washington D.C. sniper. They had three children together, including Salena Williams, left . Speaking with People Magazine, Mildred Muhammad recounted how her husband left to serve in the Gulf War in 1990 and returned a changed man the following year. Her caring husband had transformed into an emotionally abusive man and began 'treating me like his enemy', she said. It sparked her to take out a restraining order against him and file for divorce. He kidnapped their children, then six, eight and 10, in 2001 and the police located them when he tried to get food stamps - but that did not stop Mildred's fears. 'What most people don't know is that I was the person he was after,' she told People. 'Two years prior he threatened to kill me when I asked for a divorce. 'I didn't know where John was or what he . was doing, but I looked for him on the rooftops and nearby levees. He . told me he was going to kill me, and I knew he would.' On October 2, 2002, the pair began their killing spree, gunning down people indiscriminately in parking lots and outside their homes in the D.C. area. Killers: John Muhammad, pictured left before his execution in 2009, killed at least 10 people on a three-week shooting spree in 2002 with Lee Boyd Malvo, right, who was just 17 at the time . Convicted: He was found guilty of the crimes in Virginia in 2003, pictured, and sentenced to death . When Mildred learned of the killings, she never considered it could be her ex-husband. 'I was scared like everybody else, but my fear was more intense because I was also hiding from John,' she told the magazine. 'I always knew if he killed me, it would be a shot to the head.' Police later told her that her ex-husband has sent his then 17-year-old sidekick, Malvo, to Mildred's home to pretend to be a salesman and shoot her dead. The terror ended on October 24, 2002, . when police caught the pair as they slept at a Maryland rest stop in a . car they had outfitted . for a shooter to perch in its boot without being seen. That day, the FBI hauled Mildred in for a meeting and revealed her ex-husband was the killer. 'My head hit the table,' she remembered. 'I was shocked.' But when they asked if she thought he was capable of the murders, she said that he was. Struggle: Mildred, who speaks out against domestic abuse, said she lived in fear that her ex-husband would shoot her dead after she divorced him. She said she was not surprised he was the sniper . Ordeal: Taalibah, 19 (left), and Selena, 20, were kidnapped with their brother by their father in 2000 . He had once told her: 'I could take a small city and terrorize it. Everybody would think it was a group of people, and it would only be me.' She was placed in protective custody with her children, John, Salena and Taalibah, who continued to ask about their father. He was convicted of capital murder in Virginia in 2003 and, three years later, he was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in Maryland. As his execution on November 10, 2009 - when he was 48 - neared, his children hoped to speak to him one last time, Mildred told People. His lawyer said he would take his cell phone with him. 'The children waited for their dad to call, but it was a call that didn't come,' she said. 'We watched the television until a man came out and said John expired. My children lost it.' Malvo, who is now 27 and recently told . the Today show that Muhammad sexually abused him for two years, is . serving a life sentence in a south Virginia prison without the . possibility of parole. Locked up: Malvo, pictured testifying against Muhammad in 2003, was sentenced to life without parole . Sick: The men would lay in the back of this Caprice and shoot their victims through a hole cut in the trunk . He has claimed that he was 'brainwashed' by Muhammad, whom he had met when he lived in Antigua with his mother, and lived in fear that he would disappoint him. Police have never confirmed that Muhammad was motivated by his desire to kill her and regain custody of their three children; Malvo said Muhammad wanted to extort $10 . million from the government to set up a camp in Canada where homeless . children would be trained as terrorists. Mildred has written a book about domestic abuse and tours the country speaking out about her experiences - which she said are firmly in the past and no long haunt her. 'I'm so sorry that so many people were killed,' she added. 'It's not my fault. I was afraid of him like everyone else. I stopped being afraid, I guess, when they executed him on November 10, 2009.'","Mildred and John Muhammad were married for 10 years until he returned from the Gulf War a changed man .

A novice bell-ringer caused become caught in her rope – and had to be winched 20ft to safety from the belfry. Helen Springthorpe, 58, was beginning her weekly practice session at her church when she was lifted by the rope and fell, knocking herself unconscious. Her horrified fellow bell-ringers called an ambulance, but because the bell tower could only be reached by a steep and narrow spiral staircase, paramedics could not carry her down on a stretcher. A team of firefighters helped to rescue Helen Springthorpe from the top of the spiral staircase . The solution? A team of specialist . firemen more used to rescuing climbers from cliff tops and rock faces – . who embarked on an elaborate mission that involved opening a trap-door . in the belfry floor and winching Mrs Springthorpe to the ground 20ft . below. Mrs Springthorpe, who works as a . typist, said: ‘I don’t remember very much at all, I started pulling the . bells and the next thing I knew I was looking at a paramedic. ‘I have no real memory of it at all.  I . have no memory of being caught up. I think I hit my head on the wall . and then fell over and hit it on  the floor – it wasn’t that exciting. The exciting bit was being rescued by all the firemen. ‘It’s just been quite a drama I think . trying to get me out – the actual accident wasn’t much, but trying  to . get me out of where I was was quite difficult.’ Paramedics who arrived at St . Nicholas’s Church in Bathampton, near Bath, initially thought Mrs . Springthorpe had broken her hip and gave her morphine – but she received . a clean bill of health after a hospital examination. Rescue: A total of 19 firefighters - including specialists more typically called out to rescue rock climbers in difficulty - attended the scene at the church in Bathampton . A trapdoor in the gallery floor was lifted out so firefighters could lower the 58-year-old through the gap to safety . Precarious: The bell-ringer was strapped to a stretcher and passed from the confined gallery at the top of the belfry to a waiting firefighter on a ladder . Mrs Springthorpe, from Bath,  has only . been bell-ringing for three months and took up the hobby after a . neighbour suggested she come along to the weekly group sessions. ‘I just like the church bells, I’ve . always liked hearing them, so I thought I’d have a go,’ she said, adding . she would ‘have to see’ whether she would be going back to the belfry . any time soon. Tower captain Peter Powell, 79, was one of five bell-ringers who were there when Mrs Springthorpe fell. 'I started pulling the bells and the next thing I knew I was looking up at a paramedic' Helen Springthorpe . He said: ‘It all happened  so quickly. She was unconscious for a while, and two  of our ringers, who are . qualified medically, quickly got down with her and tried to revive her . quickly and start talking to her. ‘At the same time the ambulance was . called and then it was a case of keeping her warm on the floor, because . she was very cold and the colour had drained from her face. Everybody . was just sitting around very worried, not quite knowing what to do, but . left the two that did know what they were doing to carry on. ‘She was learning to ring,  had just started, and then  this happened.’ Reverend Paul Burden said Mr Powell . had been training bell-ringers for many years and that nothing like the . incident on Monday evening had ever happened before. Careful: Ms Springthorpe's stretcher was attached to specially designed ropes before being guided to the ground by firefighters, who spent over an hour getting the woman to safety . The inside of the tower at St Nicholas Church in Bathampton, near Bath . He said: ‘It’s not nice when it . happens and it’s a reminder that bell-ringing is a very skilled hobby . and there needs to be careful training on it.’ The clergyman added that he was pleased with how the rescue went and praised the emergency services for doing a ‘brilliant’ job. He said: ‘Helen was only really aware of the number  of people involved when she got to the bottom and was wheeled out.’ The nine firemen from Bath who . initially attended called in a specialist team of 11 from Bristol, who . usually deal with rescues from rock faces. Ms Springthorpe had been attending bell-ringing sessions for three months at the picturesque church . The typist joked that she may think twice about returning to bell-ringing after her experience . An Avon Fire and Rescue Service . spokesman said: ‘The local woman took off with the rope and she got . knocked around in the process. ‘There is a small trap  door and the . only way she could have come down was through the trap door – the . staircase was so narrow we wouldn’t have managed to bring her down . through that on a stretcher. ‘The woman was safely lowered about . 20ft to the ground, where she was taken into the care of ambulance staff . who took her to hospital.’","Helen Springthorpe collapsed on the gallery floor 20ft above the ground after hitting her head and being knocked unconscious at a church near Bath .

The youngest sister of Brazilian footballer Hulk was returned unharmed this afternoon after being held by a gang of kidnappers, police revealed. Angelica Aparecida Vieira, 22, arrived back at her parents home in Campina Grande, northeast Brazil, at around 12pm local time. She had been left on the road near the house by a silver Honda car, according to reports. Kidnapped: Angelica Aparecida Vieira, 22, the youngest sister of Brazil international player Hulk, was snatched at gunpoint as she parked in front of a restaurant in the family's hometown of Campina Grande . The only witness to the crime, Helio . da Silva, the owner of another restaurant where Ms Vieira worked as a . nutritionist, had just stepped out of her car when the gang struck. No comment: Police have confirmed the abduction, but Hulk's family, most of whom still live in Campina Grande, have so far not commented on it . He was taken to hospital suffering from shock but was later released. Police have not yet confirmed how many people were involved in the abduction. Ms Vieira is one of six sisters of soccer star Hulk, 26, who became Brazil's second most expensive footballer in September after a £32million move from Porto to Zenit St Petersburg. The forward - real name Givanildo Vieira de Souza - is regularly called up on international duty and was part of the Brazil squad which won a silver medal in this summer's London Olympics. He is thought to earn £100,000 a week. Hulk's family, most of whom still live in Campina Grande, have so far not commented on the incident. The striker is said to be exceptionally close to his family, in particular his sister. Brazil team-mate and Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva yesterday took to Twitter to express his sympathy. He wrote: 'I want to offer my friend HULK support. Much strength friend, I am praying that this will be resolved as soon as possible. Hugs.'It is not the first time organised kidnapping gangs in Brazil have targeted the family of super-rich soccer stars. The mother of former Man City winger Robinho was held hostage for 40 days after being snatched by kidnappers at her home in Praia Grande, Sao Paulo state, in November 2004. She was released unharmed after a ransom was paid. And in May 1994 the late father of Brazil legend Romario, then playing for Barcelona was kidnapped as he left a bar in Rio de Janeiro and held for a £4million ransom. Police freed Edevair Faria seven days later after bursting in on the kidnappers' lair. Home town: Campina Grande, where Ms Vieira was taken from outside a restaurant . Another of Ms Vieira's brother's Tiago Alves, 23, told Brazilian news website NE10 that she left home earlier yesterday morning for Mauricio de Nassau university, where she is studying nutrition. At 1pm she met up with restauranteur Helio da Silva, who is also her course coordinator, and the two headed to a restaurant in the Catole district where Ms Vieira was due to present a seminar. He said: 'Helio told us that when they arrived at the restaurant he left the vehicle first, then moments later, the gangsters jumped inside the car and took my sister without a trace.' He said Helio called Ms Vieira's mobile phone straight after the abduction. He said: 'A man answered who said he was her husband, then hung up, but Angelica's husband was here at home with us. 'My other sister tried to call her again, but by then her phone was switched off.' Ms Vieira is married with two children, a two-year-old boy and a girl, four. Hulk's father and the family's private security agents were accompanying the work of the police. Jose Alberto Carlos, the director of a football school belonging to the player's Hulk Foundation for poor children in the city said the star is closely followed the case from St Petersburg. It is not known how much the kidnappers had demanded for her ransom or how much the family had paid to secure her release. Earlier it had been reported that the family had asked the police to stay away from the case, suggesting contact with the gang had been made. Police chief Marcos Paulo Vilela said that officers had interviewed Ms Vieira at the house.He said more details of the case will be revealed at a press conference tomorrow.","Angelica Aparecida Vieira, 22, was snatched at gunpoint from outside a restaurant in hometown of Campina Grande .

In its bizarre new video, the animal rights charity PETA highlights that fruit and veg are the key to virility . It features various men gyrating with an assortment of phallic-shaped fruit and vegetables as their manhood, accompanied by phrases such as ‘a cucumber has never looked so good – or so wicked’. From a tennis player sporting a giant carrot, to a car wash mechanic with a banana, PETA says the video is ‘a light-hearted way to show that spicing things up in the bedroom can be as simple as changing things up in the kitchen’. The charity maintains that cholesterol in meat, eggs and dairy products can clog our arteries and slow the flow of blood to all the body's organs – including those that are vital in the bedroom. The charity maintains that cholesterol in meat, eggs and dairy products can clog our arteries and slow the flow of blood to all the body's organs – including those that are vital in the bedroom . Vegan meals, on the other hand, contain none of the animal fat or cholesterol found in meat, eggs and dairy products. Vegans are also, on average, fitter and slimmer than meat-eaters and less prone to heart disease, strokes, diabetes, obesity and cancer, the charity claims. 'When it comes to making love, carnivores can be as sluggish as the blood trying to squeeze through their clogged arteries – but vegans have the stamina to keep the party going all night long,’ said PETA UK associate director Mimi Bekhechi.

ITV has been forced to stop airing The Only Way Is Essex before the watershed because of its sexual language and content. The action was taken after a viewer saw an episode of the reality show one afternoon last August and complained to broadcasting watchdogs that young children could have been exposed to the programme's adult themes and swearing. The episode was originally aired at 10pm but repeated at Sunday lunchtime on ITV2. The cast of TOWIE: Action was taken after a viewer complained about the content of the episode . The watchdog found that producers used 20 bleeps during the half-hour episode to block out offensive language. But Ofcom said 'the bleeping of the words was not always sufficient to mask the language or its impact'. ITV is to stop scheduling the show – which stars Sam Faiers and has introduced slang such as vajazzle (to decorate a woman's genital area with crystals) to a wider public – during the day at weekends or during school holidays. Inappropriate: Stars of the show had open conversations about sex and drinking . During the episode in question, two men Charlie and Chris, discussed women in a nightclub. Charlie said: 'I like the curvaceous type – a little bit of junk in that trunk.' Chris replied: 'Sounds like every man likes a bit of boobage, bit of bum.' He adds: 'You see, I never talk to a girl with the eyes. I'm looking down seeing what they've got to offer… You need to just pounce on your prey and just penetrate.' Other offensive material included conversations about STI tests and getting 'totally smashed', and characters making sexual gestures with their hands. The watchdog concluded that ITV had breached the rule that children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from material that is unsuitable for them. ITV have previously been reprimanded over voting issues on Britain's Got Talent. Viewers were unable to vote via smartphone despite having paid for the correct apps. The broadcasting company has also been under fire in recent years over the flagship show The X Factor's risque performances from female pop stars.

War graves, such as this one belonging to Lieutenant Colonel  'H' Jones, are looked after by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . The graves of war heroes should be given special protection, a report said yesterday. Nearly 1,000 Victoria Cross winners are buried in UK churchyards and cemeteries, and many of their memorials are in poor repair. The sites should be registered and looked after, says a policy document from the Bow Group. The think-tank put the cost of the scheme at £1.2million a year. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission looks after the graves of 386 VC winners who fell in action abroad, including that of Falklands heroes Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay as well as Corporal Bryan Budd who lost his life in Afghanistan. But relatives are responsible for the . upkeep of graves of VC winners who died in other conflicts or of old . age. Because family lines dwindle or people are unaware they exist or . cannot afford to maintain them, many burial plots have fallen into . neglect. ‘The UK affords no protection for those that did not fall in active service,’ said the Bow Group’s Richard Mabey. ‘With a lack of substantive funding, many VC graves may soon crumble.’ The plight of hundreds of military graves was highlighted by the Victoria Cross Trust. Gary Stapleton, a 45-year-old Doncaster businessman, started the group after discovering that Lance Corporal Thomas Bryan, who won a VC in the First World War, was buried in a neglected grave in a local cemetery. His research uncovered hundreds of other examples of graves falling into disrepair as well as 78 that were unmarked. Among those were Major General Clifford Coffin, who died aged 88 in 1959, and . won his medal for courage while fighting with the Royal Engineers at . Passchendaele, Belgium, in July 1917. His citation read: ‘Although under the heaviest fire from both . machine guns and rifle fire and in full view of the enemy, he showed an . utter disregard of personal danger, walking quietly from shell-hole to . shell-hole, giving advice and cheering his men by his presence.’ 386 VC winners killed in action, such as Bryan Budd, pictured, have their graves looked after by the CWGC, but the graves of many others who did not die in active service are not looked after . The headstone of VC winner Sergeant James Firth, who is buried in . Burngreave Cemetery, Sheffield, is another that has become shabby. The inscription on the grave is almost unreadable, eroded through years of battering by the weather. Sargeant Firth, of the 1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington’s (West Riding) Regiment, was a hero in the Second Boer War in South Africa. Under heavy fire he carried two wounded comrades from the battlefield to safety, despite being shot through the nose and eye. He died aged 47 in 1921. The Victoria Cross Trust is in talks with Sheffield City Council to maintain the grave. The Bow report also urged ministers to scrap the 75-year limit after which local authorities can dig up the graves. The Victoria Cross is the highest award . for gallantry that a British and Commonwealth Serviceman can achieve. It . dates back to 1856 during the Crimean War. The graves of many soldiers who were awarded the VC for their actions in the First World War but were not killed in action have been left to crumble .","The graves of 386 Victoria Cross winners killed in action abroad are looked after by a Commonwealth commission .

Not least because, as his admiring colleagues put it, he just loves ‘sinking his teeth into criminals’. But all good things come to an end and now Janus, a Belgian Malinois police dog, is retiring at the grand old age of nine and a half. Happy retirement! Janus the police dog, who has chalked up a remarkable 440 arrests in the last four years, is calling it a day at the age of nine-and-a-half. Janus is seen here with handler PC Dan Thomas . Paired with handler PC Dan Thomas in 2008, Janus has used his tracking and searching skills to secure the arrest of 285 crime suspects. He also assisted in a further 157 captures – scaling 6ft high fences and chasing down sprinting suspects. On top of that, the sharp-toothed sleuth left around 60 criminals needing hospital treatment for bite injuries after coming off worst in their encounters with him. PC Thomas said: ‘Janus has depended on me and I’ve equally depended on him many times when he’s come to my aid and fended off violent offenders.’ The officer and Janus have been nominated for numerous awards in the West Midlands including two Chief Constable Commendations – the force’s  highest accolade – and three local policing commendations. ‘You could tell he really loved the job,’ said PC Thomas. ‘A walk with Janus always had to involve some training as he wants to stay active and not just go for a stroll. ‘Janus been involved in some  fantastic arrests and used his search skills to uncover a huge array of stolen property and evidence that’s led to convictions.’ Partners against crime: Dog handler PC Dan Thomas with Janus (right), who is retiring, and another police dog from the West Midlands constabulary . Described by PC Thomas as ‘one of the force’s finest’, Janus’s haul of recovered property has included knives, screwdrivers, clothing,  stolen items and cash. In one incident he uncovered £5,000 stolen from a security van heist and in another sniffed out more than £10,000 worth of stolen power tools. PC Thomas, who is keeping Janus as a pet, said: ‘He’s an excellent dog in so many ways: extremely sociable, very playful, agile, fast and highly driven to work. Janus will live out his days with my  family and I. ‘He’ll be given the best care and attention and rightly so. ‘He’s been a pleasure to train, work and live with and if I could turn the clock back and work him again I would.” Janus joined West Midlands Police as a pup around eight years ago, but it was not until he joined frontline duties with PC Thomas that he really made his mark.  The officer will now work with police dog Zane, who graduated from the force’s breed and training scheme. West Midlands Police Dog Unit manager, Inspector Russ Evans, said: ‘At the time of his retirement, Janus was among the oldest operational general purpose dogs we’ve ever had. There are no set retirement dates for our dogs. ‘It all depends on the individual dog and Janus was still scaling  6ft fences and chasing down suspects in his final few months with the force.’ West Midlands Police began recruiting Belgian Malinois, or shepherd  dogs, around ten years ago. Inspector Evans said: ‘They exhibit energy levels that are among the highest of all dog breeds, love new challenges and are relatively easy to obedience train.’","The Belgian Malinois police dog is retiring at the age of nine-and-a-half, having worked for West Midlands police for four years .

Fat cats at Britain's top companies have defied the financial crisis and awarded themselves pay rises that take average earnings to £4million. While their basic salaries have remained roughly the same, FTSE-100 company bosses have benefited from an enormous 27 per cent increase in income thanks to incentive schemes. News of their sky-high earnings will frustrate ordinary workers struggling to cope with austerity measures while those at the top continue to enjoy a 'champagne lifestyle'. Well-off: The highest-paid executives in Britain's biggest companies are hardly feeling the pinch, thanks to incentive schemes . The steep increase, revealed by Incomes Data Services, is also likely to anger investors who have seen the value of their holdings slashed by disappointing performances at corporate giants. The value of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) rose by an average of 81 per cent to £938,000 for directors and £1.6m for chief executives in the year to June, said the IDS report. Directors' pay increased by a median of 3.5 per cent, while the value of their bonuses fell by 4.9 per cent, the study found. But this deficit was made up by incentive schemes, which are now used by more than 90 per cent of FTSE-100 firms. LTIPs are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns, with directors typically having to reach a minimum target before any shares are granted. Backlash: The top earners at FTSE-100 firms were Angela Ahrendts of Burberry on £15.9m, left, and WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell on £14m, right . However, LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than a company's historical performance, so directors may be paid even if their company's performance has worsened, IDS revealed. 'Whether a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,' said Steve Tatton of IDS. 'However, while shareholders will be pleased to see more traditional elements of pay seemingly slowing, these figures show that directors' earnings can still grow significantly as a result of a complex mix of incentives.' TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber added: 'Directors have proved that executive pay structures are not fit-for-purpose by securing another huge earnings boost, even while ordinary workers suffer flat or even falling wages. Lucrative year: Shell CEO Peter Voser, left, and CEO of Jupiter Edward Bonham Carter, right, both made £10.4m . 'An 81 per cent increase in long-term incentive plans when the economy is struggling to climb out of a double-dip recession shows just how flawed the so-called performance elements of directors' remuneration have become. 'We still have way to go to bring a sense of reality to executive pay and ensure that directors' pay is aligned with the long-term health of the company rather than simply its share price.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze more cash from their companies. 'Wages for many working people have stagnated since 2003 and have fallen in real terms since the recession hit. Scalps: Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, left, and ex-Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey, right, left their companies in disgrace this year after rebellions from shareholders and the public . 'But the richest have continued to pull ahead. The top 10 per cent have 12 times more income than the bottom 10 per cent. Scandalously, Britain has the fastest growing income inequality compared to other developed countries. 'What is particularly sickening is that some of the companies may be performing poorly - but the cash registers are always ringing for these directors.' 'Flawed': TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said directors' pay should be aligned with the long-term health of the company . Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'The Government is guilty of allowing the gap between the rich at the top and those at the bottom to grow. It has used the recession to hold down wages in the public sector and cut jobs and services, while those at the top continue to enjoy a champagne lifestyle. 'It is clearly ridiculous that taxpayers are landed with a bill of between £6bn and £7bn a year for in-work benefits because scrooge bosses are lining their own pockets.' Shareholders have fought back against excessive pay this year in an extraordinary show of strength, with the so-called ‘shareholder spring’ claiming senior scalps including Andrew Moss, chief executive of insurance giant Aviva, and Trinity Mirror’s Sly Bailey. Yet surviving senior managers are only seeing increase in their pay packets. The top earner was Angela Ahrendts, chief . executive of Burberry, which has just issued a profit warning but paid . Ahrendts £15.9m. WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell, who suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts on pay in recent history, was second with £14.2m. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everyone else. ‘The gap between rewards in the boardroom and those for the rest of society has opened up to unsustainable levels. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.’","Top earner was Angela Ahrendts, chief .

A distraught nephew who 'hero-worshipped' Jimmy Savile has died 'of a broken heart' after the details of his uncle's decades of child-abuse became public. Charity volunteer Vivian Savile, 69 - described himself as a 'last of the Saviles' - and was admitted to hospital just a week after his relative was outed as a paedophile. Vivian, from Pontypridd, South Wales, was the only son of Savile’s brother Vincent and had 'become depressed and unable to eat properly' after Savile's hundreds of victims came forward. He died on October 29. A family spokesman said: 'Heartbreak may have been the cause of his condition. 'He hero-worshipped his uncle and was proud to be the last male member of the family with the surname Savile. 'At the height of the media blitz, he became quiet and withdrawn, leading to a lack of interest in almost anything including food.' In his last interview six weeks ago, Vivian said: 'Jimmy’s reputation is hugely important to me. 'We never had even an inkling of anything untoward involving him. 'The dead cannot defend themselves, they would never have dreamed of saying this when he was alive and now Jimmy should be left to rest in peace.'

A mentally ill woman who who wrongly feared she was being persecuted by her neighbours suffocated her four-year-old daughter 'out of love' to protect her, a court has been told. Chantelle Blake pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was made the subject of a hospital order by Manchester Crown Court. The court heard that the 32-year-old used a pillow to suffocated her daughter Kaiya because she was suffering from ‘delusions and hallucinations’. Tragedy: A mentally ill mother, Chantelle Blake killed the daughter Kaiya because she believed she was being 'persecuted by their neighbours', a court heard . Speaking in September last year after . the incident, neighbour Karina Demetriadis, 24, said: 'Chantelle . shouted at me once because she thought I was staring at her daughter. 'She kept herself to herself and would never just have a normal conversation with anyone. 'She always looked like a doting mum. She was very protective.' There is no evidence to suggest the neighbour did anything wrong. When sentencing her, Mr Justice MacKay said: ‘The day you ended your daughter's life will, I am sure, be with you forever.’ The judge said it was not the purpose of the court to punish Blake, as doctors on both sides agreed she was and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He said: ‘I fully accept that you did what you did out of your love for and concern for Kaiya.’ Mr Justice MacKay said the defendant's ‘mental functions’ 'abnormal’ at the time. ‘You were thinking in a distorted and deluded way, but you genuinely believed that you were acting to protect your daughter from harm by persons who wished her ill. You thought that because you were mentally ill at the time.’ Suffocated: Four-year-old Kaiya was killed by her mother out of love . The court heard that Kaiya was found by police at their home in Garthorne Close, Moss Side, Manchester, on September 22 last year after the defendant turned up at A&E with a child's suitcase. She had slashed her arms with a knife and told a nurse she had suffocated her daughter, the court heard. Mr Reeds said that the signs ‘were not picked up at the time’. In 2011, the court heard, the child was taken away from Blake. He said: ‘There was a period when it was necessary to assess whether or not she could cope with looking after Kaiya and that separation seems to have been the catalyst for the acceleration of her delusional behaviour.’ The court was told that Kaiya was returned to her mother and some months after this assessment she killed her daughter. Mr Reeds said she attended the A&E department of Manchester Royal Infirmary on September 22, 2011. She had attempted to cut her forearms and her wrists. She spoke to a triage nurse who described her as being ‘matter of fact’. Scene: Flowers are left out side the house of Chantelle Blake after she killed her young daughter Kaiya . Mr Reeds said: ‘She said it was because she had killed her daughter. She said she had suffocated her daughter. She had brought her child's suitcase with her which had some personal effects in it.’ Also in the suitcase was the knife she had used to cut herself. Police went to her home and broke down the door. ‘Under a duvet in the bedroom, with a pillow covering her face was the body of Kaiya. It was plain that she had been there for some time. It was also plain that she had been suffocated,’ Mr Reeds said. It is not clear how long the child had been dead, the court heard. Judy Khan QC, defending, said: ‘Miss Blake does not accept that she was mentally ill but she does accept that she was not in her right mind at the time of killing her daughter. Happier days: Chantelle Blake with her daughter Kaiya . ‘She maintains that she and her daughter were persecuted by her neighbours and she did not, nor has she ever, suffered from delusions or hallucinations.' Miss Khan added: ‘She agrees that whatever the situation was with all those external factors, she made a grave error in killing her daughter and she will bitterly regret it for the rest of her life.’ Miss Khan said Blake did it out of ‘love and fear’ and to protect her daughter. ‘There was no one she could turn to and nobody else on her side,’ Miss Khan said. The court was told that Kaiya's father, Alexander Glenford, was based in Jamaica but that Blake and Kaiya regularly visited him. Blake cared for Kaiya as a single parent but Mr Glenford ‘kept in touch with the defendant and maintained an interest in her and his daughter.’ Detective Chief Inspector Phil Reade, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘Kaiya's death was an absolute tragedy. She was a happy young girl with her whole life ahead of her.

The devastation wrought by hurricane Sandy could have been avoided by a simple but ingenious technology made from old car tyres, Britain's leading marine engineer claims. Thousands of car tyres lashed together to support tubes extending deep into the ocean could avert hurricanes, says Stephen Salter, emeritus professor of engineering design at Edinburgh University. With the backing of Microsoft billionaires Bill Gates and Nathan Myhrvold's company Intellectual Ventures, he has patented the idea but says further funding is urgently needed to research the scheme. The Inlet section of Atlantic City, New Jersey, as Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. last week: The huge storm wrought devastation across the Caribbean and the east coast of the U.S. Hurricanes are areas of intense low pressure that form over warm ocean waters. The source of their energy is water vapour which evaporates from the ocean surfaces, fuelling the storm with the latent heat of condensation. The so-called 'Salter Sink' harnesses wave power to in effect stir up the ocean, bringing cooler water from below stopping the surface from reaching the kinds of temperatures that cause the most devastating hurricanes. It works as a wave-powered pump, with the ocean swell pushing hot water into the top of the cylinder, with gravity then pushing that water down as far as 200m where it mixes with the cool deep. Over time, this action mixes the ocean waters bringing surface temperatures down and lessening the potential for a devastating hurricane to form. How it works: A ring 80-100 meters across floats . on an assembly of discarded tires, lashed together and filled with a . buoyant substance, such as foamed concrete . Harnessing wave power: The surface of the ring . rises a meter or so above the sea level. Ocean swells passing over the . structure fill it with warm surface water . Mixing up the oceans: A tube . connected to the inside of the ring sinks 50-300 meters to the . cooler water below. Gradually the tube fills with warm water, . which drains out the bottom. It has a tapered profile to . accelerate the velocity of the flow and to improve mixing of the warm . exhaust water with the colder water at depth . Intellectual Ventures suggests sinks ranging from 10m to 100m in diameter could potentially remove heat from the surface of the ocean at gigwatt rates. Professor Salter told the Observer that harnessing energy from waves to cool the ocean to makes ecological sense. The pumps would be placed in 'hurricane alley', the region of the Atlantic around the equator where the worst storms form. The sinks would have to be put in place months before the beginning of the hurricane season in late spring, and retrieved just before the major storms arrive - but by then their job should be done. 'It may take thousands of these to protect America’s Gulf region (for example) but we estimate the cost would be much lower than the damage caused by one of these storms,' Intellectual Ventures says on its website. Professor Salter added that he estimates 150-450 of the structures would be needed to suppress the formation of deadly hurricanes. 'They would drift around and send out radar signals so that no one would collide with them,' he told the Observer. 'Hurricane alley' is a strip within the Atlantic . Ocean where sea surface temperatures reach 28 °C (82 °F) or higher in . late spring and summer (shown in orange for May 2003). The region that . fuels tropical storms and hurricanes shifts annually but always stretches from east Africa to the Caribbean and the Gulf of . Mexico . Professor Salter first came up with the idea after seeing the damage and suffering caused in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina and first presented it to the U.S. government in 2007. The U.S is prioritising research into hurricane suppression, with seven of the 10 deadliest hurricanes to hit that country having struck since 2004. At the latest estimates, Hurricane Sandy has caused a total of $30billion (£19billion), with the economic costs of hurricanes in the U.S. and Caribbean since 2002 clocking in at a phenomenal $200billion (£125billion). Professor Salter claims the mechanics of his technology has been proven, but says research funding is urgently needed to investigate the ecological effects it might have. Although he has written to the UK government's chief scientific officer, British officials have previously shied away from funding research into his marine technologies. In 1982 he invented the idea of a mechanical device that could bob up and down on the ocean generating electricity, but the government subsequently shut the UK Wave Energy programme claiming it was too expensive. It later emerged that civil servants from the energy department's nuclear power division had 'miscalculated' by a factor of 10 the cost of energy production from Professor Salter's device. It has been claimed that decision may have set back British wave energy research by 20 years.","Professor Stephen Salter's invention would cool the ocean's surface to stop deadly hurricanes from forming .

Muslim men and boys were forced from their villages and herded into minefields and a makeshift 'death camp' by Bosnian Serb soldiers, the trial of the so-called 'Butcher of Bosnia' was told yesterday by a survivor who was just 14 at the time. Mr Elvedin Pasic, now aged 34, was the first person to give evidence in the war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic yesterday. Fighting back tears, he described the moment he fled with his mother as 150 people were executed . in his Bosnian village in 1992. The witness spoke about his harrowing escape and the scenes of horror he had seen in his home village of Grabovica in northern Bosnia. Face to face: Elvedin Pasic, left, gave evidence against former Bosnian Serb leader Ratko Mladic, right, in the first day of his war crimes trial in the Hague today. He testified about his village being shelled by Bosnian Serb troops under Mladic's command, but chose not to confront the 70-year-old defendant. He told the court that his neighbour, who was pregnant, asked him to carry her daughter to safety. 'I remember she said ""can you please carry her - if you have to rip her arm out, just don't let her go"".' The Muslim described weeks of wanderings with his mother, being turned away from village after village. He spoke in English, carefully describing how he and his mother eventually circled back to their home village despite a warning from two Serb soldiers patrolling nearby who told them 'there is nothing for you to go back to: your home is Turkey, this is Serbia.' He described his excitement as they entered the village anyway and he raced up a shortcut to his family house - only to find the Serb soldiers had told them the truth about there being little for them to return to. 'The house was burned completely, the fridge, the televisions, the walls - what was left of the walls was stripped' Pasic said. Even a stash of clothing they buried when they left had been found and taken. On trial: Former Bosnian Serb Army Commander General Ratko Mladic, is pictured centre, and his wife Bosiljka, right, along with bodyguards near the village of Han Pjesak east of Sarajevo in 1996 . Pasic's voice choked with tears as he described how he had hoped to find his dog alive, but found it shot where it was chained. Most of the handful of people who had remained in his village, notably one elderly religious man whom Pasic knew, had been burned alive in their homes, Pasic testified; one was shot instead. Judges paused for a recess in the mid-afternoon, with Pasic expected to testify next about Serb forces imprisoning and mistreating men, women and children at a makeshift detention camp in a nearby school. Mladic's lawyers claimed that recent changes about what can be filed meant prosecutors had put forward significantly more evidence than previously allowed. The defence motion said the change 'is unprecedented in the history of the tribunal and threatens to be a significant blight to the integrity of these proceedings. Urgent action by the Chamber is required to avoid a very (great) potential miscarriage of justice.' In charge: Bosnian Serb army commander-in-chief Col. General Mladic, centre, observes Bosnian government forces positions in Gorazde, eastern Bosnia in 1994 . Mladic's trial started on May 16, but was almost immediately halted because prosecutors admitted that an apparent clerical error meant they failed to disclose thousands of pages of evidence to defence attorneys. If convicted, Mladic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The defendant nodded his head in agreement at the start of Pasic's testimony, as Pasic told of good relations between Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats before the war. The long-awaited trial finally began despite a motion by defence attorneys to adjourn it for six months. U.N. judges said the prosecution . could respond to this latest request for a delay tomorrow, and allowed . Pasic to testify.

"By . Shona Sibary . PUBLISHED: . 20:42 EST, 5 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:42 EST, 5 November 2012 . Shona and her children Florence, Annie, Monty and Dolly at their home in Hindhead, Surrey. She has paid more than £100,000 in childcare over the years . The other day I did something I should warn other working parents never, ever to try at home (or anywhere else for that matter). I whipped out a calculator and totted up the entire amount that childcare for my four children over the past 14 years has cost me. No doubt you will argue that I must already know what I am spending. Indeed, I do — on a daily, monthly and, if I can bear it, annual basis. Somehow it seems more palatable when broken into bite-sized chunks. What I have never before been brave enough to stomach is adding it all together to give a final, terrifying total. I say terrifying because it came to well over £100,000, and for that amount I could have bought a house in some parts of Britain — something solid and tangible with four walls and a door. Instead, I have nothing to show except an extremely precarious freelance journalism career and a shelf of bottles of dodgy Eastern European liquor given to me as Christmas presents by my many au pairs over the years. This is why Nick Clegg has become my new and very unlikely hero. This week, he vowed to make affordable childcare his number-one priority. The Deputy Prime Minister says his announcement was prompted by the deluge of complaints from working parents he has received about the rising costs of childcare. In an email to supporters, Clegg said: ‘I want every parent who wants to work to be able to — without seeing every penny of their wages disappear in childcare bills.’ If only. For me, the stark reality of choosing to bring four children into the world while clinging on to a career by my fingernails has meant I’ve been bled dry. Indeed, if I’d known how expensive continuing to work would be, I’d have put my feet up years ago. Maybe it’s easier for parents who have a fixed salary — they can budget what help they can afford and then decide whether they can afford to work at all. Shona Sibary spent the staggering sum on nurseries and au pairs in a bid to avoid stressful scenes like this of trying to work while caring for young children (file picture) And for those of us who are self-employed, it’s a roller-coaster requiring nerves of steel or a helpful grandparent at the end of the road to take up the slack — neither of which I possess. If there’s a bad month without much work, the costs still need to be met. For years, I’ve been paying between £1,000 and £2,000 a month for the privilege of simply doing my job — often at a loss. This has occasionally led to me taking desperate measures. I remember being forced to sell my dead grandmother’s ring to pay a debt at my daughter’s nursery. And I’ve lost count of the number of times . Nick Clegg has become an unlikely hero for Shona Sibary after pledging to cut childcare costs . I’ve withdrawn cash on a credit card to give to the au pair. I would honestly begrudge none of this if I felt it had all been money well spent. But the problem is that when you get other people to look after your children, there is always that unhelpful thought lurking in the back of your mind: ‘Couldn’t I do a better job myself?’ When I had three children under the age of four, I used a combination of day care nurseries and au pairs. The rationale behind this was partly financial and partly common sense. Au pairs are not qualified nannies and therefore shouldn’t take sole charge of small children for long periods of time. So the children would spend 8am to 2pm at the nursery — which is all we could afford, but it gave me the peace and quiet I needed to work from the house. Then they would come back home and be looked after by the au pair during the afternoon if I needed to continue writing. This meant we kept those nursery costs down — which is just as well because they are exorbitant. Depending on where you live, you can pay between £45 and £80 a day per child. This never ceased to amaze me when I visited such establishments, because they always seemed to be staffed by overweight 18-year-old girls who doubtless had some NVQ in bottom-wiping or whatever, but otherwise looked alarmingly inert. I remember picking up my eldest, Flo, now 14, only to be horrified by the ‘day-care lingo’ she had picked up. I would spend hours undoing the damage, explaining to her that it wasn’t a ‘toilet’, it was a ‘loo’, and that dinner is a meal you have in the evening, not at lunchtime. When each of my children hit the age of three, I transferred them from day care to a government pre-school nursery where they would be eligible for free sessions. Shona has added up the costs . While this is a move designed to help working parents and amounts to around 15 hours a week free of charge, it only goes so far in being of any real use. Most nurseries offering the government funding close at 3pm and for the entirety of every school holiday. That’s why I’ve always needed au pairs in addition to any childcare outside the house. But, boy, have they cost a fortune. I shudder to think how I have forked out £30,000 of hard-earned cash over the years to a stream of girls — most of whom have been totally incompetent. And this £80 per week doesn’t include money spent on their food, electricity, English lessons and repairs to the bodywork of the car when they’ve pranged it. Shona has spent a fortune on 'mostly useless' au pairs and is yet to find her perfect Mary Poppins, pictured. Let’s start with the Romanian who thought it was OK to take my two daughters — then aged two and five — shopping in the town centre in bare feet because ‘that’s the way we do things back home’. Then there was the Polish girl who borrowed the car, drove a 50-mile round trip to a Portsmouth nightclub and brought two squaddies she’d picked up back to her bed in my home (leaving me no petrol for the school run). Not forgetting the Slovakian girl who stole £200 from my children’s piggy banks, oh, and the Dutch one who had a fling with George Best in our spare bedroom (no, I’m not making this up). Then, last, but by no means least, the Czech — or was it  Slovenian? — au pair who made game efforts to nab my husband, but settled, instead, for one of  his friends. Of course, things are much easier now that my older three — Flo, 14, Annie, 11, and Monty, nine — are at school. Now, there is just three-year-old Dolly’s nursery to pay for. It’s money well spent, apart from one small niggle. Government guidelines dictate that nursery staff can no longer use the word ‘naughty’. This, apparently, is a potentially damaging statement against a child’s personality. So, if Dolly does something wilfully disobedient she must be told that her ‘behaviour’ has made staff a ‘little bit sad’. There is no naughty chair or naughty step. The word has been banished.

Scroll down for video . Tailor to the stars: Martin Greenfield has been altering suits for decades, and has a host of celebrity clients from the music, sports and political arenas . In fact, the first shirt he ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an SS guard who had given it to him to wash. Mr Greenfield, 84, told the Washington Post: 'I didn’t know how to wash shirts - we had a maid. And I ripped his collar… First, he whipped me, then he gave me the shirt.' Honing his sewing skills and fixing the attire to fit him properly, Mr Greenfield used the shirt as a status symbol, wearing it in place of his prison garb. He had been moved to the Buchenwald camp before he was freed by Allied forces. When freed, he was alongside another young prisoner, writer Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. Master of the trade: The first shirt Mr Greenfield ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an SS guard who had given it to him to wash . Mr Greenfield was 19 years old when he arrived in the U.S. in 1947. Today, he is showing few signs that he is ready to retire. The Post reported that suits at Greenfield’s Brooklyn headquarters cost anywhere from $1,800 to $2,700. In the past, Mr Greenfield’s prowess as a tailor has been sought out by some of America’s biggest names, including Paul Newman and Michael Jackson. But perhaps no name is bigger than the president of the United States. Wall of fame: On the wall in Mr Greenfield's office are photos and letter signed by Paul Newman and Bill Clinton, among others . High-priced: Suits at Greenfield's Brooklyn headquarters cost anywhere from $1,800 to $2,700 . As a young tailor in the 50s, his bosses gave him the privilege to measure Dwight D.

Eisenhower may have been Mr Greenfield’s first president, but he wouldn’t be the last, as Lyndon B.

A charity worker has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work. George Maccoy also claimed to have completed 25 years in the RAF, but documentation suggested he had only completed 16 days before buying himself out without completing his basic training. He was employed as a ‘meeter and greeter’ at Corporation of Trinity House, a 500-year-old charity based in Newcastle which helps to care for mariners and their dependents. Disgraceful: George Maccoy, 60, has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work . While he was employed, he claimed he had testicular cancer and forged letters from an imaginary consultant to justify taking time off work for fictitious hospital appointments. The charity had sacked the 60-year-old for nine counts of gross misconduct which included running-up up a 'considerable bill' by calling a dating agency on the handyman’s phone, the tribunal was told. But Mr Maccoy claimed he had been unfairly dismissed when the breakdown of a relationship triggered an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder which his managers failed to deal with. But his case was withdrawn and the tribunal was shown paperwork stating the 60-year-old served just 16 days in the RAF in 1979 without having completed his basic training. And in a rare move by the tribunal panel, Mr Maccoy was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs after a second claim for disability discrimination was withdrawn in June this year. Mr Maccoy was employed by Master, Pilots and Seamen of the Corporation of Trinity House, where he worked as a 'meeter and greeter' attending to VIPs and guests at the charity’s functions. Fantasist: George Maccoy was employed as a 'meeter and greeter' at a 500-year-old charity . But the organisation, which helps support poor mariners as well as examining and licensing deep sea shipping pilots, dismissed him in May last year after it was discovered that he had lied about suffering from cancer. Mr Maccoy had used a work printer to write letters from medical experts in which he lied about suffering from testicular cancer, the tribunal was told. He lost his £8-an-hour job after colleagues discovered the forged letter from fictitious consultant oncologist Simon Carter, a character created by Mr Maccoy to justify taking time off work to attend appointments, it was said. In February Mr Maccoy - who has spoken publicly about his battle to deal with the demons of war - launched a damages claim for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. But a legal team from Eversheds, led by senior associate Stephen Cairns, refuted the claims and in April they produced a letter from the RAF which said Mr Maccoy enlisted on March 21, 1972, but bought himself out just 16 days later on April 6. It is unclear if Mr Maccoy subsequently served in other parts of the armed forces or whether he saw action on foreign soil. It is believed that he was a member of the Territorial Army at some point. But Mr Cairns produced evidence at the tribunal which suggested Mr Maccoy had been working in South Tyneside as a caretaker during the 1990s when he claimed to be a serving aircraftsman. A spokeswoman for Trinity House said: 'The Newcastle Trinity House is pleased with the outcome of this employment tribunal which makes clear that all Mr Maccoy’s claims were completely untrue. 'We are, however, both deeply shocked and saddened that Mr Maccoy invented a past history with the RAF and moreover that he chose to fabricate post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of combat experience. 'We feel such deception is not only disturbing but also demeaning to all those genuine victims from our armed forces.' Mr Maccoy refused to comment following the tribunal but in a claim submitted to the tribunal, Mr Maccoy said: 'I was dismissed from my employment for alleged gross misconduct. 'At that time and presently I was/am suffering severe depression, also severe PTSD causing me to suffer loss of intellectual and social functions, whilst striving to hold down full-time employment.'","George Maccoy was employed as a ‘meeter and greeter’ at a 500-year-old charity which helps to care for mariners and their dependents .

A rat catcher who blasted an 83-year-old Army colonel to death on his doorstep was yesterday jailed for life. Christopher Docherty-Puncheon, 33, knocked on his victim's door and then killed him with a single shotgun blast. The crime stunned the village where Lieutenant Colonel Robert 'Riley' Workman lived – but for nearly nine years the killing – which became known as the Midsomer Murder – remained a mystery. 'Execution-style' killing: Retired Army Colonel Robert 'Riley' Workman (left) was shot dead on his doorstep in 2004. Christopher Docherty-Puncheon (right) has been jailed for life for his murder . Lt Col Workman was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, on January 7, 2004 . Police were unable to find any forensic evidence and there was no obvious motive. Docherty-Puncheon, a game keeper and pest controller, had done odd jobs at the widower’s home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire. He was finally convicted after jail cell boasts while on remand for another murder. Circumstantial evidence also linked him to the crime. Docherty-Puncheon’s motive remains unclear, however, and may never be known. During his jail cell confessions, he claimed to be a contract killer and to have had a homosexual affair with Lieutenant Colonel Workman – both of which he denied when he gave evidence. Investigation: Hertfordshire police search for evidence outside a phone box in Braughing after Lt Col Workman's death in 2004 . Blast: The gay WWII veteran was shot dead with a single blast from a sawn-off shotgun on the doorstop of his rural cottage . Jailing him for a minimum of 32 years, Mr Justice Saunders, said at St Albans Crown Court: ‘It was a terrible crime and people living in that rural community were shocked by the gunning down in cold blood of one of their elderly neighbours.’ The colonel’s body was found by his carer in January 2004. The front door was open but nothing was missing from his home. Docherty-Puncheon was arrested within 24 hours. But he was released because there was no firm evidence against him. However, in 2006 he was convicted of the murder of his friend, traveller Fred Moss, 21, and received a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. Confession: Docherty-Puncheon, 33, was on remand for another murder when he confessed to a cellmate that he had killed 83-year-old Lt Col Workman, pictured with late wife Joanna . Hertfordshire Police only learned of his . jail cell confessions – which appeared to link the murders – two years . later when they began an investigation into the Workman case. During the trial, the jury heard that the defendant told one inmate at Bedford Prison that he had been ‘engaged in sexual activity’ with the pensioner, who was ‘wealthy and generous’. Prosecutor Richard Latham QC said: ‘He said Fred Moss had been using drugs and the colonel found out. He said the colonel was homosexual and had tried it on with Moss. Victim: Docherty-Puncheon's fellow prisoner also told how the gay 33-year-old, who was in a civil partnership, had claimed to have . had a sexual relationship with the 'wealthy' Lieutenant Colonel, left, and right with his wife . Huge case: Docherty-Puncheon had initially been a suspect in the police investigation - which involved interviewing more than 3,000 people and the offer of a £10,000 reward . ‘The defendant had gone round to confront the colonel and the colonel threatened to go to the police and he had shot him at the door.’ He had also claimed to an inmate to be a ‘modern-day hit man’ who had been hired to kill someone in Australia. Docherty-Puncheon complained in court he felt like he was in the middle of a TV drama after locals learned of his arrest in 2004. ‘They were talking about it, coming up with ridiculous theories. It was like Midsomer Murders,’ he said. Comparison: At the time, the mystery killing was likened to one that might feature on ITV detective drama Midsomer Murders because of its rural, idyllic setting . Police inquiries revealed the  colonel, who served with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light infantry during the Second World War, led a double life in the 1960s when he used to frequent gay bars. Docherty-Puncheon denied discussing the murders in jail and insisted he had not killed the colonel, whose wife Joanna died a few months before his murder. The couple had no children.","Lieutenant Colonel Robert 'Riley' Workman was shot dead in January 2004 .

If you thought playing games on your mobile phone while at work was a mindless distraction and waste of time, then think again. In fact, it has been discovered that if you play popular game Angry Birds while at your desk – it could make you smarter and a better worker. Research has suggested that playing such games can make you a more ‘resilient’ employee and help you focus at work. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) cited research suggesting that engaging in some activities we think are non-productive - such as small exercises - may be a smart way to spend time, particularly at work. People across the world reportedly spend 300 million minutes a day on Angry Birds, one of the most popular games available on touch-screen smartphones. Indeed, the Prime Minister David Cameron has himself admitted to being an Angry Birds addict. Writing in the HBR, Jane McGonigal, a game designer and author of Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, referred to research suggesting these practices can make people better problem solvers, more collaborative, and less likely to give up.

'Suicide': Gary Engel, pictured in a mug shot from the 1980s, was found hanged in his jail cell on Monday . A former police officer accused of plotting to torture, dismember and bleed a businessman to death as part of a plan to extort millions from him has died in jail in an apparent suicide. Gary Engel, 61, was found hanged in his cell by a bedsheet on Monday morning, McHenry County Deputy Coroner Robert Locke told the Chicago Sun-Times. He was due to be arraigned for his alleged crimes in federal court in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday and was being held alone in a cell. Coroners are now waiting for his toxicology results before they rule the death as suicide. It comes less than two weeks after Engel was arrested with a fellow former police officer, Steven Mandell, and accused of plotting to kill a man who owned real estate. The duo intended to pose as police officers and, using a fake arrest document, kidnap the man and take him to a custom-built murder chamber to torture him, according to conversations secretly recorded by a witness co-operating with police. They planned to take the man to an office with a giant sink to drain his blood and torture him until he gave them money and millions of dollars worth of real estate, according to the criminal complaint. 'My guy knows what he's doing, he knows . how to waterboard, do interrogation, psy-ops,' Mandell, also 61, allegedly said of . Engel. On recordings, Mandell allegedly guessed . the victim made as much as $100,000 a month in cash from 25 rental . properties. The men also discussed demanding at least $500,000 from the . man. Bleak: Engel was found in his cell at McHenry County Jail, pictured, two weeks after he was accused of planning to torture and 'bleed out' a businessman after extorting millions of dollars from him . They then allegedly intended to dismember him with saws and a butcher's knife and Engel allegedly said he . wanted the victim's dead body to 'bleed out... you want to let him . drain'. But before they could carry out the grisly murder, they were caught by the FBI in an undercover operation and arrested at the makeshift torture chamber in the northwest side of Chicago. Officers said the men both had fake firearms and bogus law enforcement credentials. Mandell also possessed a fake arrest document naming the victim as a criminal defendant. The FBI also found saws, a butcher . knife, numerous zip-ties for restraints and a loaded .22 caliber . semi-automatic pistol at the site. Both . men had previously been convicted - and cleared - of a similarly gruesome plot in Missouri in 1984; they allegedly intended to kidnap a Kansas . City nightclub owner and extort money from him. Death: Engel, pictured right in the 1990s, allegedly planned to cut up his victim with saws and a butcher knife . Partner in crime: He allegedly planned to pose as a police officer with fellow former cop Steven Mandell, pictured, to nab the victim. Both men were convicted - and later released - for a similar crime in the 80s . Engel was sentenced to 90 years in prison in 1991, while Mandell was sentenced to death in a separate murder case - making him the first police officer ever to go on death row. Yet both men were eventually cleared and released after arguing that evidence had been improperly withheld at his trial. Engel was freed in 2010. In this most recent case, both men were charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. Mandell was a Chicago police officer for 10 years until 1983 while Engel worked in Willow Springs.","Gary Engel arrested two weeks ago in undercover FBI operation .

Sarah Palin held off until the eve of the 2012 presidential election to reveal that she had decided to back Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for the White House. The former Alaskan governor posted a lengthy message on Facebook detailing the reasons as to why she was behind the Republican candidates - and it was mostly a negative assessment of Obama's past four years. She wrote: 'On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states.' Following her failed run for vice . president alongside John McCain in 2008, Palin has been a vocal . commentator on the race - but has stopped short of endorsing a . candidate. At the primaries stage, she gave her vote to Republican hopeful and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In . the 19-paragraph message posted on Monday, Palin launched a scathing attack on President . Obama, where she wrote: 'In 2008, Barack Obama promised to . fundamentally transform America. 'And . for all his failures and broken promises, that’s the one thing he has . delivered on. He’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of . anxiety. It doesn’t have to be this way.' Almost 48,000 people 'liked' Palin's message on her Facebook page and it was shared close to 4,000 times. Before now, Palin had not formally endorsed a candidate but her political action committee last week donated $5,000 to Romney's campaign. Another one in the ballot box: Mitt Romney, pictured with wife Ann today in Fairfax, Virginia has been backed by Sarah Palin . Backed by the A-list: He may not have Palin's vote but Obama can rely on the support of Bruce Springsteen and Jay-Z, seen here today in Columbus, Ohio . Palin, who is currently writing a motivational fitness book, has been prolific in her Facebook posts during the 2012 campaign. She was mired in controversy last . month when she took to the social network to say that Obama should end . his ‘shuck and jive shtick’ over the death of U.S. ambassador to . Libya Chris Stevens. The phrase has racist connotations among African-Americans and is used to denote somebody being deceitful. She also weighed in on the VP debate . between Paul Ryan and her adversary four years ago, Joe Biden. Palin said . that moderator Martha Raddatz had been 'tough' on Ryan and allowed Biden . the run of the conversation. Memories: Palin herself debated against Joe Biden during the 2008 presidential election . This Tuesday our country’s future is in our hands. What’s past is prologue. We know what we will get from a second Obama term because we’ve all endured his first term. We know how well he kept his 2008 campaign promises. Do we really believe he’ll keep his 2012 promises? Do we believe the word of a man who promised he wouldn’t raise taxes on the middle class, but then slammed the middle class with a massive tax hike in the form of Obamacare (and don’t forget that his own lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that the individual mandate is a tax)? Do we really believe he won’t raise taxes even more on every American in order to pay for his wasteful spending and his crony capitalism? Do we believe that the same president who increased the debt in his first term by more than all the first 41 presidents combined will suddenly decide to cut the deficit in his second term? Do we believe that the president whose reckless spending led us to the first credit rating downgrade in our nation’s history will suddenly become a responsible fiscal manager if we reelect him? Do we really believe that a president who promised us that job creation was his number one priority despite month after month of dismal job numbers now has a credible 'plan' for the job growth that eluded him for the past four years? Do we believe that the same president who shut down the Keystone Pipeline and blocks domestic oil and natural gas development at every turn is somehow going to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and lead us to energy independence? Do we really believe that our country’s national security is safe in the hands of a president whose administration denied security and assistance to our consulate under attack on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on America, and then blamed that consulate attack and the death of our ambassador on a “spontaneous” protest over an obscure YouTube video despite all the real time evidence to the contrary? Do we believe that a president who was caught on a hot mic telling the Russian president that he would have “more flexibility” after his reelection is being honest about his plans for a second term? We know what we will get from a second Obama term. We will get the same failed policies. We will get Obamacare locked into law without any chance of undoing this dangerous legislation and any chance to seek real patient-centered health care reform. We will get a debt crisis. We will get more inflation and higher gas prices. We will get tax increases. We will get fewer jobs. We will get more small businesses collapsing under the weight of higher taxes and unfair regulation. We will get more corruption and crony capitalism favoring the Obama administration’s friends. We will get less domestic energy development and increased dependence on terrorist sponsoring foreign regimes for our energy needs. We will get a “blame America first” foreign policy that bows to our enemies and snubs our friends like Israel and leaves America and the world less safe. We will get less opportunity and security for ourselves and for our children. In 2008, Barack Obama promised to fundamentally transform America. And for all his failures and broken promises, that’s the one thing he has delivered on. He’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of anxiety. It doesn’t have to be this way. Tuesday is our chance to turn things around. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have offered a credible alternative to Barack Obama’s failed policies. Governor Romney understands how the free market works. His pro-growth economic policies will benefit all Americans. He has promised to move us toward energy independence, deficit reduction, and responsible entitlement reform that honors our commitment to our seniors and keeps faith with future generations. Governor Romney deserves a chance to lead. President Obama had his chance. He’s failed, and we can’t afford to go backwards. We must also remember the many good Republican candidates who are running for the House and Senate this year. They deserve our support as well. If you are like me, you have watched these campaigns, learned about the candidates, and know where they stand despite the skewed lens of a partisan media bent on keeping liberal leadership in power. We saw the destruction a Democrat controlled White House, House, and Senate brought us after the 2008 election. Our country can’t afford that again. Your vote is the only safeguard against that happening. On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states. Voting is our duty and our right. We must never forget the immense sacrifices generations of Americans, including our brave men and women in uniform today, have made to give us this right. And we must never forget the duty we owe to generations of Americans yet to be born to exercise our right to vote prudently. The White House and control of the Senate is in the balance in this election, and every vote will count. I firmly believe it is our responsibility to restore this country and secure the blessings of liberty and prosperity for our children, just as it was secured for us. This is our sacred duty to the past and to the future. We will succeed in this so help us God. God bless you and God bless America. With an Alaskan heart, .

"By . James Andrew . PUBLISHED: . 09:46 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:12 EST, 7 November 2012 . A civil servant has avoided jail after he faked a visa application to bring a Nigerian nanny back to the UK to look after his children. Foreign Office worker James Mooney worked in Lagos and claimed that the domestic servant had been working for his family for a year, as opposed to six months to guarantee she would be granted a visa and he would have a cheap worker once she was in the UK. The 33-year-old was caught out when some of his colleagues in the close knit ex-pat community in the Nigerian capital were aware that the family had sacked their former nanny just six months earlier and replaced her with Rose Usang Inah, the nanny he wanted to bring to the UK. Accused: Former foreign office officials James Mooney and Natasha Vukic arriving at court for sentencing . The visa was cancelled before the nanny was able to travel to Britain. Mooney was sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to assisting unlawful immigration on the second day of his trial at Inner London Crown Court. Charges against his ex-wife and mother of his two children Natasha Vukic, 36 and who worked as an Entry Clearance Officer [ECO] for the UK Border Agency in Nigeria were dropped after the prosecution offered no evidence. Sentencing Mooney to a three month curfew with electronic tag and to work unpaid for 240 hours, Judge Ian Darling told him: 'The country was entitled to expect honesty from its public servants.' He said: 'You stand before me having pleaded guilty to a serious offence representing as it does not only corruption but a massive breach of trust. Critical: Judge Ian Darling said Mr Mooney had shamed himself and his family . 'This is as tragic as it is perplexing. You come from a family who in effect has dedicated itself to public service working around the world for varying limbs of the British Government. 'Fifteen years ago you followed your parents into this world and you were successful, able and thoroughly trusted. 'In a moment of sheer madness not in my judgement carried out solely by you, you have thrown it all away. 'You have brought shame not only to yourself and to your family. Their deservedly good reputation has been tarnished by your folly.' He told Mooney his loss of integrity and job would be a 'permanent reminder of your stupidity.' Judge Darling said Mooney was now facing losing his home while paying maintenance to his two children and so was not required to pay costs of more than £9,500, £6,000 of which was the cost of sending detectives to Nigeria to investigate the crime. The maximum sentence was 14 years. His barrister Paul Wakerley, in mitigation, said: 'There had not in fact been a breach of UK immigration law. 'A visa was initially granted on the back of the application and quickly cancelled. So there had not been in fact a breach of immigration law. 'It’s not suggested by the prosecution that there was not a plan for the nanny to come to the UK and work as their nanny. 'It’s not a device cooked up so as to allow this lady free access to the country. The motive was greed or saving of money. 'The effect of that which he admitted or taken responsibility for is this 33-year-old who worked for the FCO for approaching 15 years and had good reports has thrown all that away. 'He’s lost that job, he lost the job he obtained in the UK when he came back here and his employment prospects are limited by the conviction.'","Foreign Office worker claimed nanny had worked for a year rather than six months to ensure visa was granted .

To people who were caught in snarled traffic or had to shovel snow with leaves still on the trees, the storm pulling off the East Coast on Thursday was your basic nor'easter. To The Weather Channel, it was Athena. The network has taken to naming winter storms, much like is done for tropical systems. Scroll down for video . New system: The Weather Channel has taken to giving winter storms names much as they do for tropical storms with a second storm in the Midwest, pictured off their site, now named Brutus . Unusual: The season's first nor'easter, now uniquely named Athena by The Weather Channel, brought inland snow and strong coastal winds despite leaves still decorating trees like this yard in Massachusetts . The Weather Channel says it makes the storms easier to identify and will raise awareness among those in their paths. It also draws attention to The Weather Channel at times of bad weather, when the network's ratings usually soar. The National Weather Service names hurricanes but isn't recognizing the cable channel's winter storm names. The government agency sent out an advisory to its personnel Wednesday asking them to 'please refrain from using the term ""Athena"" in any of our products.' All their own: So long as viewers tune into the Weather Channel they can see storms named like Athena and Brutus, as seen here already reported on their website . Many news services, including The Associated Press, aren't recognizing the names in their coverage, either. The weather service has said it has no opinion about the names but noted that winter storms can end and redevelop, making it difficult to define where one storm ends and another begins. Oddly enough, it was the weather service that first dubbed Superstorm Sandy 'Frankenstorm' many days before it made landfall. That nickname faded, in large part because The Weather Channel would not use it for fear it made light of a serious situation. Covered: Over four inches of snow was seen falling over Central Park's Wollman Rink in New York though leaves still covered the trees there as well . Namesakes: A list of 26 names have been planned out for this winter season primarily using Greek or Roman names while one storm has been named Q for the NYC subway line . At The Weather Channel, a team of . meteorologists decides which winter storms get names based on factors . like expected snow depth and wind speed, handing them out no more than . three days in advance. Athena was named, in part, for fears that it would add to damage in areas already reeling from Sandy. The winter storm dropped as much as a foot of snow in some parts of New Jersey and knocked out power to tens of thousands of customers. The Weather Channel has already named another winter storm expected to sock the Northern Plains as Brutus. Earlier this fall, the network released in advance a list of 26 names it will be using for storms, also like is done for hurricanes. The names, including Helen, Luna, Magnus and Ukko, are primarily based in Greek or Roman mythology, although the storm dubbed simply Q was named for the New York City subway line. If anyone is digging out from Zeus in a couple of months, you'll know it has been a brutal winter.

Hungry children from families too poor to eat are being taught cookery at school on Fridays so they have food to take home for the weekend. Shocking figures have also revealed the number of Britons relying on emergency food handouts has soared to record levels - with charities warning the grim situation is going to get worse. One in seven children regularly go without a hot meal, according to the Unite union, and in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a handful of schools are getting pupils to cook a high-carbohydrate, nutritious meal before heading home for the weekends. Breadline: Pupils are taught cookery on Fridays to tackle poverty (stock image) Ralph Berry, who chairs the city's Child Poverty Board, said teachers had been noticing that children were underweight and urged other schools to follow suit. He added: 'It is an impact of rising poverty really. It's a small thing that can help. People are sharing these ideas. We are trying to get schools to look at any steps they can to impact on poverty.' The Trussell Trust, which runs a nationwide network of 270 foodbanks, said nearly 110,000 people turned to it for help between April and September - compared to 128,697 over the last financial year. The organisation is expecting to feed more than 200,000 hungry mouths by the end of this financial year, with food prices likely to rise further and fuel bills increase by nearly 10%. The worrying figures follow Prime Minister David Cameron's insistence that the economy is picking up. Unite claims people are borrowing an average of £325 a month to pay for essentials, such as food and housing, while Oxfam estimates one in three children and 13 million people are living in poverty in the UK. Poverty: One in seven children regularly go without a hot meal (stock image) The Trussell Trust's executive chairman, Chris Mould, said the rising cost of food and fuel, combined with static incomes, high unemployment and changes to benefits is responsible for the soar in demand at foodbanks - , which provide three days food to people in crisis. He said: 'The Trussell Trust has seen first-hand the devastating impact of rising food prices on people in poverty. 'It means that the budgets of people on the breadline are stretched even further so that even a small change in financial circumstances can push people into a crisis where they cannot afford food.' The South West has the highest numbers turning to the Trussell Trust, with 21,000 people, including 7,000 children, . being fed since April - just 5,000 less than the nationwide figure in 2008-09. This is compared to 16,000 in the South East and 15,000 in London, where nearly 6,400 youngsters are among those going hungry. In the West Midlands around 14,000 . people have been using foodbanks, compared to almost 12,000 in Wales and nearly 10,000 in the North West. Unaffordable: Rising cost of food is blamed for increase in foodbank demand . Less than 5% of the trust's clients are homeless and more than 90% of its donations come directly from the public. Mr Mould added: 'Day in, day out, foodbanks already meet UK parents who are going without food to feed their children, or are forced to consider stealing to stop their children going to bed hungry. 'Further rises in food and fuel bills could see even more people in crisis turn to foodbanks. 'Many low-income working families are living on a knife edge. This rise in food prices could be enough to tip them into poverty, especially as winter approaches and heating costs increase. 'Christmas is looking bleak for thousands of UK families.' Mr Mould added that donations, which include cereal and tinned meat and vegetables, have also risen to 875 tonnes.

That was three weeks before its . documentary aired and nearly a month before Newsnight's editor Peter . Rippon said the BBC's own investigation had uncovered no . evidence against the corporation. ITV explored the late DJ's reign of terror in 'Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile'. Unearthed: The email from the producers of Exposure revealed the DJ's reign of terror to the BBC back in September . Newsnight decided to drop its probe . into Savile's sordid sex life, with Mr Rippon claiming  on October 2 that he had 'no . evidence against the BBC'. The letter from the ITV producer requested a detailed response about who at the BBC knew about the allegations. But the BBC last night insisted it would not release the correspondence, saying it did not want to undermine the Pollard Review into the broadcaster. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It would not be appropriate for the BBC to publish this correspondence as it has been submitted for consideration to the Pollard Review.' The Mail understands that ITV was happy to unveil the correspondence with its rival broadcaster - but only if the BBC agreed. Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, accused the BBC of a cover-up last night. No action: The letter was sent nearly a month before Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, pictured, killed off the BBC's own investigation .

Now that the Savile allegations are out in the open, why is the BBC trying to keep the contents of these letters secret? 'There is absolutely no reason why the publication of these letters would harm the two inquiries into the Savile allegations. 'The inquiries must be seen to be independent and transparent, not smokescreens behind which the BBC can hide.' The revelation comes as former West Yorkshire detective John . Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in . for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming . the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Mr . Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 . years, and who spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the . programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put . forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may . seem. 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' Today, however, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman . said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be . more specific than that at this time. 'Details of all who were questioned . in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 21:25 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 7 November 2012 . Michele Bachmann was this morning finally declared the projected winner of her congressional race with 98 per cent of precincts reporting and the one-time presidential candidate scraping by with a narrow 3,966-vote lead. It wasn't until the very final ballots were counted in her close race against businessman Jim Graves that Bachmann was announced as the winner, scraping through by a very slim margin. While she prevailed in the end, the close nature of her race and the defeat of another half dozen other Tea Party Republicans may spell the end of the conservative movement as a major political force. Focusing locally: Michele Bachmann, seen here in her Minnesota headquarters, is in a particularly tight race to hold on to her congressional seat and she raised the most out of all incumbents . Most notable were the losses of Florida's Allen West and Illinois' Joe Walsh. The final tally in the race between . West, a leading member of the Tea Party Caucus who ruffled feathers by . calling a number of Democrats 'traitorous Communists', and challenger . Patrick Murphy  but the Democrat is thought to have won by between 1,000 . and 2,000 votes. All told, USA Today reports that West spent $13million to hold on to his seat - nearly four times as much as Murphy raised. Joe Walsh, West's fellow one-term peer . from Illinois, lost to Democratic war veteran Tammy Duckworth as she . earned 55 per cent of the vote compared to his 45 per cent. Both the races in the Florida 18th and . the Illinois 8th were noted for being particularly nasty as questions . were raised over respective military records. Murphy ran negative ads about West's . time in both Kuwait and Iraq. Walsh drew the ire of some supporters . after he said that he wasn't sure if Duckworth, who lost both legs . during her time in Iraq, was a 'true hero'. While New York is known for being a . Democratic stronghold, whose Electoral College votes were quickly called . for President Obama. But upstate New York has a number of Republican . congressional districts, including two where Tea Party-endorsed . incumbents were ousted by Democratic challengers after just one term in . the House. Primping: Allen West was one of the leaders of the Tea Party Caucus when he was elected in 2010 but now faces a difficult race against 29-year-old Patrick Murphy . Elected to Congress in 2010 during the . Tea Party so-called 'uprising', Ann Marie Buerkle lost to Democrat Dan . Maffei, the man she beat out from the seat in the first place. Republican Nan Hayworth in Westchester . County was shut out by Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney, making him the . state's first openly gay man elected to Congress. While freshmen representatives like . Buerkle, Hayworth, West, and Walsh make for a trend, the most . interesting challenge still comes from that of incumbent Bachmann. Her re-election should have been a . breeze considering she was a serious contender for the presidency at one . point. She won the Ames straw poll last August in the pivotal swing . state of Iowa, but her campaign eventually ran out of steam in January . as she suspended her presidential bid just weeks before saying she would . run again for her spot in Congress. War of words: Incumbent Joe Walsh (left) questioned whether double-amputee Iraq veteran Tammy Duckworth (right) was a 'true hero' By July, Politico reported that she . had raised nearly $15million for her congressional war chest, and . followed that with an additional $4.5million in July through September. All told, she raised the most out of all of her peers in Congress. She only won in 2010 with 53 per cent of the vote, making it even more critical that every ballot is counted in this election. By 5am, Bachmann was officially declared the projected winner, coming in just shy of a 4,000-vote lead. Holding on: Republicans are expected to retain the House so John Boehner will remain Speaker . ‘When she was running for president, . her attention was clearly not on district concerns and I think that . perception stuck with some voters and it is a vulnerability that Graves . is trying to exploit,’ Minnesota’s Carleton College professor Steven . Schier told Reuters. Another female Republican who has come . under the spotlight is Mia Love, the African American from Utah who . rose to prominence in conservative circles after her address at the . Republican National Convention. Her prime convention placement, which . analysts speculated was done to show the diversity within the GOP, . heightened her national recognition but apparently was not enough to . take her over the edge. Love conceded to Democrat Jim Matheson even though he was only up by less than one percentage point at the time. Following hype over her strong speech, . Tea Party groups reportedly sent out emails to supporters saying that . Love was being targeted by liberals intent on stopping her from making . history as the first black female Republican elected to Congress. Two Tea Party favorites who faced threats over ethical concerns had a split night. Both Michael Grimm from New York and . David Rivera from Florida are currently subject to federal . investigations, but that apparently had little sway over New Yorkers. Grimm held on to his seat, beating . challenger Mark Murphy even though he is at the center of a campaign . finance scandal where he was accused of taking contributions from the . aide to a local rabbi in return for helping him get a green card. Rivera is said to be at the center of . an FBI investigation relating to the alleged funding of a fake campaign . of one of his would-be competitors. Because of the continuing ethical . questions, and the fact that he only won by 52 per cent of the vote in . 2010, it comes as little surprise that Democrat Joe Garcia claimed . victory on Tuesday. Looking at the larger picture, these . loses meant little for the Republican party. The GOP retained its . control over the House just as it was expected to do and John Boehner . will remain the Speaker. What they do change is the role and . influence of the Tea Party, particularly in their credibility in regards . to their staying power.","Tough races for half-dozen Tea Party candidates across the country .

"By . Louise Boyle and Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 23:06 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:15 EST, 7 November 2012 . Lukewarm: Sarah Palin sounded pessimistic about Mitt Romney's chances . Former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin last night said that she was 'disappointed' about the outcome of the election results as she talked about Romney's chances. During an appearance on Fox News, Palin told host Greta Van Susteren that a second Obama term would be 'catastrophic' to the country's economy but there is little Republicans can do but cross their fingers at this point. 'I’m crossing my fingers, Greta, and hoping things can turn around in the remaining hours of the evening,' she said. Palin's pessimistic take comes after a campaign season of tepid endorsements and little action on her part. The former vice presidential candidate held off until the eve of the 2012 presidential election to reveal that she had decided to back Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for the White House. The former Alaskan governor posted a lengthy message on Facebook detailing the reasons as to why she was behind the Republican candidates - and it was mostly a negative assessment of Obama's past four years. She wrote: 'On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the common-sense conservatives running for office in your states.' During the primaries, she gave her vote to Republican hopeful and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Another one in the ballot box: Mitt Romney, pictured with wife Ann today in Fairfax, Virginia has been backed by Sarah Palin . In the 19-paragraph endorsement message posted on Monday, Palin launched a scathing attack on President Obama. She continued in that vein during her Election Night appearance, saying: 'This really is a catastrophic set-back to our economy and to any opportunity that we would have for Supreme Court justices to be appointed who would be strict adherents to the traditional interpretation of what our Constitution says.' Palin had not formally endorsed a candidate but her political action committee last week donated $5,000 to Romney's campaign. Palin, who is currently writing a motivational fitness book, has been prolific in her Facebook posts during the 2012 campaign. Not her strongest words: Palin waited until the night before the election to endorse Romney . Memories: Palin herself debated against Joe Biden during the 2008 presidential election . She was mired in controversy last month when she took to the social network to say that Obama should end his ‘shuck and jive shtick’ over the death of U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. The phrase has racist connotations among African-Americans and is used to denote somebody being deceitful. She also weighed in on the VP debate between Paul Ryan and her adversary four years ago, Joe Biden. Palin said that moderator Martha Raddatz had been 'tough' on Ryan and allowed Biden the run of the conversation. This Tuesday our country’s future is in our hands. What’s past is prologue. We know what we will get from a second Obama term because we’ve all endured his first term. We know how well he kept his 2008 campaign promises. Do we really believe he’ll keep his 2012 promises? Do we believe the word of a man who promised he wouldn’t raise taxes on the middle class, but then slammed the middle class with a massive tax hike in the form of Obamacare (and don’t forget that his own lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that the individual mandate is a tax)? Do we really believe he won’t raise taxes even more on every American in order to pay for his wasteful spending and his crony capitalism? Do we believe that the same president who increased the debt in his first term by more than all the first 41 presidents combined will suddenly decide to cut the deficit in his second term? Do we believe that the president whose reckless spending led us to the first credit rating downgrade in our nation’s history will suddenly become a responsible fiscal manager if we reelect him? Do we really believe that a president who promised us that job creation was his number one priority despite month after month of dismal job numbers now has a credible 'plan' for the job growth that eluded him for the past four years? Do we believe that the same president who shut down the Keystone Pipeline and blocks domestic oil and natural gas development at every turn is somehow going to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and lead us to energy independence? Do we really believe that our country’s national security is safe in the hands of a president whose administration denied security and assistance to our consulate under attack on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on America, and then blamed that consulate attack and the death of our ambassador on a “spontaneous” protest over an obscure YouTube video despite all the real time evidence to the contrary? Do we believe that a president who was caught on a hot mic telling the Russian president that he would have “more flexibility” after his reelection is being honest about his plans for a second term? We know what we will get from a second Obama term. We will get the same failed policies. We will get Obamacare locked into law without any chance of undoing this dangerous legislation and any chance to seek real patient-centered health care reform. We will get a debt crisis. We will get more inflation and higher gas prices. We will get tax increases. We will get fewer jobs. We will get more small businesses collapsing under the weight of higher taxes and unfair regulation. We will get more corruption and crony capitalism favoring the Obama administration’s friends. We will get less domestic energy development and increased dependence on terrorist sponsoring foreign regimes for our energy needs. We will get a “blame America first” foreign policy that bows to our enemies and snubs our friends like Israel and leaves America and the world less safe. We will get less opportunity and security for ourselves and for our children. In 2008, Barack Obama promised to fundamentally transform America. And for all his failures and broken promises, that’s the one thing he has delivered on. He’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of anxiety. It doesn’t have to be this way. Tuesday is our chance to turn things around. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have offered a credible alternative to Barack Obama’s failed policies. Governor Romney understands how the free market works. His pro-growth economic policies will benefit all Americans. He has promised to move us toward energy independence, deficit reduction, and responsible entitlement reform that honors our commitment to our seniors and keeps faith with future generations. Governor Romney deserves a chance to lead. President Obama had his chance. He’s failed, and we can’t afford to go backwards. We must also remember the many good Republican candidates who are running for the House and Senate this year. They deserve our support as well. If you are like me, you have watched these campaigns, learned about the candidates, and know where they stand despite the skewed lens of a partisan media bent on keeping liberal leadership in power. We saw the destruction a Democrat controlled White House, House, and Senate brought us after the 2008 election. Our country can’t afford that again. Your vote is the only safeguard against that happening. On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states. Voting is our duty and our right. We must never forget the immense sacrifices generations of Americans, including our brave men and women in uniform today, have made to give us this right. And we must never forget the duty we owe to generations of Americans yet to be born to exercise our right to vote prudently. The White House and control of the Senate is in the balance in this election, and every vote will count. I firmly believe it is our responsibility to restore this country and secure the blessings of liberty and prosperity for our children, just as it was secured for us. This is our sacred duty to the past and to the future. We will succeed in this so help us God. God bless you and God bless America. With an Alaskan heart, .

"By . James Chapman and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:35 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 7 November 2012 . Investigation: Home Secretary Theresa May has announced a new investigation into child abuse in North Wales in the 70s and 80s . A single wide-ranging judicial inquiry into ‘absolutely horrific’ evidence of systematic child abuse by figures of authority over several decades looked increasingly likely last night. There were growing cross-party calls for an over-arching investigation as the number of separate probes into allegations of paedophilia at the BBC, care homes and in Whitehall reached double figures. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs that the National Crime Agency (NCA) is to mount an investigation into alleged abuse in North Wales in the 1970s and 1980s amid claims that a senior Tory of the day was among the perpetrators. But she suggested that a single, wider probe was being considered by the Government once initial police inquiries are concluded. ‘I think what is absolutely horrific, frankly, is the extent to which this child abuse has been taking place over the years and across our communities over the years,’ the Home Secretary said. David Cameron, speaking on a trip to the Middle East, also opened the door to a broader judicial inquiry into the tide of historic child sex abuse allegations which began with revelations about Jimmy Savile’s paedophile activities at the BBC. ‘Let’s find out as quickly as possible whether we have a problem here. If we have a problem here then we have to take further steps,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘I don’t rule out further inquiries,  further investigations, further ways of learning lessons because clearly we’ve discovered some appalling things in recent days, particularly on the Jimmy Savile front.’ On top of the Savile scandal – which has dragged in the NHS and the police – there are increasingly wild allegations of an establishment paedophile ring involving members of the Thatcher government. NCA director general Keith Bristow will review the original police handling of complaints of a paedophile ring abusing children in care homes in North Wales, and examine the latest claims by an alleged victim. Separately, High Court judge Mrs Justice Julia Wendy Macur is to lead a review of the Waterhouse Inquiry, an inquiry set up by the then Welsh Secretary William Hague, into allegations of child abuse at North Wales care homes. Scroll down for video . Quick move: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured meeting students at a Saudi Arabian university yesterday, said he wants a swift investigation into whether the rumours are true . ‘The Government is treating these allegations with the utmost seriousness,’ Mrs May said. ‘Child abuse is a hateful, abhorrent and disgusting crime and we must not allow these allegations to go unanswered.’ Former Conservative children’s minister Tim Loughton said the Prime Minister had acted ‘commendably swiftly’ but there were now so many inquiries into child abuse, there was a serious danger of not being able to see ‘the wood for the trees’. He called for one, over-arching investigation, adding: ‘This is just getting going, this is the tip of the iceberg, this is going to get bigger and it’s going to go into other areas. ‘We’re getting an inquiry a week. There are now victims out there whose voices are only beginning to be heard. 'I think we have just got to have one over-arching, robust inquiry led by a high-level figure.’ Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson, who last month claimed there was ‘clear intelligence’ suggesting a historic paedophile ring may be linked to Downing Street, criticised the Government’s response. He said: ‘The lesson of Hillsborough and hacking is that a narrowed-down investigation is the basic building block of a cover-up. ‘To limit this inquiry to North Wales and Savile would, in my view, be a dereliction of the Home Secretary’s duty.’ In . a direct attack on Mrs May, which drew cries of protest from the . Conservative benches, he asked: ‘Does she sincerely want to start making . amends or can she live with being what she has just announced: the next . stage of a cover-up.’ n The child protection system in England is failing vulnerable teenagers and is in urgent need of review, MPs warn today. The . Commons Education Committee said that while local authorities had a . duty to safeguard all children up to the age of 18, too often the needs . of older youngsters were not met. It said its inquiry uncovered a . ‘worrying picture’ of the protection and support available to children . aged 14 to 18.

Found alive: Georg Luxi's disappearance sparked a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters . A German multimillionaire with dementia who vanished without trace two years ago has been found alive with a new wife and stepson - who now stand to inherit his vast fortune. Georg Luxi disappeared from his home in Deggendorf, Bavaria, on December 15 2010, sparking a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters Eveline, 61, and Gabrielle, 55. But when the women finally found him,  say the only contact they have had with their father since his reappearance has been through his new wife, Christa, and her son, Joseph. The new family claims he is happy in Austria and has demonstrated his love for them by signing over all of his property and wealth to them - including giving them access to his bank accounts. Now, in a legal first in Germany, Eveline and Gabrielle have filed a lawsuit against Christa and Joe, whose surnames do not appear on court papers, claiming embezzlement and false imprisonment. They claim the mother and son effectively kidnapped their father - who they say suffers from Alzheimer's Disease - and brainwashed him into leaving them all his money. They now want him returned to Germany where they say he can get the care and supervision he needs. The retired entrepreneur, who made his fortune in the fruit wholesale business, had several million euros in his bank . accounts as well as seven luxury properties in Germany. Mr Luxi is said to have met Christa after the death of his first wife. A sports-car enthusiast, he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, splashing out on luxury homes across the town in which he lived. Vanished: Mr Luxi, 86, disappeared from his home in Deggendorf, Bavaria, in 2010. His new family say he is happy and does not wish to be contacted . But in around 2005, Eveline says his mind began to deteriorate, and he began forgetting basic facts about her such as what she did for a living and even her age. He had also begun a relationship with . Christa. From that point, Eveline claims contact with her father . steadily declined until it completely fizzled out. He stopped answering her phone calls and letters and even missed his sister's funeral in September 2009. Then came a letter, apparently signed by Mr Luxi, apologising for being so difficult to contact because he had been busy walking and travelling. 'If I have time, I'll write again,' he wrote. In the following months, he wrote a handful of letters, including one to cancel plans to spend Christmas with his daughters. Then his correspondence completely dried up. But, while the handwriting was undoubtedly his, Eveline and Gabrielle claim the words and phrases in his final letters appeared less and less familiar, as though they had been dictated to him. They filed a missing persons report in December 2010 and, in January 2012, a court in Deggendorf ruled him to be in 'imminent danger' and expressed 'real doubts over the honesty' of Christa and Joseph, according to newspaper Sud Deutsche. While Eveline says she has all but given up hope of seeing any of her father's fortune, she says she just wants to see him again. 'I cannot sleep, am nervous and broken,' she told Sud Deutsche. 'I am in a state of grief.' But Joseph, Mr Luxi's de facto spokesman, apparently wrote in a letter to the court: 'Mr. Georg Luxi is a staunch, former entrepreneur and does what he wants... [he] enjoys his life as a free citizen.'","Georg Luxi disappeared from his home in Deggendorf, Bavaria, on December 15 2010 .

Post-election drop: This graph shows how significantly the drop the market has felt since the Tuesday night election news . The two-day slump came in the wake of Obama's re-election to a second term as investors turned their focus back to Europe's problems and the so-called fiscal cliff, a package of tax increases and government spending cuts in the U.S. that will occur unless Congress acts by Jan. 1. Investors see it as a serious threat to the economic recovery. 'The thinking before the election was that it would remove some of the uncertainty, but it seems to have done the opposite,' said Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer at Biltmore Capital Advisors in Princeton, New Jersey.

Although New York state was a solid Democratic win in the election, the banks were big financial backers of Mitt Romney in the hope he might ease some of the onerous regulation imposed since the Great Panic of 2008 if he won. The fear is that unless Congress and the White House can deal with the fiscal deadlock before January 1 then the automatic cuts would immediately trigger a recession potentially wiping as much as 2.5 per cent of output and leading to a sharp rise in the jobless rate. Precipice: The Dow Jones plunged 300 points . Stocks are still up on the year, but well below the peak they reached in September. That was when the Federal Reserve announced a third round of its bond-buying program, which is intended to hold down borrowing costs and encourage lending. The S&P 500 is 6 per cent below its high close of the year, 1,465, which it reached on September 14. That was its highest level in nearly five years. It is still up 10 per cent for the year. Investors may be tempted to sell appreciated stock before a possible increase in the capital gains tax at the end of the year, Mr Vernon said. Tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush expire at the end of this year and the U.S. government wants to cut a $1trillion budget deficit. 'The mood of the market has certainly switched,' said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, as investors monitor developments on the fiscal cliff and wait for more clues about Obama's agenda. Investors were encouraged by two reports on the U.S. economy that came out before the market opened. Stocks initially opened up across Wall Street encouraged by figures from the Labor Department which reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 355,000 - but fell as the morning progressed. Pedestrians walk in the rain past the New York Stock Exchange: The markets in the U.S. have endured an uncertain start to trading today . One reason for this could be despite the good news from the Labor Department, officials did caution that the figures were more than likely to be distorted by Superstorm Sandy rather than a possible sign of a healing job market . But despite the shaky start to trading on Wall Street, a separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in almost two years as exports rose to a record high. The Dow climbed as much as 48 points in the morning but started to sink after the first hour of trading. The Dow fell steadily throughout the rest of the day, and more steeply in the last hour of trading. The Dow gave up 73 points in the last 40 minutes, accounting for more than half the day's loss. The Labor Department reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 8,000 last week to 355,000, a possible sign that the job market is healing. Officials cautioned that the figures were distorted by Superstorm Sandy. A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in almost two years as exports rose to a record high. There was also encouraging news from Europe, where leaders shocked markets a day earlier with a dire forecast for economic growth next year. Obama round two: 'The thinking before the election was that it would remove some of the uncertainty, but it seems to have done the opposite,' said Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer at Biltmore Capital Advisors in Princeton, New Jersey . It has been shaky running for the U.S. markets since President Obama was re-elected . European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said financial market confidence 'has visibly improved' as the 17-country group that uses the euro struggles with its debt crisis. But he said the outlook for the economy remains 'weak.' Mr Draghi spoke after the bank's governing council left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, on Wednesday slashed its outlook for growth for this year and 2013. The report helped set off a sharp decline in stocks in the U.S and Europe. Spain's government said that it had met its financing needs for the year after raising the equivalent of $6.07billion in a series of bond auctions on Thursday. Spain became the focal point of the European debt crisis earlier this year amid concern that it would struggle to refinance its debt at affordable rates. More news came from Greece, another problematic country in the fight to sure up Europe's financial concerns. Last night Greek MPs voted through the next round of austerity measures - including tax rises and pension cuts - by the narrowest of margins to secure its next bailout bonus, saving it from 'catastrophe' its Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said.","Dow closed 121 points down on Thursday, bringing two-day total to 434 .

The presenter pushed the Prime Minister for an answer, adding: 'Can I just clarify that you are saying that you didn’t call David Beckham thick?' Key replied: 'No, what I am saying is that somebody has overheard a personal conversation and that’s their recollection of it. I am just not going to engage in discussions about that.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:31 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 7 November 2012 . The traditional Whitehall civil service is being swept aside by massive spending cuts which have seen more officials fired in 18 months than in four years under Margaret Thatcher . Whitehall mandarins claim spending cuts are going too fast and have been so severe that one department judges it a success that no member of staff has committed suicide. An extraordinary report into the civil service morale reveals the ‘fragile’ state some officials say they are in after the coalition successfully cut  thousands of jobs in just 18 months. Staff involved in making cuts have been threatened with ‘physical violence’ and one department ‘viewed not having a staff suicide as a success measure’, according to the study by the Institute for Government (IfG) think-tank. In just a year-and-a-half some 54,000 staff have been cut from the civil service, more than was achieved over four years under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Last year the efficiency programme saved more than £5billion, and with savings of £8billion expected this year rising to £20billion by 2015. The report warned that coalition government could lead to ‘fragile leadership’, while any decline in staff engagement could make further change ‘extremely difficult’. ‘The experience so far has been draining for staff at all levels, it warned.Motivating staff will be ‘tough’ with many ‘seeing a bleaker future’ than when they joined the civil service. The IfG said departments would struggle to make further cuts without ‘radical new thinking’ about the way Whitehall works. Too little has been done about how ‘how change makes staff feel’ rather than just imposing ‘logical’ cuts, one official told researchers. ‘Whitehall is at a turning point; the rapid pace of change to date belies a deeper fragility and challenges ahead,’ said the report, entitled Transforming Whitehall. ‘Two out of three large change programmes fail to achieve their aims in the private sector and there are reasons to think Whitehall may fare worse. ‘Most departments have struggled to find the capacity and capability required to lead departmental reorganisation on top of ministerial and other priorities.’ The report recommended giving more responsibility to officials below the highest ranks, in order to keep reform programmes on track in the case of changes at the top. Report author James Page, said: ‘Our . study shows 17 departments have approached their cuts in 17 different . ways; some with greater success than others. They are only part-way . through and, with more cuts on the horizon, the stakes are high. ‘It's . important to take stock of what works and the major risks ahead. Departments need to find effective ways of planning for the difficult . choices and trade-offs they will face, beyond just immediate priorities. ‘It . is essential that leaders throughout Whitehall work together more . effectively across departmental boundaries to find the best options for . savings and new ways of working. ‘And, . with the danger of declining staff engagement, the onus is on leaders . to ensure the motivation and capability is there to see them through.’ Departments . should find ways to work together to deliver savings, if it proves . impossible to make more cuts solely within their own budgets. Major changes in Whitehall are being overseen by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude and head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake . A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘In May 2010, this Government inherited the biggest budget deficit in the developed world. To ensure Britain can be in the future what it has been in the past, we are acting and taking difficult decisions. ‘That's why we set up the Efficiency and Reform Group which is driving massive savings from departments and fundamentally changing the way Whitehall operates to improve efficiency through reforms and spending controls. ‘Savings of this magnitude cannot come by trimming budgets. That's why we are working to transform Whitehall into a leaner, more efficient machine that manages its finances like the best-run businesses.’","More than 54,000 civil servants have been sacked in 18 months - more than Margaret Thatcher managed in four years .

Carrie Forsythe had to have all of the insulation ripped out of the Winnipeg, Manitoba home she took possession of in September, after discovering the severe infestation. Forsythe is considering suing the previous owner to recover the costs of taking the house to pieces to clear out the mice, expected to reach tens of thousands of dollars. Co-tenants: Carrie Forsythe took possesion of her south Winnipeg home and found she was not the only occupant . Worth the price? Canadian Forsythe paid $1million for the house but did not know about the mice problem . Decisions: Forsythe may sue the previous owner who did not inform her about the problem, although he claims he did not know . The nest was discovered after she began renovating the house by opening up the walls. 'All you see is just feces and urine, just puddles and piles,' Forsythe told CBC News. 'The whole vapour barrier is just filled with this nest.' Every piece of insulation has been removed so the house can be thoroughly disinfected - and after re-insulation the vapour barrier and drywall need to be replaced. 'Now I have a shell, which I love, and it will be clean. But someone's got to help me,' she continued. A pest control expert declared the infestation the worst he had ever seen - but Forsythe did not notice anything wrong before she acquired the house she bought in May. Shaun Jeffrey said while inspecting the house: 'Oh my God! This is years, years in the making. This is not new.' Running wild: Mice infested the 5,000-square-foot home over an estimated five-year period . Mess: The rodents' faeces and urine filled the vapour barrier and made the house a health hazard . He said that it would have taken about five years to reach this level of infestation. Although Forsythe did not have the home inspected before she took possession she had been there with architects, engineers and contractors and nobody noticed anything amiss. The house's previous owner said he knew nothing about an issue with mice and confirmed he would never have sold the property if he had. Jeffrey said it is possible the owner might not have known because the walls and insulation were both thick. No inspection: Although an inspection of the house would not include a check inside the walls the problem may have been discovered . A Manitoba Real Estate Association spokesman said the matter will most likely need to be settled in court. Ari Marantz, a Winnipeg home inspector, said an infestation on this scale is rare in the city. He confirmed that although a full inspection would not include a check for this it may still have caught the mice issue. Home sweet home: An infestation of this scale is quite rare in Winnipeg, but more common in rural areas .","All of the insulation has been ripped out leaving a bill for tens of thousands of dollars .

Tough justice: Conservative North East Cambridgeshire MP Steve Barclay as he launches an online campaign demanding killer drivers receive tougher penalties . One in three convicted killer drivers escapes a jail sentence despite taking lives and devastating those of their victims’ families, damning new analysis of official Government figures have revealed. And around half escape any kind of custodial sentence if young offenders’ institutions are included in the equation. Only 1 in 10 gets a sentence of more than 5 years - and no driver convicted for a death has ever received the maximum sentence of 14 years. The analysis of official Ministry of Justice figures is revealed today by Conservative North East Cambridgeshire MP Steve Barclay as he launches an online campaign demanding killer drivers receive tougher penalties. The MP said lenient sentencing highlighted ‘a failure of the justice system’ which wasn’t working. He said the will of Parliament was being ignored by the courts because the sentencing guidelines are too weak: ‘In 2004 Parliament increased the maximum sentence from 10 years to 14 years reflected the seriousness of the offence, but sentences do not reflect this.’ He said the MoJ figures showed that in 2011 some 408 people found guilty of causing death by careless or dangerous driving. Some 211 went to prison of whom only 37 went to prison for more than 5 years. But 197 escaped prison. When  those sent to young offender’s institutes are excluded, the MP calculates that more than 150 escape prison – or more than a third of the total. The MP’s new website at  www.StopDangerousDrivers.com goes live today with a campaign video. It features the family of 22-year-old student Jamie Butcher from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, who was killed on a pedestrian crossing in the town in February last year by a dangerous driver who ran a red light at nearly twice the speed limit. Perfect family: (Left to right) Hollie Butcher, brother Jamie, their mother Tina and stepfather Stephen Green were 'the perfect family'. Jamie was killed when crossing a pedestrian crossing in February 2011 . The graduate of De Montford University in Leicester had been accepted for a postgraduate course at Manchester University just the day before he was killed instantly on a pedestrian crossing by a driver who went through the red light at 58mph – nearly twice the 30mph speed limit – in his powerful Chrysler Cruiser. Jamie's body was thrown more than 40 yards from the impact. Prosecutors said the son of a hard-working and close-knit family had left home at 4pm to walk into the town centre to withdraw £20 from a cash machine. The driver Michael Moore, 40, of . Parson Drove near Wisbech, who had previous convictions for  speeding . and burglary, showed no emotion as he was jailed this April for just 43 . months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving in the . horrific crash. But with good behaviour he could be out within two years, fear the victim’s family. The . court heard Moore had been 82 metres from the crossing when the lights . turned amber but had not braked until after hitting his victim. Judge . Gareth Hawkesworth said it was ‘a tragic case’ which had also . ‘shattered’ the lives of Jamie’s family. Killer driver: Michael Moore, 40, who had previous convictions for speeding and burglary, showed no emotion as he was jailed for just 43 months . Conservative MP Mr Barclay said last night: ‘The driver has shown no remorse since, which has been particularly painful for the family. 'The sentence means he is likely to be out of prison in less than two years. 'Jamie’s family say they received a life sentence.' Mr Barclay said: ‘Bereaved families are right when they say lenient sentences for Causing Death by Dangerous Driving are a failure of the Justice System. ‘Parliament increased the maximum sentence from 10 to 14 years in 2004, reflecting the seriousness of the offence. 'However, this has never been used, and one in three of those convicted escape jail altogether. ‘The fact tough penalties are not being used shows that the will of Parliament is being ignored. 'Judges say they are constrained by guidelines which prevent them from handing out longer sentences. ‘That’s why I’ve launched this campaign at www.StopDangerousDrivers.com to call for a change in this guidance.’ Mr Barclay added: ‘Last year 150 drivers who killed did not go to prison at all. Only 37 received more than five years. ‘No sentence can ever bring back a loved one. 'However, we can make sure that dangerous drivers who kill receive the tough penalties they deserve.’ 'Jamie’s mother Tina, sister Hollie and stepfather Steve Green say their lives have been ‘torn apart’ since he was mown down. Stepfather Steve says on the featured video: ‘Knowing that this guy with good behaviour could be let out  and joining his family in two years doesn’t seem like justice. 'For us, losing Jamie is like a life sentence.’ Jamie’s sister Hollie, 20, a veterinary nurse said: ’It isn’t fair. 'He  needs to go down for longer than that. 'People like our family are left heartbroken every day because people get too short a sentence. The family have also set up their own ‘Justice for Jamie’ website. Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive, Brake, the road safety charity, said: ‘This campaign is crucial because letting off drivers who kill with lenient sentences, or sometimes no jail term at all, implies that driving dangerously, even when it results in loss of life and terrible suffering, is only a minor transgression. 'These crimes must be treated more seriously with fitting punishments handed out.’","Conservative North East Cambridgeshire MP Steve Barclay: 'Will of Parliament was being ignored by the courts'

Family links: Hana Nadel, left, now 86, was taken in by Madeline Cornet. Her brother Leon Degrelle, right, was a leader of the Belgian Nazi Rexen movement responsible for deporting Jews to their deaths . Safe house: Hana Nadel pictured with the family who gave her refuge including Esther Madeleine, Henry Cornet, and Chana Gnazik-Erlich . Ms Nadel, who now lives in Israel, explained they had been thrown out of their Brussels home when her mother noticed a sign on Madeline Cornet's door asking for help. After ringing the bell and meeting Mrs Cornet, all three women were hired - Ms Nadel's mother became a cook and the two younger girls were housemaids. She said the couple quickly realised that she was Jewish as she had 'pretty dark skin.' Ms Nadel said she dodged talking . about the subject as long as possible, but when she was asked directly she told them of her origins. 'Yes, I was Jewish. I could no longer deny,' she said, reported De Standaard. Nazi association: Leon Degrelle once famously claimed that Hitler told him 'If I had a son, I wish he'd resemble you' Belgium had opted for neutrality during World War II and remained that way until 1940. Germany's plan to attack France, and British troops in France, would have forced it through the heavily-fortified Maginot Line along the French-German border. Instead the Nazis opted to attack via Low countries - the collective name for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg - in an operation they codenamed Fall Gelb. They invaded on May 10, 1940 and in a short but bloody series of battles the trio of countries were conquered within 17 days. Luxembourg fell first, with the Netherlands surrendering on May 14 after the devastating German bombing of Rotterdam. Belgium lasted the longest, finally surrendering to the Germans on May 27. One of the climactic battles of the war took place on Belgium soil, Battle of the Bulge in Ardennes lasted from December 16, 1944 until January, 28, 1945. 'You're safe here,' was the reply. 'I have broken with the fascism of my brother.' It was then Ms Nadel discovered the connection her employer had to Degrelle, but she was told she would be safe at the house as they did not share his views. But the reminders were still present - in the . children's playroom a portrait of Degrelle was hung on the wall and . the trio hid in the basement when anyone they felt threatened by . turned up at the house. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Ms Nadel's mother even occasionally cooked gefilte fish for the family's guests which included Belgian fascists. She advertised them to her guests as 'oriental fish,' so they would not know she had hired a Jewish cook. Degrelle was most famous for founding Rex, a Belgian fascist political movement with a close relationship to German's Nazi party and Italian fascists. He joined the Wehrmacht and later the Waffen SS. After the war he fled to Spain and became active in Neo-Nazi publications. He would frequently appear wearing a white uniform featuring his German decorations, and spoke of his 'thinking bond' with Hitler. Asked if he had any regrets about the war, his reply was: ""Only that we lost!

Bristol was the fifth most heavily bombed British city of World War II. The presence of Bristol Harbour and the Bristol Aeroplane Company made it a target for bombing by the Nazi German Luftwaffe who were able to trace a course up the River Avon from Avonmouth. At 6pm on 24th November 1940 Bristol experienced its first Blitz lasting six hours. Coventry had been badly bombed just 10 days before the Bristol Blitz. This raid had been widely reported in the newspapers. The government did not want to lower public morale. Between 24 November 1940 and 11 April 1941 there were six major bombing raids. In total 1299 people were killed, 1303 seriously injured, and 697 were rescued from debris . 89,080 buildings  were damaged including 81,830 houses destroyed. On 3rd January 1941 Bristol was hit by bombing yet again with the raid lasting nearly 12 hours and during it a 4,000lb bomb was dropped on Knowle. This bomb did not explode and the people of Bristol called it Satan. It was made safe and was included in the 1945 London victory parade. Bristol was the fifth most heavily bombed British city of World War Two. Experts believe the plane was bought for a youngster who was never able to play with it and died during the bombing. The camouflaged monoplane is one of only three made by iconic British toy manufacturers W. Britain. William Britain Senior turned his hand from brass maker to toymaker in 1893, and pioneered the use of lead-casting toy soldiers.

Now the . multi-millionaire, who donated almost £500,000 to the party this year, . has infuriated his North London neighbours by applying to erect a . seven-bedroom house, complete with a gym, gallery, circular fountain and . garden pavilion, on the site of his current home. Locals accuse Mr . Rosenfeld of trying to make a ‘quick buck’ by imposing  a ‘totally . alien’ design that would destroy the character of the area. The . row is embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who has made a series  of attacks . on the destructive behaviour of ‘predator’ capitalists. Mr . Rosenfeld, 50, a married father of four, returned to London last year . after spending five years as a tax exile in Switzerland – during which . time he added to his estimated £100 million fortune by making  a . £21 million profit on a Geneva mansion. The businessman then bought the . two properties within a conservation area in London’s wealthy Highgate . for a total of £14.7 million. Hypocritical: Ed Miliband says he is on the side of struggling families yet one of his most senior advisers, Andrew Rosenfeld (right) wants to demolish his £8.5million house and rebuild it as a mock-Jacobean mansion . Mr Rosenfeld embarked on the redevelopment after an architect’s report concluded that the £8.5 million house was ‘a rather ordinary example of a late Victorian house, probably built on a limited budget’. Neighbours, including Labour’s former London Deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron, have objected to the council. ‘The proposals are out of scale and character with this street within the conservation area and would be seriously detrimental  to its character,’ said Ms Gavron. Another neighbour, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ‘We think he will spend as much again  on the house, £8 million, and sell  it for between £20 million and £25 million, giving him a profit of between £5 million and £9 million – which makes his donation to Labour seem like quite small beer. But at  what cost to our local heritage?’ Extravagant: An architect's drawing of the house Mr Rosenfeld intends to erect in the place of his North London house . Mr Rosenfeld has angered his neighbours with his plans to build a seven-bedroom house with a gym, gallery, circular fountain and garden pavillion . In his response to the complaints, Mr Rosenfeld has written in a letter to the council: ‘There seems to be a suggestion or implication from some quarters that we have not engaged in proper consultation nor responded to comments and observations made by those with whom we have spoken and represented. We commenced the consultation process around a year ago. ‘What we have sought to do is take what we consider the best aspects in the conservation area and apply a level of quality and detailing that is rarely achieved.’ Mr Rosenfeld declined to comment.","Andrew Rosenfeld bought £6.2m house next door as temporary residence .

It is set to be the ultimate hotel for football fans - just yards away from one of Britain's most famous stadiums and complete with its own rooftop pitch. But former Manchester United footballer Gary Neville has clashed with his old club over plans to construct the building in the shadow of the club's Old Trafford ground. The England veteran already has planning permission for a 139-bed hotel and supporters' club, but has now submitted amendments which include the 16m by 12m artificial area. A local council planning committee will tomorrow consider the plans for the rooftop area, which would have a retractable canopy, bar and TVs and raise the height of the 10-storey building 1.9m higher than previous drawings. Gary Neville has submitted plans for a 10-storey, 139-bed hotel with a rooftop football pitch at Old Trafford . Manchester United have already objected to Neville's development, on the grounds that it would obstruct views of their stadium’s east stand. In a report to the council, the club said: 'The tall landmark building would obstruct key views towards the stadium’s east stand. 'The east stand is the principle elevation and forms a highly visible focal point on approach to the stadium and any development proposal that fails to acknowledge the stand’s significance as a consequence of inappropriate scale and massing should not therefore be accepted.' At odds: The former Manchester United player has clashed with the club over the hotel development . In May Manchester United lodged a stinging five-page objection letter against the hotel, leisure and retail complex. They claimed the development has insufficient parking and say that even if those issues were resolved, ‘MUFC shall continue to oppose and object to the proposed scheme due to its impact on the Old Trafford landscape, highway safety and the club’s holistic vision for the continuing enhancement of the area surrounding the stadium’. Manchester United have refused to comment on plans for the artificial pitch. A new planning application has also been submitted for two giant LED advertising screens on the side of the hotel. The Sky Sports pundit and Daily Mail . columnist is no stranger to planning battles, having recently secured . permission for a 'Teletubby' eco-home in rural Lancashire. Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine had to be dropped, but developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power Neville's house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West. It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and solar panels. Last month, the former United captain spoke at a conference in Manchester about his involvement in the hotel industry. Eco-home: Neville recently secured permission for a carbon-neutral house in the Lancashire countryside . Changes: The green development was only approved when Neville dropped plans for a wind turbine . He said: 'It’s like when I made my debut for Manchester United - I don’t know what’s going to happen. But in the same way - if you’ve got good people around you, you feel like you can succeed.' 'I’m excited because it will be my first foray into the world of hotels. I’m really looking forward to it. I want to deliver and achieve something.' Neville said he did not want to comment on the revised plans.

The body of a teenage boy has been found in a ditch in Yorkshire by police searching for a 13-year-old who disappeared from the area at the weekend. Lewis Eddleston, 13, has not been seen since he left a group of friends on a playing field just a mile from his home in the village of Edenthorpe, near Doncaster, on Sunday afternoon. Police said it was too early to confirm the identity of the body, which was found today in a ditch a mile from where Lewis was last seen in the village, but officers are linking the discovery to the search for the missing schoolboy. Lewis was playing on the field on Sunday when he asked his friends to look after his mobile phone while he went to the toilet. He never returned. A . South Yorkshire Police spokesman said today: 'Police can confirm that . the body of a young male has been found in a ditch close to The . Boulevard, Edenthorpe, Doncaster.

She said: 'He has never done anything like this before - it is totally out of character. 'We had had a lovely family bonfire on Saturday night and there were no problems at home or at school. 'Worried sick': Lewis' mother Diane had made an emotional appeal for her son to return home . 'We just want to know he is safe, we have no idea where he is or what has happened and we are worried sick. 'I just hope he sees this and gets in touch to let us know he is OK.' There had been no news of Lewis' whereabouts since Sunday, although there had been unconfirmed sightings of the schoolboy in the Balby area of Doncaster. The family's neighbour Royce Lambert, 49, said news of the discovery had rocked the estate. 'People are devastated,' he said. 'He was a great kid, your typical 13-year-old boy. I had to tell him off a few times for climbing on my garage but that's just what lads his age do.' The retired Royal Marine said: 'My thoughts are with the family. 'It's been hard for them while he has been missing but this news is truly heartbreaking. 'Nobody knows what's happened to him yet, whether it's been an accident or something else. 'I just hope they find out as quickly as possible - for the sake of the family if nothing else.' Police have erected a cordon around the scene where the body was found at Hunger Hill Lane, an area locals said was used mainly by dog walkers and youngsters using it as a short-cut to school.

A 12-foot crocodile in your path would be scary at the best of times but this one proves it can tower over any human who visits its watering hole. As menacing as the predator looks standing on its hind legs, the huge reptile is considered sacred by the local people in Bazoule village in Burkina Faso, West Africa and is simply reaching for the live chicken being dangled before it by the locals. The relationship between villagers and Nile crocodiles mean that the animals are tame enough to allow people to walk amongst them and even hold their tails. Hind leg horror: This Nile crocodile shows off his ability to stand on its hind legs to reach for a live bird on a stick being fed to it by villagers . Using a long stick to dangle a live birds in front of the crocodiles, locals encourage a few of the most acrobatic, clever and hungry crocodiles to stand up on two legs to snap up their food. British IT manager, Gavin Chapman, 34, from London captured this extraordinary sight while on holiday with his family. He said: ‘We were led down to the water's edge by two local guides with only a stick for protection. ‘There were around 15 crocodiles sunbathing about five feet from where we were walking with no fences. Make it snappy: Villagers have a close relationship with Nile crocodiles believing them to be sacred and encourage them to jump for food . ‘One guide held a chicken attached to a stick via some string. It was flapping around making a lot of noise. ‘One croc stood up briefly and with two snaps and it was gone. Then we were invited to touch the croc's tail. ‘After about an hour or so our time . came to an end, but by this time we were surrounded by crocodiles, we . felt like we were on an Indiana Jones set. ‘We literally had to pick our way through crocodiles to get past, luckily not one even flinched.’ Mr Chapman’s sister-in-law, Kate Speller from Mildenhall, Suffolk, bravely held the tail of one of the giant predators.

Tourist Gavin Chapman said: 'in two snaps it was gone' Mr Chapman said: ‘Katie was very apprehensive about it but showed great bravery in performing this act. ‘She had to take a wide angle of approach as you can’t walk past the head. ‘She approached very slowly as you would expect. ‘The crocodile didn't even flinch and acted as if she wasn't there.’ Nile crocodiles are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and reaching 500 pounds, they feed on various animals from fish to young hippopotamus. With the special care and attention from villagers, crocodiles in the area live up to 45-years-old. Mr Chapman said: ‘The villagers believe that the fortunes of the villages are linked to the survival of the crocodiles and vice versa. ‘When a crocodile dies they get buried in the villager graveyard just like a human being. ‘They are seen as part of the village as are any of the local people.’ Linked to locals: Using just a stick for protection, villagers are able to walk among the crocodiles.

John Bercow today added to the list of government ministers who will not be sending him a Christmas card when he launched a prolonged attack on Anna Soubry's 'totally unacceptable' behaviour in the Commons. Ms Soubry, appointed a health minister in the reshuffle, became the latest figure to be slapped down by the Commons Speaker, as tensions between the government and Mr Bercow reached a new  low. Mr Bercow bellowed at Ms Soubry three times in just 90 minutes, branding her behaviour in the Commons as ‘totally unacceptable’. Commons Speaker John Bercow told health minister Anna Soubry her views were not relevant . He also made clear it would not let matters rest there, saying he would be ‘speaking to others about the matter’. Mr Bercow has repeatedly fallen out with Tory ministers, notably clashing with transport minister Simon Burns – who once called him a ‘stupid, sanctimonious dwarf' - and Cabinet minister Patrick McLoughlin during his time as chief whip. A former Tory MP, Mr Bercow won the Speakership with the support of Labour MPs and has appeared to be at war with his former party ever since. Ms Soubry was first rebuked during a . raucous session of Prime Minister's Questions, with Nick Clegg standing . in for the absent David Cameron. Ms Soubry, an outspoken former TV presenter, was appointed a health minister in September's reshuffle . She was sitting on the backbenches, enthusiastically heckling Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman. But Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘I know that the junior minister in the back row thinks that her views are relevant. ‘I'm not interested, I don't want heckling, what I want is for the question to be heard and it can be heard with courtesy.’ But the row flared up twice later during a health debate, when Ms Soubry was sitting on the Government's front bench. Mr Bercow accused her of ‘conducting a running commentary’ during the debate and said: ‘I don't want to hear the sedentary chuntering and the finger wagging and all the rest of it.’ Ms Soubry, an outspoken former TV presenter, sought to argue. But Mr Bercow was having none of it, telling her that ‘she can say pooh if she wants’ but she had to ‘accept the ruling of the chair and either behave or get out of the chamber’. In the third clash, Mr Bercow made sure that the Government's duty whip was aware of his views about Ms Soubry, who was attempting to argue with Labour MP Kerry McCarthy from her seat on the front bench. He told Ms Soubry: ‘Perhaps she'll have the courtesy to listen when she's being spoken to from the chair. ‘It is not acceptable for any member of this House to treat this as a private conversation between him or herself and the member on his or her feet.’ He went on: ‘It is totally unacceptable behaving this way and it will stop straight away. ‘I hope the whip has noticed it and I will be speaking to others about the matter.’","Commons Speaker says the minister's views are irrelevant and brands her behaviour 'totally unacceptable'

A wealthy English businessman who inherited a picturesque Scottish island has given it back to the locals as a gift. Fred Taylor, a restaurant owner currently living in London, was given ownership of the Outer Hebridean island of Scalpay off Harris in 1998 following the death of his father John. Residents voted to take over the running of the island yesterday after the offer of the land for free. Picturesque: The island of Scalpay, off the Isle of Harris in the Outer Hebrides has been given to the islanders for free . Mr Taylor - who owns a family home on the island and has been a frequent visitor - offered . the gift to its 322 residents and . encouraged them to take control of their own destiny. Islanders sanctioned a community ballot and voted 197-8 in favour when the ballot closed on Tuesday. It is the largest 'gifted' community land acquisition in Scotland. Ballot papers were sent out to around 250 islanders who were eligible to vote. Fred Taylor's father, John, was a London-based architect and bought the island in 1976 from Sir Hereward Wake. The late Mr Taylor and his wife Sue used to bring their dog Tilly to the island twice every year. When he died in 1998, it was passed on to his son Fred, along with the nearby island of Sgeotasaigh, or Scotsay, which his father bought in 1965, and where his family also spent their holidays. Fred plans to move to the island of Scotsay permanently after building a property there. Now the residents on the small island of Scalpay - spanning 2.5 miles long - have avoided struggling to raise a purchase price as their only expense is legal fees. The inhabitants have decided to join in . partnership with the neighbouring community-run North Harris Trust - . which was subject to a taxpayer-funded £2.2m buyout in 2003 - in . managing Scalpay. Islanders had been told that the island is at risk of eventually being transferred to another organisation as Mr Taylor 'does not wish for the status quo to continue indefinitely.' The 60 residents who attended a recent . public meeting were told of the potential to regenerate Scalpay - which . has a high elderly population. Fred Taylor offered the gift to its 322 residents and encouraged them to take control of their own destiny . The island’s population of 320 has almost halved since the 1970s and 80s. Western Isles MSP, Alasdair Allan, welcomed the result of the ballot. He said: 'I believe that this opens up new opportunities for an island which knows that it needs new economic development.' Paul Finnegan of Scalpay Community Land Transfer Steering Group, said there were regeneration plans for the island including the old school building which closed in June after its roll fell to just four pupils. He said: 'One suggestion that has come forward is to use them for business units for small craft workshops.' 'We’ve already identified three people who live on Scaplay who are keen to take them on.' Sandra Holmes from Highlands and Islands Enterprise outlined what could be achieved. Boosting tourism, developing fisheries and installing wind turbines are ideas being considered. Finlay MacRae, secretary of the Scalpay Community Land Transfer Steering Group, said that Scalpay was unlike any of the other community buyouts who had to fight and raise money to buy their land. He said: 'We are unique in that sense. The recent meeting was very positive.' The island is officially owned by the Taylor family trust, the Sue Taylor Settlement Trust. Fred is the sole trustee and he is also offering give away the glebe park adjacent to Scalpay Lighthouse and the former Ministry of Defence tracking site, both owned by him. Fred Taylor's father, John, was a London-based architect and bought the island in 1976 from Sir Hereward Wake. He used to bring his wife Sue and their dog Tilly to the island twice every year . In the 1970s Scalpay was an important fishing community but the fleet has since declined and there are little job opportunities on the island. The isle boasts a strong network of community organisations and has a recently-opened community run shop and cafe, mini-bus service and a community centre. In 1997 the island - which once had a population of 600 - was joined to neighbouring Harris by a £6.4m bridge. There also used to be a salmon factory which was a major local employer from 2001 until closure in 2005. But Scalpay could become a significant centre for yachts visiting the Western Isles if plans go ahead to take the island into community ownership, says a feasibility study carried out by consultants. The report highlights that the principal attraction of the island is the historic Eilean Glas lighthouse and there is potential to upgrade the footpath to it as well as creating an improved coastal round-island walk. Mr Taylor told a local magazine, Island Life, in January that he had no intention of cutting ties to the Outer Hebrides if Scalpay’s residents were to take him up on the offer of their land. He said is was intending to move to the neighbourhood permanently. He has built a home on his inherited island of Scotsay. The property is a new eco-friendly, off-the-grid home complete with rainwater collectors and a wind turbine, where he intends to live full time. In his interview in Island Life, Taylor said that he was looking forward to being part of the local community, and has many friends on the island of Harris. Island aristocrat: Count Robin left a £1million island, Little Bernera, to the National Trust of Scotland but had his gift rejected . He told the magazine that despite Scotsay being a private island it does not have to feel remote, as it’s just an 8-10 minute boat trip from Scalpay and Harris – more like 'having a wet driveway,' he said. It was reported that Taylor sees great potential for Scalpay. He has considered prospective renewable forestry and energy projects, and one of his ideas for regenerating of Scalpay’s industries is to create an offshore lobster hatchery to replenish its fishing grounds. He told the magazine he had many fond memories of the place. He said: 'I spent a lot of time there when I was a kid. 'It seemed like we were going to the ends of the earth and that was what was so exciting about it.' Meanwhile, earlier this week a flamboyant aristocrat who left a £1million island to the National Trust of Scotland had his gift rejected. Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, whose bed-hopping, colourful life was said to be the model for James Bond, wanted to leave ownership of Little Bernera off the coast of the Isle of Lewis to the nation, but in a rare decision the NTS rejected the offer. The conservation charity said they rejected the island because Little Bernera is not 'significant' enough to warrant the cost it would take to keep.","London restaurant-owner Fred Taylor inherited the island from his father .

Neil Prescott, of Crofton, Maryland, was wearing a T-shirt that read 'Guns don't kill people. I do,' when first confronted by officers on Thursday, police revealed today.

The threats were made multiple times in separate phone calls this week, and investigators who searched the 28-year-old's apartment this morning found several thousand rounds of ammunition and about two dozen semi-automatic rifles and pistols. The arsenal of weapons included one assault rifle, two shotguns, nine handguns and three rifles, according to the search warrant.

Teri's approach to her daughter's career was heavily criticised, and she was accused of exploiting Brooke during her early years. She first signed on her daughter, whom she once described as looking like a 'beautiful doll', to pose for an Ivory Soap ad at just 11 months. It launched a child modelling career that would include campaigns for Breck, Band-Aids and Colgate. Teri famously raised eyebrows when she allowed her then 11-year-old to be cast as a child prostitute in 1978's Pretty Baby. Mourning: Brooke, pictured here looking strained while walking her dog in New York on Sunday, has not commented on the news of her mother's death . Difficult relationship:  The 47-year-old has previously spoken out about her mother's . domineering ways and her alleged alcohol problem, but the two were . reunited in recent years . The controversial period piece was set . in a New Orleans bordello and Brooke had a nude scene and filmed scenes . in which her character lost her virginity. Teri also arranged for a photographer to take naked pictures of Brooke when she was 10. A few years later, she permitted 15-year-old Brooke to famously star in a series of commercials for . Calvin Klein jeans, provocatively professing that nothing comes between . 'me and my Calvins.' Defending her decision to allow Brooke . to star in Pretty Baby, Teri told an American TV show a few years . after its release: 'They see total innocence, which is totally there. Criticised: Teri Shields raised eyebrows when she allowed her then 11-year-old to be cast as a child prostitute in 1978's Pretty Baby . 'Nothing comes between me and my Calvins': Brooke starred in the advert at the age of 15 . 'And two, they have the sexy child too, they have the sexy person - that appeals to them.' In the same interview Shields also said that people who accused her of exploiting her child were jealous. For her part, Brooke said at the time: 'It's only a role. I'm not going to grow up and be a prostitute.' The Blue Lagoon star's bond with Teri showed strain early on. In an article written on the pair when Brooke was 12, People magazine wrote: 'Occasionally the intimacy between mother and daughter turns into anger. Estranged: The . relationship between mother and daughter became strained as . Brooke grew up and wanted independence; their estrangement thawed in later years . It reported that Brooke complained: . ""Oh, Mommy, you're so dumb!"" to which Teri snapped back, ""I don't have . to take that crap!"" before storming out of the room. The relationship became even more tense when Brooke hit her twenties and wanted to . start taking control of her own affairs. They parted professionally in 1995, with Brooke describing the move as 'the hardest thing.' She told Rolling Stone the following year that 'something didn't feel right.' 'I had hopes and dreams, and I wasn't . doing anything to go toward them,' she said. 'The focus was on creating a . persona rather than a talent.' Proud: . Critics suggested Teri exploited Brooke after she . controversially allowed her to play a child prostitute with a nude scene . in Pretty Baby when the actress was only 12; the two are . seen in 1989 . Shields reflected in 1996 that she was proud of her daughter for taking control of her life and career. 'I felt that she had to be on her own. It kills me once in a while. I would like to get over it,' she said in . an interview on TV's Extra. 'I would love for Brooke to be my best friend, but you can't because I am her mother and she is my daughter.' In mid-Nineties Brooke accused her mother of being an alcoholic. She told the New York Times: 'I grew . up in an alcoholic household. I’m the caretaker who wants to make . everything better, and you can just do that for so long, or so I’ve been . told.' Beauty: As Brooke hit her twenties she wanted to manage her own career; the pair are pictured in 1981 . But eventually their relationship thawed and by the time of Teri's death the two were long reconciled. Theresa Anna Lillian Shields, nee Schmon, was born on August 11, 1933, in Newark. She passed away in Manhattan, New York, last Wednesday,  according to Jill Fritzo, a spokeswoman for her daughter. The New York Times reported the elder Shields died following a long illness related to dementia. Shields worked as a hairstylist, a make-up artist for Lord & Taylor and a model. She married Francis Alexander Shields in 1964, who was  23 to her 30, and Brooke was born the next year. The pair divorced a when Brooke was just a few months old.

Jenny Taylor decided to have a preventative mastectomy to significantly reduce her risk of cancer . A woman who discovered she had the breast cancer gene has spoken out about why she decided to have both breasts removed. Jenny Taylor's story echoes that of former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne who has revealed she underwent a double mastectomy after learning she carried the gene. Like Sharon, Mrs Taylor from Orpington, Kent, had the operation because she couldn’t bear to live under the shadow of cancer. She said: ‘I applaud Sharon for talking about her mastectomy. Our stories are very similar. Like me she’d had a breast augmentation before finding out she carried the gene. 'We were both healthy at the time but didn’t want to spend our lives worrying about getting cancer. It has not been easy but it was the best decision I ever made.’ The 46-year-old mother of two Jenny discovered she carried the faulty gene in 2009 after her father Ozzie had been treated for breast cancer. He’d needed a mastectomy and after 12 months of chemotherapy, made a full recovery. As her grandmother had also died of the disease aged 55, Mrs Taylor, a receptionist, was invited for screening tests to see if she carried the faulty gene. She said: ‘I had always wondered if there was a link but when the letter arrived offering me a test I was terrified.’ At the time, she was just seven months away from marrying her fiance Ricky Taylor, 46. Tragically, he had been widowed when his first wife Kay died of cancer aged 45. She said: ‘I was frightened about having the tests, but as well as my own two children I owed it to Ricky and his sons to find out if I carried the gene or not. He had already lost one wife to cancer. I was not going to let him go through that again.’ Mrs Taylor took her father with her for the tests and waited 14 days for the results. Mrs Taylor underwent testing for the breast cancer gene after her father Ozzie developed it. Tests revealed she had an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer . She said: ‘It was horrendous. I would have nightmares about cancer and tumours every night and checked my breasts for changes every day.’ Finally the consultant called her with the results. Jenny said: ‘She asked me to come in but I begged her to tell me on the phone. When she said it was positive and I had a gene that gave me an 85 per cent increased risk of breast cancer I was stunned. ‘I was crying as she explained having a double mastectomy would dramatically reduce the risk. ‘Initially it felt like an awful choice to make, lose my breasts or risk my life. I’d had a boob job nine years earlier and took great pride in my figure, but then I thought about Ricky’s wife Kay and how she had never been given that chance. ‘I started to see it as blessing, I had been one of the lucky ones. The test had given me a chance to save my life.’ Mrs Taylor with her husband Ricky. The couple were due to wed seven months after she received the devastating news, and she delayed surgery until after the wedding . Later she explained to her fiance that a double mastectomy would reduce her chances of getting breast cancer to just 10 per cent, lower than the average person's 15 per cent. ‘I knew I wanted to have the operation and Ricky wholeheartedly agreed with me. My only concern was having the surgery before my wedding.’ Having already bought her strapless dress, she didn’t want to risk not being fully recovered in time for her big day. So she spoke to her consultant about delaying the mastectomy until after her wedding day and honeymoon. ‘I told the specialist the date and they agreed it would be fine as long as I checked for any changes in my breasts every day. ‘Deep down I admit I wanted to enjoy my wedding and honeymoon with my breasts. A tiny part of me feared I was risking my life just to look good on my wedding day, but my consultant agreed the risk was minimal over such a short space of time.’ After their wedding in July 2009, the couple spent two weeks in the Caribbean. The couple married in July 2009 and Mrs Taylor underwent nine hours of surgery to remove her breasts in January 2010 . ‘I wore my bikini every day, it was almost like saying goodbye to my breasts,’ she said. After several postponements, she was finally admitted to hospital for the nine-hour operation to remove both her breasts in January 2010. Mrs Taylor had hoped to have reconstructive surgery at the same time, but after the mastectomy she was told the skin had been too tight to insert the implants during the operation. Instead, surgeons needed to start a procedure to stretch the skin using saline sacs. She later had reconstructive surgery but her implants failed and had to be removed. She is now hoping her reconstructive surgery will be complete soon. She said: ‘It’s been hard but I don’t regret my decision for a minute. 'I don’t have to live under the shadow of cancer and losing my breasts is a small price to pay to live without fear. ‘My daughter Ashley turns 18 next year and she will have the screening test to see if she carries the gene. 'She has already told me if it’s positive she wants the mastectomy and I would support her every step of the way. ‘Sharon Osbourne talking about this only helps to make the decision easier for other women. But like she said, it’s not brave, it’s simple. We want to be around to see our families grow up.'","Jenny Taylor, 46, discovered she carried the faulty gene after her father had been treated for breast cancer .

A disgraced university dean on trial for using her students as personal servants was the prime suspect in the execution-style murder of her first husband, it has emerged. Dr Cecilia Chang, 57, has been accused of embezzling more than $1 million from St John's University, where she worked as dean of the Asian Studies Center, and using students as her personal servants. But it has now emerged that her first husband accused her of being responsible for his murder as he lay dying in hospital. Disgraced: Dr Cecilia Chang, 57, has been accused of embezzling more than $1 million from St John's University. It has now emerged her dying husband accused her of being responsible for his murder . According to the New York Daily News, Ruey Fung Tsai — known as 'Johnson' - asked for a piece of paper from detectives as he lay in the intensive care unit at  Elmurst General Hospital after being shot three times in his back. He was unable to talk because he had a tube running down this throat. 'He wrote that his wife was responsible: ""My wife did this,’” a source told the newspaper. It is also alleged that Tsai told detectives of Chang's business dealings with Donald Manes - a former Queens Borough President who committed suicide in 1986 amid a corruption scandal. The murder of Tsai still remains unsolved. Detectives were unable to further question him about his claims before he died on July 31 in 1990. He was shot as he arrived at his business premises in Bushwick, Brooklyn, 11 days earlier. According to police records, after arriving at work at about 9.30am, a young Asian man walked up to him and opened fire. 'Servant': Peiyi Gan was worried she would lose her scholarship if she didn't comply with the dean's demands . The gunman did not take anything and fled into a nearby subway station. Following the murder, Chang - then a rising star at St John's - was questioned as the prime suspect but said she did not know anything. Her home was even placed under surveillance. But despite the claim of her husband, police were unable to link her to the murder. When asked to comment on the claims, Chang, who has remarried twice, said: 'My lawyer says I am not supposed to answer any questions.' A foreign exchange student at St John's University previously told a court that she was treated like a servant by Dr Chang - and said nothing because she feared her scholarship would be taken away. Peiyi (Tracy) Gan, a Chinese national, did laundry, cooked and cleaned for Dr Chang. Miss Gan said that she acted as a maid for Chang and her family at their home in Jamaica . Estates, Queens, New York and often endured verbal abuse from Chang's son Steven. She was also required to hand-wash the disgraced university dean's underwear. Under the scholarship program at St John's, students are required to give 20-hours service to the school each week. Taking advantage: A former St. John's University student previously testified that she cooked, cleaned and did laundry for Dr Chang because she feared losing her scholarship . Miss Gan, now 31, had come to the U.S. to study in 2004 - and began working for Chang seven days a week. She continued for four years until she had completed her Master's degree. As well as taking out the trash and mopping floors, the young woman cooked for the family - who often insulted her meals. Miss Gan was also forced to create . fake financial statements allowing the disgraced dean to claim thousands . of dollars from the school, according to the New York Post.

Starlings swoop and swirl in unison creating a dramatic cloud in the evening skies . The birds migrate to Britain and stay until February before returning to the continent as the climate warms . Starlings have returned to Gretna for many years at winter after their summer migration for one of the largest gatherings the country . The fantastic display is known as a 'murmuration' and the starlings normally head to Gretna, near the Scottish border, in November. Over summer there are 170,000 to 300,000 breeding pairs but over winter the Scottish population of starlings swells to two million to three million. The birds will stay until February before flying back to continental Europe for the spring and summer. Neil O'Donnell, of the RSPB in South and West Scotland, said: 'When the breeding cycle is over for the year, starlings come to Britain from the continent because it is so cold on mainland Europe. 'They form these special flocks in the sky if predators are around. 'The birds are better off being in a massive flock, as this confuses the predators and also there are more eyes to look out for danger. 'During the day the birds go out to feed, then they all come back to roost in the evening. 'They feel a lot safer roosting together. They take to the sky and form a murmuration. 'The starlings base their movements on the birds around them and so this is why you do not see them bump into each other.

'They usually arrive in November and people come from all over the country to see them.

Homeowners can register their number with the Telephone Preference Service, which is supposed to put a bar on marketing calls. But Lord McNally said: ‘We at home are supposed to be on this blocking mechanism that you sign up for, but the calls still get through.’ Speaking during questions in the House of Lords, he told Baroness Gardner of Parkes that he would investigate whether international calls get round the blocking. Baroness Gardner said she received six phone calls a week and sometimes three or four a day, 'all offering me wonderful things'. Lord McNally said: ‘I know that Ofcom is very much aware of this problem. I know that it is no use me telling the noble Baroness that she can go on to this register and that Ofcom is on the job and so on, because from the noises around the room and my own experience, I know that these nuisance calls are still getting through.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director of . consumer group Which?, said: 'Our research found that people who sign up . to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) have about a third fewer cold . calls, so it is useful. But firms calling from overseas or flouting the . rules are still getting away with it. 'Despite . up to 10,000 complaints a month to the TPS, the Information . Commissioner's Office (ICO) hasn't issued a single fine for nuisance . calling. The ICO must take tough enforcement action now by naming and . shaming companies that are still calling people registered with the TPS . and fining those found breaking the rules.' Last month businessman Richard Herman won a major victory after taking a cold-call firm to court and winning compensation to a businessman for wasting his time. The 53-year-old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls. He also recorded the calls, meaning . that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him, he was . armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary. Richard Herman at his home Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey invoiced a 'cold caller' for his time and they paid up . The Ministry of Justice has set up a claims management regulation unit which is working with the Information Commissioner to investigate individual firms receiving leads or claims as a result of unsolicited text messages, and is taking enforcement action as appropriate. Labour's Lord Kennedy of Southwark said nuisance calls were a 'serious problem' and demanded to know what the government was going to do about it. 'The mis-selling of payment protection insurance was an absolute scandal, but the activities of some claims management companies are also a scandal, with unwanted text messages and phone calls.' Responsibility for tackling nuisance calls lies with media watchdog Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s office, depending on the type of call being received. The ICO can take enforcement action to stop nuisance calls and messages and can now impose penalties of up to £500,000 for serious breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. Ofcom maintains the Telephone Preference Service register which records the homes which do not want to receive direct marketing calls but the ICO is responsible for taking action against firms who breach it. Ofcom also deals with abandoned and silent calls and is currently investigating energy firm npower and phone and broadband company TalkTalk. The watchdog could issue fines of up to £2million. An Ofcom spokesman said: 'All organisations are banned from cold-calling consumers who are registered with the TPS unless a consumer has given the company their express permission to do so. We are concerned that consumers are still receiving unsolicited sales or marketing calls, despite being registered with the TPS. 'We would encourage all affected consumers to complain to the TPS who will contact the companies involved requesting that they remove the consumers’ numbers and will also send details of those complaints to the ICO, as the body responsible for taking enforcement action against companies who break the rules.' Former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss also called for spam emails about PPI to be investigated. 'I get an enormous number of e-mails every day, generally about PPI but about a whole lot of other things, too. 'They all seem to be done at about three in the morning. E-mails are just as serious; I spend such a lot of time just deleting all these e-mails on a daily basis.'","Justice Minister Lord McNally says he has registered to not receive cold calls but it has not worked .

Unfortunately, it seems Denzel Washington's portrayal of a fully-functioning alcoholic pilot in the new film Flight isn't going down well with everyone. Brewer Anheuser-Busch has asked Paramount Pictures to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from scenes of the movie showing Washington's character drinking the beer while in the cockpit. And the distributor of Stolichnaya has made a similar request - despite the film already showing in American cinemas and grossing £15.7m in its debut weekend. Sobering: Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic pilot in the film Flight, which opened in American cinemas last weekend, but some drinks companies are not happy with the portrayal of their products . Washington's character frequently drinks Vodka throughout the film, with several different brands represented. But William Grant & Sons, who distribute Stolichnaya in the United States, said it did not license its brand for inclusion and would have refused permission if asked. James Curich, a spokesman for the company, said the company had a strict code for how their vodka was portrayed in films and wanted to market it responsibly. 'Considering the subject matter of this film, it is not something in which we would have participated,' he said. Alcoholic: Washington plays pilot Whip Whitaker in the Paramount Pictures film, a drunk pilot who is forced to make an emergency landing on a supposedly routine flight between Orlando and Atlanta . Rob McCarthy, vice President of Budweiser, said his company had not been contacted by Paramount or the production company of director Robert Zemeckis for permission. 'We would never condone the misuse of our products, and have a long history of promoting responsible drinking and preventing drunk driving,' he said. 'We have asked the studio to obscure the Budweiser trademark in current digital copies of the movie and on all subsequent adaptations of the film, including DVD, On Demand, Streaming and additional prints not yet distributed to theatres.' A spokesman for Mr Zemeckis referred questions to Paramount, which did not return a message seeking comment. Bottle it: Anheuser-Busch, the brewer of Budweiser, has called for all logos to be obscured or removed in the film Flight. Washington's character is seen drinking Budweiser at the controls . Regrettably for the drinks companies, experts say there's little they can do about it legally. 'Trademark laws 'don't exists to give companies the right to control and censor movies and TV shows that might happen to include real-world items,' said Daniel Nazer, a resident fellow at Stanford Law School's Fair Use Project. 'It is the case that often film-makers get paid by companies to include their products. I think that's sort of led to a culture where they expect they'll have control. That's not a right the trademark law gives them.' Jay Dougherty, a professor at Loyola Law School, said the use of brands in films had generally been protected by the courts, even when the companies are not pleased with the portrayals. 'It wouldn't have been effective as film if we used a bunch of non-generic brands,' said Prof Doughterty, who is also the director of the school's Entertainment & Media Law Institute. 'In a normal situation, if the alcohol were just there as a smaller part of the movie, they might have created an artificial brand for it.' Other vodka brands, including Absolut and Smirnoff, are also included in the film. Representatives of those companies did not return messages seeking comment.","Character played by Denzel Washington drinks beer in the cockpit in hit movie, which made £15.7m in first weekend at the box office .

Case rejected: Footballer Ched Evans lost a challenge against his conviction for rape . Footballer Ched Evans has lost a challenge against his conviction for rape. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker had his case rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. Today’s ruling was made by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Griffith Williams. The 23-year-old was jailed for five years in April for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room. Evans denied the offence but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court of raping her at a hotel in North Wales in May last year. He admitted having sex with her but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, 23, who also admitted having sex with the victim, was found not guilty of the same charge. Lord Judge, rejecting the conviction challenge by Evans, said: 'We can see no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury, which heard all the evidence and reflected on it after careful summing up by the judge.' The judges also threw out a bid by Evans to have his sentence reduced. The news comes as nine people who illegally named the victim were told to pay her £624 each in compensation. The nine, who included a woman teacher, posted messages on Twitter and Facebook accusing the 19 year old of being a ‘money-grabbing slut’ who had made up the attack. Some are on benefits and will be able to pay the debt off at £6 a week – denying the teenager full compensation for two years. Justice: The Royal Courts of Justice where the sentence from April this year was upheld . The teenager is said to have been traumatised by the heated online discussion after Ched Evans was convicted in April of raping her the previous May. The nine posted the messages about her with ‘deliberate malice’ after the 23-year-old Wales and Sheffield United striker was jailed for five years for the hotel room assault. The defendants appeared at Prestatyn Magistrates' Court in North Wales charged with publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case. Star: Evans was an established striker with . Sheffield United (pictured scoring against Swansea City) - and some of . the people involved in naming the rape victim were Blades fans . They claimed not to know that identifying a rape victim was a criminal offence. The judge told the offenders they had identified the victim, some with abusive comments and others with ‘deliberate malice’. He added: ‘You did so without proper knowledge of the facts and without any heed of the feelings of the victim. ‘Your actions have revictimised this . woman again. It is not for you to take the law into your own hands as . you did. In my view you best atone for what you have done by paying . compensation.’ He ordered them to pay a total of £5,616 in compensation as their only punishment.","Striker had his case rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London .

Costly: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza cost the taxpayer almost £1million in legal fees during his eight-year fight against extradition . Legal cases involving hate preacher Abu Hamza cost taxpayers almost £1million. The hook-handed extremist, who was finally kicked out of the country last month, benefited from almost £680,000 in legal aid money from the public purse. In addition, the Home Office spent nearly £250,000 on lawyers in its efforts to get him out. The scale of the fanatic’s abuse of legal aid, revealed by freedom of information requests, caused outrage last night. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling ordered an immediate review, saying: ‘We must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer. ‘The total costs in some cases seem very high, and many – myself included – will question whether they provide value for money. ‘I am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system. I have ordered an immediate examination of aspects of the system that affect its credibility with the public. Legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system, but resources aren’t limitless. It should be reserved for cases where there is genuine need.’ Hamza was put on a plane to the US last month after the last of countless legal appeals was finally thrown out of court. Freedom of information requests by the Mail reveal that Hamza’s lawyers were paid £445,452.65 to defend him against charges of inciting terrorism. Legal costs in his eight-year fight against extradition cost a total of £165,460.81. Hamza was also given legal aid worth £68,107.33 to fight attempts by the Home Office to remove his passport, a case he won. Review: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now ordered a review into the legal aid system . 'Deteriorating health': Abu Hamza asked the High Court to grant him time for an MRI scan as he renewed a long-running legal battle to halt his extradition from the UK to the US . Charges: Imam Abu Hamza al-Masri, pictured addressing his followers near Finsbury Park mosque, north London, in March 2004, now faces terror charges in America . The total expenditure included more than £400,000 for Hamza’s solicitors, Arani and Co, and more than £100,000 for one of his barristers, Edward Fitzgerald QC. The Home Office spent £79,728 on legal costs for the extradition case, and another £150,674.91 in its efforts to strip Hamza of his passport and citizenship. It means the total legal bill for taxpayers was £909,423.70. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The cost of booting out this vile hate preacher has been tremendous. Taxpayers appear to have been the last ones in anyone’s thoughts during Hamza’s drawn-out but ultimately futile legal fight.’ Radical: Hamza faces 11 counts of criminal conduct connected to the kidnapping of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998 . Hooked-handed: The Egyptian-born preacher, pictured here in 2007, lost his hands and left eye after . a mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan . In the dock: Hamza, pictured with his lawyer Jeremy Schneider, pleaded not guilty to terror charges in a New York court last week . When his extradition case came back to court for the final time last month, Hamza claimed he was unfit to face terrorism charges in the US because ‘harsh’ conditions at HMP Belmarsh had left him depressed. But after a three-day hearing, Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, said he was ‘wholly unpersuaded’ by these claims, adding that ‘the sooner he is put on trial the better’. After the verdict, Hamza was flown to New York, where he is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan. He is accused of involvement in a hostage plot in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. He also faces charges of setting up a terror training camp in Oregon.

James Nash, 21, used false documents to attend Mount Pleasant High School under the alias Javier Jones and turned out five times for the Oilers football team. His deceit was uncovered following a tip-off by a concerned parent and Nash was immediately removed from the school district and could now face prosecution. Deception: Mount Pleasant High School in Michigan, where 21-year-old James Nash conned his way onto the school football team with forged documents . Eager to play football: Nash faked a birth certificate and other documents to claim he was 17 and played four games for the Oilers football team . And because he was overage by at least three years in the school's team, the Oilers could be forced to forfeit two of their victories. The school's athletic director Jim Conway was still trying to work out why Nash would con his way back into school just to play football. He said: 'He just fit in with all the other high school kids, with the 16-, 17- and 18-year-old kids that belonged there. There were really no red flags. 'Anytime you're duped or lied to, if you will, there's some frustration that comes with that. When it comes to something like this - and integrity issue - that becomes difficult to swallow.' Nash claimed he was a 17-year-old senior who was seeking a transfer from a school in Lansing and had forged documents to this effect. Top player: Nash, who used the alias Javier Jones, seen on the ground making a tackle in this Oilers game . No athlete older than 19 is allowed to compete at high school level and when an anonymous parent flagged up their concerns, the school immediately reported the alleged violation to the Michigan High School Athletic Association. Nash competed in the final four games of the season, winning two, and if the league decide to expunge the two wins earned with him in the line-up, Mount Pleasant's record will drop from 4-5 to 2-7. The rest of the squad are reportedly furious at the news. 'Earlier this week we dug up his file, the police became involved and all the school officials, and found documents had been altered and forged,' Conway told The Morning Sun newspaper. 'There was a couple days of investigation, looking into that and what we have found is this individual is not the individual that was on the transcript. Bemused and angry: The Mount Pleasant athletic director Jim Conway was shocked to discover Nash's real identity . 'What we found is he exceeds [the age requirement]. You can't be 19 prior to September 1 to be eligible. He was older than 19 on September 1. 'The student has been removed from Mount Pleasant Public Schools.' School Superintendent Michael Pung said Nash had slipped through the cracks: 'Well I think we're kind of the victim of the circumstances. 'We had all this documentation on file that we would ask for if any student were to come to our district and enroll. 'We had a birth certificate, we had a transcript, and we had residency information all filed with us, and it was an excellent job of forging.' The school is now working with a liaison officer, who is sending the information on to the Isabella County Prosecutor.","James Nash faked documents using the alias Javier Jones to con his way into Mount Pleasant High School in order to play for the Oilers football team .

During the sickening attack he blindfolded their daughter with a Hello Kitty apron and promised her a 'chocolate' but then raped her. The teenager walked free from Cambridge Crown Court earlier this year and still lives a few doors away from the child he abused. Devastating: The young girl, who was raped by a 14-year-old boy (pictured being held by her parents) - whose appeal to get the attacker's sentence changed has failed . The victim’s parents understood he would . receive a three-year custodial sentence – but he was let off with a . community order instead after a judge blamed 'the world and society' for . his porn addiction. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth sparked outrage by deciding he should not go to prison, instead giving the rapist a three-year community order. The girl's devastated parents claimed the judge's comments had 'cheapened' their daughter's ordeal and said they would appeal. Spared jail: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth (pictured) warned the boy that he . would have been jailed for six and a half years if he had been four . years older - but blamed 'the world and society' for his porn addiction . But the Attorney General has now confirmed the appeal will not be allowed to go ahead because the case was 'difficult to sentence'. It concluded that the Court of Appeal would not regard the sentence as 'unduly lenient' and the case will not progress further. The victim's mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons- said they are 'angry' and 'disappointed'. She said: 'It is coming up the anniversary of the attack we don't wish to drag it all up again. 'Now the decision has been made, we can not appeal, we are now going to move on with our lives. 'It is disappointing, but as ever our priority is our little girl and her happiness - we just have to move on. 'We want to keep her life normal, we don't want to reinforce the memory and we want her to remain as content as she is now. 'We hope it doesn't effect her relationships in later life.' The abuse took place at the girl's Cambridgeshire home in December last year - the first time her parents had let the teenager babysit the girl alone. They trusted him to watch her for a couple of hours in return for £10 pocket money and said he was a quiet but 'normal kid' who they completely trusted. But when they got home the victim's Dad was getting her ready for bed when she revealed the babysitter had played a game, promising to reward her with chocolates. She explained how he had covered her eyes with her Hello Kitty apron and 'put his willy in her mouth'. The victim's tearful mum blasted Cambridge Crown Court for letting the attacker walk free - when he lives just a matter of doors from their family home. Professionals who dealt with the sick teen advised the Attorney General that the best way of addressing his behaviour was by educating him within the community. Walking free: The teenage rapist's addiction to porn led to the judge giving him a community order . His progress and whereabouts will continue to be monitored by police for the next two and a half years. A sex offences prevention order was also made for five years, stating he must not access or seek to access pornography of any kind and must not use any mobile devices or computer without suitable filters to prevent the viewing of pornography. The offender - who at the time of the case appeared in the dock in his school uniform - was told he had only been spared six-and-a-half years in jail because he was still a minor. The Solicitor General may have concluded against appeal but he did promise that the babysitter's period of supervision will be 'tough' and 'challenging' and will 'force him to address his behaviour'. A spokesman for the AGO said: 'Following complaints from the victim's family as well as members of the public, the former Solicitor General, Edward Garnier QC MP asked the Crown Prosecution Service to send the case papers to him for review. 'After very careful consideration of all the factors in the case, he decided not to refer it to the Court of Appeal as he did not believe they would increase the sentence.'

A bus driver who was fired for being a member of the BNP has won a long legal battle claiming his dismissal was a breach of his human rights. Arthur Redfearn, 56, was sacked from his job in Bradford, West Yorkshire, where he drove mainly Asian adults and children with disabilities. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled today his employer Serco Ltd dismissed him only because of his membership of a political party. This breaks Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the Freedom of Assembly and Association, the chamber of the court ruled. The seven judges came to this conclusion on a 4-3 majority. The court said neither passengers or colleagues had complained about Mr Redfearn, who was considered a ‘first-class employee’ before his BNP membership became public knowledge. ‘The Court was struck by the fact that he had been summarily dismissed following complaints about problems which had never actually occurred, without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role,’ it added. The court ruled that right to freedom of association must apply to everyone, not just those whose views are considered favourable or inoffensive, but also ‘those whose views offend, shock or disturb’. BNP leader Nick Griffin tweeted: . ‘HUGE VICTORY! Human Rights Court in Strasbourg rules sacking of BNP . councillor as bus driver was illegal. Congrats to Arthur Redfearn.’ He added: ‘Way now clear for . all others similarly treated to claim well-deserved compensation. Great . day for true democracy!’ Delighted: BNP leader Nick Griffin called the outcome a 'huge victory' and added it was a 'great day for true democracy' Response: BNP lead Nick Griffin tweeted his congratulations to the former bus driver . The court heard how Mr Redfearn worked for Serco as a driver from December 2003 until his dismissal on June 30, 2004. In its judgment, the court said there had been no problems with his work but other employees and trade union complained after his BNP membership was revealed in a local paper. He was summarily dismissed when he was elected as local councillor for the BNP. In August 2004 he lodged a claim of race discrimination which was dismissed by an employment tribunal which found that any discrimination against him had been on health and safety grounds. Ruling: Arthur Redfearn won his case at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg where judges voted 4-3 . Affiliated: Arthur Redfearn was dismissed because he was a member of the BNP, which is led by Nick Griffin (pictured) The tribunal found his continued employment could cause considerable anxiety among Serco’s passengers and their carers and there was a risk vehicles could come under attack from opponents of the BNP. In July 2005 Mr Redfearn successfully appealed against this decision after an appeal tribunal heard no consideration had been given to any alternatives to dismissal. But, in May 2006, the Court of Appeal allowed Serco’s appeal, finding that Mr Redfearn’s complaint was of discrimination on political and not racial grounds, which fell outside anti-discrimination laws. He was also refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The Strasbourg judgment also criticised the fact Mr Redfearn could not bring a case of unfair dismissal against Serco in 2004 because UK law said he had not worked long enough for the firm. The driver was forced to claim race discrimination because no unfair dismissal claim was allowed within the first year of employment. The court said the UK had to ‘take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect employees, including those with less than one year’s service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion or affiliation, either through the creation of a further exception to the one-year qualifying period under the 1996 Act or through a freestanding claim for unlawful discrimination on grounds of political opinion or affiliation’. The judgment added: ‘A legal system which allowed dismissal from employment solely on account of an employee’s membership of a political party carried with it the potential for abuse and was therefore deficient.’","Arthur Redfearn was sacked from his job driving a bus in Bradford, West Yorkshire .

A teenage troll who made a series of depraved sexual comments about five-year-old April Jones on Facebook has been handed a suspended prison sentence. Sam Busby, 18, walked free from court despite being told that another Facebook user was locked up for three months for an 'almost identical' offence committed last month. Instead, he received a six-week jail term suspended for 18 months. Busby, a call centre worker from St John's, Worcester, was arrested by police after posting grossly offensive remarks on the social networking site on the day a man was charged with April's murder - just five days after her disappearance in Machynlleth, mid-Wales. He pleaded guilty last week to a . charge of sending an indecent and offensive message brought under the . 2003 Communications Act. During the case, Worcester Magistrates Court heard he posted on his page: 'All these April Jones jokes are getting old, unlike her.' When challenged by another user, who said his comments were 'too soon', he responded with a tirade of vile remarks about April. Prosecutor Kerry Lovegrove told the court Busby's initial post on Facebook was a 'joke' about April obtained from another website. His inappropriate comments prompted one woman who has two young daughters to contact West Mercia Police. Ms Lovegrove said: 'She felt so shocked and sickened that she reported the matter to the police. 'She states that she was distressed by the comments as she herself has two young girls. 'The defendant was later interviewed where he admitted posting the joke. He admitted that he had further put the offensive comments. 'He told police he was an immature teenager and it was an attempt to get attention.' Busby also told officers he thought they could only be seen by his friends on Facebook.

'They are at court today but he is so ashamed of what he has done he’s asked them to stay outside the court room. 'His parents and brothers don’t know what he posted on Facebook but they know it must be bad. 'When he posted the initial joke it was a joke he had found elsewhere on a joke website and momentarily he thought it was funny. 'He is extremely immature. Anybody with any sense of maturity would have left it at that. Stupidly he didn’t, he continued the responses. 'He’s extremely sorry, he’s extremely ashamed. He can’t believe the extra stress he would have caused the family of April Jones.' Passing the sentence, magistrates said they had . taken into account Busby's early guilty plea and remorse. After . retiring to consider the appropriate sentence for more than 40 minutes, . chairman of the bench Gill Porter told the teenager: 'You will realise . by the time we have taken to discuss this matter how seriously we view . it.

'Our goal is to complete the lifecyle, to rear enough adults to produce more eggs, and then rear a second generation.

Housekeeper, Cresentia Ragonton is accused of stealing a £100,000 painting from Italian financier Giuseppe Ciardi to pay off her debts . A housekeeper stole a £100,000 painting from an Italian financier so she could clear her debts and renovate her 'cold' house, a court heard today. Cresentla Ragonton, 58, took the ‘Study for Light’ by Ed Ruscha from the Belgravia home of Giuseppe Ciardi in central London. She tried to sell the artwork at top auction house Bonhams, with an estimated price of £80,000 to £100,000, but police intercepted the sale before it could take place. Westminster Magistrates Court heard Ragonton needed cash to clear her debts and also hoped to refit of her own home. ‘She removed the painting which was valued at the amount mentioned, and put the painting to be auctioned at Bonhams’, said prosecutor Guy Saul. ‘When she was arrested, she claimed to have debts of £15,000 and also said she wanted to renovate her house because it was very cold.’ Ragonton worked as Mr Ciardi’s housekeeper at his home in Chester Square, Belgravia, for six years, and would often look after his children, the court heard. Mr Ciardi, 59, who made his fortune as the founder of hedge fund Park Place Capital, bought the art work in New York in 2004 for $65,000. Before founding Park Place in 1992, he was a Partner in BNP’s Investment Group and Lazard Brothers’ Capital Markets Group – Global Equities. He began his career at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York in 1980. His wife Alexandra was tragically killed in 2005 when she was hit by a speed boat while on holiday in Sardinia. She was swimming to join her husband on a boat at Calle de Volpe, near to the 'millionaires' playground' of Porto Cervo. Their three children all witnessed the tragedy. The accident happened just two days after the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's £30 million, 246 ft yacht crashed into rocks off Porto Cervo, leaving three people seriously injured in hospital. Ragonton worked as Mr Ciardi's housekeeper at his home in Chester Square, Belgravia for six years and would often look after his children . Ragonton admitted stealing the painting on August 6 this year. District . Judge Michael Fanning told her: ‘This was a significant breach of . trust, you have stolen from your employer who clearly believe he could . have left you in charge of his premises. ‘You abused that trust, and had you got away with it he would have been significantly out of pocket.’ He said Ragonton would be given credit for the guilty plea and transferred her case to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing. Ragonton stole this artwork 'Study for Light' by Ed Ruscha and tried to sell it at top auction house Bonhams for up to £100,000 . Ragonton’s barrister, Temi Johnson, said she had been in the UK for several years, and lived with her children who are in their 20s at her home in Canning Town, east London. ‘She has been here for a number of years, and worked for Mr Ciardi for six years’, she said. ‘She has no previous convictions, has never been arrested, and it appears this was a one-off incident.’ Ragonton, (right) said she stole the painting, from Mr Ciardi (left) to clear her debts of £15,000 and to . renovate her house because 'it was very cold' Ms Johnson added there was ‘no actual loss’, because the painting was recovered before it could be auctioned off. Ragonton, dressed in a purple checked jacket with her hair tied back, spoke during the brief hearing to confirm her name, age and address. She was released on condition bail to sleep every night at her home address and not to apply for a passport or travel documents. Ragonton, of Sheppard Street, Canning Town, east London, admitted one count of theft. She will be sentenced on a date yet to be set.","Ragonton had worked for Italian financier for 6 years .

Miss Ciobotaru was so badly injured in the attack she had to have an operation on her nose and was off work for one month, Southwark Crown Court was told. Badea claims she lashed out because Miss Ciobotaru called her a 'whore' and a 'pervert' and bad-mouthed her family. Giving evidence Miss Ciobotaru, who no longer works at the club, said Badea became angry she was taking her customers last February. She said: 'She told me ""You do money, I do money as well"". 'She told me she was going to wait for me outside. She said she will punch me.' Miss Ciobotaru said she told the manager who offered to walk her home, but she decided to go alone as she was tired and was then set upon by Badea. The alleged victim said that when she called police Badea tried to take her phone and told her: 'Police won't do anything. I am a woman.' Both women worked at the French Pussycat club in Soho at the time of the alleged attack in February . Badea claims Miss Ciobotaru, who she previously allowed to live with her for two weeks when she had nowhere to stay, screamed at her 'I will f*** your mother' in their native Romanian. Sharmila Salvi, defending, said this was one of the worst things you could say in their language and was particularly offensive to Badea as her mother had abandoned her when she was just two weeks old. Miss Ciobotaru said the attack had left her scared to go out and that Badea had threatened to get someone to follow her.

Former Manchester United star Gary Neville has clashed with his old club over plans to build a hotel with a rooftop pitch. The England coach already has planning permission for a 139-bed hotel and supporters' club in the shadow of Old Trafford, but has now submitted amendments which include the 16m by 12m artificial area. Trafford planning committee will meet on Thursday to consider the plans for the rooftop area, which would have a retractable canopy, bar and TVs and raise the height of the 10-storey building 1.9m higher than previous drawings. Gary Neville has submitted plans for a 10-storey, 139-bed hotel with a rooftop football pitch at Old Trafford . Manchester United have already objected to Neville's development, on the grounds that it would obstruct views of their stadium’s east stand. In a report to the council, the club said: 'The tall landmark building would obstruct key views towards the stadium’s east stand. 'The east stand is the principle elevation and forms a highly visible focal point on approach to the stadium and any development proposal that fails to acknowledge the stand’s significance as a consequence of inappropriate scale and massing should not therefore be accepted.' At odds: The former Manchester United player has clashed with the club over the hotel development . In May Manchester United lodged a stinging five-page objection letter against the hotel, leisure and retail complex. They claimed the development has insufficient parking and say that even if those issues were resolved, ‘MUFC shall continue to oppose and object to the proposed scheme due to its impact on the Old Trafford landscape, highway safety and the club’s holistic vision for the continuing enhancement of the area surrounding the stadium’. Manchester United have refused to comment on plans for the artificial pitch. A new planning application has also been submitted for two giant LED advertising screens on the side of the hotel. The Sky Sports pundit and Mail on Sunday . columnist is no stranger to planning battles, having recently secured . permission for a 'Teletubby' eco-home in rural Lancashire. Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine had to be dropped, but developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power Neville's house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West. It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and solar panels. Last month, the former United captain spoke at a conference in Manchester about his involvement in the hotel industry.

Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington state legalized gay marriage last night in historic shift on the controversial issue. The three referendums, combined with Minnesota voting down a constitutional amendment banning same-sex matrimony, mark the first time supporters of 'traditional marriage' have ever lost at the polls. All 32 previous times the issue has come before the people - weather banning it or legalizing it - voters have chosen to define marriage as between one man and one woman. Six states allow gay couples to wed, but each of those measures were been enacted either by a court decision or a vote of the state legislature. Scroll down for video . Waiting for results: Christabel Escarez, right, and Daisy Frearson, second from right - both in support of same-sex marriage - watch early election results at the Wildrose bar in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood . Vote: Since 1998, same-sex marriage has been rejected in all 32 states that have held popular votes on the issue, until the streak was broken tonight in Maine . The federal government does not . recognize same-sex marriages, but the Obama administration announced . early in his first term that the Justice Department would not enforce . the federal Defense of Marriage Act. In . the weeks leading up to the vote, Minnesota for Marriage ran a Facebook . photo campaign of Northwestern College students, who were photographed . with signs that read: 'I'm voting yes because...' with their own . personal message. Similar measures were approved in 30 other states, most recently in North Carolina in May by a wide 61-to-39-percent margin. 'The tide has turned - when voters have the opportunity to really hear directly from loving, committed same-sex couples and their families, they voted for fairness,' said Rick Jacobs of the Courage Campaign, a California-based gay rights group. 'Those who oppose the freedom to marry for committed couples are clearly on the wrong side of history.' Backing: Minnesota for Marriage started a Facebook campaign featuring Northwestern College students showing their support for a state ban on same-sex marriages . Divisive issue: In the images, students displayed a sign that read 'I'm voting yes because...' with their own personal message . The outcomes of the marriage votes . could influence the U.S. Supreme Court, which will soon consider whether . to take up cases challenging the law that denies federal recognition to . same-sex marriages. The gay-rights victories come on the . heels of numerous national polls that, for the first time, show a . majority of Americans supporting same-sex marriage. Maine's referendum marked the first time that gay-rights supporters put same-sex marriage legalization to a popular vote. They collected enough signatures to . schedule the vote, hoping to reverse a 2009 referendum that quashed a . gay-marriage law enacted by the Legislature. It passed 53 percent to 47 percent, with 272,000 Mainers voting against it. In Maryland and Washington, . gay-marriage laws were approved by lawmakers and signed by the governors . this year, but opponents gathered enough signatures to challenge the . laws. Emotion: Three young men sobbed in St Paul, Minnesota, sobbed with happiness when they learned that a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage had failed . Celebration: Gay marriage supporters in Washington State turned out to cheer as a referendum legalizing the practice passed . Maryland Gov Martin O'Malley, who campaigned vigorously for the marriage measure, spoke to a jubilant crowd in Baltimore. Those ballot proposals each passed by a 52-to-48-percent margin. Christopher Wold, 31, danced with his . partner of four years after the result in Maryland became clear. He said they would . like to marry now that it's legal in Maryland. 'It feels so good to be accepted by so many people of all different backgrounds,' he said. 'It just feels wonderful.' In Minnesota, gay marriage remains illegal, but an act of the state legislature could overturn the law. Had it become a constitutional amendment, it would have been more difficult for gay rights advocates to undo the measure. The vote was 51 percent against the ban and 48 for it. The president of the most active . advocacy group opposing same-sex marriage, Brian Brown of the National . Organization for Marriage, insisted Tuesday's results did not mark a . watershed moment. 'At the end of the day, we're still . at 32 victories,' he said. 'Just because two extreme blue states vote . for gay marriage doesn't mean the Supreme Court will create a . constitutional right for it out of thin air.' He made his remarks before the outcome of Washington's referendum became clear.","Minnesota voters reject constitutional amendment banning gay marriage .

Jose Antonio Ramos, 69, was taken into custody following his release from a northeastern Pennsylvania prison - where he spent more than 20 years for molesting children - because he failed to provide accurate information required of sex offenders, according to state police. State police did not immediately specify what information Ramos failed to supply. The 69-year-old has long been suspected in the disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz, who vanished May 25, 1979, after leaving his Manhattan home to go to a bus stop two blocks away. Mystery: Jose A. Ramos, left, was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz, right, but never convicted in connection to the case . Re-arrested: Jose Ramos, right, is escorted by police to his arraignment in Kingston Township, Pennsylvania, today after he was released from prison . It was the first time his parents had let him go off to school alone. Megan's Law - also known as the Sexual Offender Act of 1994 -  was established after the murder of Megan Kanka, from New Jersey, at the hands of her neighbor Jesse Timmendequas, a registered sex offender. It requires persons convicted of sex crimes against children to notify local law enforcement of any change of address or employment after release from custody. In 29 July, 1994, Timmendequas lured the seven-year-old into his house by offering to show her a puppy. He raped, beat, suffocated and murdered her, had sex with her dead body before dumping it in a nearby park. It was largely held that if Megan's parents knew they were living next to a convicted sex offender, she would still be alive today. Since 2004, the public has been able to view information on sex offenders required to register with local law enforcement, when previously the information was only available by personally visiting police stations and sheriff offices. Kanka's family set up a charitable foundation, the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, with the aim of preventing crimes against children. Investigators in Etan's case have long . been focused on Ramos, who had been dating the boy's baby sitter and . later served the time in Pennsylvania for molesting two other boys. Etan's disappearance prompted a . massive search that stretched as far as Israel and spawned the national . movement to publicize the cases of missing children. The blond, blue-eyed boy's photo was . among the first put on milk cartons, and his case turned May 25 into . National Missing Children's Day. His parents never moved or changed their phone number, in case he returned. In 2001, they obtained a court order . officially declaring their son dead. They have become outspoken . advocates for child protection issues. Ramos was declared responsible for . Etan's death in a civil court in 2004, but the Manhattan district . attorney's office has said there wasn't enough evidence to charge him . criminally. Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance. Earlier this year, a new suspect . named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said . he confessed this spring. His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said . Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional . evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission. Prosecutors are expected this month to . announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue . pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store . near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled . the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag. Tribute: Etan's parents never moved from their New York City apartment, pictured in May, or changed their phone number in case he returned . Empty: Police have searched new suspect Pedro Hernandez's home since he confessed but still haven't found evidence to tie him to the crime . Tipped: Police were lead to Hernandez after a resurgence in press on Etan's disappearance prompted an anonymous tip . Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance. He has declined interview requests while incarcerated, telling reporters . he may make a public statement after his November 7 release. In the . early 1980s, Ramos was arrested but not convicted on charges he tried to . lure children to a drainage pipe he was living in. New suspect: Pedro Hernandez's attorney says his client is mentally ill and has only convinced himself he killed Etan Patz . At the time of his arrest, photos of young blond boys, similar to Etan, were found in his backpack. After his release, Ramos traveled the country attending gatherings of the Rainbow . Family of Living Light, a loose collection of peace activists. Then . in the mid-1980s he again faced child molestation charges when he was . accused of luring three boys into his bus and assaulting them at two of . the group's gatherings in Pennsylvania. 'He had . thousands of dollars in 'Star Wars' toys on his bus. He had videotapes, . and he had all kinds of materials he used to lure children inside,' Barry Adams, a longtime Rainbow member, recalled last month from his . Montana home. 'It was a horrendous circumstance from A to Z.' Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Etan's father Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy?' written on the back. Earlier this year, a new suspect named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said he confessed this spring. His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said that Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission. Prosecutors are expected this month to announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag. Since his . confession, an extensive probe has found no hard evidence that could . link Hernandez to the crime and his attorney has raised even more doubts . about the case saying that his client suffers from schizophrenia, . bipolar disorder, and has heard voices. 'He either did it, or he really believes he did it,' a source in the district attorney's office told the New York Post.

A man serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of two French students attempted to construct a glider . out of fridge shelves, a mattress, coat hangers and bed sheets so he could 'fly out of prison'. The makeshift contraption, which had been cobbled together by convicted killer Daniel Sonnex, was discovered by prison officer Richard Stringfellow on June 19, 2010, Reading Crown Court heard. Sonnex was jailed for life in 2008 for the torturing and stabbing to death of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez. He was serving his sentence at HMS Lartin maximum security jail in Evesham when he launched an attack on Mr Stringfellow. The court was told that 27-year-old Sonnex, jumped on the officer's back and holding a knife, shouted:  'I'm going to slit your f****** throat.' As he was restrained by other officers, Sonnex, who had previously converted to Islam and appeared in court wearing a Muslim headdress, started shouting, foaming at the mouth and chanting in Arabic. He told the court he attacked Mr . Stringfellow because the officer had found a 'glider' he was building . out of fridge shelves, which he planned to use to fly out of the prison. Asked what his thoughts were on the . morning of the attack, Sonnex said: 'I thought agents were out to get . me, both French and British, to assassinate me. 'It was broadcasted across the TV that . me and my co-defendant were used as government scapegoats in order to . cover up the murder of students who were about to expose the bird flu . virus.' The court heard officers were searching for missing shelves from a fridge, which Mr Stringfellow found in the exercise yard. Sonnex told the court he had been . building a glider using the shelves, as well as coat hangers, his . mattress and sheets from his cell, and did not want it to be found. 'I was actually experimenting on making a glider and a shield in order to protect myself at the same time,' he told the court. 'A glider in order so I could fly from the rooftop over the wall of the prison establishment.' He said when he saw Mr Stringfellow with the 'glider', he feared he would be taken to the segregation unit and killed. 'I have heard rumours of them killing . within the segregation at HMP Long Lartin, plus I believed that they was . out to assassinate me as well,' he said. 'I thought, ‘I need to get out of here'.' Sonnex was jailed in 2010 for the murder of French students Gabriel Ferez (left) and Laurent Bonomo (right) Sonnex said he remembered nothing . after the attack until he 'came around' in the segregation unit: 'I was . screaming to Allah and crying at the same time'. Asked why he jumped on Mr Stringfellow's back, he said: 'I was just thinking, ‘I'm dead, he is going to kill me'. In a statement read to the court, . officer Andrea d'Arienzo said she heard Sonnex shout: 'I am here for 40 . years, kill me now, take me to the promised land,' while senior prison . officer Alexis Wood said Sonnex was foaming at the mouth and his eyes . were glazed. 'He was shouting, ‘I want to die, show me paradise, you're all going to die',' she said. 'He was also calling on Allah and his Muslim brothers.' Sonnex denies a charge of false imprisonment as well as one of making a threat to kill. The court was told that he admitted jumping on Mr Stringfellow and holding the knife to his throat, but that he never intended to hurt him. Sonnex, formerly of Deptford, south-east London, is now being held at high-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor and is taking anti-psychotic medication, the court heard. Sonnex said he planned to climb up the . fence, move across to the roof, and then glide some 30ft over the . prison wall. But he said the glider kept breaking up. Asked in cross examination if he really thought he could fly, Sonnex said: 'I did at the time, yes.' The court heard that Sonnex had a slew of previous convictions, many including the use of knives. In . March 2003, when just a teenager, he was jailed for a total of eight . years for stabbing someone several times, and also for firing blank . shots from a handgun during a robbery in September 2002, then pistol . whipping a member of staff. He has also attacked prisoner officers several times whilst in jail, the court heard. He . was expelled from school at the age of 12 and attended schools for . special educational needs, spent his time 'hanging about or at home'. Born . into a Catholic family, he said he converted to Islam in Long Lartin . because he had been 'fascinated' by the religion since the age of 17, . and in the maximum security prison was full by Muslims, who he described . as 'very righteous people'. Long Lartin prison in Evesham where Sonnex had started building his glider with which he hoped to fly out of jail . Sonnex, who gave a no comment interview to police about the jail attack, was put in segregation at Long Lartin afterwards, and also when he when he was moved to HMP Woodhill in February last year - spending nearly 12 months in segregation. Describing it as 'mental torture', he said: 'I went completely insane, I went nuts down there. I was messed up, I went nuts, I tried to kill myself down there, I was placed on suicide watch. I just went nuts down there, I went insane down there. 'Words can't really explain how it affected me.' Sonnex claimed he was attacked in HMP Belmarsh between June 2008 and June 2009 while awaiting trial for the double murders, and said he was verbally assaulted by officers in Long Lartin. He sought psychiatric help in February last year at Woodhill and was moved to Broadmoor Hospital in February this year.'

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 06:46 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 7 November 2012 . A species of flesh-ripping dinosaur has been named after the demonic Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings after palaeontologists classified it from just its eye-socket. Sauroniops pachytholus - 'eye of Sauron' in Greek - was identified from a single fossil fragment of part of its upper skull found in the Kem Kem region of south-east Morocco in 2007. As big as a Tyrannosaurus rex, the beast stalked North Africa around 95million years ago, according to a study published recently in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Fearsome: This artist's impression shows Sauroniops pachytholus in the background feeding on a young Spinosaurus. Scientists estimate that the creature was 40ft long . Study leader Andrea Cau, of the Museo Geologico Giovanni Capellini in Bologna, Italy, said the fossil fragment used to describe the dinosaur included only part of its skull, including an eye socket. 'The idea of a predator that is physically known only as its fierce eye reminded me of Sauron, in particular as depicted in Peter Jackson's movies,' he told National Geographic. He and his team believe the fossil fragment belonged to a new type of carcharodontosaur, a species  that includes some of the longest and heaviest known carnivorous dinosaurs. 'Sauroniops was a two-legged predator, quite similar to T. rex in general shape, although not closely related to the latter,' Dr Cau told MailOnline. Piecing together the past: The fossilised fragment of skull that Andrea Cau and his colleagues used to identify the newly discovered dinosaur . By comparing the skull fragment with fossils from related species Dr Cau's team determined S. pachytholus was 40ft long. However, . without more fossils to go on, he admitted that it was impossible to . give a precise estimate of the size of the creature. Examination . of the fossil revealed that S. pachytholus had a distinctive bump on . its forehead, setting it apart from other creatures of the same species. In their paper, Dr Cau's . team speculated that this lumpy growth may have been used in . head-butting clashes during mating displays. Jigsaw identification: This image shows how the fragment would have fitted into the complete skull of the dinosaur. A human skull is shown for comparison . The find backs up a hypothesis that there were four large species of therapods living alongside each other in that part of Africa. Others include Carcharodontosaurus, Deltadromeus, and Spinosaurus. 'Sauroniops lived along the banks of a large delta, under a hot and warm climate, very rich of fishes and crocodiles,' Dr Cau told National Geographic. 'The abundance of food may explain the abundance of predatory dinosaurs.' Dr Cau has written about the discovery on his blog.","Sauroniops pachytholus was one of four large predatory dinosaurs which lived in North Africa 95million years ago .

Controversial: French President Francois Hollande is pushing ahead with his pledge to legalise gay marriage . President Francois Hollande’s Cabinet pushed ahead with a controversial French bill that could see gay marriage legalised early next year. The move defies vocal opposition in the majority Catholic country from religious leaders, the rural heartland and the conservative opposition. The French leader’s top ministers approved the bill legalising marriage and adoption for same-sex couples and have sent it on to the legislature for debate. Gay marriage has become a contentious issue in France, where Hollande made it a liberal cornerstone of his campaign, hoping it would create a clean break from his conservative predecessor. At the time, it appeared to have the backing of a majority of the population, but it has since turned into a politically sensitive issue. Though France would become the 12th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage if the bill passes, the country of 60 million people would become the biggest so far in terms of economic and diplomatic influence. Polls show a majority of French support gay marriage, but it has divided the country’s left and right, with lawmakers from the conservative UMP denouncing the Cabinet approval Wednesday. 'It’s the end of the family, the end of children’s development, the end of education. It’s an enormous danger to the nation,' UMP Senator Serge Dassault said on the radio show France Culture. In France, a prominent conservative and former prime minister, Francois Fillon, has opposed any gay marriage legislation, and he plans to run in this month’s election for the UMP leadership. Amid the clamoring, the Socialists have decided to delay the parliamentary debate about the bill until January, knowing that it risks being modified or diluted by legislators. Divisive: Hollande's proposal has met strong opposition from religious leaders . Opposition: A prominent conservative and former prime minister, Francois Fillon, has opposed any gay marriage legislation . Elsewhere in Europe, gay politics has also come to the fore this week. On Tuesday, Spain’s Constitutional Court upheld the legality of the country’s gay marriage law, which was approved in 2005 when the country’s parliament was Socialist controlled. The court rejected an appeal contending that marriage in the constitution means only the union of a man and woman. The county’s top court voted 8-3 to dismiss the appeal filed by the conservative Popular Party. The Popular Party took power late last year after the Socialists were ousted over their handling of the country’s economic crisis.","Polls show a majority of French support gay marriage but it has divided the country’s left and right .

The 47-year-old actress, who had a troubled relationship with Teri, who masterminded her daughter's career after launching her into showbiz as a baby, says she wouldn't be who she was today if it wasn't for her mother. Heartfelt statement: Brooke Shields has released a statement following the death of her mother Teri Shields, who died at the age of 79, following 'a long illness' 'My mother was an enormous part of my life and of who I am today,"" Brooke said in a statement to People magazine. 'I loved her, laughed with her, and respected her. And although she had her share of struggles, she was my mom.' Brooke and her mother had a troubled relationship, eventually becoming estranged due to Teri's 'iron fist' approach to her daughter's career and resentment that Brooke wanted to be independent of her. In Mourning: Brooke pictured with her mother Teri in 2007; Teri died last Wednesday in New York after a long illness, her daughter's spokeswoman has revealed . Teri's approach to her daughter's career was heavily criticised, and she was accused of exploiting Brooke during her early years. She first signed on her daughter, whom she once described as looking like a 'beautiful doll', to pose for an Ivory Soap ad at just 11 months. It launched a child modelling career that would include campaigns for Breck, Band-Aids and Colgate. Teri famously raised eyebrows when she allowed her then 11-year-old to be cast as a child prostitute in 1978's Pretty Baby. Mourning: Brooke, pictured here looking strained while walking her dog in New York on Sunday, has not commented on the news of her mother's death . Difficult relationship:  The 47-year-old has previously spoken out about her mother's . domineering ways and her alleged alcohol problem, but the two were . reunited in recent years . The controversial period piece was set . in a New Orleans bordello and Brooke had a nude scene and filmed scenes . in which her character lost her virginity. Teri also arranged for a photographer to take naked pictures of Brooke when she was 10. A few years later, she permitted 15-year-old Brooke to famously star in a series of commercials for . Calvin Klein jeans, provocatively professing that nothing comes between . 'me and my Calvins.' Defending her decision to allow Brooke . to star in Pretty Baby, Teri told an American TV show a few years . after its release: 'They see total innocence, which is totally there.

In the same interview Shields also said that people who accused her of exploiting her child were jealous. For her part, Brooke said at the time: 'It's only a role. I'm not going to grow up and be a prostitute.' The Blue Lagoon star's bond with Teri showed strain early on. In an article written on the pair when Brooke was 12, People magazine wrote: 'Occasionally the intimacy between mother and daughter turns into anger.

They parted professionally in 1995, with Brooke describing the move as 'the hardest thing.' She told Rolling Stone the following year that 'something didn't feel right.' 'I had hopes and dreams, and I wasn't . doing anything to go toward them,' she said. 'The focus was on creating a . persona rather than a talent.' Proud: .

The body of an unidentified Taliban fighter allegedly murdered by five Royal Marines in Afghanistan may never be found, it emerged last night. A team of forensic scientists and military police – protected by 120 soldiers – has flown to Helmand to investigate the hugely sensitive murder claims. But the remains have still to be discovered and, even if they are, they may never be positively identified because nobody knows who he was. Heat of battle: Fighting in Helmand has pushed the Royal Marines to the limit . Details of the extraordinary search in the warzone have emerged days after the five troops won a court battle to protect their anonymity during their forthcoming trial because of ‘an immediate and real risk’ to their lives from terrorists. The Marines first appeared in court last month. They are accused of murdering a captured Afghan national on or about September 15 last year, and were charged after the discovery of video footage on one of the men’s computers, allegedly showing them discussing what to do with a gravely injured captive. It is the prosecution case that the man – whose name does not appear on any charge sheet – was subsequently murdered. The case has prompted an enormous public backlash with a Facebook campaign attracting over 100,000 supporters and protest marches across Britain demanding the charges be dropped. None of the accused can be identified after Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett this week extended an anonymity order. One protester, former Marine James Grant, 34 – a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan – said the charges against the five were unjust. He said: ‘They were doing their job in incredibly difficult circumstances. Most of our politicians have not been out to Afghanistan and can never imagine what it is like to be at war.’ Hugely sensitive: A team of forensic scientists and military police has been dispatched to Helmand Province (pictured) to investigate the hugely murder claims . Unusually, the charges were brought even though a body has not been found. In a region littered with booby-trap bombs and still infested with insurgents, it is the investigators’ task to search for it. Tribal elders have had to be asked for permission for the search to go ahead and, potentially, a body being exhumed. There is also the question of how the remains might be positively identified. Although thousands of Afghan males have been biometrically recorded to allow quick identification by troops, the biometric information may not have survived decomposition. In addition, it has now emerged that the five Marines had for several days been fighting the Taliban in a desperate life-or-death struggle, described by one comrade as ‘a daily survival lottery’. The case has focused attention too on the rules of engagement and how Britain applies the law to its servicemen and women operating under the pressures of the battlefield. The Marines were part of a Commando Battle Group in and around Nad-e Ali, a rural area of Helmand that was once the Taliban’s heartland – an area stained with the blood of dozens of UK servicemen. 'Survival lottery': More than 20 troops had died in Helmand - seven of them Marines - in the six months leading up to the alleged killing (file photo) In an area known as Death Valley, their remote checkpoint base had come under fierce attack at least eight times and patrols from it were regularly ambushed. In the six months leading up to the alleged killing last September, more than 20 troops had died in the province, seven of them Marines. The small band of commandos – between 20 and 30 men – felt isolated in their mud-walled checkpoint, and are said to have stockpiled captured Taliban guns and ammunition in case their own ran out. Morale across the Marines was dealt a . further blow with the death of a popular comrade, James Wright, 23, on . August 5 last year when a ten-man patrol was attacked by a force of . around 80 Taliban in the Shpazh Gerebian region. After . four hours the patrol managed to pull back to their base with the help . of air support and mortar fire. As is routine after a patrol, Wright had . taken off his helmet ahead of an operational debrief. It was then that the Taliban attacked again. Wright, a father-to-be, was fatally wounded in the head by a grenade. In . the following days and weeks there were more attacks in Helmand; one . base came under sustained fire for ten successive days. In mid-September . the fanatics mounted another attack on an isolated base, leaving more . than 20 Marines pinned down. It is the aftermath of this attack that is . the focus of the investigations. An . Apache helicopter was called in and was able to end the Taliban . assault. Once the fighting subsided, a gunman was found with severe . wounds and allegedly close to death. The . video footage allegedly shows Marines discussing what to do with him. Several are said to have held a vote. The filming then stops. Their . options were to treat his wounds and ensure his evacuation to Camp . Bastion or take him to their Forward Operating Base for treatment. Last . October the Marines returned home to a heroes’ welcome and, officials . say, it is likely that whatever happened would have remained secret, had . it not been for the arrest of one of the men by civilian police . investigating a completely unrelated matter. As part of that inquiry they seized his laptop, found the footage from the compound, and alerted the military. Investigators have questioned officers and fellow Marines while Afghan interpreters are being traced. The . five Marines – known only as A, B, C, D and E – face a Court Martial . and their initial appearance was behind closed doors in Bulford garrison . on the edge of Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.

A convicted murderer has been awarded nearly £5000 in compensation as the failure of Scottish courts to hear his appeal in ‘reasonable time’ was found to have breached his human rights. William Beggs, known as the ‘limbs-in-the-loch’ killer was jailed for life in 2001 for murdering 18-year-old Barry Wallace in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. A jury found Mr Beggs, 49, guilty of raping and killing the teenager before cutting up his body and dumping his limbs and torso in Loch Lomond and his head in the sea. Awarded: Convicted murdered William Beggs will be paid nearly £5,000 in compensation for 'damage caused' by his lengthy appeals process . Mr Beggs has appealed against his conviction, which will see him spend at least 20 years behind bars, a process which has taken over ten years. The European Court of Human Rights today published a ruling that awarded Mr Beggs £4,800 (€6,000) after finding that the lengthy appeals process breached the European Convention on Human Rights. Scottish courts were found to have broken article 6.1 of the convention which states: ‘In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.’ Guilty: Mr Beggs is appealing against his 2001 conviction over the rape and murder of Barry Wallace, 18 . The award is made up of £1,600 (€2,000) for non-pecuniary damage, such as pain and suffering, and £3,200 (€4,000) for legal costs and expenses. Mr Beggs has failed in previous appeals to overturn his conviction at the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court in Edinburgh. His entire appeal proceedings have lasted ten years and three months. A summary of the European Court ruling stated: ‘Although the case was complex, this did not in itself justify appeal proceedings which lasted over ten years. 'A substantial proportion of the delay had been caused by the applicant’s own conduct. ‘However, there were also periods of . inactivity where the courts had failed to take steps to progress matters . of their own motion.

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, recently took home a fat bundle of cash after receiving $401 million in company stock and selling 2% of her shares for $7.4 million. Her big reward was part of a $3.1 billion dollar payday at the company last week after restrictions on insider trading expired. Making friends: Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg talks to the press at a Seoul, Korea hotel on September 14, 2012. Passing by: Sandberg passes Google co-founder Sergey Brin, left, at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 12, 2012. 43-year-old Sandberg spent her childhood in North Miami Beach, Florida, and received her M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1995. Her first job after leaving business school was working as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company. In 2004 she married David Goldberg, chief executive of the web survey development company SurveyMonkey, after divorcing Brian Kraff, co-founder and chief executive of the web marketing company Market Hardware. Sandberg and Goldberg reside in Atherton, California, and have two children. In June 2012 Sandberg was elected to Facebook's board of directors, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. That same year she was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.

Sandberg was the highest paid employee at Facebook in 2011 with salary and stock awards earning her $30.87 million that year. Sandberg sold 339,512 of her Facebook shares at about $21.10 each on Halloween, according to Bloomberg News. She still owns 18 million shares of company stock. The big question suddenly buzzing throughout the tech community is whether Sandberg and other Facebook employees will stay at the company for much longer. Facebook workers can now pursue life-long dreams they put on hold to work there, TechCrunch notes.

Sandberg joined Facebook in 2008 and helped build it into the world’s largest social networking site worth more than $50 billion. Some estimates put her total net worth close to $2 billion. Prior to joining Facebook Sandberg worked at Google as vice president of operations and online sales. From 1996 to 2001 she served as chief of staff for the U.S. Treasury Department. Facebook’s first employees, including 28-year-old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have been at the company for almost nine years now.

A . disabled grandmother has been left distraught after ‘rude’ nurses failed to . offer her a shower or hair wash throughout her two week stay in hospital – . where she also contracted superbug MRSA. Dorothy Middleton, aged 77, has been left in fear of returning to hospital . following the shocking treatment which her family have labelled ‘absolutely atrocious’. Her daughter Dorothy Snowden, aged 54, made the claims . against Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire where she was . initially admitted for shoulder pain on June 12. Dorothy Middleton, right, pictured with her daughter Dorothy Snowdon, said she was not once offered a shower or hair wash during her two week stay in hospital . The Daily Mail has routinely highlighted the scandalous . treatment of the frail and aged as part of its long-running Dignity for the Elderly . campaign. Mrs Snowden said: ‘It was absolutely atrocious how she has . been treated. ‘There is no patient care in that hospital.’ Mrs Middleton is partially paralysed following a stroke 20 . years ago and also suffers from diabetes. Mrs Snowden claimed her mother was not once offered a shower . or hair wash and nurses banged her knee against a bed rail, but when the  grandmother complained she was told by nurses that it was arthritis. Although scans were taken of the pensioner’s stomach, knee . and hip, her daughter claims the shoulder pain was not investigated. She was also asked to bring her mother’s insulin from home . because staff were unable to access any in the hospital. Mrs Snowden added: ‘On one occasion my mum asked for a bed . pan and when she rang the buzzer the nurse came in and said “what do you want” and when mum said she wanted a bed pan the nurse said “what again?”. ‘I’m absolutely gobsmacked they can treat patients like . this. ‘When she was discharged we were told she had MRSA but she . didn’t have it when she was admitted and the staff said she’d got it there. ‘The discharge sheet also said she had no pressure sores but . she has some on her back and in her groin which is infected.’ The grandmother said: ‘Some of the nurses didn’t even sit me . up to have my meal and you can’t lie down to eat.’ On the day of Mrs Middleton’s discharge, Mrs Snowdon spoke . to the ward sister who she said apologised for the level of patient care and . admitted that the pensioner had not been offered a wash during her stay. Mrs Snowden said: ‘We have to do something because there is . going to be another patient in that bed and another, until someone does . something about it nothing will change at the hospital. Dorothy Snowdon said the ward nurses apologised for the lack of care her mother received during her two-week stay at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, Yorkshire . ‘My mum hasn’t been at all well since coming out of hospital . but she doesn’t want to go back there.’ Tracey McErlain-Burns, chief nurse at the Mid Yorkshire . Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘All complaints and expressions of concern are taken . seriously and arrangements are in place for matron to meet with the family to . answer questions and provide an explanation. ‘Following that meeting I am confident that matron will take . the necessary steps to ensure that any lessons are learnt.’ The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly Campaign has . pressed for better standards in hospitals and care homes since 2002.

The twins’ mother, Shellie Tucker, . has kept a blog documenting her daughters’ progress, and just hours . after the surgery was completed, she revealed her joy at the successful . operation. 'Today it is a . time to celebrate, to be thankful, to appreciate, to praise, and to . enjoy this weight lifted off our shoulders,' she wrote. 'The . surgery went better than expected.

Together: The Tucker family only learned something was wrong at the 20-week ultrasound, left . The family now hopes Allison and Amelia will be able to return home in time for their first Christmas. Shellie had previously written of . the family's struggles on the blog. She wrote how she married her husband, Greg Tucker, in 2009, and had issues getting pregnant. After . having their first son, Owen, she wrote: 'Our chances of having a . second baby was very slim. We tried month after month with no success.'

'At this point, it's in the . surgeons’ hands.We just have to hold our breath and hope and pray God . listens to our thousands of supporters. We will be okay. We will be . strong.' But the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia said the girls were 'excellent candidates for separation'. Officials said the surgery will be the 21st separation of conjoined twins performed at the hospital. Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births, and most are stillborn. About three-quarters of such twins are female and are joined at least partially in the chest, sharing organs. Family: Shellie married Greg Tucker, who works in the Army, in 2009 . Sibling rivalry: The girls have an older brother, Owen . Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, the hospital said. A year ago, conjoined 20-month-old twins from the Dominican Republic were separated at a Virginia hospital. Maria and Teresa Tapia were attached at the lower chest, and surgical teams successfully divided their liver, pancreas and other shared organ systems and reconstructed their abdominal walls. A few days before that, 2-year-old twin sisters Angelica and Angelina Sabuco from San Jose, California, who were joined at the chest and abdomen, were separated in procedures performed at a California hospital.","Allison and Amelia Tucker born joined at the lower chest and abdomen .

Not guilty: A judge has ruled that Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger did not break any laws when he reduced a manslaughter sentence for a political ally's son . A Sacramento County superior court judge ruled Friday that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't break any laws when he cut the manslaughter sentence for the son of a political ally just hours before leaving office last year. Judge Lloyd Connelly called Schwarzenegger's decision to reduce Esteban Nunez's sentence from 16 years to seven years distasteful and 'repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state,' but within his executive powers as governor. Nunez is the son of the governor's onetime political ally, former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez. Esteban Nunez pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in a 2008 attack on an unarmed group of young men after he and some friends were turned away from a fraternity party in San Diego. Three others pleaded guilty to various charges in the attack that killed 22-year-old college student Luis Santos. Santos' family and the San Diego . district attorney sued, claiming that Schwarzenegger violated the . voter-approved Marsy's Law, which requires families be notified about . cases involving their loved ones. 'The . attorney general's office fought for corruption, and they won,' said . Kathy Santos, Luis' mother, outside court. Disappointment: Kathy and Fred Santos, the victim's parents, expressed their upset after the ruling on Friday describing Schwarzenegger and Nunez as conniving politicians . 'They defended a backroom . deal, you know? They got away with it for today, but we're very . disappointed. Where's the justice for our son? He was murdered. Two . conniving politicians got away with it.' The family said the judge's words were not enough. They want the reduced sentence for Nunez thrown out. Connelly sided with the attorney general's office in ruling that Marsy's Law does not specifically address the governor's power of pardons and commutations, which may have been an oversight when it was drafted. He said that other laws cited by the plaintiffs' attorneys also did not place a specific obligation on the governor to notify the family or the district attorney, even if that had been the practice in Schwarzenegger's office for other pardon and commutation applications. Political pop: Former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez's son was one of several men convicted in the 2008 slaying of an unarmed 22-year-old college student . 'Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion,' Connelly said. 'This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state. ... It is outside the normal realm, the normal circle of fundamental justice.' But, he said, it was not illegal. San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said her office will appeal the judge's decision. The Santos family said they were considering their options. Schwarzenegger said in his commutation notice that he believed the sentence was excessive given Nunez's 'limited role in the killing.' He said evidence showed that Nunez's friend delivered the fatal blow, yet both men received the same 16-year-sentence. The former governor told Newsweek in April 2011 that his office made a mistake in not notifying Santos' parents, but he defended the decision, saying: 'I mean, of course you help a friend.' Dumanis and attorneys for the Santos family said Schwarzenegger blatantly violated the state constitution with his last-minute decision, ignored the victims' due process rights and acted 'in an arbitrary and capricious manner.' Low places: In an interview in 2011 Schwarzenegger, pictured before a cartoon character of himself, expressed no doubt in helping out a friend . There was evidence that Schwarzenegger generally required that his office follow the provisions of Marsy's Law, which voters approved while he was in office in 2008, when he considered other clemency cases, Deputy District Attorney Laura Tanney wrote in a brief filed this week. 'Schwarzenegger knew the law, he knew exactly what was required of him, and yet he defied the oath of his office,' Tanney wrote. Esteban Nunez, now 23, is incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, about 50 miles southeast of Sacramento, and is scheduled for release in 2017. His father is a political consultant in Sacramento. Gov. Jerry Brown in October signed a bill that was written in response to the controversy over Nunez's commutation. It requires the governor to give at least 10 days' notice to the district attorney in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred before acting on an application for clemency. That would give the district attorney time to notify crime victims and allow them to petition against a sentence reduction.","As one of his last moves in office the former California governor cut Esteban Nunez's sentence from 16 years to seven .

"By . James Tozer and Nazia Parveen . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 7 November 2012 . Steven Messham arrives at the Wales Office in London yesterday . The head of the original inquiry into sexual abuse of boys at children’s homes in North Wales says he does not recall any of them claiming politicians had preyed on them. John Jillings said yesterday he had no memory of ex-resident Steve Messham making the claim, first aired on Newsnight, of being raped by a senior Thatcher-era Tory when he spoke to him in the mid-1990s. His resulting report uncovered widespread sex abuse by staff at several homes but was controversially pulped amid allegations of a cover-up. In 2000, a Government-commissioned public inquiry confirmed that hundreds of young boys had been systematically abused, centred on the now-notorious Bryn Estyn home. But Mr Messham’s claims this week prompted David Cameron to order new inquiries into whether links to a wider paedophile ring potentially involving politicians were suppressed. As Mr Jillings cast doubt on Mr Messham’s account, two brothers who were at Bryn Estyn at the same time as him told the Daily Mail that claims of boys being taken away to be abused by outsiders were untrue. Mr Jillings, now 78 and long-retired as director of social services in Derbyshire, was commissioned by Clwyd council in 1994 to examine claims of abuse at 40 homes across North Wales. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme he did not recall Mr Messham or other ex-residents claiming politicians had taken them to a hotel in nearby Wrexham and abused them. ‘My memory may be fading but I don’t remember that was one of the issues he raised with us,’ he said. Asked whether he had heard claims by victims of abuse by a leading Thatcher-era Conservative politician who is still alive, Mr Jillings replied: ‘Not to the best of my knowledge. ‘I’m sure that would have lodged in my mind and we would have wanted to investigate it had we known about it.’ Alleged abusers named to him ‘didn’t include well-known people in public life’, he added. The former Bryn Estyn boys home, Wrexham, which closed down following claims of child abuse . On Tuesday an unnamed former resident of Bryn Estyn said he saw the late Sir Peter Morrison – a former close aide to Margaret Thatcher who died in 1995 – visit the home several times in the 1980s and take boys away in his car. But brothers Kevin and Sean Maher, who were at Bryn Estyn at the same time as Mr Messham and now live in Bolton, rejected the claims. Sean, 45, said: ‘We were abused on a regular basis by staff, from beatings to molestation, and it was happening to many of the boys. ‘But the idea of smartly-dressed guys turning up in flash cars and picking us up is just a figment of someone’s imagination.’ Kevin, 44, added: ‘The notion that some shadowy figures would turn up at the gates in sports cars and take boys to be raped is just farcical. This simply did not happen.’ Mr Messham – who plans to make a formal complaint against the former Tory grandee to the new National Crime Agency investigation – arrived at Bryn Estyn in 1977 and is understood to have been there for three years. Last night he refused to confirm the date he left but claimed not to have been there at the same time as the Maher brothers. ‘I don’t care what they saw,’ he told the Daily Mail. ‘I wasn’t there then.’ He said critics were trying to discredit him.","John Jillings said he had no memory of ex-resident Steve Messham making the claim of being raped by a senior Thatcher-era Tory .

A British businessman sentenced to six months in a Dubai jail for pinching a woman's bottom in a bar has won his appeal - but says his life is in tatters after spending every penny fighting to clear his name. Married expatriate Steven Sherriff, 45, escaped serving time behind bars but says he has been financially ruined by his nine-month ordeal and humiliated after being branded a sex attacker. He plans to sue his accuser, a 23-year-old Brit who claimed he groped her left buttock and slipped his hand between her legs. Married expatriate Steven Sherriff escaped serving time behind bars but says he has been financially ruined by his nine-month ordeal in Dubai . And he said the last nine months have been 'hell' for him and his wife Betina after the cost of legal bills and lost earnings amounted to £70,000. Mr Sherriff, an investor who sells airplane paint, said: 'I don't know if I can face staying in Dubai after this. Of course I'm relieved to have won my appeal but we have been financially ruined. 'I haven't been able to work while this has been ongoing and they took my passport away. Overnight my earnings of £7,000 a month went down the drain and we had to spend another £3,500 on legal fees. 'I lost an airplane contract worth millions because I was not allowed to work. 'Betina has been in bits, especially after hearing all the terrible things I was accused of, none of which I would ever do. 'I am going to be taking legal action against the people who tried to put me behind bars. I have lost nine months of my life because of their drunken stupidity.' Belfast-born Mr Sherriff, who has lived in Dubai for seven years and been married for 15 years, had been on a bar crawl with six friends on February 24. He and one of the group ended up in Nelsons bar in the Media Rotana hotel at 11pm, where he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman standing at the bar, a clerk with a recruitment company. She was out with her 27-year-old boyfriend and a friend and complained she had felt someone groping her between her legs - although she admitted she did not see who did it and her own friend claimed Mr Sherriff was innocent. Mr Sherriff said: 'She insisted it was me because she turned around and I was standing there. It is sickening. I know myself and I would never do that.' The woman's boyfriend knocked him unconscious after she claimed he had groped her. Both men were arrested and Mr Sherriff said although they mutually agreed to drop charges against each other, the boyfriend went back on his word and he was charged with the sex attack. Mr Sherriff was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in the Medina Rotana . bar in Dubai . They were each fined £170 for drinking alcohol, a crime in the Islamic country, and in July Mr Sherriff was sentenced to six months behind bars for the sexual assault. He immediately appealed and was on bail while fighting his case, although his passport was taken away and he was prevented from visiting Betina, who works in a nursing home in Copenhagen in her native Denmark. Mr Sherriff was only cleared when three bouncers from the bar, who refused to give evidence at the original trial, were ordered by judges to appear before Dubai's Court of Appeal and admitted they did not see a sex attack taking place. Even though he has proved his innocence, his accuser cannot be identified because she is protected by the same law which prevented the victim of rapist footballer Ched Evans from being named. Under British law, she can only be named if she is proven to have lied to police and prosecutors. Mr Sherriff thinks she refused to change her story because she was afraid of ending up behind bars herself. He said: 'I have lost nine months of my life because of her and her boyfriend's drunken stupidity. 'At any point, they could have called the whole thing off but they didn't. Brits in Dubai need to know if they come here, they need to respect the law, not use it to their advantage against innocent people. 'I know the rules here and have always respected them. 'I will be seeking legal action against them. They can't get away with lying like this. This has been a living nightmare.'","Married expatriate Steven Sherriff, 45, .

Detectives are searching a remote Lancashire wood after the killer of a 'Romeo' businessman revealed the location of his body. 'Wheeler dealer' David Guilfoyle, 37, disappeared in May 2005 whilst having an affair with Debbie Fitzpatrick and another woman. Scorned former husband, factory worker Shane Fitzpatrick, 36, was later convicted of beating Guilfoyle to death and hiding his body. Search: Police are scouring woods near Bolton by Bowland in Lancashire for the body of David Guilfoyle . Detectives have been joined by army engineers and forensic archaeologists in the search for the body . Searches of waters and woodland at the time - including a search of a reservoir by police divers - proved fruitless. But . detectives have now renewed the search after Fitzpatrick rang them from . prison to say he had 'found God' and was willing to show them where he . dumped the body of his former love rival. Fitzpatrick . was taken from his prison cell at Garth Prison near Leyland to . Admiral's Wood near Bolton-by-Bowland, Lancashire, where he said he had . buried Guilfoyle hours after killing him. Killer: Shane Fitzpatrick (right) was jailed for murdering David Guilfoyle (left) in 2005, but had hitherto refused to reveal where he had buried his body . Police are scouring the woodland with sniffer dogs and digging up parts of the woodland where Guilfoyle’s body is suspected to be buried. A keen fell runner, Fitzpatrick had chosen the burial site after running through it during Bowland Harriers fell races. Detective Superintendent Paul Withers, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'Shane Fitzpatrick has been serving a custodial sentence but never admitted his guilt and never answered questions until recently when he indicated he wanted to speak to us. Love rivals: Guilfoyle was having an affair with Fitzpatrick's ex-wife Debbie Fitzpatrick . 'Two officers visited him at Garth Prison last Friday when he basically admitted his guilt, admitted responsibility for the murder and indicated that the body had been buried in a shallow grave in Admiral’s Wood. 'He expressed remorse for his actions and indicated he had given up the body because it was the right thing to do especially for Mr Guilfoyle’s friends and family. He has had a lot of time to think about things and deeply regrets what he did. 'Fitzpatrick was brought to the scene on Tuesday morning and indicated an area, but it was difficult for him with the passage of time, there has been some logging in the wood, and, of course, it was dark when he buried the body.' Detective Superintendent Withers added the search involved 25 detectives, crime scene investigators and two forensic archaeologists. They were joined by soldiers from the army’s 33 engineers regiment who were giving advice on signs of ground disruption. Fitzpatrick was jailed for 20 years in 2005 after Preston Crown Court found him guilty of murder. The court had heard how Guilfoyle - who had a 15-year-old daughter - was having an affair with Fitzpatrick’s ex-wife Debbie and another woman Adele Walton. He was said to be 'quite well off' and owned a number of properties which were rented out. He also travelled the world, including Egypt, Brazil and Australia. Guilfoyle - a championship pool player who represented England in the sport - was also described as a 'wheeler dealer'. He sold illegally-imported cigarettes on the black market, dealt in pirate DVDs and counterfeit clothing, and kept up to £30,000 in cash in his home. Friends said he had lots of enemies. Fitzpatrick had married teaching assistant Debbie in 1995 and the couple had three children but their marriage was stormy. The factory worker was said to have a . 'possessive jealousy' towards Debbie, believed she was having an affair . with a work colleague and beat her leaving her with various injuries . including black eyes and fractured cheekbone. Debbie . eventually moved out of their home in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire . and in November 2002, began an affair with Guilfoyle. Fitzpatrick . sent his former wife text messages saying he did not like Guilfoyle and . in conversations told her: 'You’re mine - he has stolen you off me and I . feel like killing him'. 'Wheeler-dealer': Guilfoyle owned several properties, drove a Jaguar and was said to be involved in black-market clothes, DVDs and cigarettes . Police found blood stains on the drive of Guilfoyle's £230,000 bungalow in Accrington, Lancashire . The Fitzpatricks divorced in August, 2004 but he still harboured feelings for Debbie. Guilfoyle was last seen alive on May 25 2005 watching Liverpool’s victory in the Champion’s League Final at the Grey Horse pub in Accrington. He was said to be 'in jubilant mood' but he was reported missing two days later. Police who went to the victim’s £230,000 bungalow found huge bloodstains on the drive. Guilfoyle’s racing green convertible . Jaguar XK8 car worth £15,000 was found parked and locked on the drive. Letters were found behind the door, a computer still switched on showing . the date May 25th and his bed had not been slept in. Clothing . was lying around, his wallet, credit cards and PINS were on a bedside . cabinet and a substantial amount of cash was in the house. His parked . car was locked but the keys could not be located. The . court heard Guilfoyle’s blood was found around the house with a large . heavy bloodstain on the drive. Attempts had been made to clean up the . scene. Fitzpatrick’s DNA was found on a torch discovered on top of the hose pipe. Evidence: Police found large bloodstains (pictured) on Guilfoyle's driveway . Weapon: Detectives found Fitzpatrick's DNA on a torch abandoned at the scene . Inquiries revealed neighbours had . spotted Fitzpatrick in the days leading up to Guilfoyle’s disappearance . dressed in dark clothing and behaving 'like a commando'. Police . believe he lay in wait at Guilfoyle’s house dressed in dark clothing . and wearing a balaclava and beat him to death under cover of darkness in . what was described as a 'ferocious assault'. He cleaned the scene with the hosepipe before hiding the victim’s body at unknown location. Fruitless: Despite searching local woodlands and reservoirs, police could find no trace of Guilfoyle's body at the time of the killing . After police charged him with murder Fitzpatrick was heard telling his son: 'The worst case is I will get 15 to 20 years if found guilty - but I still reckon I’ve got a good chance of getting off with it'. Fitzpatrick denied murder but was convicted by a majority verdict of 11-1. At the time judge Mr Justice David Clarke told him: 'You carried out a carefully planned and professionally executed killing in which he had taken great care to cover his tracks in every direction'. 'You have been successful in concealing the body but you have not been successful in deceiving the astute and attentive jury.'","'Wheeler dealer' David Guilfoyle murdered in 2005, but body never found .

Senior judges today expressed amazement after technology giant Apple suggested it would need two weeks to post a notice on its website. One judge suggested that Apple chief executive Tim Cook ought to make a statement setting out the 'technical difficulty' facing the American firm. Judges were sitting in the Court of Appeal in London hearing details of a dispute between Apple and rival Samsung. The original notice posted on Apple's website, which a court today said did not comply with its orders . Apple had been instructed by judges to publish a statement acknowledging that it had lost an earlier legal fight with Samsung. The two firms returned to court after Samsung complained that the notice Apple posted did not comply with the court order and should be altered. Apple said the notice did comply. But judges agreed with Samsung and said Apple should post another statement. A lawyer representing Apple said the firm could take a notice off its website in 24 hours but asked judges for 14 days to post a replacement. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks displays the new iPad mini. Today a court sugggested he should explain why it takes the firm two weeks to post a statement on its web site. Lord Justice Longmore told Michael Beloff QC: 'We are just amazed that you cannot put the right notice up at the same time as you take the other one down.' And Sir Robin Jacob added: 'I would like to see the head of Apple make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the Apple company.' He told Mr Beloff: 'I don’t believe the instructions you have been given. 'This is Apple that cannot put something on their own website?' Judges said Apple should post the notice within 48 hours. The ruling came after a lawyer representing Samsung today told . Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob that . Apple had published a notice on its website on October 26 - in 'purported compliance' with a Court of Appeal order. But Henry Carr QC said Apple had added an account of court proceedings . in Germany and the United States which was 'inaccurate and misleading'. 'This has received enormous publicity and has perpetuated confusion as . to Samsung's entitlement to market the Galaxy tablet computers in . issue,' he said, in a written statement given to judges. 'It has created the impression that the UK court is out of step with other courts.' He said Apple should be told to stop publishing the notice it had posted and made to comply with the court's order. Mr Beloff told judges that Apple thought that it had complied with the court order. 'It's not designed to punish,' said Mr Beloff. 'It's not designed to make us grovel.' 'The only purpose must be to dispel commercial uncertainty.' Judges decided in favour of Samsung, told Apple to make changes and said . they would give detailed reasons for their ruling later. Apple today posted a notice in the Financial Times newspaper . explaining decisions by the High Court and Court of Appeal about the . dispute over Samsung's Galaxy computers. The notice was shorter than the . website statement and Samsung made no complaint about it. An Apple iPad (left) is displayed next to Samsung's Galaxy tab. Today Apple was told it must post a second statement on its website after a court decided its first version did not comply. They were hearing the latest stage of a legal dispute centred on computer technology produced by Apple and Samsung. Apple had complained that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was too similar to its iPad. But a judge at the High Court in London ruled in July that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was not 'cool' enough to be confused with Apple’s iPad. In October, Apple failed to overturn that ruling in the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob upheld a decision by . Judge Colin Birss QC, who had concluded that three Samsung Galaxy tablet computers did not infringe Apple’s registered design. Judge Birss had said: 'They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.' He had decided that consumers were not likely to get the two tablet computers mixed up.","Apple rapped after failing to comply with court ruling and told to post a replacement .

Some 400 people filled the Harlow . Islamic Centre for a Muslim funeral on October 24, joining Dr Shakoor - . who suffered minor injuries as he fought to rescue his family from the blaze. Paramedics, firefighters and police . officers who dealt with the blaze attended, while teachers and pupils . who studied alongside the children also joined members of the Islamic . community. On October 17 it was reported that . tests carried out at the scene of the fire suggested that the blaze may . have started accidentally.

Harlow during the same evening and early morning there were two other . unsuccessful attempts to break in to other properties and one where . entry was gained but the suspect was disturbed and nothing was taken. ‘How these incidents relate to the current investigation is ongoing.’ The officer said he was keen to speak . to a teenage boy of around 15 or 16 wearing a tracksuit, and a slim girl . in a school uniform who were seen throwing Dr Shakoor's laptop bag away . near garages in Whitewaits, Harlow.

He said: ‘Dr Shakoor remembers leaving his Toshiba Satellite laptop in the lounge when he went to bed that evening. ‘The fire that raged through the . downstairs of the house has left the contents totally destroyed. We now . believe that this laptop may have been stolen.’ Police also want to speak to a group of teenage boys who were outside the house in Barn Mead in the early hours of October 15. DS Vinson said a group of four boys . wearing tracksuits and baseball caps and two teenagers on pedal bikes . had been seen in the area. Tragedy: Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on brickwork, and the walls are black with smoke . In the immediate aftermath of the fire, police said they were treating it as a suspected arson attack. On the same night, a neighbour's car was torched and that incident is still being investigated as arson.

Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge, head of Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said today that the investigation had so far been unable to identify the cause of the house blaze. He said: ‘The fire burned through the downstairs of the house at a very high temperature, destroying most of the contents. ‘Scientists have been sifting through the remains and have confirmed that to date there is no evidence of a flammable liquid being used. 'It is however, important to emphasise that detailed forensic testing remains ongoing.’ Dr Shakoor (right) read a statement in which he appealed ‘from my heart’ for anyone with information to help him understand the tragedy. Unable to fight back tears, he said: ‘In the space of just one night I have lost everything dearest to me. ‘Any father, any mother, anyone who has family who they love, will understand the pain that I and all my family are suffering. ‘Allah has given me courage to face this tragedy with patience, and so many people from across the community have supported me with their love and words and comfort at this terrible time. ‘Today I am looking to the community once again for help in providing answers to the many questions that remain. ‘I do not understand why my little children who were so happy and full of life, who had so much to live for, are no longer here. ‘I ask from my heart that anyone with information comes forward to help, so that I may understand the tragedy that has befallen my beautiful family. ‘Even a small piece of information may make a difference and, however difficult it may be, I ask anyone who knows what happened, to do the right thing, to come forward and to talk to the police.’","Dr Abdul Shakoor suffered smoke inhalation as he tried to save his family .

'A pat on the back, telling them it's okay to molest your daughter, impregnate her, and for her to have a child, a blind child? It's ok?' Scroll down for video . Devastated: Tiara Stevens, 27, says her son was born blind and albino after she was impregnated by her own father at age 12 . Outraged: Ms Stevens says she is furious that her father must serve only one year in jail for repeatedly raping her when she was a little girl . Fred Montgomery, 47, had pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct with a minor. He was sentenced on Monday to 15 years in jail, but all but one year was suspended. Tiara was just 12 years old when she was impregnated by her father at the trailer home they shared. She only realised she was pregnant the day before she gave birth after going into labour at school. Her son was born blind and due to gene problems was born an albino. Tiara told officials in 1999 that her father had raped her in the mobile home they shared in Lancaster County, South Carolina. But no action was ever taken even though a DNA test in 2000 confirmed he was the father of his own grandson. Years of abuse: Ms Stevens (left) says she waited 14 years to see her father Fred Montgomery (right) brought to justice . Tiara and her father continued to live in the same small town for over a decade until authorities were pushed into action by the single mother. Officials with the 6th Circuit Solicitor's Office said a fire at the courthouse destroyed many of the documents related to the case. In an interview with WISTV, 27 year old Tiara said she was shocked by the lenient sentence. 'It was a slap in the face,' she said. Tiara said she is often confused on how to describe her son. 'That confuses me a lot,' said Stevens. 'It's like, ""Which one are you today? Are you my son, or are you my brother?"" Because he really is both.' In a previous interview, Tiara described how her father would sneak into her room and rape her. 'He never told me what he was doing,' said Stevens. 'It was just late at night. He would come in, take my clothes off, and he would have sex. And he would leave and he would say, ""You better not stay up all night,"" and I would go in the bathroom and I would cry. The next night he may not do it, but the next night, he would repeat the same thing.' Tiara said she has not yet told her son that her grandfather is actually her father and will be out of prison in a year. 'From this day forward, I will fight for victim's rights to make sure this never happens again,' Stevens said. wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina | .","Tiara Stevens says her father raped her in their South Carolina trailer and authorities did nothing for 14 years .

Apple has been accused of resorting to technological trickery in an effort to obscure their 'apology' to Samsung after losing the latest round of their ongoing tablet legal battle. Visitors to the Apple UK website homepage have to scroll down to see the statement after an apparent quirk of the new JavaScript code pushes the mea culpa out of sight. The re-sized code seems not to affect the U.S. version of the technology giants website and only appears on the UK one, which has led to users on websites such as Reddit to smell sour grapes from Apple. Visitors to the Apple website in the UK could not obviously see the link to read Apple's statement regarding Samsung today . According to tech experts, the piece of code that Apple used ensures that an advert for the iPad mini takes up the whole page - pushing the apology out of sight. One software developer who has spoken to CNET, explained that the new JavaScript forces the central image on the website to take up a larger amount of space on the page, showing the new iPad Mini, but not a link to the statement. This is significant because on October 18, UK High Court Judge Colin Birss ordered Apple to post a message on its British website for one month stating that Samsung did not infringe any of Apple's patents in the production of their Galaxy Tab and did not break any laws. However, Samsung complained to the UK Court of Appeal that Apple's statement posted on October 25 was inaccurate and it was ultimately deemed to be 'non-compliant' with the original order made earlier this month. It made reference to their victories against Samsung outside the UK, and as such the original release upset the South Korean technology company. Visitors to the website had to scroll down to see a link that would explain the Californian technology giants reaction to their legal loss to Samsung . 'A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple’s design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc,' read the original statement. 'So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple’s far more popular iPad.' Furthermore this was placed not on the front page but tucked away accessible only through at least two links and the appeal court demanded that Apple change this on Thursday and gave them 48 hours to do so. The judges, Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob called the statement 'untrue' and 'incorrect' and Apple did eventually remove it. The difficult to find statement that Apple are linking to on the homepage of their website in the UK . However, it was only today that technology experts noticed the new 'apology' and its lack of visibility. 'On 25 October 2012, Apple Inc. published a statement on its UK website in relation to Samsung’s Galaxy tablet computers,' said the new 'hidden' posting. 'That statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. The correct statement is at Samsung/Apple UK judgement.' It is unclear whether the re-sized code was a deliberate attempt to conceal their statement or if it is simply because Apple are innocently trying fit as many images onto the page as possible. But regardless, this is just the latest installment in the spat between the Californian and South Korean companies which began back in 2010. The original notice posted on Apple's website, which a court said on Thursday did not comply with its orders . Apple have accused Samsung of copying patents and designs for their respective smartphones and tablets and have opened lawsuits in countries across the world. In the UK lawsuit, Apple contended that Samsung had used their European 'registered design' for the iPad tabler - but Judge Birss disagreed and found against Apple in July. Samsung said that the original statement from Apple contained potentially confusing references to German and U.S. court decisions as well as the British ruling, was 'inaccurate and misleading'. An Apple iPad (left) is displayed next to . Samsung's Galaxy tab. Today Apple was told it must post a second . statement on its website after a court decided its first version did not . comply. Judges agreed and said Apple must post the new statement within the next 48 hours, although the U.S. company said it would need two weeks to post the notice. Judge Robin Jacob told Apple's lawyer, Michael Beloff, he did not believe that it would be difficult to post a new statement on the website. 'I would like to see the head of Apple make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the Apple company,' the Press Association quoted Jacob as saying. 'This is Apple that cannot put something on their own website?' Apple declined to comment on the ruling until they posted the new statement today.","Apology message is not displayed unless users scroll down the website .

Andrew Mitchell denied acting as a 'rogue minister' yesterday – as he insisted David Cameron had backed his decision to hand £16million in foreign aid to Rwanda. The former international development secretary has come under fire for lifting the suspension on aid to Rwanda on his final day in office, despite claims its regime is guilty of human rights abuses. Mr Mitchell – who resigned as Tory chief whip after allegedly calling Downing Street police 'plebs' – had told Mr Cameron that Rwanda had 'ended' its support for the notorious M23 rebels who are leading an uprising in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In fact, a UN report leaked last month accused Rwanda of masterminding the rebellion which has forced half a million from their homes. Mr Cameron had made it a condition that support for the M23 rebels ended before aid was restored to the regime of Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Labour MP Richard Burden, a member of the Commons committee which quizzed Mr Mitchell, said: 'It is not clear to me why Mr Mitchell decided to release this money before the full UN report is out next month.' Carina Tertsakian, of Human Rights Watch, said it was 'disingenuous' to claim Rwanda's support for the mutiny had ended in the summer. 'Between the end of July when aid was suspended and the start of September when it was reinstated, support for M23 was ongoing,' she said. Downing Street sources last night insisted Mr Cameron did not feel he had been misled. Pictured Congolese government troops and tanks who fought M23 rebels who were allegedly funded by Rwanda . Mr Mitchell has developed a close friendship with President Kagame. But yesterday he insisted his decision to restore aid was 'made with complete propriety'. He said he took 'great offence' at media portrayals of him as a 'rogue minister who signed cheques under the bedclothes and bunged them to dubious regimes'. Half of the £16million payment to Rwanda went straight into the Kagame regime's coffers. International Development Secretary Justine Greening will decide whether to press ahead with a further £21million in Rwandan aid after the UN report is published.","Tory MP signed off payment despite UN atrocities alert .

A 46-year-old mother has been jailed for more than two years after a seven-year benefit fraud that saw her wrongfully receive £75,000 of taxpayers' money. Mother-of-three Andrea Blakeburn, of Darlington, County Durham, repeatedly told officials from the council and the Department for Work and Pensions that she lived alone with her children. But her crime was uncovered when investigators looked around the supposed single mother’s home in January and found her partner Ronald Thomas underneath some a duvet. 'Single mother': Andrea Blakeburn, 46, of Darlington, County Durham, repeatedly told officials from the council and the Department for Work and Pensions that she lived alone with her children . Her lies helped her rake in thousands of pounds a year in council tax relief and housing benefit from Darlington Borough Council, Teesside Crown Court heard. She was also said to have received thousands of pounds in Employment Support Allowance, Income Support and Jobseeker’s Allowance. James Fenny, defending, argued that Blakeburn had not lived an extravagant lifestyle on the money and used it simply to feed and clothe her children. But Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told her: ‘There are many people in your position, struggling to make ends meet. ‘The message has got to come from this court that whatever the mitigation, people who carry out benefit fraud to this extent will go to prison.’ Blakeburn would struggle to cope in jail and her son, daughters and two grandchildren would also suffer, Mr Fenny told the court. She had endured an ordeal in the community after the media revealed her fraud when she pleaded guilty last month, he said. Location: Blakeburn's home is on this road, Pateley Moor Crescent, in Darlington, County Durham . Locking up Blakeburn for two years and four months, Judge Bourne-Arton described the cheating as ‘persistent, deliberate and determined’. He said: ‘People who carry out deceptions to get benefits to which they are not entitled can come from a number of different backgrounds. 'Every bit of money you got came from people who pay their taxes, many struggling to do so. It is the public who are the sufferers. It is their money' Andrea Blakeburn, 46 . ‘Many, like you, are otherwise decent people, not well-off, struggling, but a number of those who are struggling to bring up children don’t cheat. ‘Every bit of money you got came from people who pay their taxes, many struggling to do so. It is the public who are the sufferers. It is their money.’ Mr Fenny said: ‘Clearly it is not right, and she admits her guilt. She has suffered quite a lot already. She is frightened of going to prison. There has been no lavish lifestyle here. ‘The money has been spent on children - on their shoes, clothing and food - and not holidays and cars.’ Blakeburn admitted ten charges of making false statements and two counts of failing to notify a change in circumstances between 2003 and 2010.","Andrea Blakeburn, of Darlington, told officials she lived alone with children .

Scientists working with NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone in California have revealed radar images of a near earth asteroid as is approached us just days ago. Near-Earth asteroid 2007 PA8 passed by on Oct. 28, 29 and 30. The asteroid's distance from Earth on Oct. 28 was 6.5 million miles (10 million kilometers), and 5.6 million miles (9 million kilometers) on Oct. 30, and it made its closest approach on November 5th, coming within 17 times the Earth-moon distance (4 million miles or 6.5 million kilometers). This composite image of asteroid 2007 PA8 was obtained using data taken by NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, Calif. JPL scientists chose to image asteroid . 2007 PA8 due to its size and relative proximity to Earth at the point . of closest approach. The perspective in the images is similar to seeing the asteroid from above its north pole. Each of the three images is shown at the same scale, Nasa said. 'The radar images of asteroid 2007 PA8 indicate that it is an elongated, irregularly shaped object approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers) wide, with ridges and perhaps craters. 'The data also indicate that 2007 PA8 rotates very slowly, roughly once every three to four days.' The trajectory of asteroid 2007 PA8 is well understood. This flyby was the closest Earth approach by this asteroid for at least the next 200 years. Although the orbit of 2007 PA8 is well known and is not considered a threat to Earth in the near-term, it is classified as a 'near-Earth asteroid.'

An architect was kicked, punched and spat on as he tried to defend his award-winning home from gatecrashers behaving with a 'pack mindset' during his daughter’s 13th birthday. Sixty uninvited older teenagers - who spotted the party details through Facebook messages - gathered on the £1.1million home of Shaun Beverley in an exclusive private road. In every parent's worse nightmare, they descended upon the home and refused to leave the house, which had won Mr Beverley a Home Builder of a Year award. But when Mr Beverley told the group they had ten minutes to leave the home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, they turned on him and inflicted horrendous injuries on the 45-year-old. The group punched him to the floor, and then kicked, spat on and threw objects at him, District Judge Jeff Brailsford sitting at Blackpool Magistrates Court heard. Before him was one of the attackers, a 16-year-old - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - who admitted assaulting Mr Beverley on July 7 this year. The court heard that the youth - who was not invited to the party - threw three punches at his victim before others joined in the attack. The judge heard that the group conned their way into Mr Beverley property which had electric gates by using an intercom giving a false identity. They turned up at the daughter’s party because they had been alerted to it by Facebook. A pack of teenagers descended upon the home of the award winning architect . The judge told the teenager: 'You were . part of a pack mindset which led this man suffered a vicious and . horrendous attack try to defend his home and his garden in an entirely . proper manner. 'He was entitled to do what he he did.' 'He had opened up his home for his daughter’s party and these people wangled their way in.They were all at least two or three years older then the girl.' 'But when asked they were not for leaving. Mr Beverley started to usher them out when he was punched to the floor by you.' The 16-year-old who attacked the father, pictured, apologised . 'You became the front man and other . egged you on. 'You are an intelligent young man and you behaved in an . appalling manner you will forever regret what you did to this man.' Brett Chappell, defending, said his client apologised unreservedly for what he did. 'He wants to go into the Army. 'When he was shown the photographs of the injuries suffered by an innocent man he was totally ashamed and accepts he was a catalyst for what happened.' The youth was given a nine month referral order during which he may have to meet his victim face to face. He must pay Mr Beverley £150 compensation and £50 court costs. Gatecrashers looking at the social media site for details of private events have become a common problem. In October, Graham Sumeray, chief executive of Fine and Rare Wines, and his wife, Sax, went out for dinner on Saturday evening, after allowing their 16-year-old son, Hugo, to invite some friends to the four-bedroom family home in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. However, fifty uninvited guests turned up after spotting the invitation on Facebook and a treasured family heirloom went missing from the home. Police and an ambulance also arrived after a fight broke out between two youths and a teenager suffered a broken nose and needed eight stitches.","Shaun Beverley was punched to the floor and kicked in 'pack' attack .
