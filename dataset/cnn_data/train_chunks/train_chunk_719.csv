Helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter has issued a worldwide safety alert after a fault was found in the  model of craft that crashed into a pub, killing 10 people. A problem detected with the fuel dial meant that the indicator could fall straight from green to red without any warning, the firm discovered. The issue was found on some of the manufacturer's EC135 aircraft - the same type as the police helicopter involved in the Glasgow, Clutha pub tragedy last month. The scene at the Clutha pub in Glasgow on November 29 when Scotland's police helicopter crashed into the bar killing three on board and seven inside . Operator Bond Air Services temporarily suspended flights of its 22 EC135 helicopters last week after a fuel gauge fault was discovered on an air ambulance in the North West of England. The suspension affected air ambulance and police helicopters across the UK, many of which have now resumed flights. Eurocopter has now issued a safety information notice after tests revealed other aircraft may be affected by similar issues. A statement said: 'Eurocopter has been informed by Bond Air Services of an issue involving the fuel indication system experienced during normal operations by one of its EC135 EMS aircraft. 'Following this incident, fuel system functionality tests performed by Bond Air Services and two other EC135 operators in Europe have revealed possible similar supply-tank fuel gauging errors on some aircraft. Manufacturer Eurocopter has issued a safety warning after detecting a fault with the fuel indicators in their EC135 helicopters, the same model as that which crashed into the Clutha pub . Rescue workers prepare, left, to lift the wreckage of the Police Scotland helicopter from the Clutha pub, right . 'This incident is currently under in-depth investigation by Eurocopter. The first analysis shows that the indication of the fuel quantity in the supply tanks could be over-estimated.' The safety notice warns crews that in the 'worst case' scenario, a red low fuel warning could appear without any amber fuel caution beforehand. Pilot David Traill died in the crash along with two police officers on board and seven people drinking inside the Clutha pub . In a statement, Bond said: 'We note that Eurocopter has today issued a safety information notice to operators of the EC135 across the world confirming that some of their aircraft have a fault in the fuel indication and alert system which means that warning system may not work properly. 'This was a fault discovered by Bond during normal service operations on Wednesday, December 11, which we immediately reported to Eurocopter and the appropriate authorities. 'We understand other operators have since conducted similar tests and found similar problems with their aircraft. 'As soon as we discovered this issue, in line with our commitment to the highest standards of safety, we took the prudent decision to temporarily suspend service operations whilst we conducted checks on our fleet of EC135s. 'The results of these tests were subsequently validated by Eurocopter, and appropriate repairs made before returning the aircraft to service.' The company said it had ordered that all its EC135s should have a minimum of 198lb (90kg) of fuel on board at all times. An initial report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) into the Glasgow crash said there was 'no evidence of major mechanical disruption of either engine' of the Police Scotland helicopter. In addition, the helicopter still had 21 gallons (95 litres) of the 882lb (400kg) of fuel that it had taken off with from Glasgow City Heliport. The three people on board the Bond-operated aircraft and seven people in the pub died when it crashed on November 29.","The Police Scotland helicopter crashed into the Clutha pub in Glasgow on November 29, killing three on board and seven in the bar .

The creator of hit U.S. gang crime drama The Wire has claimed legalising cannabis would only help 'white middle-class kids' and there is a 'racial bias' in his country's multi-billion dollar war on drugs. Former Baltimore crime reporter David Simon, whose bleak portrait of his drug-ravaged home city has been hailed as the greatest television drama of all time, said he wanted the drugs debate re-framed. Speaking at a debate hosted by the Observer  at the Royal Institution in London, Simon called the government crusade against drugs 'a holocaust in slow motion'. Drugs debate: Producer David Simon at the premiere of HBO's The Wire in 2006 in New York City. The thought-provoking series went on to be a massive hit . Dominic West (left) as Jimmy McNulty speaking to youths on the streets of Baltimore in The Wire . Asked about recent votes in Colorado and Washington to legalise marijuana, he said: 'I'm against it. 'The last thing I want . to do is rationalise the easiest, the most benign end of this. The . whole concept needs to be changed, the debate reframed. 'I want the thing to fall as one complete edifice. If they manage to let a few white middle-class people off the hook, that's very dangerous. If they can find a way for white kids in middle-class suburbia to get high without them going to jail and getting them to think that what they do is a million miles away from black kids taking crack, that is what politicians would do.' Simon claimed if marijuana were legalised it would mean another 10 to 40 years of 'assigning people of colour to this dystopia', the Observer reported. He argued that the American economy has left 10 to 12 per cent of the population 'abandoned' without any hope of finding work. As a result, he claimed the dealing drugs was the only industry left in places such as Baltimore and east St Louis. The Wire creator Simon said the drugs war is making cost-effective policing on the streets of Baltimore too easy, to the detriment of police work on non drug-related crime. Pictured is a scene from series one of the drama . Jimmy McNulty (left), played by Dominic West, and Detective Bunk Moreland (right), played by Wendell Pierce, in The Wire . Simon said Baltimore had seen a decrease in arrests for non-drug offences from 70 to 90 per cent to 20 to 40 per cent . He described it as making 'cost-efficient' policing in Baltimore whereby small-time dealers are picked up on the street easy for the authorities. But he said criminal activity other than drugs was ignored because prosecutions were expensive and time-consuming. Simon said Baltimore had seen a decrease in arrests for non-drug offences from 70 to 90 per cent to 20 to 40 per cent, while drug-related arrests increased on some beats from 5,000 to 30,000. Simon concluded that the policy has made the city more unsafe while drugs have become cheaper and more available than ever. Simon's long-running saga, which looked at the dark underbelly of the city of Baltimore, ran for five seasons on HBO. Each season of The Wire focused on a different facet of the drugs trade in the city of Baltimore, Maryland. In order they were the drug trade on the streets, the seaport system, corruption within the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The Wire, which ran from 2002 to 2008 . and became a huge cult hit, being hailed by many critics as the best . television programme of the last decade or even of all time.","David Simon said he wanted the drugs debate re-framed .

"PUBLISHED: . 14:58 EST, 26 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:59 EST, 26 May 2013 . There was a close call between a military helicopter and a regional airliner attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington last week, federal officials said today. At their closest point, the two aircraft were flying at the same altitude and were only 950 feet apart laterally, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident. Republic Airlines flight 3281 had descended to 400 feet as it approached the airport when the helicopter, which had been flying lower and ahead of the plane, briefly rose to 400 feet as well, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. The passenger flight involved in the near-disaster was an Embraer 175. The pilot aborted the planned landing at Reagan National Airport to avoid a collision with a helicopter . That set off an alarm aboard the airliner warning of a potential impending collision, Weiss said. The airline pilot aborted the landing, circled around and landed safely. The incident occurred at 4:05 p.m. EDT on Friday, Weiss said. NTSB identified the airliner as an Embraer 175, a twin-engine jet that generally seats about 80 people. The flight originated in Columbus, Ohio, and was destined for Huntsville, Alabama, with a stopover in Washington, Weiss said. Weiss identified the helicopter as a Bell UH-1 based at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland using the call sign Mussel 9. The UH-1, also known as a Huey, has a single engine with a two-bladed main rotor and tail rotor. The Air Force's 11th wing, based at Andrews, includes a UH-1 helicopter squadron. Andrews is the military's security base for the Washington area. Warhorse: The Bell UH-1 helicopter involved in the incident was a model used during the Vietnam War . The FAA initially identified the helicopter as a UH-60, better known as a Black Hawk, but later confirmed it was actually UH-1. In the United States, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) has been collecting confidential voluntary reports of close calls from pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers since 1976. The system was established after TWA Flight 514 crashed on approach to Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, killing all 85 passengers and seven crew in 1974. Danger averted: There was a close call between a military helicopter based at Joint Base Andrews and a regional airliner attempting to land at Reagan National Airport near Washington last week . Some familiar safety rules, such as . turning off electronic devices that can interfere with navigation . equipment, are a result of this program. According to a White House commission, due to near-miss observations and other technological improvements, the rate of fatal accidents has dropped about 65 per cent, to one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures, from one in nearly 2 million in 1997. The Federal Aviation Administration was formed in 1958 to oversee and regulate the airline industry and the use of U.S. airspace by both civilian and military aircraft following three mid-air collisions, two of which were between military and civilian aircraft. Prior to this, there was no unified control of airspace for civilian and military flights. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the near-collision.","A military helicopter and a regional airliner that was attempting to land came dangerously close to collision .

X Factor runner-up Nicholas McDonald has spoken out against the 'unprofessional' judges . The X Factor runner-up Nicholas McDonald has criticised judges Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh over their treatment of him in the final. The 17-year-old has accused Take That singer Barlow of ‘not liking’ him after he was the only one of the four judges to refuse him a standing ovation for his performance. The Scots schoolboy was also ‘disappointed’ by his own mentor, after Walsh urged viewers to vote for his rival, winner Sam Bailey. The judges’ actions were met with fury by family and fans of the singer, known as Nicky, with his mother Eileen branding them unprofessional. However Nicholas said he was not disappointed to have lost out to 36-year-old prison officer Sam Bailey, because it means he will be able to return home to Scotland for Christmas. The runner-up, from Motherwell, Lanarkshire, yesterday revealed his frustrations over the TV talent show final. He said: ‘Gary had a problem with me throughout the whole show. He never seemed to like me and whenever I gave a good performance he would pick up on the smallest things in the world. ‘I was disappointed with Louis saying, ""Vote for Sam and her single everyone."" It felt like Sam was getting all the love.’ The teenager’s mother went further, saying: ‘It was completely unprofessional, Gary refusing to stand after Nicholas’s song. ‘As for Louis, I don’t know what that was about and it was rude of him. 'He should have been backing his own act and not encouraging the public to vote for their opponent. 'I think Louis just speaks without thinking sometimes.’ The teenager (right) said he was disappointed in mentor Louis Walsh (left) for supporting his opponent Sam Bailey . Walsh made the comment after Bailey . sang Power of Love in the first part of the results show. He then went . on to praise her again, saying her winner’s single would be the . Christmas number one. The negative comments from Barlow followed Nicholas’s rendition of Robbie Williams' hit Candy. The judge, who wrote the song, said: ‘On a night like tonight it is all about showcasing your strengths and I just didn’t think that song showcased your voice. ‘I think Nicky is a balladeer at heart and that was going in another area I have never heard you go before.’ In the second part of the results show, he was the only judge not to give Nicholas a standing ovation. X Factor bosses refused to comment on the actions of the judges, but confirmed that Nicholas was one of the contestants who did not attend Barlow’s star-studded after-show party at the Dorchester hotel. Barlow has subsequently said he wants to write songs for Sam Bailey, whose victory will see her supporting Beyoncé on the superstar’s world tour next year. While she begins promoting her single, a cover of Demi Lovato’s Skyscraper, Nicholas will this week be heading home. Nicholas from Motherwell, Lanarkshire, said he felt judge Gary Barlow 'never liked' him and picked on his performances .

The teenager yesterday confided that he was not completely dismayed to finish second. On . Sunday night he swiftly left the VIP X Factor after-party at the Hilton . to go to the Quality Hotel Wembley to see his family. Now, after six months of separation during the show, he will get to spend Christmas with them. He said: ‘I am really happy I can just go home and spend Christmas with my friends and family. ‘If you came in first, I knew you would be doing your promo for your album, singing it everywhere and doing a lot of things. The teenager said he was glad opponent Sam Bailey (left won the competition as he can now spend Christmas at home in Scotland . ‘I was more than ready to do it but I was also more than happy for Sam to get the title and all the pressure of being the one with the X Factor. Second place means I can go home and spend Christmas with my family instead.’ The relatives he will be reunited with are his mother, his father Derrick, brothers Kevin, 18, and Lewis, 13, and his eight-year-old sister, Antonia. Mrs McDonald said: ‘It has been a long time since June and we have missed Nicholas terribly, we just want to have a normal family Christmas together. ‘We are so proud of what he has achieved and in my eyes, wherever he came in the competition, he was always the winner.’","Teenager said he was 'disappointed' in mentor for supporting opponent .

Stabbing: Holding a blood-stained shirt and being treated at the scene, this is the man in his mid-twenties who is believed to have been stabbed in Woolwich this afternoon . A man in his twenties has been stabbed in broad daylight less than 300 metres from where soldier Lee Rigby was executed on Wednesday afternoon. Police treated him at the scene in central Woolwich but Scotland Yard said the violent assault is not linked to the terror attack last week. The person was stabbed at 4pm in Wellington Street - across the road from where Lee Rigby was murdered - and he is not thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. Hours earlier the family of murdered British soldier Lee Rigby paid an emotional visit to the scene where he was hacked to death close to Woolwich Barracks. A group of young soldiers also arrived to pay their respects to Drummer Rigby, solemnly saluting the site where he met his death. Many of the young men carried red and white hackles, famously worn by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, of which Drummer Rigby was a treasured member. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The victim is a man in his mid 20s. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening. He will be taken to hospital. 'This incident happened geographically very close to where Lee Rigby died, but we do not believe what happened is linked to Lee’s murder or any issues associated with it.' There have been no arrests. Initially today's stabbing horrified people as it was feared the attack may be linked to the killing, which has shocked the world. The streets wee filled with people who came to pay their respects. Lee Rigby was hacked to death by two attackers in the same street on Wednesday, also in broad daylight. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and his alleged accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, are believed to have run down the off-duty British soldier with a Vauxhall Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks, crushing his body against a road sign. Last respects: Soldiers in full uniform salute murdered British soldier Lee Rigby at the site where he met his death last week . Round of applause: Soldiers gave a show of hands as they viewed the ever-increasing volume of floral tributes to Drummer Lee Rigby, and placed further flowers at the site where he died . Tribute: Many of the soldiers carried red and white hackles, which are famously worn by members of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers . Witnesses said the terror suspects . then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like 'crazed animals', before . dragging his corpse into the middle of the road leaving a trail of . blood. As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting: 'this is what God would have wanted'. A . blood-soaked man believed to be Adebolajo, who was still holding a . number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a . clear London accent: 'You people will never be safe.

The suspects remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals. Four days after he died his bereft family arrived at the spot where he died and struggled to cope with what they saw. Drummer Rigby's mother Lyn, stepfather Ian and estranged wife Rebecca looked at the thousands of tributes in Woolwich and left a balloon from his two-year-old son Jack saying 'Dad in a million'.

Hi-tech: The £199.99 Tea Maker from Heston Blumenthal claims to create the perfect brew . For most of us it is a relatively simple process: boil the kettle, put a teabag in a mug, pour on the water, add milk and sugar to taste. But that straightforward approach to making a cuppa is not good enough for chef Heston Blumenthal, famed for his risk-taking gastronomy. He has developed a tea maker that brings his hi-tech culinary approach into the home, casting aside the teapot and teabag. His £199.99 stainless steel Sage Tea Maker claims to deliver the perfect brew from what is effectively a combined kettle and teapot. It can even be used instead of a teasmade as it has a delay setting, allowing users to wake up to a perfect cup of tea. The device, one of a range of appliances he has created, has five temperature and time settings based on whether you are using normal black tea leaves or green, white, herbal or oolong varieties. ‘The right time and temperature  are critical for a great cuppa,’ said Blumenthal. ‘Different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures, and we all have a favourite strength. ‘You fill the stainless steel basket with leaves, tell it the type of tea, select the strength and it will heat the water, slowly lower the basket, then raise the basket from the water when it’s done.’ The Tea Maker keeps the beverage warm for up to 60 minutes and can also be used as a conventional kettle or to brew coffee. It is part of the new Sage by Heston Blumenthal range that includes an ice cream maker and a juicer. Most expensive in the range is  a £549.99 Barista Express coffee machine to make espressos and cappuccinos. A four-slice motorised toaster, costing £169.99, toasts bread depending on its ingredients and thickness. It has defrost and crumpet settings. Luxury: The new Heston Blumenthal range also includes a precision toaster for £169.99 . The . Heston toaster includes a quick look button which triggers the machine . to lift the bread out to show whether it is done or not. If it not quite golden, pressing the ‘A Bit More’ button lowers it back in for another 30 seconds. There . are independent controls to allow two different toasting settings, a . one-touch automatic lowering system, an LED light progress display, a . toast ready sound alert, together with defrost and crumpet settings. Convention: The Heston Blumenthal £99.99 kettle has five different settings for different types of tea . Each of the innovative machines come with recipes, hints and tips drawn up by the award-winning chef and TV food guru. Most expensive of the appliances in the range is a £549.99 Barista coffee machine – the sort of thing found in an independent coffee shop. It contains a 250g bean hopper, which is enough for 25 shots of espresso. It then grinds the beans and dispenses the doses of fresh coffee into the cups on a six place warming tray. For cappuccino lovers there is a high powered milk frothing arm and stainless steel frothing jug. The Sage range is a brand of the Australian Breville group, while they will be sold in the UK through the likes of Lakeland, John Lewis, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Debenhams and Harrods. The manufacturer’s general manager for marketing, Scott Brady, said the chef had been involved in presenting the products to UK retailers. ‘As an intrinsic brand partner, Heston has helped to explain the benefits of our flagship products…to a highly receptive audience,’ he said. A spokesman added: ‘Heston Blumenthal, the ultimate food thinker and experimental chef, was involved in testing and production. ‘These powerful, heavy-duty machines have an array of automatic, pre-set programmes that replicate commercial appliances and do all the thinking for you. ‘Thanks to Heston and Sage, prepping, boiling, whisking, whipping, cooking and baking has never been so easy.’","Chef has created new Tea Maker which claims to deliver perfect brew .

The Dutch non-profit company that has gathered 200,000 volunteers for its planned manned mission to Mars has unveiled details about the first stage of its mission. Mars One announced Tuesday that it has hired Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Surrey Satellite Technology to design a satellite and lander that it intends to launch in just four years. The robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 - two years later than initially planned, Mars One founder Bas Lansdorp said. The Lockheed Martin contract to design a Mars lander - similar to NASA's 2007 Phoenix lander - is worth $250,000, according to CBS News. Scroll down for video . The colony as it is expected to look in 2015 - with four astronauts arriving every two years on the one-way mission . The company paid Surrey Satellite . about $60,000 to design the red planet's first 'geostationary' satellite . that would also be launched on the first mission. To . help fund the project, Mars One also launched an IndieGoGo . crowd-funding campaign. The project raised $10,000 in the first hour and . was at $27,000 early Wednesday. A prison guard, a mother who home-schooled her children and a stand up comedian are among the 200,000 people from around the world who have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars. The . hopefuls, who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their . training starts, said why they would leave behind their loved ones and . revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen. One . applicant from Australia said he would take his ukulele, which he has . named Amanda, while another from the United States said she would pack . her fluffy mongoose toy. By 2015, the selected candidates will start an eight-year training regime where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation. The majority of applicants for the . one-way trip to Mars came from the United States, with India . and China coming in second and third place. Twenty-two-year-old hopeful Thomas Eccles, told The Guardian: 'Can you imagine . how deranged and unstable I would eventually become? That would make for . some impressive TV gold.' Dutch group, Mars One, wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as soon as October 2016 . The mission will begin with a landing rover set to launch in 2018 to scour the planet looking for a landing site . In 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers. Two living units, two life support units, a second supply unit, and another rover arrive on Mars . Mars One says it is not necessary to have military training nor experience in flying aircraft nor even a science degree. Candidates must: . 'Be at least 18 years of age, have a deep sense of purpose, willingness to build and maintain healthy relationships, the capacity for self-reflection and ability to trust. They must be resilient, adaptable, curious, creative and resourceful. Mars One is not seeking specific skill sets such as medical doctors, pilots or geologists. Rather, candidates will receive a minimum of eight years extensive training while employed by Mars One. Erica . Meszaros, another potential candidate from the United States, said: 'I want to see the sun rise over a completely new horizon, in a completely new sky. I think that's worth any price. 'The day they stop trying to colonise Mars will be the day I stop trying to help them do it. 'I . have a stuffed animal of a mongoose that's been everywhere with me. 'My . husband bought her for me when we were just dating, and ever since she's . followed me to work conferences in Hawaii and internships in . California. I'd love to take her to Mars, too. Josh . Richards, Australia from Australia said: 'If there was one thing I . could take to Mars it would be my semi-acoustic ukuele named Amanda. 'It has travelled around the world and has never failed to lift my spirits or those around me.' Ben . Pearce, a self-confessed 'momma's boy' from Canada said: 'I've spent a . couple of years working in the software industry, sitting at my desk . writing tedious code and I began to wonder: is this it? 'There . are so many profound scientific questions that can be answered if we . set out and explore the red planet, that I would be remiss if I didn't . apply. 'What gets . me through the idea of leaving my friends and everyone I love forever is . the knowledge that this settlement is bigger than my relationships; . bigger than anyone's relationships, because it will truly impact the . entire planet.' Rickard . Feiff, from Sweden said:'Columbus could have skipped going west and . waited a few hundred years for satellite technology to tell him what's . was out there. He did not wait, nor will (or should) we. 'I'm . a correctional officer in the Gothenburg jail, working with people that . are in desperate need of positive contact and change. 'It is a great insight into the human mind and a chance to work with the betterment of ones fellow humans. Pamela . Nicoletatos, mother from Netherlands who home-schooled her two sons . said: 'I've always had a passion for space and scientific discoveries. 'Humanity is more than just Earth, or even our solar system, but rather a small fraction of what all the Universe holds. 'I . hope to only inspire others to have an innate curiosity for adventure, . discovery and a desire to see things outside of the box. I just honestly . think it is an opportunity of a life time and would be a shame to pass . up.' As of the application deadline a week ago, more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars . The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by . engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the . broadcasting rights to the mission. The . applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their . lives – and be filmed for a reality TV programme, said the company . behind the mission, Mars One. The . Dutch group wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as . soon as October 2016.  A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. They . added that landing systems will be tested eight times before they are . used to transport humans – a move that Mars One said will make the trips . ‘much safer than moon missions’. The second round will include an . interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to . the third round will compete against one another. The . third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates . for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and . online. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. ‘Going to Mars would make me feel like I am a true Star Trek officer,’ said one applicant, Michael Archavian. He said that if selected he would ‘do a lot of exploring, see the sites, and stay up at night to see the dual moons’ But Dr Veronica Bray of the University of Arizona has expressed concerns about the project. ‘Radiation . exposure is a concern, especially during the trip,’ she said.  ‘This . can lead to increased cancer risk, a lower immune system and possible . infertility.’ The colony . budget is £4 billion, compared to the £1.8 billion spent on Nasa’s rover . Curiosity, the most advanced and biggest robot to ever traverse Mars. Mars . One aims to raise money to help fund the project through a . long-running, global, reality TV show, which will select the first 24 . candidates and follow their training. Viewers . would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth . in ten years’ time. By 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers. Dr Chris Lintoot, from Oxford University, said that while the mission was plausible, the problem would lie in the funding.","Candidates include a Swedish prison guard and a stand-up comedian .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 11:39 EST, 21 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 21 May 2013 . The Fort Hood army doctor awaiting trial for a gun attack that killed 13 fellow soldiers and injured 32, has been paid $278,000 since the shooting on November 5, 2009. Soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the Texas army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat, but the Department of Defense confirmed that Major Nidal Hasan has continued to be paid. The Army said that under the Military Code of Justice, unless Hasan is found guilty, his salary cannot be suspended. Army Specialist Logan Burnett, who was shot three times at the Army Deployment Center, is appalled that the accused gunman is still being paid. Appalled: Logan Burnett, who was shot at Fort Hood, and his wife Torey now struggle to pay for groceries . 'There have been times when my wife and I . cannot afford groceries. We cannot afford gas in our car,' Mr Burnett, who has since retired, said. 'This makes me sick.' If the army psychiatrist had been a civilian employee at the base, the Army could have suspended his pay after only one week, NBC5 Investigates said. Personnel rules for most civilian . government workers allow for 'indefinite suspensions' in cases 'when the . agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a . crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed'. The continued salary is just one of several battles victims of the shooting are fighting. Because the Army classified the shooting as workplace violence rather than being combat related, and refuses to call it a terrorist attack, the gunman's victims have been denied benefits they would ordinarily be entitled to. Trial: Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan will be tried for 13 specifications of premeditated murder . Under the combat related classification, servicemen would be entitled to the pay, Purple Heart retirement and medical benefits afforded to soldiers wounded in war, or during the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. This means that Mr Burnett, who had been due to go to Iraq before the shooting, and the other victims and their families, are missing out of thousands of dollars in benefits and pay each year. On the third anniversary of the shooting, victims filed a lawsuit against the Army to try to win back the rights to the benefits they claim they are entitled to. Mr Burnett was appalled when he was shown a letter from the Department of Defense confirming Hasan had been paid more than $278,000. The letter was a response to a request by NBC5 Investigates under the Freedom of Information Act. Mr Burnett, who now lives in Arizona, said: 'I honestly thought I was going to die in that building.' The former reservist, who needed to undergo surgery several times and still suffers from post-traumatic stress, said the attack was like being in combat. Help: Army medical staff treat their fellow servicemen who were shot in the attack at the Texas base . 'You take three rounds and lose five . good friends and watch seven other people get killed in front of you. Do you have another term that we can classify that as?' he said. His wife, Torey, told NBC5: 'They don't need to be treated like . this. They don't need to sit and fight every day for this benefit or . that.' Shawn Manning, who was shot six times and still has two of the bullets lodged in his body said: 'It was no different than an insurgent in Iraq or Afghanistan trying to kill us.' He estimated that the ‘workplace violence’ classification has cost him almost $70,000 in benefits that would have been available if his injuries were classified as ‘combat related'. ‘Basically, they're treating us like I was downtown and I got hit by a car,’ he told ABC News. The victims are being supported in their fight by Republican Congressman Thomas Rooney. 'We're giving the defendant in this case . every benefit of the doubt. But yet we're not giving the benefits to . the victims,' Mr Rooney, a former Fort Hood prosecutor, said. He has signed a bi-partisan letter urging Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to reclassify the attack as combat related, adding that  the situation has 'resulted in an embarrassing lack of care and treatment for the victims and their families'. 'What happened here was an attack on our military by a terrorist element specifically targeting our military,' Mr Rooney, who represents Florida said. Grief: The family of Aaron Nemelka visit a memorial for the 19-year-old who was one of the Fort Hood victims . The campaigner for veterans' rights added that he would be willing to consider whether Congress should update its rules so that the army could suspend the pay of soldiers accused of harming their fellow servicemen. One of the police officers who helped stop the gunman, said: 'We've asked for the incident to be reclassified from “workplace violence,” of all things, to what it was, which was a terroristic attack.' Sgt Kimberly Munley, who has since been laid off from her job at the base, says the victims have been forgotten by those who promised to care for them. FBI reports showed Hasan was communicating with Al Qaida before to the shooting. The National . Counterterrorism Center also lists the Fort Hood shooting as a 'high . fatality terrorist attack'. The Army turned down further requests from NBC 5 Investigates about Hasan's pay and the classification of the shooting. Its Chief of Media Relations said: 'The Department of Defense is committed to the integrity of the ongoing court martial proceedings of Major Nidal Hasan and for that reason will not further characterize, at this time, the incident that occurred at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009.' It is possible for the Army to recuperate some of Hasan's salary if it demands that he pays for his medical costs after being shot by a police officer. It is not yet clear if the army will do this. Forgotten: Families say the needs of victims have been ignored because of how the attack was classified . It is not the first time that Hasan's salary has been highlighted. In July 2010 Bank of America closed his account and the doctor struggled to find another financial institution willing to accept his army pay, according to Statesman. John Galligan, his civilian attorney, said he and his staff tried to open accounts in Hasan's name at several banks but were turned down. Earlier this year, an army spokesman said any government declaration that Hasan is a terrorist could mean a delay of another 'year or more' in a trial which has already been pushed back several times by lengthy debates over Hasan's beard and other side issues. 'Such an unprecedented action would thwart the real and lasting measure that will bring closure to the grieving and harmed victims, the trial itself,' the Army concluded. Hasan, who had been due to work in Afghanistan at the time of the attack, faces the death penalty if convicted by a military jury on 13 specifications of premeditated murder. The American, who is now paralyzed from the waist down, is due to go on trial later this year.","Army still pays salary to Major Nidal Hasan, who is due to go on trial over Texas shootings .

On Monday the . heartbroken blonde revealed that her face had been so damaged from too . much surgery that she hasn't been able to smile at her baby daughter . Papaya since she gave birth . in 2011. Alicia has two daughters, Georgia, 17, and 16-month-old Papaya. She told The Sun: 'Imagine holding . your baby daughter for the for the first time and not being able to . smile. 'I have been so selfish. Now my dream is for Papaya one day to see her mummy smile back at her for the first time.' In a bid to fix her smile Alicia, who . has declared that she will not have any more surgery unless it is . corrective, underwent a painful procedure that involved . breaking her jaw and nose and having her ears cut off last week. Last week she was seen with a swollen, bloodied face which was the result of a corrective operation to remove all of her facial implants . Alicia lays the blame for her . addiction firmly at the feet of the surgeons who continued to operate on . her despite the obvious signs of Body Dysmorphic Disorder. She told host Holly: 'I am angry with . the surgeons that have done this to me. I wish they had offered me . counselling. I lied about my age, but  I was a young girl and they . didn't need to put me on that path. 'You are playing with people's faces and . you are damaging their looks. I was a model, looks are everything to . me. There are instances of people taking their own lives and I have felt . like that at times. I have thought I can't take this any more, I can't . live like this. The glamour girl started having plastic surgery aged 17 and has spent over £1million on her addiction . Comparing herself to Katie Piper, the former model who was disfigured in an acid . attack, glamour girl Alicia says that her life has been ruined by 'attackers in white . coats'. She says that she was blinded by the predatory surgeons who promised she would look . 'perfect' but instead turned her in to a walking sideshow: 'I often used that word. I took a Barbie doll to one medical consultation to show . them exactly what I was after. 'I . was unwell; addicted to surgery. But none of those doctors tried to . stop me. I think they just wanted my money.' Alicia, seen in 2001 (left) and photographed at home in London in March 2013 (right), has undergone over 350 operations including one to have her toes shortened . Alicia needs to have one more corrective operation to stop her face drooping, but she is urging other women never to have plastic surgery just to make themselves look better . She added: 'I wouldn't let my daughters have surgery. They are beautiful just the . way they are. Don't let your children have surgery, youth is beautiful . in itself, spend any spare cash you have on counselling (if they ask for a boob job), . work on telling them how beautiful they are.' Cosmetic surgeon Dr Angelica Kavouni also appeared on This Morning, and said: 'A surgeon has to make sure that the patient is having surgery for the right motives, but it's not easy, a lot of patients lie about their medical history. 'Most surgeons do pick up telltale signs of dysmorphia and there are strict guidelines. I'm sorry that it didn't happen in this instance. 'But it is an industry, there are lots of commercial practices with no continuity of care. It's not medicine, it's business, big business.'","Model has had more than 350 cosmetic operations .

The Ashes were lost to England today with their third successive defeat by Australia but in the figure of Ben Stokes they at least can take considerable consolation from their failure to retain the most precious prize in cricket. The 22-year-old from Durham, thrown into this series in Adelaide more in desperation than hope, struck a maiden Test century of considerable maturity to keep Australia waiting for a moment of triumph that had seemed guaranteed. England, so bereft of runs from all their leading batsmen so far, went into the final day of the third Test needing a miracle if they were to pull off the highest successful run chase in the history of Test cricket.

While there was . Stokes, born in New Zealand to a rugby league professional who made his . life with his family in Cumbria, there was hope for England as he batted . calmly but with authority in company with Matt Prior. And . as England’s quest to make 504 was whittled down to a target of fewer . than 200 Australians became ever so slightly twitchy, a sure sign the tourists have missed a huge opportunity here by failing to put them under . pressure. It is no . exaggeration to say that Prior, for one, is playing for his future after . a dismal summer and now winter but he played well until yet another . brainstorm and yet another bad shot to gift Johnson his . wicket. Stokes was . undeterred and moved to a century that could provide the launching pad . for a long England career before lunch, celebrating with commendable . moderation because of the seriousness of his team's plight. England . went to the interval having added 81 in the first session for the loss . of just Prior, leaving them 172 still to get with four wickets left, but . the break allowed Australia to regroup and they returned once again the . dominant side.

The extent of their superiority . here has been both emphatic and surprising and they are worthy winners . of a prize that has eluded them for seven years. So .

Australian side whereas this one is not so England have no shortage of . motivation in the final two Tests of this series to avoid what would be . an even greater humiliation.

"By . Kerry Hudson . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 14 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:21 EST, 14 December 2013 . Reassured: Kerry Hudson, who is 14 weeks pregnant, has a bipolar-type mental health condition . It was the stuff of nightmares: a vulnerable, mentally ill woman held against her will and forced to give birth by caesarean. By her own horrifying account, her newborn daughter was snatched by ‘social workers’ from her breast and spirited away, to be adopted – the mother simply left to howl in anguish. Hearing the case of Alessandra Pacchieri, who was in Britain to attend a training course and is now back in her native Italy, a senior Milanese judge called it ‘an extreme act of violence’, and akin to a horror movie. And, on first reading, it would seem there was some sinister agenda at play – a fragile mental health patient who had her unborn child stolen from her womb. For me, though, the case held particular terror. You see, like Alessandra, I suffer a bipolar-type mental illness. And I am pregnant. Like her, I too made the decision – although with full consent of my doctor – to come off medication, to prevent any harm to my unborn child. But we now know Alessandra’s experience is not as it first appeared. No one can doubt her anguish, yet the reality of the complex and very sad situation is not quite as she saw it. And knowing that there were professionals around to make decisions that could well have saved her and her child’s life when she was unable to do so herself, reassures me. The caesarean birth was necessary because she’d had one previously and a natural labour could have resulted in uterine rupture. It was eerie timing that, just a few days before Alessandra’s story came to light, my colleague Erica Camus wrote in these pages about how the medical establishment is geared  up to support women with mental health problems who wish to start  a family. Erica, who has a history  of schizophrenia, is exploring her options and isn’t yet ready to start a family. My partner and I were not so well prepared when, in late September, I discovered I was five weeks pregnant. I had been told by gynaecologists while in my mid-20s that I would have fertility problems as a result of polycystic ovary syndrome and fibroids. I’m now 38, and I didn’t think I’d ever be a mum. After confirming the pregnancy with my GP, I made an appointment with my regular psychiatrist. He made me an immediate referral to see a perinatal specialist, a psychiatrist who supports expectant mothers with a mental health diagnosis during pregnancy, and for up to 12 months after birth. I made the decision almost immediately that I wanted to stop taking the four medications I use to control my condition, as there is a risk of damage to the foetus. Initially, my doctors advised me not to – it’s a case of weighing up the risks versus the benefits – but I was insistent. Life-saving decision: Alessandra Pacchieri's caesarean birth was necessary because she¿d had one previously and a natural labour could have resulted in uterine rupture . I take an antidepressant, which I had to be weaned off over two weeks as suddenly stopping can cause panic attacks. I was also referred for an early scan, at eight weeks,  to check that the drugs hadn’t already affected the baby’s heart. Thankfully, everything was fine. Among the army of healthcare professionals assigned to me as a pregnant woman, I also have a mental health midwife. I’ve not yet met her, but I am told they are specialists in the emotional side of pregnancy and motherhood. They all form my dedicated community mental health team (CMHT) – every woman similar to me will have one – who communicate with each other about my case. Bar a few mood swings in the first trimester that most pregnant women experience, I feel more stable now than I have in recent memory. Maybe it’s something to do with the healthy routine I have been sticking to, something I feel I need to, as it’s not just me any more. I never used to eat breakfast, but now I’m eating three times a day.  By early evening I’m exhausted, so I go to bed earlier and get up earlier, absorbing more daylight. I’m taking recommended pregnancy supplements, working harder, making plans, and have a focus. But I am being monitored and have been advised that even though my partner is brilliantly supportive, I may need to spend some time in a mother and baby unit – like a nursing home but for new parents with diagnoses like mine – after the birth. A combination of lack of sleep and hormonal changes means there is a high risk that women with bipolar can suffer post-natal psychosis and a facility like this is equipped to support me, and nurse my baby, if that happens. My CMHT have a duty to make a referral to child services around the time of birth. Initially I was concerned. Would they deem me unfit to be a mother? But I was confusing child services with child protection, a different thing altogether. Child services offers initial support, making sure you are coping with everything, if, and only if, needed. Soon, at 32 weeks, a month and a half shy of my due date, there will be a meeting: a room filled with my CMHT team, social services, my family, and partner. This is part of an ongoing dialogue. Decisions aren’t made for me. Just like any patient, ultimately what I do is down to me. But should I become ill, I might not cope so well, and in that case these people will act in my baby’s and my own best interest. It would distress me to think that, having seen the outcome of Alessandra’s ordeal, a pregnant woman would rather suffer in silence because she now feels that asking for help could result in having her child taken away. Like her, in the past, I have voluntarily been admitted to hospital for treatment when I felt I needed help. But I would like to think this will  be recognised not as weakness, but as making positive decisions regarding my health. Episodes, as we call them, are only temporary. Often there are many months, years or decades of wellness. Unfortunately we tend to come under scrutiny only during the bad times. Bipolar people are just like anyone else, and we can make darn good mothers, too. seesaw-seatingplan.blogspot.com .","Kerry Hudson suffers from a bipilar-type mental illness .

Bruce Reynolds, the crook regarded as the mastermind of the Great Train Robbery, died yesterday aged 81. His death after a short illness came months before the 50th anniversary of the 1963 heist in which a gang escaped with a then record £2.6million – about £40million in today’s money. A career criminal who enjoyed the high life and drove an Aston Martin, Reynolds was a notorious jewel thief and housebreaker who formed the 17-strong gang which held up the Royal Mail travelling post office in Buckinghamshire as it ran between Glasgow and London. Mastermind: Bruce Reynolds, who organised the Great Train Robbery, has died aged 81 . Arrest: Reynolds being taken away by police in November 1968 after spending five years on the run . Reynolds, left, with his wife Frances, Barbara Daly and her husband, John . Reynolds was considered the inspiration for Michael Caine's 1965 depiction of fictional spy Harry Palmer (above) in the film The Ipcress File . Nicknamed Napoleon, he bought his shoes at Lobb, his shirts from Jermyn Street and his suits in Savile Row  and was considered the inspiration for Michael Caine’s 1965 depiction of fictional spy Harry Palmer in the film The Ipcress File. After the robbery, using a series of aliases and a false passport, Reynolds went on the run in Mexico and Canada for five years with his wife and young son before returning to Britain when the cash ran out. Justice eventually caught up with him in Torquay in 1968. When Tommy Butler, the Flying Squad detective who arrested him there, said: ‘Hello, Bruce, it’s been a long time’, Reynolds replied: ‘C’est la vie’. The last of the robbers to be caught, Reynolds was sentenced to 25 years in jail. He was released on parole in 1978 and moved, penniless, into a tiny flat off London’s Edgware Road. In the 1980s he was jailed for three years for dealing amphetamines. Gang: Reynolds, centre, with his accomplices Buster Edwards, Tom Wisbey, Jim White, Roger Cordrey, Charles Wilson and Jim Hussey in 1979 . His wife Frances, who had changed her name to Angela, died a couple of years ago, and he lived out his last years in Croydon, south London. In his memoirs, written in 1995, he said the Great Train Robbery proved a curse which followed him around and no-one wanted to employ him, legally or illegally. ‘I became an old crook living on hand-outs from other old crooks,’ he said. His musician son Nick Reynolds, whose group Alabama 3 produced The Sopranos theme tune Woke Up This Morning, yesterday announced the death of the Great Train Robber. Heist: The train which was targeted by the robbers pictured soon after the crime . Record: The haul, worth over £40million in today's money, was the biggest robbery in British history . ‘He hadn’t been well for a few days and I was looking after him,’ he said. ‘I really can’t talk at the moment. I can confirm that he has passed away and he died in his sleep.’ The robbery went on to be the subject of several films and books, with a tawdry glamour attaching itself to the notorious crime – even though the train driver was violently attacked and all the robbers eventually caught. No guns were used, but driver Jack Mills was coshed and left unconscious by an unidentified assailant, suffered constant headaches for the rest of his life and died in 1970 from leukaemia. Scene: The bridge where the bandits held up the train and attacked its workers . Carnage: Inside a carriage of the mail train in the aftermath of the robbery in 1963 . More than £2million of the gang’s haul was never recovered. Seven of the gang, including its most infamous member Ronnie Biggs, were given 30-year sentences in 1964 after judge Edmund Davies called it ‘a crime which in its impudence and enormity is the first of its kind in this country’ and said he hoped the length of the sentences would ‘ensure that it is the last of its kind’. Biggs lived as a fugitive in Brazil for 36 years after escaping from Wandsworth Prison before finally returning to Britain to face jail in 2001. Aged 83, he was released on ‘compassionate grounds’ in 2009, has suffered a series of strokes and is now so frail he is unable to speak. Cash: Detectives search through sacks of banknotes which were stolen in what was then a record robbery . Investigation: A policeman picks up the train driver's hat from the railway tracks near the ambush site . Father and son: Reynolds with his son Nick, an artist who is a member of the band Alabama Three . Yesterday Biggs’s son Michael said: . ‘Regardless of whatever mistakes Bruce made in his life, Bruce was a . very, very kind person who was a true gentlemen who made many friends in . his life. Bruce was my father’s closest friend, they met in borstal . when they were 13. Biggs’s son claimed: ‘He was very old . school. He was absolutely against violence and deeply upset about what . happened in the Great Train Robbery. ‘He believed that if you are going to . be a criminal then be one but don’t go mugging old ladies. The attack . on the driver was something that did upset everyone involved.’ Leonard ‘Nipper’ Read, the Scotland . Yard detective who successfully pursued the robbers, said: ‘It really is . the end of an era. It was certainly a well-organised operation and . Reynolds was the pioneer.’ Notorious: Ronnie Biggs, pictured left at the time of the robbery and right in 2011, is the best-known of the gang after escaping from prison and spending decades on the run .

"By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 08:29 EST, 17 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:56 EST, 18 December 2013 . Bradley Murdoch, who was convicted for murdering Peter Falconio, has filed an application for leave to appeal . The man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback 12 years ago today launched a dramatic new move to win his freedom. Bradley Murdoch, now 55, was sent to jail for life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the murder of Mr Falconio, 29, while he was travelling through central Australia with his British girlfriend Joanne Lees, who was 28 at the time, in 2001. Murdoch has always insisted on his innocence - and today, through a team of lawyers, he filed an application for leave to appeal in the Criminal Court of Appeal in the Northern Territory. ‘The entire case against him has more holes in it than a Swiss cheese,’ Mr Andrew Fraser, an investigator working with Murdoch's legal team, told the Daily Mail. Mr Falconio’s body has never been found after Miss Lees told police that she and her boyfriend had been waylaid by a stranger who drove up beside them at night and indicated there was something wrong with their camper van. She said that when Mr Falconio went to the rear of the vehicle she heard what she thought was a gunshot. The stranger then partially bound her with home-made handcuffs, she said, and bundled her into his four-wheel-drive vehicle. But she was able to escape and hid in roadside bushes. It was a year before police arrested Murdoch. But today his legal team said in the appeal papers that the prosecution had made a serious error. The papers allege that ‘the crown prosecutor in the original trial, Rex Wild QC, improperly groomed the star crown witness, Joanne Lees, in how to give her evidence,’ Murdoch’s barrister, Peter Faris, QC, said in a statement. ‘This allegation brings into question the entirety of Lees’ evidence,’ he said. It is understood the legal team, who have been examining every minute detail of the case against Murdoch for years, decided to strike after reading comments allegedly made by former prosecutor Mr Wild in an interview with a Sydney newspaper. Murdoch, now 55, was sent to jail for life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the murder of Mr Falconio (left), 29, while he was travelling through central Australia with his British girlfriend Joanne Lees (right), who was 28 . In that article, Mr Wild was reported to have said that he considered Miss Lees a risky witness because he could never quite fathom her, not that he ever doubted her. He was quoted as saying: ‘It was all explained to her: be yourself; let it all hang out; the jury will want to see your raw emotions. ‘But no. Stiff upper-lip. It was not as though she was an upper-class girl - she was middle class. But she was not going to let these people get at her.’ The defence team, the Mail has learned, has gathered a number of witnesses who are ready to challenge scientific evidence brought against Murdoch. Among the crucial points, should Murdoch win the right to appeal, will be the credibility of DNA evidence and what was found in blood that had pooled on the road where the rear of the couple’s campervan had been parked. Mr Falconio's body has never been found after Miss Lees told police that she and her boyfriend had been waylaid by a stranger . Murdoch’s lawyers are expected to challenge the strength of evidence that stated that it was the outback drifter’s DNA that was found on a T-shirt being worn by Miss Lees on that night of July 14, 2001. She claimed that Murdoch had struggled violently with her after dragging her from the campervan and had sat on her as he tried to bind her legs together. Yet, Murdoch’s supporters have always asked, why was only a ‘speck’ of DNA found. What was said to have been Murdoch’s DNA will now also come under scrutiny. The spreading pool of blood has also come into question by Aboriginal trackers that the Mail spoke to in the days after the dramatic events near the hamlet of Barrow Creek, north of Alice Springs. After closely examining the blood they said they could not understand why there were no ants crawling on it, insisting they would have moved in on it even though it was winter time in Australia. The Aborigines said there might have been ‘something in the blood’ that turned ants away, indicating that the pool was not fresh. At the time of Murdoch’s trial, which saw him convicted in 2005, Miss Lees’ story was questioned by his defence team. They asked her how she had managed to scramble from the cabin into the rear of the vehicle said to have been driven by Murdoch when the cabin was sealed and the only access to the rear was through the back entrance. When she told the court that perhaps she had been pushed in through the canvas sides of the four-wheel-drive, it was claimed that could not have been possible because Murdoch had erected a metal grill under the canvas as a deterrent to thieves.","Bradley Murdoch sentenced to a minimum 28 years for murder of Mr Falconio who was travelling through Australia with girlfriend Joanne Lees .

At this time of year, you might expect Santa to welcome any attempt to lighten his load. But Father Christmas has walked out of one of Britain’s busiest grottos – complaining that children did not get enough time to tell him their wishes. The man behind the white beard, Mike Daviot, also accused organisers in Edinburgh of overcharging for a ‘tacky and disappointing’ experience in which political correctness put a stop to the time-honoured tradition of sitting on Santa’s knee. Hanging his hat up: Mike Daviot, 55, resigned from his job as Santa at a . grotto in Edinburgh amid complaints he was grumpy with the children - . but he says he was spied on by elves . Yesterday, the Mr Daviot said he had quit in protest at his ‘bland and formulaic’ script and time constraints, saying: ‘It’s nothing more than a cattle-herding exercise to keep the visits as short as possible so they can get as many people through the door as possible and make a lot of money. ‘The kids are only getting about a minute in the grotto and if they ask a question which isn’t in the script you are supposed to ignore them.’ Mr Daviot, 55, resigned after just a week at the attraction in East Princes Street Gardens, where families pay £5 per child to visit Santa’s grotto. He admitted breaking the rules by deviating from the set text and allowing some infants to sit on his knee, which earned him a formal warning from organisers Underbelly. Mr Daviot, who was one of three Santas working shifts at the grotto, said: ‘All of the advertising said children would get to sit on Santa’s knee. 'That leaves Santa in the incredibly difficult position of trying to explain nicely that they can’t. ‘I eventually came to this decision that very young children – under a year old – could sit on my knee at the parents’ request.’ In a letter to the Scotsman . explaining his decision to resign, Mr Daviot added: 'I quickly . discovered to my cost that digressions from the bland, formulaic script . were being reported to management by the female elves working as Santa’s . helpers. 'We were, in fact, being spied on.' Festive fun: Mr Daviot worked as one of three Father Christmases at the Santa's grotto in Edinburgh . The actor, who lives in Edinburgh, also complained there were no lavatories for staff and nowhere to store personal belongings. A spokesman for Underbelly insisted the time spent in their grotto ‘compared favourably’ with others and said it had been hoped that children could sit on Santa’s lap, but organisers had been advised against it by a child protection expert. A spokesman for Underbelly said: 'Unfortunately, Mr Daviot was a Bad Santa who decided to leave Edinburgh’s Christmas of his own accord on 13 December. 'However, if he had continued to flout the guidelines, he would have been dismissed and sent back to Lapland. 'He . was given a formal warning on 12 December for contravening company . guidelines for allowing children to sit on his knee, before choosing to . resign. 'We were very disappointed by this but we were right to act on the experts' advice.' He added: ‘On a more positive note, a . new Santa has just arrived all the way from Lapland and is happily . settling into his new grotto.’ One grotto worker said: 'He was a really grumpy Santa. Everyone loves the job, but he seemed to hate it. 'He didn't get on with anyone, even the elves, and was very brusque with the children and their parents. 'He would interrupt the children, saying: ""I'm talking now""' - unnamed grotto worker . 'He didn’t get on with anyone - even the elves.

Mr Daviot insisted he had not been grumpy with the children, saying: 'Quite the opposite - and that's what the fuss was about. 'I was actually making an effort to interact with the children rather than just sticking to anunbelievably bland script. 'I became grumpy with the way the whole thing was being run but I wasn't grumpy with the children.'

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:49 EST, 17 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:02 EST, 17 December 2013 . A judge ruled yesterday that one of the Muslim fanatics who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby has no defence to the charge of murder. Mr Justice Sweeney said nothing Michael Adebolajo, 29, had offered in evidence about killing the 25-year-old soldier ‘amounts in law to a defence’. The judge told the jury to ignore Adebolajo’s claim that he is ‘a soldier of Allah’ who is ‘justified in doing what he did’. Scroll down for video . Final statements: As the trial of the men accused of murdering Lee Rigby draws to a close, Justice Sweeney, left, told jurors to dismiss Michael Adebolajo's, right, defence that he was a 'soldier of Allah' Bereaved: Relatives of murdered fusilier Lee Rigby (left to right) stepfather Ian Rigby, mother Lyn Rigby, sister Sara McLure and fiancée Aimee West, who have attended every day of the trial . Victim: The alleged murderers of Lee Rigby cut his throat because it was 'humane' and carried it out because they were 'at war', a court has heard . Adebolajo has repeatedly told the Old . Bailey that the killing near Woolwich Barracks in South East London on . May 22 was an act of war aimed at changing British foreign policy in . Muslim countries. Michael Adebowale, 22, his co-defendant, has refused to take the stand and no other evidence has been offered on his behalf. The case continues to be heard because the onus is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendants. Jurors returned to court yesterday for the closing speeches in the case from prosecution and defence barristers. Message to jury: Justice Sweeney (pictured) told the court: 'I have ruled that nothing he [Adebolajo] said in evidence, such as he was a soldier of Allah, amounts to a law to a defence to this count' In . his closing speech, Richard Whittam, QC, prosecuting, said the . ‘barbarous’ actions of the defendants were ‘indefensible in the law of . this country’, but added: ‘Islam, one of the world’s great religions, is . not on trial and nor can it be.’ Adebolajo’s . barrister David Gottlieb suggested in his closing speech that his . client was obeying a command from God and did not form the intention for . murder. Adebolajo has told the court he loved Al Qaeda and wanted to change British foreign policy by killing the 25 year-old Fusilier. He added: 'I am a soldier. This is war.' The judge also told the jury they did not have to reach a verdict on the second charge of conspiracy to murder as this was dealt with by the attempted murder charges. He added: 'Neither side will suffer any disadvantage as a result of its removal so for good reason I am going to discharge you from any further consideration of count two and it will play no part in my directions of law to you in due course.' Drummer Rigby's family were again there to hear the evidence. Beginning his closing speech, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said that after he was run over, according to Adebolajo: 'Lee Rigby was slain by a mujahideen who struck his neck with a sharp instrument and sawed until his head almost became detached. Gunfire: The armed officers shot Adebowale, right, and Adebolajo, left on the floor after they hacked to death their victim in a Woolwich street . Shocking: This is the Vauxhall Tigra that was used during the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby which was shown in court during the trial of Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22 . Evidence: . This giant knife was found on the passenger seat of the vehicle that . ploughed into Drummer Rigby at 40mph on May 22. It was not used in the . killing . 'That is how he viewed the first part of his actions. It will be for you to decide the evidence in this case and to consider his acceptance that both he and his co-defendant are responsible for killing Lee Rigby. Testimony: Michael Adebolajo said he loved Al Qaeda and said its members were his 'brothers' 'He denies murder and he does not accept the barbarous reality of what they did and the intimidation of the public and all those present.' Mr Rigby, a father-of-one from Middleton, Rochdale, Lancashire, was a member of the Corps of Drums in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment. He was knocked over by a Vauxhall Tigra driven by Adebolajo and Adebowale as he crossed the road near Woolwich Barracks in south London on 22 May this year. Adebolajo then attempted to decapitate the soldier while Adebowale stabbed him in the torso before the pair dragged his mutilated body into the middle of the road. Both men were shot by armed police at the scene. Recounting the events of May 22 and the prosecution's case, Mr Whittam showed the jury once again images of bloodied knives, and also replayed the video clip in which Fusilier Rigby is seen being hit by a Vauxhall Tigra. 'What was the consequence of driving into Lee Rigby?' asked Mr Whittam. 'The consequence was it broke his back.' Replaying a video clip showing Fusilier Rigby being dragged into the road, Mr Whittam said: 'Is this a humane killing? Background: Adebolajo, 28, pictured in a police interview, was brought up as a Christian but became a Muslim when a student at Greenwich University . 'Is this a killing with an attempt to decapitate and then deposit the body in the middle of the road causing traffic to stop and turn around?' Mr Whittam recalled witness accounts previously read to the jury as well as extracts from a note handed to Amanda Donnelly-Martin at the scene. 'You will have to consider if that's a suicide note,' he said. 'Note that it contains the phrase ""If I live beyond this day"". 'What was the purpose of what they have done, killing Lee Rigby in the way the had done, in putting the body there and staying at the scene? 'To borrow a phrase from the first defendant - carnage.' Last seen: Drummer Rigby was seen here getting off a DLR train at Woolwich Arsenal Station, just before he was hacked to death on May 22 . Mr Whittam turned to the charge of attempted murder of a police officer and described the defendants' actions when police arrived at the scene. He told the jury not to be 'seduced by suggestions that the sole objective was to commit suicide'. Describing Adebolajo's movement, the prosecutor said: 'He had a meat cleaver, a weapon that needed to have direct contact. He raised the weapon above his head and got very close to the vehicle.' Describing Adebowale's movement, he said: 'Did he run straight at the vehicle to be caught? He ran along the wall. Why? To draw fire.' Whittam said: 'What these two men did, crashing their car and breaking the back of Lee Rigby and then killing him is indefensible in the law of this country.' He went on: 'Killing to make a political point, to frighten the public, to put pressure on the Government or as an expression of anger is murder and remains murder whether the government in question is a good one, a bad one, or a dreadful one.' 'Brutal': The two men accused of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (second right) hacked at Lee Rigby like 'he was a tree', witnesses said . David Gottlieb, for Adebolajo, quoted from a poem by First World War poet Edmund Blunden, called Report On Experience, and told the jury that religion had been a 'red herring' in the case. He went on: 'All deaths outside of lawful deaths are cruel, needless and unnecessary. 'Do you think really that this is the cruellest, most sadistic, most callous, most cowardly killing that's ever occurred in our nation's history? It isn't.' Mr Gottlieb suggested that rather than murder, the proper charge for Adebolajo would have been 'treason, terrorism, or maybe manslaughter' - but later corrected himself by telling the jury that this has no legal basis as a defence. Tragedy: Drummer Lee Rigby relaxing on leave from the Army in the year before his death, which was described in detail yesterday . The defending barrister also suggested that Adebolajo was 'the most law-abiding terrorist in the history of this country' as his client paid for a parking ticket moments before the alleged murder took place. Mr Gottlieb told the jury that they 'genuinely have a choice' to acquit his client, and that they will be under pressure 'from outside, from the mob, from the world, to convict'. Turning to the attempted murder charge, he said it is 'possibly the most ridiculous charge ever put before a judge and jury in the history of this country'. Mr Gottlieb told the jury that there were unarmed police near the scene, but Adebolajo chose to wait for armed teams, which would not fit with an intention to kill an officer. He had also underlined passages about martyrdom in documents found by police. The barrister went on to tell the panel of eight women and four men that the issue of what motivated Adebolajo 'raises awkward questions' for the UK's political leaders. He said: 'A person, a human being, can do the most evil act in the world and not actually be evil themselves.' The barrister went on: 'All I'm asking on behalf of my client is that you try this case according to the same standards that you would for anybody else.' Adebowale, also known as Ismail Ibn Abdullah, of Greenwich, and Adebolajo, also known as Mujaahid Abu Hamza, of Lewisham, both deny murder and attempted murder of police officers. The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.","Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale admit killing Lee Rigby in May .

'Of the eight million traditional Christmas trees in the UK only around two million ever get recycled. I thought that was a dreadful waste.

From 2001 to 2011, the number of foreign-born residents rose by 2.9million. Yet in the 50 years beforehand only an extra 2.7million arrived from abroad. The figures – published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday – show the impact of Labour’s open-door immigration policy. A new wave of migrants, from Romania and Bulgaria, is expected in the new year when labour market restrictions are lifted. The two countries are the poorest in the EU and it is thought as many as 50,000 of their citizens a year will decamp to Britain. The influx of Poles from 2004 has made them the second largest foreign-born group in the country, behind only Indians. Because of the upheaval of the Second World War they occupied the same position in the 1950s, but then behind the Irish. Successive decades saw the arrival of waves of Caribbeans, Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. This . pushed the foreign-born population up from 1.9million in 1951 to . 4.6million in 2001. By 2011, it had soared to 7.5million, fuelled . largely by arrivals from Eastern Europe. It means 13 per cent of the population of England and Wales now comes from abroad compared with just 4.3 per cent in 1951. IRELANDMigration to Britain dates back to the famine of 1840s and 19th century industrialisation. But numbers have fallen in recent years, because younger generations have not replaced older Irish who have died.POLANDIn the wake of the Second World War Poles were the second largest group of foreigners in the UK, but through the latter 20th century were overtaken by Pakistan, Germany and USA. When Poland joined the EU there was a 10-fold increase in Poles in England and Wales from 2001 to 2011. INDIAIn 1951 India was the third highest country of birth and the Indian population in the UK almost doubled between 1961 and 1971. From 1961 until 2001 Indian-born was the second highest ranking non-UK country of birth and in 2011 became the largest foreign born population.PAKISTANThe third highest foreign-born population since the 1980s, the Pakistan-born population grew fastest between 1961 and 1971 to 136,000. Like India, the numbers have been fuelled by people moving to join family members and studying in the UK.JAMAICAIn the top 10 since 1961, the Jamaican-born population grew fastest from 1951, peaking in 1971 at 171,000 before falling to 160,000 in 2011. ‘Migration . has contributed to just under half – 45 per cent – of the total . population change of the last 60 years,’ the ONS report said. Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch think-tank said the statistics confirmed an influx without precedent in British history. ‘It . is impossible to believe that this has happened by accident over such a . long period. It could only have been deliberate policy.’ Sir Andrew . said. Two former Labour home secretaries apologised last month for . blunders over Eastern European immigration. Jack Straw said the policy had been a ‘spectacular mistake’ while Alan Johnson admitted ‘they got the sums wrong’. The . ONS report said: ‘Migration broadly is influenced by push and pull . factors at source and destination, including economic condition, . personal and national, pre-existing connections through family and . cultural links, and political factors. ‘Cultural . factors, including education and the wide use of the English language . globally are also pertinent. 'Historic and Commonwealth ties may have . influenced migrants’ choice of destination country.’ In . some cases the ONS picture is skewed by historic movements of British . people to foreign countries. People from India living in the UK include . those, such as Cliff Richard or Joanna Lumley, born during the last . years of imperial rule. The 7.5million figure for the number of foreign-born residents may be far too low, because it takes no account of illegal immigration. A study from the London School of Economics estimated the number of people with no right to be here ranges from 417,000 to as high as 863,000. Many will be overstayers who have remained after visitor or education visas ran out. Others will be asylum seekers who have not returned home when their claims to refugee status have been rejected, or people who have smuggled themselves in, some from Calais to Kent ports. Similarly, . many German-born people here are children of British soldiers who . served in Germany in the years after 1945. ‘For each of the top five . non-UK countries of birth in 2011, migration to the UK in substantial . numbers began at different times,’ the report said. ‘The . Republic of Ireland had an earlier historical flow, with 38 per cent of . Irish-born residents in 2011 arriving before 1961. By contrast 86 per . cent of Polish-born residents arrived in 2004 or later.’ The Indian-born population doubled between 1961 and 1971, and the Bangladeshi-born population doubled in the 1980s, it said. The . major increase in immigration after 2001 included, alongside Poles and . Eastern Europeans, increases in migration from Nigeria, Nepal, the . Philippines, Spain and China, the ONS found. More than 100,000 Nigerians arrived in the decade, spurred by civil conflict at home and opportunities in England. The . report added: ‘A peak in arrivals of Spanish-born residents can be seen . in the period 2007-2009. This is most likely to be related to the . economic crisis.’","In 1951 there were 1.9million non-UK born residents in England and Wales .

With young children inevitably set to ask a barrage of questions about Santa this Christmas, a team of scientists have created a fun guide that attempts to at least answer a selection of them. It was created by the founders of The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair who teamed up with economists from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). They worked out that, based on official population figures, there are 1.6 billion children worldwide set to be visited by Santa this year. Using official global population figures, the Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair and the Centre for Economics and Business Research have attempted to calculate the science of Santa, pictured left. They worked out that 1.6 billion children will need presents globally this year . Based on population figures, Santa will deliver gifts to 1.6 billion children. This requires visiting 5,556 homes a second and eating 150 billion calories in milk and mince pies. With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve. Each child needs 80cm of wrapping, which would stretch 1.5 million miles. The total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion. Prior . to the big night, Santa needs to store all these presents in a . warehouse. Assuming each present average out at 0.008 m3, the . warehouse would need to cover the same space as 240,000 double-decker . buses. But thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the Earth, Santa does have 32 hours to work with. The researchers estimated that Santa will therefore have to visit 5,556 homes every second on Christmas Eve to make sure every child gets a gift. With an average of 2.5 children per household, Santa will need to make 640 million stops on Christmas Eve. If he eats milk and mince pies at each of these addresses, he will consume a total of 150 billion calories in just one night - 60,000 times his daily recommended intake. Assuming each of the 640 homes he visits gives him a 200ml glass of semi-skimmed milk and one mince pie, Santa will have drunk almost 130 million litres of milk by the time he’s finished his deliveries - enough to fill over 50 Olympic swimming pools. He will also have eaten nearly 40,000 metric tonnes worth of mince pies. To work off this extra weight, Santa would need to walk 1.3 billion miles, which is 54,000 times around the circumference of the earth. According to the Big Bang Fair, Santa's elves will use 80cm of wrapping paper for each child, which would stretch 1.5 million miles and the total number of presents would set Santa back £279.27 billion. He would also need to store these presents in a warehouse that covers the same space as 240,000 double-decker busses . The Big Bang experts assume each elf can wrap a present in exactly 10 seconds and at that speed wrapping two presents for every child would require 3,000 elves to work eight hours every day for an entire year to get the job done. Furthermore, if Santa gave two presents to each child the elves would need to use an average of 80cm of wrapping paper for each gift – which works out at a staggering 1.6 million miles of paper. If two metres of wrapping paper costs Santa 99p, this will cost a total of £1.27 billion. Based on these calculations, . Christmas gifts will cost Santa £279.27 billion this year - £30 billion . more than the GDP of his home country of Finland. That would be enough to go around the world 60 times and is more than six times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The researchers estimated that Santa will have to visit 5,556 homes every second this Christmas Eve to make sure every child gets a gift.

Although this . release has been designed as a tongue-in-cheek promotion for the fair, . Paul Jackson, the Chief Executive of EngineeringUK, said: ‘With . Christmas on its way, we thought that calculating the ‘science of Santa’ would be a great way to get young people, parents and even Santa . himself thinking about how important science, maths, engineering and . technology are. Daniel . Solomon, a CEBR economist, added: ‘As our calculations confirm, the . organisation and commitment which Santa and his elves display every year . is incredible. ‘Christmas must be really hard work for Santa and the whole team at the North Pole; I’m sure they enjoy Boxing Day.’ In addition to the Big Bang's figures, Seagate has calculated the disk space required to back up Santa’s list. Based on the world population data for under-14s, taken from the U.S. Global Census, Seagate worked out Santa would receive an estimated 1,843,868,987 letters this year. If each Christmas letter takes up an estimated 500KB when uploaded as a scanned copy, it would take up 859GB of data each year. Letters from India's children would take up the most room with 338MB.  China comes in second taking up 225MB and Nigeria sits in third place taking up 72MB. The UK comes in at number 32 on the list, taking up 10MB of data.","Fun infographic attempts to explain the science behind Santa and his elves .

It is easy for inmates to get drugs in Brixton prison but basic needs such as provision of clean underwear are not being met, inspectors have said. Some wings in the south London prison are limited to two pairs of underwear per man each week, chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said, recommending that inmates who receive prison-issue clothing should have sufficient sets of underwear each week. Illegal drug use was 'high' in the prison and inspectors 'routinely smelt cannabis' when they visited the jail unannounced in July this year, Mr Hardwick said. 'Easy': Drugs are easier to get a Brixton prison than clean underwear, an inspector has said . Brixton was re-roled in July 2012 as a category C and D resettlement prison for the local area and receives a large population of sex offenders. The prison, which opened in 1819 as the Surrey House of Correction, was operating at about 60 per cent over its certified normal capacity, the chief inspector said. 'Many prisoners shared small, cramped cells and some had inadequately screened toilets and because, at the time of the inspection, there was far too little activity for the size of the population, many were locked in their cells for more than 20 hours a day,' he said in his report. Some 30 per cent of prisoners told inspectors it was 'easy' or 'very easy' to get hold of drugs inside Brixton, twice the level of those who said it was easy to get hold of alcohol. But Mr Hardwick said Brixton prison was at 'a turning point' as new and refurbished activity buildings were being worked on. 'This inspection came at a very bad time for the prison - when all the disadvantages of major building works were apparent but none of the advantages of the new provision had yet been realised,"" he said. 'Cramped': The prison was operating at about 60 per cent over capacity, the chief inspector said (file picture) 'However, the fact was that the prison was not yet ready for the category C and D prisoners it now held and too many lacked the opportunities for purposeful activity and rehabilitation they needed. 'Too much was on hold waiting for the new facilities to be ready and some elements of prisoners' treatment and conditions were unacceptable - and had remained so for too long.' Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, the executive agency of the Ministry of Justice that provides offender services in the community and in custody, said: 'Brixton prison was undergoing a significant change when the chief inspector visited, but since then it has continued to adapt to its new role.

A reconstruction of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus, showing its 'cock's comb'. Scientists identified it in a rare mummified fossil of one of the dinosaurs which preserved impressions of soft tissues . 'Until now, there has been no evidence for bizarre soft-tissue display structures among dinosaurs,' said lead researcher Dr Phil Bell from the University of New England in Australia. 'These findings dramatically alter our perception of the appearance and behaviour of this well-known dinosaur and allow us to comment on the evolution of head crests in this group.' 'It also raises the thought-provoking possibility of similar crests among other dinosaurs.' He added: 'An elephant's trunk or a rooster's crest might never fossilise because there's no bone in them. This is equivalent to discovering for the first time that elephants had trunks.' The mummified specimen, from the species Edmontosaurus regalis, was found in rock deposits near the city of Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada . The Edmontosaur was one of the last surviving dinosaurs. It was a plant-eater, probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs. It had about 1,000 teeth. Pictured is a fossil of its skull . The Edmontosaur was one of the last surviving dinosaurs. It was a plant-eater, probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs. Researchers believe it had about 1,000 teeth. It was a slow-moving dinosaur with few defences, but may have had keen senses to help it avoid predators in its swampy habitat. Edmontosaurus is a genus of crestless hadrosaurid - also known as the duck-billed dinosaur. Duck-billed dinosaurs, described as 'gentle giants', roamed North America between 65 and 75 million years ago and grew to about 40 feet in length. They were America's most common dinosaur, filling the same ecological niche occupied by antelopes and deer today. Fossils of the Edmontosaur have been found in western North America, including Montana, USA, and Alberta, Canada.

The mummified specimen, from the species Edmontosaurus regalis, was found in rock deposits near the city of Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada. Scientists were excited when they found evidence of skin impressions. But nothing prepared them for what was to come. 'We have lots of skulls of Edmontosaurus, but there are no clues on them that suggest they might have had a big fleshy crest,' said Dr Bell. 'There's no reason that other strange fleshy structures couldn't have been present on a whole range of other dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex or Triceratops.' The discovery is reported in the latest issue of the journal Current Biology. In roosters and other birds, bright red crests are used to attract mates and deter rivals. The dinosaur's crest may have performed a similar function, the scientists believe. 'We might imagine a pair of male Edmontosaurus sizing each other up, bellowing, and showing off their head gear to see who was the dominant male and who is in charge of the herd,' said Dr Bell.

Charities said thousands of elderly and other vulnerable adults are being denied dignity and peace of mind because of council spending cuts . The number of elderly people being given state-funded care in their homes has dropped by a quarter in just five years, according to official figures. Charities said thousands of elderly and other vulnerable adults are being denied dignity and peace of mind because of council spending cuts. Cash-strapped authorities nationwide are limiting their provision with tougher rules on who is entitled to receive help, despite the need growing as the population ages. A total of 1.3million people receive . state-funded home help, a place in a care home or hot meals – down from . 1.7million in 2007-08. In the last two years, the number of elderly having meals on wheels has almost halved from 45,000 to 23,000. Meanwhile there has been a 12 per cent fall in those receiving home care, from 437,000 to 385,000. Figures . from the Health and Social Care Information Centre also show that the . number with a state-funded place in a care home has fallen by 2 per cent . from 167,000 to 164,000. Caroline . Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘These figures show how . increasingly desperate the care crisis is, with the numbers of people . receiving care falling, as are the number of people being assessed to . see if they need support. ‘It’s clear that frontline cuts are leaving older people struggling on alone whilst living with chronic  illnesses and disability. ‘We already know that there are hundreds and thousands of older people who need help with basic tasks such as washing, dressing or cleaning their teeth and who do not receive it. ‘As local authorities continue to restrict eligibility for the people with highest needs, the situation looks bleaker than ever. Those older people unable to access care are being denied their dignity and peace of mind at the point of greatest vulnerability.’ Figures show the number of people receiving home care has dropped 12 per cent to 385,000 . This month, the charity warned that thousands of elderly residents would be denied help to even get out of bed in the morning under a  Government shake-up. Ministers plan to draw up a national set of rules to determine who is eligible for care. Currently this is determined by councils but has been  condemned as a postcode lottery. However, charities have warned that the bar will be set too high. Under the new system, it is likely the state would only pay for care for the elderly and disabled with  ‘critical’ or ‘substantial’ needs, such as help with eating, drinking and most other basic daily tasks. Those deemed to have moderate needs, such as assistance getting out of bed and washing, would have to pay themselves. Earlier this year, the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity revealed that more than half of councils grant vulnerable residents ‘disgracefully’ short carer visits of just 15 minutes. Over the next year, it is estimated that £1billion will be slashed from the annual social care budget of  £17billion. The same amount was cut last year. Figures obtained by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in May showed that councils cut spending by £991million in 2011-12 and by £890 in 2012-13. Liz Kendall MP, Labour spokesman for Care and Older People said: ‘These figures show that some of the most vulnerable aren’t receiving care under this Government, with hundreds of thousands fewer getting help.’","Cash-strapped authorities limiting provision with tougher rules .

Life Skills: Victoria Overy, headteacher at Chase High school says the mentoring scheme is aimed at pupils who may not have a male role model in their lives . Boys are being taught how to behave like men at school to make up for the lack of male role models at home. The growth of single parent families – most often without a father – means children are growing up without the steadying influence of a strong and caring man. Many end up with a skewed view of life from friends, television or even pornography. Headteachers are bringing in male mentoring schemes which replace the father and son chats that were once a rite of passage. Pupils are being guided through topics such as the right way to ask a girl out, how to treat women and what it means to be a good pupil and friend. Other practical help includes shaving tips, how to be presentable and money management. Chase High School in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, is introducing a scheme from next month. Headteacher Victoria Overy said it was mainly aimed at pupils ‘on free school meals who may not have a male role model in their life’. ‘Young men have a skewed view of what a relationship is like because of the easy access to pornography,’ she added. ‘Sex education often only deals with how not to get pregnant and violent relationships. We want this scheme to teach pupils details on establishing relationships and how to end them without breaking hearts. ‘I have a school full of brilliant male role models and it would be a shame to waste that.’ Danny Chaplin, an art teacher taking part in the ‘man days’, said: ‘Youngsters these days are very desensitised to the world due to computer games, TV and pornography. We need to teach them that women are not sex objects and that it is not all right to pass around pictures of them on mobile phones. Role model scheme: Teachers at Chase High School hope it will improve boys' learning and eventually their academic results . ‘The lessons will teach boys how to approach women, how to take them out and treat them properly.’ Boys will also be offered golf lessons, football tournaments, camping and survival skills to encourage team-building. Girls at the secondary school –which was recently graded ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted inspectors – will have lessons from female teachers covering money management and career aspirations. Help: Pupils are being guided through topics such as the right way to ask a girl out, how to treat women and what it means to be a good pupil and friend . Similar schemes have been introduced at Cornelius Vermuyden School on Canvey Island, Essex, and the Lilian Baylis Technology School in Lambeth, South London. Earlier this year a study of family breakdown warned a million children are growing up in ‘men deserts’ – living without a father and rarely meeting an adult male. In some areas, three in every four families are headed by one parent, the Centre for Social Justice said, claiming it was causing a ‘tsunami of family breakdown’. The effects of family breakups on children are known to include poor school performance, difficulty making friends, bad behaviour, anxiety, depression and a greater chance of drug-taking or crime. A quarter of primary schools did not have a single male teacher in 2010. Two decades ago, men made up four in ten teachers. The shift away from education was linked to the attraction of other graduate jobs and fears of allegations of inappropriate behaviour. But figures last month showed the number of men training to be primary school teachers has surged by nearly a third in five years. Teacher recruitment expert Professor John Howson said: ‘If you haven’t got a male role model at home or at school then it’s a challenge for boys as there is nothing to counteract the sort of role model you get on television.’","Teachers at Chase High School in Westcliff-on-Sea have agreed to help .

Then others arrived to help and soon she was in a . triage area where someone wrote a number on her forehead. 'I just prayed that I had a number that was high enough to get help,' she said.

She was injured in the second explosion while walking with her husband. Haslet said she thought she was going to die . The next day, she woke up at Boston Medical Center and saw her mother. 'I told my mom ""My foot feels like it’s asleep."" And she said, ""Adrianne, you don’t have a foot anymore.”' Nine days after the attack, neither Haslet nor Roche has thought much about the Russian-born brothers, one dead, one alive, whom authorities said are responsible for the attack. As she recovers, Haslet said she trusts law-enforcement officials will do what’s best. She’s hoping to get a prosthetic device in the next two months. Roche cannot bend her left leg, as a grid of metal rods that’s meant to help her heal protrudes into it. She said she isn’t sure if authorities should seek the death penalty for the remaining bombing suspect, but says everyone should move forward without fear. 'If we’re afraid, the enemy wins,' she said.","Adrianne Haslet, 32, to make guest appearance on next week's DWTS .

A pioneering electric car company, which planned to set up networks of battery swapping and charging stations to end drivers' concerns about running out of power has folded. Electric car company Better Place has filed a motion in an Israeli court to wind up the company, bringing an end to a venture whose battery charging network had aimed to boost electric car sales. Better Place partnered with Renault in 2008 to create an electric car system combining charging terminals with battery swap stations to increase the range of electric cars and put an end to drivers' worries about running out of power. Out of juice: Israeli-American electric car company Better Place announced  it was filing a court motion for dissolution after its shareholders refused to provide further funding . It had raised more than £560million from top-tier investors and two years ago said it was valued at £1.5billion. Last August, Better Place secured a £34million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB)- the company's first credit facility from a financial institution - to further develop its global electric car network. But sales never took off, with just over a thousand cars on the road in Israel and Denmark, the first two countries where it began operating. 'The (gasoline-free) vision is still . valid and important and we remain hopeful that eventually the vision . will be realized for the benefit of a better world,' the company's board . of directors said in a statement. 'However, Better Place will not be able to take part in the realization of this vision.' Carmakers . have invested heavily in electric cars, but awareness is growing that . hybrid and battery cars may not be enough to win the race to meeting . rigid EU carbon dioxide emissions limits. Better Place's sales never took off, with only around a thousand cars on the road in Israel and Denmark, the first two countries where it began operating . 'This is a difficult day for all of us,' said Chief Executive Officer Dan Cohen. 'Unfortunately, after a year's commercial operation, it was clear to us that despite many satisfied customers, the wider public take up would not be sufficient,' he said in a statement. The company management, he said, requested the appointment of a voluntary liquidator who would decide on how to award compensation to customers and staff and maintain the network already in place. Sunday's announcement came as no surprise. With its partner Renault, Better Place committed to a production run of 100,000 electric cars for Israel and Denmark, counting on large fleets to sign up. At the same time it developed plans to expand into Australia and then onto markets like China and the United States. Replaced: Founder Shai Agassi was removed as CEO in October, and his successor was named four months later . But the large-scale deals never materialized. Only about 900 of its cars are on the road in Israel, and about 400 in Denmark. Renault could not immediately be reached for comment. In February 2008 it said Renault-Nissan and Better Place had signed an agreement 'to provide the necessary conditions for the successful launch of electric vehicles.' A November earnings report published by conglomerate Israel Corp, which owns about 30 percent of Better Place, said the company had an accumulated deficit of £371million with more losses expected. The company made changes and reduced its workforce. Founder Shai Agassi was removed as CEO in October, and his successor was named four months later. Alan Gelman, chief financial officer and head of operations in Israel, told Reuters at the time that the company knew why it was floundering and was trying to turn a corner. 'We at times were too focused on turning into a global company and expanded too fast, but we have to focus on local operations and selling cars,' he said. After a failed final round of fundraising, Better Place turned to the Tel Aviv area court. 'Revenues are still insufficient to cover operating costs, and in the light of the continued negative cash flow position, the board has decided that it has no option but to seek to make this application to the courts for an orderly liquidation of the company,' it said in a statement. Israel Corp, the largest shareholder in Better Place, said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on Sunday it had decided not to inject more cash into the beleaguered company. Other shareholders include HSBC, GE, Morgan Stanley and Vantage Point Venture Partners. None were immediately available to comment. Gene Gable, a spokesman for Vantage Point Venture Partners, confirmed that the group was an investor in Better Place and since 2008. However, he said he could not disclose the amount of Vantage Point's investment in the electric car venture. 'We are not making any further comment on Better Place right now,' he said. 'We may have a statement later in the week.'","Better Place has filed a motion in an Israeli court to wind up the company .

The secret behind the spacesuits than put man on the Moon has been revealed as a team of seamstresses from underwear firm Playtex. They worked with engineers to design a suit capable of keeping a man alive in orbit - and saw their design work by the Apollo astronauts. The incredible story is set to be made into a major Hollywood movie, it was revealed today. Buzz Aldrin walking on the surface of the moon during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on on July 20, 1969 wearing his handmade spacesuit created by an offshoot of the Playtex company . Every Apollo suit was handmade to fit each astronaut by International Latex Corporation, a division of Playtex . Every Apollo suit was made to fit each astronaut. Each Apollo mission required fifteen suits to support the mission. The main, or prime, three-man crew each had three suits: I for flight; 1 for training; and 1 as a flight back-up in case something happened to their flight . suit, thus a total of 9 suits for the prime crew. The back-up three-man crew each had two suits: I for flight and I . for training. The astronaut corps at that time included between 25 and 27 astronauts. The film, to be called Spacesuit, will be based on a book by Nicholas de Monchaux called  Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo. 'A spacesuit is made out of a flight suit, a Goodrich tyre, a bra, a girdle, a raincoat, a tomato worm,' de Monchaux says in the book. He says the seamstresses were able to sew far more accurately that other teams vying for the Nasa contract. 'They had to sew to a 1/64th of an inch tolerance without using any pins, he told website txchnologist. 'So there was no question that it was kind of a couture handicraft object versus something made according to more conventional military industrial principles. 'Like few others in the whole process, they really had the lives of the astronauts literally in their hands.' He also believe Nasa played down their involvement in the project.

Canadian scientists have discovered artificial sweeteners in water samples collected from the Grand River in Ontario. The sweeteners - found in everything from diet soda to flavored yoghurts - pass through waste-water treatment systems and are then discharged into waterways. In other words: humans consume them, expel them, and they wind up in our waterways. Sweet nothings: Artificial sweeteners are used in low-calorie foods and sodas as a sugar alternative but they persist through sewage treatment and wind up in rivers and waterways . The researchers write in a paper published on PLOS ONE that the sweeteners got into the Grand River from the 30 sewage treatment plants that empty into the river and its tributaries. The Researchers, from Environment Canada and the University of Waterloo sampled the Grand River at 23 separate locations along more than 150 miles of its course. They found concentrations of four sweeteners: cyclamate, saccarin, sucralose and acesulfame, the last of which is particularly resistant to removal. The scientists say its very persistance and the fact that it comes solely from human waste makes acesulfame a good candidate for tracing the movement of treated sewage after it is expelled into rivers and waterways. The Grand River: The large river in Southern Ontario, Canada, is impacted by agricultural activities and urban centers . 'Given the persistent nature demonstrated here and solely human source, we expect that acesulfame will become the most reliable detector of wastewater presence, dilution, and transformation in surface and ground waters,' write the researchers. The researchers write that the concentrations they measured for sucralose, cyclamate, and saccharin are the 'highest reported concentrations of these compounds in surface waters anywhere in the world.' And acesulfame persists at elevated concentrations over a distance of 300km. Having survived the sewage treatment plants, the compounds also persisted through water purification to be found in trace amounts in municipal tap water from homes that draw water from the River Grand. Traceable: The persistence of artificial sweeteners means they're a good way to trace where waste water ends up . The researchers say the effects of artificial sweeteners on aquatic life are largely unknown. But, they write, 'We demonstrate here that aquatic organisms likely experience long-term exposure to significant concentrations' of artificial sweeteners if they reside downriver from water impacted by urban activities. The report is just part of a growing body of evidence that the chemicals humans ingest - anti-depressants, sweeeteners, antibiotics and many other prescription drugs - wind up in our waterway and drinking supplies. So far, researchers are unsure of the longterm effects for humans and the environment are.","Canadian scientists have found elevated levels of artificial sweeteners in the River Grand, Ontario .

A high-speed powerboat inspired by First World War biplanes has become the world's first to 'fly' above the water on futuristic hydrofoils . It's also claimed the boat is one of the most environmentally friendly powerboats in the world because of its minimal drag. Length: 570cm . Width: 740cm . Height: 390cm . Weight: 350 kg . Expected top speed: 50 knots (58mph) Cost: £200,000 . The small but constant amount of drag is achieved using a specially designed hydrofoil, which is a wing-like structure mounted on struts below the hull of a boat. This lifts it out of the water during forward motion. It is the first hydrofoiling personal powerboat ever to go on sale on the open market, but potential buyers will have to spend a staggering £200,000 if they want one. The wFoil Albatross is the result of professional pilot and engineer Tomaz Zore's 10-year bid to design ‘the ultimate joy machine’. The makers of the wFoil Albatross claim it can hit speeds of 70mph thanks to its unique design, which lifts the boat clear of the water . Mr Zore, 48, from Slovenia, said: ‘I wanted to create a machine that would show all the magic of flying to anybody, even without a pilot license. ‘The question of how to combine the sky and the ocean - flying and sailing - into one unique experience would keep me awake at night. ‘That is how the next big thing on the water, the wFoil concept, was born. It is the first hydrofoiling powerboat ever to hit the open market - but potential buyers will have to fork out a staggering £200,000 if they want one . Mr Zore said the design of the wFoil Albatross was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the First World War. A Sopwith F-1 'Camel' from the time is pictured . The hull of the two-seater 18ft boat is handcrafted from mountain spruce, while its foils are made from carbon fibre and its rotor blade is aeronautical-grade aluminium. Mr Zore said the design of the wFoil Albatross was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the First World War. ‘Those years in aviation meant the years of freedom, where you could just seat in the plane, start the engine and fly away,’ he said. ‘There were no air traffic controls, flight plans or millions of regulations. There was just you, the aeroplane and freedom. ‘The same goes for the Albatross. There is no pilot license needed - you just start the engine and fly low above the water.’ Mr Zore is also planning a sailing version of the Albatross with which he hopes to challenge the world record for the fastest wind-powered boat .

They were later ushered out of the courtroom after the men were sentenced and did not speak to reporters. Watts, 34, and England, 21, were charged with first-degree murder, shooting with intent to kill and five hate crimes in the 2012 shootings of William Allen, Bobby Clark and Dannaer Fields, who were killed as they walked near their Tulsa homes on Easter weekend. Two others were wounded - David Hall, who was shot in the stomach and Deon Tucker, who was hit in the shoulder. All five victims were black. Watts is white and England has said he is Cherokee Indian. Watts and England had faced separate trials that were scheduled for early next year. Home to murderers: The gunmen lived together in this one-story house .

District Court Judge James Caputo sentenced both men to three terms of life in prison without parole for the murder convictions. The two were each given two more life terms for shooting with intent to kill and five, one-year prison terms for the hate crimes. 'Justice is served by this result,' Tulsa County First Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond said. 'These killers will spend the rest of their life behind bars for their actions. 'This was a senseless and tragic violent crime that alarmed everyone in our city as well as nationwide,' he added. Rob Nigh, an attorney for England, said a deal from prosecutors had only recently been offered to his client. He said England decided to plead guilty because he wanted to take responsibility for what he had done. 'He has tremendous remorse for what has happened,' Nigh said. 'He was telling the truth when he said he will live with this for the rest of his life.' Some of the brutal details on how the pair carried out their rampage last year came out in a preliminary hearing. England's uncle testified last year that England and Watts treated the mass shootings as a contest and said England used racial slurs to describe the victims the day after the crimes.","Alvin Watts, 34, and Jake England, 21, charged with first-degree murder .

A comet-chasing probe is set to be woken from its deep space slumber early next year, the European Space Agency (ESA) has said. At precisely 10 am GMT on 20 January, the Rosetta spacecraft be brought back to life as it moves closer towards Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenk. When Europe's Rosetta spacecraft wakes, scientists are hoping it will be ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land on the comet. Scroll down for video... When Europe's Rosetta probe gets roused from its deep space slumber next month, scientists are hoping it will wake up fit and ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land a spacecraft on a comet . The scientists are in for an nerve-wracking wait as there is little room for mistakes as the coming months. After it is woken from its slumber, the spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It will then attempt a historic landing in November 2014 the intercepting a 4km wide comet as it hurtles towards the sun. ‘Imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain,’ said Paolo Ferri, head of mission operations at the European Space Agency (ESA). The effort is different from Nasa’s Deep Impact probe that fired a projectile into comet Tempel in 2005, hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study. For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation . Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation. In 2014, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s surface in November. The time for Rosetta to wake up and prepare for this most exciting scientific adventure is now fast approaching. That mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended meeting ESA is planning for its spacecraft. Launched in 2004, Rosetta has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day. The probe had to conduct three fly-bys of Earth and one of Mars, taking advantage of the planets' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet 67P as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph (62,000 mph). The spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy. ESA has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardise the mission: a problem with two of the four `reaction wheels' used to turn the spacecraft, and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvres. ‘This is making our life more difficult,’ Dr Ferri acknowledges. But he added that engineers have found workarounds. If all goes according to plan, the probe's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on, though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order. The following months will involve a gradual approach of 67P, as Rosetta gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what Dr Ferri likened to two planes flying in formation. After it is woken from its slumber, the spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Pictured is an artist's impression of the comet . This will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet, which is about 4km (2.5 miles) in diameter, and identify a good landing site. At the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet's three active regions - where matter appears to be released into space - or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander's sensitive instruments. The lander - called Philae - will drop onto the surface of 67P and latch on using a harpoon, to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet's weak gravity. Using drills, it will dig up samples and analyse them using on-board instruments. Researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results, because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe. ‘This time capsule's been locked away for 4.6 billion years,’ said ESA's director of science Mark McCaughrean. One key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on Earth, he said.","Rosetta will be brought back to life on January 20 at 10am GMT .

An Indonesian volcano is thought be the source of a massive ‘mystery eruption’- the largest that has occurred in the last 3,700 years. The enormous blast, which took place nearly 800 years ago, may have created a ‘Pompeii of the Far East’, according to researchers. They believe this mystery city may lie buried waiting to be discovered on an Indonesian island. The source of the eruption has been narrowed down to the Samalas volcano on Indonesia's Lombok Island. Its location is shown in the bottom image. Today, all that remains is a large crater lake . Researchers claim the volcano could also be one that started a 600-year cold period named ‘the Little Ice Age’. A team, led by Franck Lavigne of . the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, has dated the blast to . between May and October of 1257. The source of the eruption has also been narrowed down to the Samalas volcano on Indonesia's Lombok Island. Today, all that remains is a large crater lake. ‘At the local and regional scales, the socio-economic and environmental consequences of this cataclysmic event must have been dramatic,’ said the report, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers believe the volcano could also be one that started a 600-year cold period named the Little Ice Age . This map shows the large presence of pumice- a very light and porous volcanic rock- of up to 50 mm at . 46-km distance southeast from the vent on Sumbawa. Scientists claim this shows the huge magnitude of the Samalas eruption . The eruption was eight times as large as the Krakatau explosion which occurred in 1883 and twice as large as Tambora in 1815. The blast was so large that it left its mark in the ice of both the Arctic and the Antarctic. To narrow down the source of the explosion, the research team analysed volcanic ejecta chemistry, stratigraphic data, historical writings and radiocarbon-dating results. Professor Lavigne said that while the . eruption was known by many different researchers, the main problem up . until now was they had all been working separately. This map shows the distribution of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) from the Samalas eruption and location of charcoal samples used for radiocarbon dating. The enormous blast, which took place nearly 800 years ago, may have created a 'Pompeii of the Far East', according to researchers . ‘The tropical location, the size of its . caldera, the timing of the eruption, its magnitude, and the match . between the geochemical composition of Mount Samalas ash with glass . shards found in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica,’ wrote the . researchers. The team believe the volcano blasted 10 cubic miles of debris up to 27 miles high into the sky. The fallout settled around the world. Near the volcano itself, it settled into thick deposits that the researchers sampled in over 130 places. Further afield, the volcanic sulphate became locked in ice core samples taken from both Greenland and Antarctica. Tree rings with abnormal growth rates, and historical records from as far as Europe, showed how the eruption disturbed the climate for at least two years. Field observations on the pyroclastic fall layers from the Samalas show the maximum thickness measured exceeds 1 m, and cumulative fall deposit reaches up to 1.60m . Meanwhile, medieval texts describe unusual cold and wet weather the following summer in 1258. Researchers believe that the Samalas volcano had a role in triggering the Little Ice Age. In a 2012 study, scientists used climate models to show that a series of eruptions may have triggered the onset of the Little Ice Age. Although the precise timing varies somewhat, this period is typically considered to have occurred between 1250 and 1850. 'A single eruption could not have caused such long-term climate change,' Erik Klemetti, a geoscientist at Denison University told The Conversation. 'Instead, it had to be a sequence of large eruptions, one of which might be the Samalas volcano.'","Eruption thought to be from Samalas volcano on Indonesia's Lombok Island .

A Toronto Star reporter has sued Mayor Rob Ford for suggesting the journalist was a pedophile in a recent television interview. Ford appeared on a Vision TV interview with former media baron and convicted felon Conrad Black and accused Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale of taking pictures of little kids. Ford said he didn't 'want to say that word but you start thinking what this guy is all about.' Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says he stands by every word he said during a televised interview in which a newspaper reporter claims the politician insinuated he was a pedophile . The day after the interview aired, Ford told reporters that he stands by his words. 'I stand by every word I said with Mr. Black in my interview.' Toronto Star City Hall reporter Daniel Dale (above) hit Ford with a libel notice on Thursday . Ford's insinuation was related to an instance when Dale was close to the mayor's house in May 2012, investigating a plot of public land adjacent to Ford's home that the mayor wanted to buy. Dale has said he was writing a story about the plot so he went to take a look at it when the mayor emerged from his home to confront him. Dale said the mayor's two children were nowhere in sight, nor were any children in sight. He decided to take action after Ford repeated the accusations on a Washington D.C., sports radio show Thursday, saying again that Dale was taking photos outside of his house. Dale said Ford added this: 'When you've got young kids, that freaked me right out.' Writing in his column in the Toronto Stat yesterday, Dale said: 'This isn't quite as egregious as the comment he made to Black, but it brought renewed attention to his malicious and defamatory insinuation to Black that I have some sort of predatory interest in young children - that I am a pedophile. 'I can't tolerate it. I won't tolerate it.' wrote Dale in his article published late Thursday. Dale said the libel notice asks Ford to immediately retract the false insinuation that I am a pedophile and all of his false statements about my conduct on May 2, 2012. Dale said he is also suing Vision TV, which twice broadcast Ford's remarks to Conrad Black. Ford, pictured yawning during an executive committee meeting in Toronto, is yet to quit his post . Dale asks that Ford and Vision owner ZoomerMedia apologize immediately 'publicly, abjectly, unreservedly and completely. 'It had become clear to me that, if I had done nothing, the mayor would make his smears some sort of political talking point. 'His comments to Black were no one-time slip; they seemed to be the first shots in a bewildering campaign against my good name. 'At a Tuesday news conference, he pointedly said he stands by ""every word."" Today, he repeated many of his false claims on American radio', wrote Dale. The disgraced politician has instead responded by going about his usual business in Toronto, he was pictured leaving the City Hall's gym last week . Ford and his brother, councilor Doug Ford, have taken pointed shots at the media, calling journalists maggots. Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced in May when two reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw a video of Ford appearing to smoke from a crack pipe, but they did not obtain a copy. Ford vilified the Star, accusing the paper of trying to take him down. He admitted last month to smoking crack 'in a drunken stupor'. Ford, pictured in another council meeting, has refused to apologise to the lawyer for the claims he made in a TV interview, which he gave alongside convicted fraudster Conrad Black . The argument centers around a conversation Dale and Ford had on the Mayor's Toronto drive-way last year . Toronto Star editor Michael Cooke on Thursday told local broadcast TV station CP24 that the newspaper fully supports and backs Dale's lawsuit. '(Ford) called Daniel Dale probably the worst thing you could call a man, that is a man who takes advantage of children and has sex with them. He called him a pedophile. That is a vicious, awful libel.' said Cooke. A copy of the libel notice was not immediately available. There was no immediate response from Ford or his lawyer to the suit. Vision TV has also refused requests for comment. As well as sticking to his political role, Ford has joined the panel of a sports radio show in Washington DC .","Ford said he was 'freaked out' when Journalist Daniel Dale was at his home .

As the clock strikes twelve on New Years Eve, thousands who have gathered on the banks of the Thames to watch the annual fireworks over London will experience something quite different. This year, the skyline will not only be filled with exploding colours, but peach snow, banana confetti and giant 'zesty orange' bubbles.

Scroll down for video . World's first: Food scientists Bompas & Parr will release 'zesty orange' bubbles, peach snow and banana confetti over the spectators on London's South Bank at the annual fireworks display this year . Food scientist Sam Bompas said they wanted to try to make a multi-sensory firework display because 'nothing of the sort had been attempted before' The idea is to create an experience which is for all senses, one which spectators can see, smell and taste, as the British capital welcomes 2014. Jelly geniuses Bompas & Parr, who famously put a cake-inspired crazy golf course on the roof of Selfridges, have created special effects involving fruit flavours and fruit smells, to go along with the fireworks. Sam Bompas, food scientist, said: ‘The concept of the world's multi-sensory firework display came from researching grand historic spectacles. We realised nothing of the sort had been attempted before and that it would be a genuine world first. ‘We're going to actually let people taste the fireworks.

Fewer than one in five teenagers has a part-time work while they study, heralding the death of the Saturday job. New figures reveal that among 16-18-year-olds just 19.4 per cent of students are also earning money, falling to 14.2 per cent among 18-year-olds. MPs and employers warn thousands of youngsters are missing out on the ‘rite of passage’ in holding job like delivering newspapers or shelf-stacking, leaving them ill-prepared for the world of work. New figures from the Department for Education show how the proportion of teenagers in full-time education who also have a job has fallen sharply in the last decade . Tory MP Damian Hinds, who obtained the figures, said having a Saturday job was a 'rite of passage' for young people to experience the world of work . The economic crash has meant fewer part-time jobs are available for students while increasing numbers of exams mean many feel under pressure to study not work. There are also claims that paper boys and girls have been replaced with ‘more reliable’ adults who are considered less likely to turn up late or quit without warning. From 2001-2004 the number of young 16-18-year-olds with a part-time job was relatively stable at around 475,000. But by 2011 the figure had slumped to 370,000, a drop of more than 20 per cent. In 2002, almost one in three 16-year-olds had a part-time job but a decade later the figure was just over one in six. Tory MP Damian Hinds said young people who did not experience the world of work in a part-time job were missing out. ‘One of the ways you learn the knocks of life is through work,’ he told MailOnline. ‘If there are fewer young people doing Saturday jobs and paper rounds you are that much less likely to get used to having a bad boss and all the things which are like a rite of passage.’ Mr Hinds, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said there were several reasons for the fall. ‘Fewer people now get papers delivered, people don’t have their milk delivered and so on. ‘There . is also something about how hard kids work these days and how much more . they are examined. They are doing more subjects in the lower sixth and . have more exams and they do feel the pressure of academic achievement. In some areas paperboys are being replaced by older people who are thought to be more reliable . ‘I don’t want to force any 15, 16 or 17 year old into any particular job but most of us would say that actually doing some work is beneficial thing. There are things you learn as well as getting some money in your pocket.’ Mr Hind's all-party group on social mobility is examining how prepared young people are for the world of work. Employers said changes in the law made it harder to hire children. Graeme Collins, from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, said that whilst the majority of newspaper deliveries were carried out by young people, 'there has been some some shift towards toward employing adults in this role'. 'This reflects legislative changes which impact on the employment of young people and also an increasing use of motor vehicles to undertake deliveries.' The National Union of Students suggested part-time jobs could be being snapped up by older university undergraduates. Toni Pearce, NUS Vice-President for further education, said: 'Rising youth unemployment in recent years, and struggles to find work further up the career ladder could mean that university students and potentially even graduates are taking the jobs that previously would have gone to college students.' The education select committee has launched an inquiry into careers guidance for young people. EEF, the manufacturers organisation, told the inquiry: ‘If … young people are not proactively seeking work outside of their studies, then there is the risk that young people will not have any form of work experience upon leaving the education system,  which will significantly impact their employability skills and prospects for the future.’ The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said there should be more ‘encouragement for pupils to take on internships, voluntary activities and Saturday jobs, to gain work experience and insight into working life’.","Number of 16-18-year-old students who also have part-time jobs falls by 100,000 from 2001-11 .

For motorists driven to distraction by Britain's increasingly cratered roads, German luxury car giant Mercedes-Benz's tonight unveils a clever antidote. Its new flagship S-Class limousine can see potholes and bumps in the road and adapt suspension to brace itself ahead of the impending impact in a bid to reduce the potential damage and discomfort. Mercedes-Benz says it is the first car in the world to have suspension 'with eyes' as part of its revolutionary system called 'road surface scan' using a stereo camera. Eyes on the road: The Mercedes-Benz S350 BlueTec can scan the road surface and adapt its own suspension . Flagship: The German luxury car company has unveiled its new S-Class limousine in Hamburg . The firm boasts it is the 'most advanced S-Class ever created', with the driver even able to choose any perfume he or she wishes circulating around the cabin via an atomiser in the air conditioning system. And it is also the first car in the world to dispense completely with light-bulbs – replacing all lights with LED systems. As the covers came off the new car in Hamburg, Mercedes-Benz said: 'The new S-Class is the world's first car to detect bumps on the road ahead. 'If the car's road surface scan detects unevenness, it instantaneously sets up the suspension to deal with the situation. 'The 'eyes'; are provided by the camera fitted behind the windscreen, which scans the road up to 15 metres ahead. Magic body control: The latest Mercedes-Benz boasts active anticipatory suspension . More sensors - more protection: The new S-Class is fitted with radar, stereo camera and ultrasonic systems . Dazzle-free: The car's highbeam assist plus detects traffic ahead and adapts the lights accordingly . 'The vehicle then adjusts the damping . of each wheel to a tauter or softer setting in advance or the load in . the wheel via an active hydraulic system. 'The suspension is adapted within fractions of a second and body movement reduced considerably.' The firm said the system works in good visibility and at speeds of up to 80 mph. It added that the new S-Class is also 'the first ever car without a single light bulb'. Instead, nearly 500 high tech . electronic 'LEDs'  light emitting diodes illuminate the road, the . vehicle, the interior and the boot. A . spokesman said: 'Around 100 years after the introduction of electric . lighting in motor vehicles, Mercedes-Benz is now making a complete . switch to LED technology. Air fresher: The driver can choose any perfume he or she wishes circulating around the cabin via an atomiser . Luxury: The S-Class seats include a special massage feature and can recline to 43.5 degrees . 'The  new S-Class is the first vehicle in the world that does not contain a single light bulb, outside or inside.' The intensity of the brake lights is also reduced at night or while waiting at traffic lights to ease the effect on other drivers. Among the other luxuries are special massage seat features which can even replicate a 'hot stone' massage. Mercedes-Benz also promise 'to replicate the feeling of a First Class airline cabin by reclining the rear seat to 43.5 degrees. For executives on the move the car also features a series of mobile office aids, including a multi-media system. Long awaited: Mercedes-Benz's S400 Hybrid (W222) will be available to order in Britain from next month . Price tag: The S-Class will cost between £65,000 and £100,000 with UK order books opening in June . This is all in a car which Mercedes-Benz points out is lighter, more efficient and faster than the model it replaces. The firm says the most frugal S300 BlueTec hybrid model will manage 64.2miles to the gallon. The most powerful S500 model will accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 4.8 seconds with the top speed electronically restricted to 155mph.

Loan shark: Stephen Fossey, 45, who ran an illegal money lending business from Bacup market today avoided a jail sentence after a court heard he scared no one . A market trader who ran an illegal lending racket from his fruit and veg stall has avoided jail after a court heard his interest rates were over 100 times lower than licensed payday loan firms. Stephen Fossey, 45, used his pitch at Bacup market, Lancashire, to give credit to up to 180 customers over a four-year period. He typically charged between 25 and 30 per cent interest on loans - compared with online credit firms who have been known to charge up to 4000 per cent on repayments. Fossey was caught after investigators from the England Illegal Money Lending Team were tipped off by trading standards officers who were investigating a black market tobacco racket he was running. The father-of-three set up the £140,000 loans racket as a means to save money for his retirement but he has since been expelled from the market. Today at Burnley Crown Court, Fossey of Rossendale admitted engaging in a money lending operation, without a licence under the Consumer Credit Act, and two allegations of possessing criminal property. But he was given a suspended prison term after a judge said customers 'spoke highly' of Fossey and he had not intimidated any of them. Fossey's defence lawyer Mark Stuart said: 'There is no suggestion any sort of pressure was put upon people to repay. 'He was charging far less a rate of interest than those of licensed money lenders. This was going to be a pot for him, having had no pension for his retirement. He has now lost £100,000 that was owed to him.' Fossey first agreed to lend money to customers while doing his fruit and veg rounds in Burnley, Rossendale and nearby Todmorden. His home was searched on May 29 last year by Trading Standards officers who found a carrier bag under his bed containing two bags of money, totalling £7,164, and documentation, in particular two notebooks, an address book and a black pad. Also seized was a handwritten letter addressed to 'Steve' and 'Phil' from one of those who had borrowed money. The notebooks were effectively records of loans Fossey had provided over the previous 13 months. Over that period alone there had been 196 loan accounts between the defendant and borrowers. Sentenced: Fossey, a father-of-three, set up the £140,000 loans racket as a means to save money for his retirement but he has since been expelled from the market . Over 100 people had an account, some had more than one and 449 loans had been issued, including top-ups. The amount of repayment received over the period was £139,579 and the outstanding balance owed to the defendant was £93,918. Prosecutors said the operation was a 'substantial illegal business.' The majority of the accounts required repayment of £20 a week, but one person was paying back at £400 a month. Prosecutor David Hercock said: 'The prosecution's position is that the interest charged, 25 to 30 per cent, while it could not be described as exorbitant or grossly excessive, is nevertheless high. People who borrowed were in a continued cycle of borrowing from him. 'There is no evidence of enforcing payment by violence or intimidation, but the use of the fictitious support does appear to be a mechanism or implied threat to make sure he got repaid.' Fossey received 12 months in prison, suspended for two years, with 200 hours unpaid work. He will now face a Proceeds of Crime hearing. Loan shark: Bacup market, in Lancashire, where Fossey ran his illegal money lending scheme from . Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson told Fossey: 'I am quite satisfied you did not engage in any kind of threat, either implied or real to enforce loans and certainly did not use violence. 'It seemed nobody was frightened of you. No late charge was added if payment was missed and you did not take possessions or other forms of collateral. 'It seems a lot of the people to whom you loaned money speak highly of you. On the other hand, of course, this was extensive.' After the case the Illegal Money Lending Team said some victims paid up to £200 on top of a £500 loan, and more than £1000 was added on to a loan of £3500. One victim spoke of how he had been repaying the loan for more than 10 years and believed he had paid back thousands of pounds. When he was struggling to repay, he was forced to take out further loans to pay off existing ones. At the point of Fossey's arrest he was paying up to £130 a week, and was told he still owed £2500. Lee Ormandy, Lancashire County Council Trading Standards, said: 'This case sends a clear warning that illegal money lenders in Lancashire will be pursued and prosecuted. 'We will continue to work closely with the Illegal Money Lending Team, police and other agencies to protect local communities from loan sharks. Anyone being harassed or threatened by a loan shark can and should get help now.'","Stephen Fossey, 45, charged customers between 25% and 30% interest .

A solar kettle that harnesses energy from the Sun and does not require access to mains electricity has gone on sale. The kettle, developed by British engineer James Bentham,  boils water by using solar technology, making it ideal for intrepid explorers who need more than a traditional flask to keep them warm and hydrated. In addition to making a cup of tea, the portable kettle can also be used to sterilise river water and desalinate seawater. The Solar Kettle, designed by British engineer James Bentham, harnesses the Sun's rays to make a cup of tea possible no matter where you are in the world. It can also be used as a flask to store hot water for long periods . Resembling a telescope, it works by using a thermal vacuum tube to absorb and convert the Sun’s rays into heat. Two exterior reflectors open out to maximise the amount of solar energy obtained, enabling the water inside to boil without the need for any additional energy supply. It also comes with an built-in stand so that it can be positioned to face the Sun, along with a thermometer located on the lid, which allows the user to monitor the temperature of the water. The Solar Kettle’s exterior remains cool to touch, even when the contents are at the boiling point, reducing the risk of burns to the user. It can also be used to store hot water for long periods of time. The kettle is weighs 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) when empty and only stores half a litre of water at a time.

The disgraced Canadian journalist . taped an interview with Ford last Friday and it was originally planned . to air on December 16, but pushed forward a full week 'due to demand'. In the revealing interview he explains how he hasn't touched a drop of alcohol for the last five weeks. Tete-a-tete: Conrad Black's interview with Ford will air tonight in Canada on ZoomerTV at midnight Eastern Time, 9pm Pacific . In a preview of the interview, Ford announces that he hasn't had a drink since last month. 'I . haven't had a drop of alcohol in five weeks,' he says. 'I was never an . alcoholic. But you know, I'd like to have a few drinks on the weekends, . like I think a lot of people do. 'But a couple of times I made a fool of myself, if you want to be frank.' Ford . says events like being caught drunk at the Taste of Danforth event in . downtown Toronto last August made him reevaluate drinking, and he came . to the conclusion that 'enough's enough'. Black . will likely be an understanding interviewer, as he spent 37 months in a . U.S. prison after being convicted of obstruction of justice. United front: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and his wife Reneta made a rare public outing together to attend the funeral of fallen Police Constable John Zivcic Monday morning . Standing by her man: Reneta Ford is rarely seen out with her husband, but was by his side last month when he apologized for using the word p**** on live TV. Pictured above outside the ceremony . Relentless: Mayor Ford has refused to step down from office since Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair announced in October that they have a video showing him smoking out of a crack pipe. Chief Blair was at the funeral today . In the preview, Black said that the 'piling on' to Mayor Ford 'has been excessive'. 'He was elected mayor of Toronto and those who do not like his style will be free to vote against him is he runs again,' Black said. 'If there is sufficient evidence to prosecute him with crimes, due process should be followed. 'But he should be accorded a full presumption of innocence unless he is justly convicted. Beyond that his accusers should put up or shut up.' Mayor Ford first made headlines in October when Toronto police chief Bill Blair announced they had a video which showed Ford smoking from a crack pipe. Initially, Ford denied that he had ever smoked crack and refused to resign. Changing his story: Mayor Ford initially denied ever smoking crack, but eventually confessed saying he wasn't addicted to the substance . But on November 5, Ford admitted that he had smoked crack-cocaine in the past, maintaining that he is not addicted to the substance. 'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine but...am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Um, probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.' Since then, Ford's been a constant headline fixture as his public behavior spiraled out of control and the Toronto city council voted to remove his special privileges and reduce his office budget. But perhaps Ford's most embarrassing gaffe was when he described allegations that he made passes at a staffer, Olivia Gondek. New addiction: Mayor Ford has been exercising regularly and promised to lose 40 to 50 pounds in the next six months . 'It says that I wanted to eat her p****. I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much,' he said in a press conference on November 14. Ford was forced to hold another press conference later in the day in order to apologize for his lewd language earlier. Reneta stood behind him as he apologized for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'. Today Ford he was joined by his wife Reneta today as the two attended a funeral for fallen Police Constable John Zivcic. Constable . Zivcic, 34, was on duty when he was involved in a car crash on November . 30 and died two days later in the hospital. Ontario Premier Kathleen . Wynne and Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair spoke at the funeral. Mayor . Ford did not make a speech. The rare appearance of Reneta Ford happened the same day the interview is set to air. Rob Ford's wife Renata Brejniak stood by her man today as he apologized for the 'graphic language' he used to describe allegations he made sexual advances towards a staffer. Not much is known about Renata, even to people within the Ford circle. She has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine. The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas. Doug Holyday, Ford's former deputy mayor was at their wedding held at St George's Golf and Country Club. 'I don't even know if she has a job,' he told Toronto Life. The Ford marriage has been far from perfect. In 2008, a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' behavior. When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house. Happier times: Ford and his wife (right) celebrating his election as Toronto Mayor in 2010. His mother Diane (left) is pictured kissing her son . Television crews covering the dispute showed up to Ford's parents house where he used daughter Stephanie to deflect questions about the fight. He held her up in the front door and she said 'no comment' to the reporters gathered outside. The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police. Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her. At the time, a neighbor described Mrs Ford to the Globe and Mail as 'reclusive and rarely seen out of the house' The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part. The couple seemed to patch things up after the incident. 'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.' Renata rarely gives interviews. A June 2013 Toronto Sun article about the first-lady of Toronto references the last time she spoke to the press - October 25, 2010 when Ford was elected mayor. Renata was helping her husband out at the time, returning calls when one reporter got a rare opportunity to chat with the first lady of Toronto. When asked about their children, Renata says they try to shelter Stephanie and Doug from politics. 'We have decided to wait until they are older to explain about politics,' she said. 'The revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.' Ford has been married to his wife Renata Brejniak since 2000. They met in high school and have two children together, daughter Stephanie and son Doug. Reneta rarely gives interviews with the press, and usually isn't seen out with her husband except for important political occasions - like when he was elected mayor in 2010.

"By . Sarah Harris . PUBLISHED: . 20:01 EST, 24 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:01 EST, 24 May 2013 . Complaints: Beyonce's Live at the Roseland DVD has been branded too suggestive for young audiences . Raunchy pop videos are to be forced to carry age ratings, ministers said yesterday. They are closing a legal loophole that has allowed youngsters to buy sexually explicit and ultra violent material without restriction. There are already age restrictions on feature films but a range of pop videos, sports releases, religious and educational DVDs and Blu-Ray discs are classed as exempt. In one case, topless lap-dancing was considered exempt on the basis it was an exercise video. Semi-naked cage fighting has also been free from classification because it was deemed a sport. Campaigners have also warned about depictions of self-mutilation, erotic dancing, sex toys and drug use being widely available to youngsters as DVDs. Tory communications minister Ed Vaizey yesterday announced the Video Recordings Act 1984 is being changed to enable age ratings to be given to DVDs that are currently exempt. Products that are deemed unsuitable for children will have to carry the familiar British Board of Film Classification age ratings: 12, 15 and 18. The changes are expected to come into force next year and will apply to all new releases. Mr Vaizey said: ‘Government realises that the world has moved on since these exemptions were written into the Video Recordings Act 30 years ago. ‘The changes we’ve announced will help ensure children are better protected and parents are provided with the information necessary for them to make informed choices about what their children view.’ The minister also wants the industry to ‘develop solutions so more online videos – particularly those likely to be sought out by children and young people – carry advice about their age suitability’. Examples of currently exempt DVDs attracting complaints to the BBFC include Beyoncé, Live at Roseland – a concert recording in which the singer dances suggestively in her underwear. Ultimate fighting championship DVDs – a series with images of bloodied sporting violence – have also caused upset. Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, made the DVD age rating recommendation in his independent review into the commercialisation and sexualisation of children in 2011. He yesterday welcomed the Government’s announcement but said he wanted the digital world to also adopt age ratings because children can download inappropriate videos off the internet. Of age ratings, he said: ‘It’s giving parents, but also children and young people, the opportunity to decide whether something is appropriate or not. You wouldn’t go to the cinema without looking at what rating a film is beforehand. ‘Some material in music videos is either very violent or misogynistic or its very sexually explicit. ‘Many parents would feel very shocked if they realised their children were encountering it.’ Linda Papadopoulos, a respected clinical psychologist, said: ‘This will help parents as they’re not always up with what their kids are watching. Vulnerable: Psychologists worry that parents often do not know what their children are watching . ‘Videos are something that you’re not aware of the implicit messages they sometimes send. We know, whether it’s using derogatory language towards women or having them as decorative objects, all these things send a really negative message and objectify women and young girls and give kids an unhealthy script about how to relate to each other.’ The Government also announced that wireless internet providers are working to make publicly available WiFi ‘family-friendly’ in places such as cafes and restaurants. The firms will automatically block pornography websites or encourage their business providers to adopt filtering services at sites where children may have access to their free service. Edward Timpson, the children and families minister, said: ‘Through the UK Council for Internet Safety we will push for a firmer commitment from WiFi providers, retailers, shops and cafes so parents are reassured their children will not be able to access pornography when they are away from home.’ The British Retail Consortium also announced updated guidance to members to help promote ‘responsible childrenswear retailing’ .","Communications minister Ed Vaizey announced clampdown on explicit DVDs .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 08:36 EST, 8 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:04 EST, 9 May 2013 . Public health reforms which would have pushed up the price of alcohol and forced cigarettes to be sold in plain packets were missing from the Queen’s Speech. Health campaigners expressed dismay at the omissions, with Tory MPs with some Tory MPs warning David Cameron not to try to outflank the UK Independence Party as the party of  'beer & fags'. But the ideas were shelved to focus on the economy and tackling immigration, to avoid being seen to add to the cost of living for hard-pressed families. Scroll down for video highlights of the Queen's Speech . When the Queen delivered her speech to MPs and peers it contained no mention of plans to tackle binge drinking of smoking . David Cameron, pictured walking from the Commons to the Lords today, had been a vocal advocate of a minimum alcohol price . David Cameron and Nick Clegg vowed instead to focus on backing people who 'work hard and want to get on'. They promised measures to boost ‘fire up’ the private sector, increase pensions and protect consumers. But today's Queen's Speech did not contain expected legislation on tracking internet use, a register of lobbyists and enshrining in law a promise to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid. However, the government came in for fierce criticism for the lack of any public health policies in today's statement. The government has quietly dropped a string of ideas it planned to include in this year's Queen's Speech. Government sources insist ministers want to focus on issues which matter to voters, and not adding to living costs or red-tape. Among the coalition's ideas not included were: . Mr Cameron championed the idea of a minimum unit price for alcohol, arguing it would curb problem drinking. But it was opposed by the George Osborne’s Treasury, Home Secretary Theresa May, Education Secretary Michael Gove and former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. Just weeks ago it was reported that the government would also press ahead with laws forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plan packets, copying rules introduced in Australia last year. The Smokefree Action Coalition - an alliance of more than 100 health charities, unions, royal colleges and campaign groups - today wrote to the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary to . implore them to introduce the measure. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted the ideas had not been dropped altogether. ‘We haven’t made a decision,’ he told BBC Radio 4.He said plans in Scotland for minimum alcohol pricing had been challenged in the courts, while Australia’s cigarette laws only came into force in January. Mr Hunt added: ‘It’s a much harder job to assess the evidence as to how effective it will be and that takes time. And I want to make sure we do the job properly so I’m going to take the time that I need to.’ There was speculation that the move was a reaction to the rise of UKIP, whose leader Nigel Farage has promised to scrap the smoking ban in pubs. During the local election campaign, he was regularly pictured smoking with a pint in his hand. But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former . GP, has repeatedly called for action to tackle problem drinking. She . tweeted: 'We shouldn't compete with Farage by looking like a Party which . promotes beer & fags.' She also raised questions about the role played by Lynton Crosby, who has been hired as chief Tory election strategist. His PR and lobbying firm Crosby Textor was on a retainer for British American Tobacco when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in Australia. Tory MPs warned the government against trying to outflank Nigel Farage's UKIP as the party of 'booze and fags' Former GP turned Tory MP Sarah Wollaston warned against trying to outflank UKIP on public health . Dr Wollaston added: 'Did Mr Crosby have any involvement in advising on dropping these public health measures? 'Whatever your views on minimum pricing we deserve clarity about advice from lobbyists at the heart of Govt & a Free Press to challenge.' A plan to create a register of firms which lobby the government to have policy changes has also been dropped. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Two key public health policies have been dropped since Lynton Crosby arrived in Downing Street. 'David Cameron needs to come clean about whether Crosby had any involvement in these decisions. 'From the outside it looks very much like a right-wing lobbyist is dictating the coalition's public health policy.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also raised questions in the Commons about why the government 'dropped the Bill' after Mr Crosby's arrival. However, a Downing Street source denied Mr Crosby had any influence over policy. 'Mr Crosby has not lobbies the Prime Minister on anything. There has not been any impact on the Queen's Speech whatsoever.' Mr Crosby does not had a desk in Number 10 or a pass to enter Downing Street, the source added. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure over the decision not to legislate on plain cigarette packets, while questions have been raised about the role Tory election strategist, who has worked as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry . Dr Mark Porter, chairman of council at . the British Medical Association, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' that the measures were omitted from the Queen's Speech. Dr Porter added: 'If the Government U-turns on its pledge to deal with alcohol and tobacco related harm, we will have to question its commitment to protecting the nation's health,' he said. 'A minimum unit price for alcohol would result in a decrease in thousands of alcohol related deaths. 'Ultimately taxpayers pay the price as the NHS picks up the bill for the damage to health and lives lost from tobacco and alcohol related causes.' Health groups also urged the government to act to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, added: 'There is strong evidence that removing glitzy designs from cigarette packs makes them less attractive to children, increases the impact of on-pack health warnings and stops tobacco companies misleading consumers about the harm cigarettes cause. 'If the Government is serious about improving the nation's health and stopping so many people dying early - which it says it is - it must reconsider its decision and push for the early adoption of standardised packaging.' Legislation: Cigarettes would have been sold in plain packaging under the plan which has been shelved . Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking . Deborah Arnott, chief executive of . health charity Action on Smoking Health (Ash), said: 'If the Government . cannot find the courage to act, then Parliament must be given the chance . to decide, as it did with smokefree legislation.' But Jorge da Motta, managing director of Japan Tobacco International UK, said: 'The decision of the UK Government not to include plain packaging in the Queen's speech reflects that the regulatory principles of evidence based policy not policy based evidence are being observed. 'The tobacco control lobbyists have attempted to convince MPs that plain packaging will discourage young people from taking up smoking; they have tried to use emotion to circumvent the Government's own consultation process and to close down any debate.'","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt under pressure over missing reforms .

A terminally ill mother-of-three is planning to spend her final months sailing around the UK – and hopes the trip will leave her dog with a place in history. Lori Murdock, 57, wants Betty the Patterdale terrier to become the first dog to travel all the way around the UK by sea. Ms Murdock, from Topsham, in Devon, began planning her voyage when doctors told her there was no cure for her aggressive form of skin cancer and gave her nine months to live. Lori Murdock, who has terminal skin cancer, is sailing around the UK with her dog, a Patterdale terrier called Betty - she hopes Betty will become the first dog to travel the whole way around the UK by sea . She will set sail from Topsham, Devon, this week on board a restored 1950s wooden yacht with two-year-old Betty and her partner, Stephen Rodwell, 60. She will stop off at various locations around the coast in an attempt to raise awareness about the importance of having moles checked for signs of skin cancer. She also hopes to raise £10,000 for cancer charities, Macmillan, FORCE and Factor 50 Fundraisers, before she returns to Devon after three months. The retired solicitor and law lecturer, who has previously sailed across the Atlantic, said: ‘I’ve been fortunate enough to sail to some wonderful places but I realised that I did not know my own island. The mother-of-three was given just nine months to live when it was discovered that her malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed in September 2009, had spread to other parts of her body . Ms Murdock will sail from Topsham, Devon, with her partner, Stephen Rodwell (pictured) who restored the 1950s wooden yacht that they are sailing . ‘Nine months is no time at all so I realised I needed to make this trip happen and I only hope that I’m alive long enough to get all the way around. ‘Betty is a seasoned sea-dog and shouldn’t be too fazed by a few months at sea. ‘It might sound traumatic but she loves the boat and she has her own lifejacket which she has been wearing since she was a puppy.’ Ms Murdock was diagnosed with . malignant melanoma in September 2009 two years after she first expressed . concern to her doctor who failed to spot the cancer. By then the illness had spread to other areas of her body leaving her with no hope of survival. She intends to spend three months travelling all the way around the British Isles stopping at ports along the way. While on the journey she hopes to educate people about the signs of skin cancer and to raise £10,000 for cancer charities . She said: ‘Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer but it can be cured in most cases if you catch it early. ‘I’m hoping that by doing something like this I can raise awareness and if it helps one person then it will all be worth it.’ On her fundraising page Ms Murdock wrote: ‘I want to encourage everyone I meet along the way to check their skin, get to know it so you can spot any change, however small. ‘Get it checked out straight away. If you are worried, ask to be referred to a specialist. ‘Malignant melanoma is the second fastest growing cancer in young people between 15 and 35.

The battle to stop foreign invaders killing off native British wildlife is costing £1.7billion a year. Among the biggest culprits are Japanese knotweed, American grey squirrels, Russian zebra mussels and Eastern European ‘killer’ shrimp. BBC research revealed that the total bill for defending British animals and plants from the ‘alien’ invasion costs £1.7billion a year – or more than £25 for every person in the country. Only humans do more harm to native biodiversity than foreign species. 'Foreign killers': American grey squirrels were listed among other alien invaders as dangers to British wildlife . Tackling Japanese knotweed costs the economy £165million a year, according to figures from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The most costly problem is the European rabbit, with damage to crops and measures to control it adding up to more than £260million a year, the Defra data showed. BBC1’s Countryfile said other major culprits include mink, which were imported from the US by fur farms but escaped to wreak havoc, and American signal crayfish. The programme highlighted how zebra mussels have so infested Rutland Water in Rutland that Anglian Water has had to spend £500,000 to install special filters to sift them out because they spread so quickly, clogging pipes. Cambridge University zoologist Dr David Aldridge explained how the mussels – which have distinctive striped shells –  arrived in the UK about ten years ago on the hulls of ships from Eastern Europe. Infected: The Olympic Park site was covered in Japanese knotweed. Organisers spent £70m removing it . Costly: BBC1's Countryfile claimed Brits would have to pay £25 each to remove killers like Russian zebra mussels . They reproduce so rapidly they kill off local mussels by growing all over them, starving them  of food. Rutland Water now contains millions of zebra mussels, he said. ‘A single individual can produce a million offspring in a year. ‘They are probably the dominant organism now in this water. What we are finding in the UK is where zebra mussels are established, native mussels are declining very rapidly.’ Chris Featherstone, from Anglian Water, said: ‘Every year we have to take tons of these shells away to keep the water flowing.’ American mink is another creature noted in the programme, which warns we need £1.7bn to save the wild . Countryfile reporter Tom Heap said: ‘From the grey squirrel,  American crayfish, mink driving water voles from our river banks and the small but scarily-named “killer shrimp”, a whole host of  animals and plants are playing their part in colonising our countryside. ‘Luckily, of the 2,000 non-native species living among us, only a few hundred are actually harmful.’ The water vole – often associated with the character Ratty in Wind In The Willows – is Britain’s fastest declining native mammal. In 1990, there were seven million living on the riverbanks. By 1998, there were fewer than one million and numbers are continuing to decline. As well as falling prey to escaped mink, they have seen changes in farming destroy their habitats. Trevor Reynolds, invasive species adviser at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Our priority has to be tackling non-native species, because they lack natural pests and enemies.’ Japanese knotweed, brought  to Britain by Victorian botanists as an ornamental pond plant, is one of the fastest spreading invaders. During building of the Olympic Park in East London it cost an estimated £70million to remove the plant and dispose of it. Red squirrels are only just starting to increase their numbers after nearly 140 years of losing out to grey squirrels introduced from North America. Plantlife is also at risk, with warnings that the native bluebell could disappear within a decade. It is being squeezed out by a cross between the British bluebell and a Spanish cousin introduced more than 300 years ago. Some invaders even pose a health risk. The sap of giant hogweed  can cause painful blisters and the caterpillar of the oak processionary moth can cause a fatal allergic reaction.","It would cost every Brit £25 each to save our wildlife from foreign 'killers'

Bowers and his terrified fellow students had heard a loud series of bangs from outside their classroom but it was the announcement of a full and immediate lockdown over the school intercom that caused them to fear for their lives after 18-year-old Karl Pierson shot Claire Davis, 17, at point blank range. But in the midst of the panic as Bowers and his class bolted to the corner of the classroom, he found a ball point pen and etched, 'Family, I love you all so much' - underlining the 'so much' - and underneath drew a cross with the words 'I am here now' to symbolize the afterlife. Speaking to CNN, Bowers said that he truly believed that if the shooter, who was unknown to him at the time, had entered the class room, he thought he was going to die and wanted his family to know he was in a better place. 'That's where I really genuinely thought I was headed if Karl happened to stumble into our classroom and actually end it for all of us,' said Bowers to CNN. Scroll Down for Video .

They were ordered to the corner of the classroom as far as they could get away from the door. His mind racing, Bowers prayed to God and then wrote his heart-wrenching message onto his hand. 'I found that I was carrying a pen with me, a ball point pen, and that morning, I didn't really tell my family I loved them,' said Bowers to CNN.

Video of the concert posted online shows the pig, also painted with dollar signs, the logo . for oil conglomerate Shell and the Communist hammer and sickle symbol, drifting over the crowd during the climax of the show's finale. 'With this disgusting display Roger Waters has made it . crystal clear: forget Israel, never mind ""limited boycotts promoting .

The only books this bigot should be . getting should be with the Mullahs in Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood.'

According to the Supreme Court, it was never established that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina disturbed the peace out of 'hatred for a social group'. The crime was also not violent and the Moscow court did not take into consideration that Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have children, the Supreme Court added.

William Shakespeare is the highest placed Briton in fourth position, while David Cameron is way down in 1,483rd spot. Winston Churchill is ranked 37th, thirty places behind Adolf Hitler. The British wartime leader is also ranked lower than former US Presidents George W Bush and Ronald Reagan. But Churchill is by far the highest placed Prime Minister, ahead of Margaret Thatcher in 271st and Tony Blair in 584th. Queen Elizabeth I is the highest ranked woman at 13, three places above Queen Victoria. They are two of just three women in the top hundred, along with Joan of Arc. The list was compiled using a programme which mainly draws on how significant someone’s entry is on internet encyclopaedia Wikipedia as well as mentions on online newspaper reports, books published on the web and other parts of the internet. The system gives equal weight to both celebrity and gravitas, but aims to assess people’s long term fame by including a ‘reputation decay’ mathematical formula which predicts their impact up to 200 years after they die. Britney Spears would be ranked 27th most significant person on her current fame but drops to 689th when the decay formula is applied. Table: Nelson Mandela ranks just 356th in a table of people's historical importance created by a Google engineer using similar systems to the way the search engine ranks web pages using Wikipedia . Steven Skiena, professor of computer science at New York’s Stony Brook University and co creator of the formula, said Mandela’s apparently lowly position was a ‘fair ranking.’ He said: ‘Bigger does not mean better. ‘Mandela is the highest ranked African leader and a few places above Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, which makes sense. ‘Both men could be viewed as founders of their respective nations and therefore of similar significance in the long term.’ He said the software suggested that a third of historical figures currently studied in U.S. school are relatively ‘obscure’ and had little impact on modern society. He added: ‘The quantitative approach to ranking someone’s significance provides another way to look at many things, not just history. ‘I suspect about a third of workers hired by companies from a pool of candidates are not the best people for the job. ‘A more scientific approach might be a way of helping to correct inevitable human errors.’ But historian Antony Beevor said the idea that historical significance could be reduced to a formula was ‘preposterous’. ‘You simply cannot calibrate history and assess it in that way,’ he said. ‘It’s just a question of how they construct their algorithm and how they view their weightings.’ Professor Skiena and his colleague Charles Ward, an engineer with Google, have published their findings in a book called Who’s Bigger? Where Historical Figures Really Rank. It names Mozart as the most significant musician in history at 24th, three places ahead of Beethoven and 24 ahead of Bach, according to the list.

The mother whose baby  daughter was snatched by social workers after a forced caesarean has written a poignant letter to her ‘little Princess’ promising never to forget her. Alessandra Pacchieri begged the Daily Mail last night to pass the letter to her 15-month-old girl, now being cared for by Essex social services and being lined up for new adoptive parents against the mother’s wishes. ‘I want to tell my daughter what I feel and how much I care,’ said Miss Pacchieri, 35, from her home town near Siena, Italy. ‘I am not allowed to speak to her or see her any more and, if she is adopted, this letter may be the last time I can get a message to her.’ In near perfect English and on paper dotted with drawings of hearts, the letter tells her daughter: ‘I miss you so so so much.’ Miss Pacchieri writes that ‘I pray God every day to protect you’ and describes her hopes that they will be reunited one day. The letter goes on: ‘Please always remember that I LOVE you and I wanted you to be with me.’ Miss Pacchieri, who has two other daughters, is at the centre of a major international row over a UK family court’s secret decision to force her, without her consent, to have a caesarean in an Essex NHS hospital on August 24 last year before her baby was removed by social workers for adoption. Miss Pacchieri was seven months pregnant and on a training course at Stansted airport to be an air hostess when she had a panic attack and called the police for help. She had stopped taking her medicine for a bipolar complaint in case it harmed her unborn child. Officers took her to hospital where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and, later, was forced to have a caesarean under anaesthetic so she could not protest. She told the Mail: ‘I was marched into a hospital operating theatre and pushed on to a bed. They put a mask over my face. When I woke up the baby had arrived.’ Heartfelt: Miss Pacchieri says it may be the 'last time I can get a message to her' Miss Pacchieri has seen her baby ten times. On the last occasion, in May this year, she was told to say a final goodbye to her daughter by social workers at a council centre in Essex. The child was introduced to prospective new parents in October and has since seen the couple regularly in preparation for her planned adoption in the next few weeks. Italian and English lawyers acting for Miss Pacchieri are preparing to challenge the adoption plan.The case has caused an uproar and is now being overseen by Sir James Munby, England’s most senior family judge. Miss Pacchieri has told the Mail that she has sent previous letters to her daughter. But she fears they have not been read to the child by Essex social workers. Dear Love, . I miss you so so so much and I think about you all the times. I wonder how you are doing and what are you doing. I pray God every day to protect you, keep you away from evil and to bless you. You are my little princess. I did not see you since May and I can imagine how big you are right now! I pray God that one day you could reunify with me and your sisters cause we love you so much. I want the best for you and I wish they would have give us a home to be together. I don’t know when I am gonna see you again but I know that one day we will... I am positive about that and I have faith. Please always remember that I LOVE you and I wanted you to be with me. I send you all my love and pray that our angel will look after you. Your mother . At an English court hearing this spring, the judge said she was intelligent and articulate. However, he ruled that because Miss Pacchieri might stop her bipolar drugs at some time during her daughter’s childhood, the adoption should go ahead. A spokesman for Essex social services promised the mother’s letter would be passed to the child if Miss Pacchieri sends it to social workers from Italy. The spokesman insisted that previous letters had not arrived.","Alessandra Pacchieri desperately wants her daughter to know she cares .

Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut who was the second man to walk on the moon, has said he wants the US to permanently 'settle and colonise Mars.' And the 83-year-old former astronaut expects it to become a reality by 2040. Aldrin made the statement in a blog for CNN and his plans to get there form the basis of his new book Mission to Mars. The second man to walk on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, wants the US to colonise Mars and believes there will be a settlement on the red planet by by 2040 . Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot, walks on the surface of the Moon. It's been 44 years since the Apollo 11 landings and Aldrin thinks there has been 'too little progress' since . A group of scientists are trying to replicate what it would be like to live on Mars, by living and working in spacesuits in the Utah desert. Engineers, geologists and biologists from the Mars Desert Research Station are living in cramped conditions with limited water, electricity, food and oxygen, a vast distance from home. The 'astronauts' are a group of volunteers who are helping to discover ways to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of Mars and use the Utah desert's Mars-like terrain to simulate working conditions on the red planet. Aldrin said: 'I have always felt Mars should be the next destination following our landings on the moon. 'I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing American permanence on the planet Mars.' Aldrin added that the advances made by Nasa's Curiosity Rover and the pictures it has beamed back from the red planet have added to public interest. 'The dream of reaching the red planet looks like it is finally getting closer to becoming a reality.' It has been 44 years since the Apollo 11 moonwalk and Aldrin thinks there has been 'too little progress' in getting people to settle on other planets. This image from NASA TV was one of the first images sent from the Curiosity rover after it successfully landed on Mars in August 2012.

Aldrin believes this is the most economical transportation system concept between the two planets. He believes that using this capability, humans could arrive and settle on Mars between 2035-2040. Aldrin's plan is outlined in his new book, Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration out now. He continues: 'We are at an inflection point. 'We can choose to do what is easy, what is safe. 'Or we can choose to make a difference. The choice to me is absolutely clear. 'There is no other choice than to commit to Mars. 'Humans need to explore, to push beyond current limits, just like we did nearly 44 years ago that enabled me to stand at Tranquility Base on the moon. 'In reaching outward with method and intent to Mars, America is once again in the business of a vital, meaningful and future-focused space exploration program.' More than 78,000 people recently applied to go on a Dutch reality TV show in which they would move to Mars permanently.

Two Alabama men have been charged with imprisoning and filming their sexual abuse of a minor for use in child pornography made with the son of one of the accused. Domestic partners Charles Dunnavant and Carl Herold face a litany of charges ranging from sexual torture and sodomy to exposing a person to an STD and child pornography production. Authorities are seeking a $1million cash bond for each of the accused, the boy was Herold’s son according to reports. Awful: Charles Dunnavant (right) and Carl Herold are both accused in the horrific sexual torture of Mr Herold's nine-year-old son . The young boy, only nine-years-old, was held hostage in the Huntsville house of horrors for eight months, during which he was sexually assaulted, abused, sodomized and exposed to an STD by both men while a camera caught all the depraved details, according to a court filing cited by WHNT. ‘The victim in this case was kept in Defendant’s home, without schooling or interaction with others outside the supervision on Defendant or his co-defendants, for eight months,’ said the filing. Mr Herold, 32, also satisfied his perverted desires by taking the boy – his son – across state lines for criminal sexual purposes, according to the document. The awful father faces federal charges for those actions, but they have not yet been brought against him. Investigators have in their possession pictures of the evil torture the innocent boy suffered at the hands of the wicked men, they said. The boy also told investigators of his suffering during a recent interview, according to the station. ‘They held the child captive for eight months and there are no standards, taboos or lines this defendant and his co-defendant hesitated to cross,’ Huntsville Police Department investigator Chad Smith testified in court Monday, according to WHNT. House of horrors: The Huntsville home where both men carried out the bulk of their depraved acts . In court: Mr Dunnavant was in court Monday for his arraignment . Mr Herold was arrested last month and the boy placed into protective custody, according to AL.com. He faces two counts of sodomy, aggravated child abuse, three counts of sexual abuse of a child under 12-years-old and child pornography charges. He is an IT consultant who worked from home. The boy’s mother did not live with the men and appears to have not been part of his life, according to WAAY. Mr Dunnavant was a loan officer until his arrest last month, according to WHNT. He faces charges of sexual torture, sodomy, aggravated child abuse and transmitting or exposing a person to a STD. Authorities asked for the $1million bond for each man because they have not hesitated to leave the area in the past and have the means to flee. ‘He has the means of travel, family out-of-state and some of the allegations are there was much travel in the lives of Dunnavant and Herold,’ Mr Smith said in court. The men are co-defendants. Authorities are still investigating to determine if others were involved. Mr Herold will be arraigned Tuesday.","Carl Herold, 32, is accused of sodomizing and sexually abusing his own son - only nine-years-old .

Following a petition that gathered more than 160,000 signatures, a Florida school district has finally agreed to rename a high school originally named after a Confederate general and the first 'Grand Wizard' of the Ku Klux Klan. Nathan B. Forrest High School in Jacksonville will change its name to something less controversial after the school board voted unanimously to remove Forrest's name from the school. According to the Washington Post, the school was named Nathan B. Forrest High School when it opened in 1959 after an organization called Daughters of the Confederacy pushed to commemorate the general. The vote: Duval County School Superintendent Nikolai Vitti watches as the votes of board members come in on his recommend to change the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest High School . The first Grand Wizard: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest was head of the KKK from 1866 until 1869 . Omotayo Richmond, who began the petition, has a daughter who attends school in the district, but  told ABC News he would not allow her to set foot inside a school named after a notorious racist. ‘It just wouldn’t happen,’ Mr Richmond said. ‘I believe it’s outrageous that this could even be questioned by anybody… that anybody could even come to the defense of this man.’ He’s not alone, the more than 160,000 people who signed his online petition come from all over the country. ‘I am very encouraged that [people] chose to support this cause and I am humbled by that and excited for change,’ he continued. Today, more than half the school's students are black. At the school board meeting Monday night, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said: . 'If you look at the history of the naming of Nathan B. Forrest High School, the students originally wanted the school to be named Valhalla. Politics reigned and as a response to desegregation and the civil rights movement, the school was named Nathan B. Forrest. That was not the will of the students, and considering the opinion of the students in this process, I think it is an opportunity to give voice to students whose voices were not heard in the beginning and can certainly be heard now. Commemorated elsewhere: The General Forrest Monument that was erected in Memphis, Tennessee in 1906 . Honoring a racist: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest High School was named after the former KKK leader, but residents want that to change . A previous attempt to change the school’s name have somehow failed. Despite a 2007 Florida State College . study that received an overwhelming number of responses in favour of . changing the school’s name, the school board voted against changing the . school’s name, according to ABC. The city of Memphis, TN., earlier this year voted to rename a park . named after the Mr Forrest, who also was a general in the Confederate . Army during the Civil War. The KKK marched on the city, with a . local leader claiming 'the Memphis City Council is basically trying to . eradicate white people out of the history books across America.' Lance Stoll, the college professor who headed up the 2007 effort, is spearheading this one as well. He believes this time the name will change. ‘We don’t want 60 per cent of the kids, black kids, going to a school named for somebody who would’ve killed them and enslaved them if he had the chance,’ Mr Stoll told ABC. Over 90 per cent of respondents in just under 2,000 door to door surveys conducted by Mr Stoll’s Jacksonville Progressive Coalition have responded in favor of changing the school’s name, ABC noted. The Klan: Klan members wear ceremonial robes and carry Confederate flags, in a nod to their past, when marching in protest . A further 36 people showed up to last week’s school board meeting advocating to change the name, according to ABC. Some did speak in favor of the name remaining, arguing for Mr Forrest’s place in history. ‘Forrest, the man, and his association with the KKK is history,’ 1979 graduate Alison Barwick said, according to ABC. ‘The KKK’s function was much different in his time than it is now.’ ‘I think you’d be hard pressed to find any Southern gentleman from that era that didn’t have some association with the Klan,’ she added.","Nathan Bedford Forrest High School, in Jacksonville, is named after the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan .

Congress' top GOP watchdog is warning the secretary of Health and Human Services to stop instructing contractors behind healthcare.gov not to talk to Congress about the project. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair Darrell Issa, a hard-charging California Republican, told Sec. Kathleen Sebelius in a letter on Wednesday that it's against the law to get between Congress and the companies her agency hired to work on  the crash-and-burn website. 'Obstructing a Congressional . investigation is a crime,' Issa said Thursday in a statement. 'The federal . obstruction laws reflect the fact that Congress’ right of access to . information is constitutionally based,' his letter warned,' and critical to the integrity and . effectiveness of our oversight and investigative activities. ... Private citizens and companies . cannot contract away their duty to comply with a congressional request . for documents.' Issa also alleged that muzzling the website contractors violates a federal whistleblower law that 'prohibits interfering with an employees’ right to furnish information to . Congress.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa is a no-nonsense investigator whose knife-in-the-teeth approach to Obamacare has rankled Democrats for more than a year . What, me worry? U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has made several appearances on Capitol Hill to defend the Obama administration's handling of the national health insurance overhaul . 'Any effort to enforce a . contract that prevents a federal employee – or in this case, a . contractor – from communicating with Congress is unlawful,' he wrote. On Dec. 6, Issa says, HHS told at least one contractor not to respond to congressional requests for documents related to the failed website rollout, insisting that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should be the only source of information Congress gets. Issa has been conducting an aggressive investigation into the mistakes made in contracting, building, and testing the website, which quickly became a national punchline after it went live. Part of that probe involved requesting information from 11 of the most active companies that worked on the site. But in the Dec. 6 letter Issa obtained, HHS notified . a contractor called Creative Computing Solutions that its contract forbade it from providing documents to third parties, . including members of Congress. 'If you receive a request for this information from Congress,' the government department wrote, 'CMS will respond directly to the requestor.' Muzzled: Executives from the biggest Obamacare website contractors had their turn before Congress on Oct. 24, weeks before HHS started telling them to freeze lawmakers out of their document chains. Pictured (L-R) are Cheryl Campbell of CGI Federal, Andrew Slavitt of Optum/QSSI, Lynn Spellecy of Equifax Workforce Solutions and John Lau of Serco . Healthcare.gov, the main national Obamacare portal, has been a debacle for the Obama administration following crashes and extended downtime following its Oct. 1 launch . Issa cited HHS's antagonism toward his committee, but said in his letter that trying to put a gag on potential witnesses was a bridge too far. 'The Department’s most recent effort to stonewall, however, has morphed from mere obstinacy into criminal obstruction of a congressional investigation,' he wrote Sebelius. Obstruction of justice is a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Issa's oversight committee issued a subpoena on Oct. 31 for documents in HHS's possession that could help explain how healthcare.gov cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build but brought such widely documented disappointment.. Those documents, he said Wednesday, would include everything he has requested from the 11 contractors. Sebelius' agency hasn't turned them over, most recently citing the time burden of finding and cataloging so much information for Congress.","The Department of Health and Human Services wrote to Obamacare contractors telling them not to respond for Congress' document requests .

Bumbling Pennsylvania cops tossed a New York couple in jail for the past month on drug charges but released the duo after the supposed drugs tested positive – as soap. Annadel Cruz, 26, and Alexander Bernstein, 30, were pulled over last month for speeding in rural Pennsylvania. A search of their car turned up white powdery bricks wrapped in tape, which they insisted were soap but the officer insisted was cocaine. The officer searched Ms Cruz’s Mercedes-Benz after smelling marijuana – which Ms Cruz admitted to smoking in New York, but not while driving – and found a small amount of pot in her bra, as well as the powdery soap, according to The Morning Call, which detailed the ordeal. Locked up: The pair spent a month inside Lehigh County Prison . The officer insisted the powdery substance tested positive for cocaine in a field test and arrested them. The pair were hit with drug trafficking charges and tossed into Lehigh County Prison, where they remained on cocaine trafficking charges until last week, when an actual lab test came back indicating the powder was nothing more than soap – just as they had claimed. They were held in jail on a bail of $500,000 for Mr Bernstein and $250,000 for Ms Cruz.

Levine's turn as the new face of Obamacare comes shortly after down-market retailer Kmart unveiled a clothing line featuring his name -- and all the press certainly won't hurt sales . Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, named the 'sexiest man alive' by People magazine in November, is joining a handful of B-list celebrities to promote the Affordable Care Act to millennials who are abandoning the new health insurance scheme in droves. With a Harvard University poll showing this week that only 29 per cent of uninsured 18-to-29-year olds say they will definitely or likely to enroll in the new insurance marketplaces, the co-star of 'The Voice' is fronting a social media campaign designed to make Obamacare cool again. According to an announcement from the state-based insurance exchanges in California and Connecticut, and the Enroll America activist organization, the campaign will also leverage aging TV star Fran Drescher, 'Harold and Kumar' film star Kal Penn, actress and R&B singer Tatyana Ali, Latin Grammy winner 'Pitbull' Perez, and Iman 'AlphaCat' Crosson, an impressionist best known for his impersonation of President Barack Obama. Crosson recorded a spoof rap video, performing as the president, in conjunction with the program's launch. 'Don’t stand and diddle, my healthcare’s the shizzle,' he raps. 'It's chock full of top-notch healthcare provizzles. We’ll cover all your vizzles, your dizzles and your tizzles.' The campaign, called 'Tell a Friend – Get Covered,' features an aggressive Twitter push focused on the hashtag #getcovered. The White House joined in on Thursday afternoon with a tweet of encouragement to young Americans by insisting that buying a medical insurance policy would 'give your mom piece [sic] of mind.' CNBC correspondent Bertha Coombs fired back, tweeting, 'Your mom may want you to use #spellcheck in addition to #gettingcovered.' Levine's tweets brought more digital guffaws. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The White House's social media gurus played along with the new campaign's hashtag, only to bring digital guffaws with a typo . 'Tell A Friend - Get Covered' will officially launch Friday with a social media storm designed to attract millennials . Penn's first tweet in conjunction with the PR campaign was designed to appeal to the frat-boy set. 'Cover your dong, and you will live long,' he wrote. 'In fact, cover your whole sexy body. #GetCovered.' Bloomberg reported that the program's goal is to make '100 million Internet contacts' with millennials before Obamacare's open enrollment period ends on March 31. 'The idea is a drumbeat of dialogue, a drumbeat of discussion about coverage – not about glitches, not about the politics, not about the pundits,' said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state-based insurance exchange that spearheaded the campaign's launch. It's also about the personalities, including Drescher's irritating, nasal-voiced nanny character from the 1990s. 'Like we say at Cancer Schmancer, ""Take control of your body,""' she said in a statement on thursday.  'That's why I support Obamacare. Sign up and tell all your friends to sign up, too.' Sexiest: Levine and girlfriend Behati Prinsloo took time in Hawaii for a stroll before a Maroon 5 concert . Healthcare.gov had a rocky rollout and produced the online equivalent of millions of eye-rolls among tech-savvy young Americans, whom the Obama White House now hopes to woo back into the fold . The White House's model for the . Affordable Care Act hinges on attracting enough young, healthy Americans . – 40 per cent of total signups – to offset the cost of medical . treatment for older, more illness-prone enrollees. Levine, one of the co-hosts and judges on 'The Voice,' is the highest-profile celebrity the Obama administration and its allies have enlisted to date in their quest to right Obamacare's sinking ship . Early . estimates suggest that enrollment totals among the younger population . have totaled no more than 25 per cent.

Enroll America, the Obama-linked advocacy group that counsels uninsured Americans on how to enroll in new coverage, is part of the PR push. Anne Filipic, the group's president and a former deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, told Bloomberg that the focus on star power is just 'a first step to raise awareness.' Filipic was also Deputy Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee and served on Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' intergovernmental affairs staff during Obama's first term in office.. 'We don’t think that, by seeing a tweet, suddenly millions of people will go get coverage,' she said. 'Adam Levine’s tweet helps us begin, and then we can have a substantive conservation about what’s available.'","State-based insurance exchanges hope to use Twitter-swarm to entice millennials back into the Obamacare fold .

Food buffs will tell you that poached salmon and black truffles is lost without a chilled French chablis. But would they have a clue if you asked them which wine was best paired with a Big Mac and large fries? Motivated by the idea that every meal can be special, a team of experts has developed a guide that matches some of the nation’s favourite snacks and takeaway meals with their perfect wine. Experts say the perfect wine can be found for any meal, including takeaways . The researchers promise to make every . meal ‘a memorable experience’ by listing the best wine to go with . anything from a fish finger sandwich to Marmite on toast.

For . example, the experts said Scotch eggs should be teamed with a Swartland . chenin blanc, whose ‘round peachy texture works beautifully with the . soft texture and rich flavour of the egg’. A . McDonalds Big Mac meal is best accompanied by a zinfandel because its . ‘plummy sweet fruit characters pair well with the sweet flavours’ of the . chips and burger. After-dinner favourites haven’t been . forgotten, with the guide saying that Ben & Jerry’s Phish ice cream . should be matched with Yellow Tail shiraz or a dessert semillon.

Pope Francis said in a newspaper interview yesterday that he is not a Marxist but that even they can be good people. Responding to conservative criticisms that his economic and social ideas smack of communism Francis also denied reports that he would name a woman cardinal. Last month, American radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who has a huge following in the United States, railed against the pope for written comments made on the world economy. Limbaugh, who is not Catholic, said that parts of the document were 'pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the pope' and suggested that someone else had written the papal document for him. He also accused the pope of going 'beyond Catholicism' and being 'purely political'. Asked about the accusations, which sparked a debate in the media last month, Francis, a member of the all-male Jesuit order associated with progressive social policies, told La Stampa: 'Marxist ideology is wrong. But in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people, so I don’t feel offended.' In last month’s document, seen as a platform for his papacy, Francis attacked unfettered capitalism as 'a new tyranny' said an 'economy of exclusion and inequality' had proven to be deadly for many people around the world. In his response to the critics, Francis said he was not speaking 'as a technician but according to the social doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and this does not mean being Marxist'. He said he was just trying to present a 'snapshot of what is happening' in the world today. On Wednesday, Pope Francis was named 2013 Person . of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and . fugitive Edward Snowden into second place . Asked about speculation that a woman could be among the new cardinals he will appoint early next year, he said: 'I don’t know where that idea comes from. Women in the Church should be valued, not ""clericalised"".' In another document last week, Francis said huge salaries and bonuses were symptoms of an economy based on greed and called again for nations to narrow the wealth gap. Conservatives in the 1.2billion member Church have expressed concern and disappointment about some of the pope’s pronouncements, such as when he said he was not in a position to judge homosexuals who are people of good will sincerely seeking God.","Pontiff said Marxist ideology is wrong but he is not offended by label .

The Pentagon, with help from Apple product designers at Frog Design and Hollywood illustrators, has developed a mapping-style 'game' prototype that could be used to launch cyberattacks at the click of a button. Dubbed 'War of Cyberwarcraft' the system uses Samsung touch table technology to control network topologies - or a group of connected nodes - that look like 'constellations of stars'. Military strategists can press a node to open a drop-down menu that lets them visualise all possible attack scenarios and choose exactly how and where to send the attack. Scroll down for video . What Project X could look like: an early prototype of the interconnected maps that future cyber-warriors will use to prevent cyberattacks. This isn't exactly what the prototype looks like because Darpa is keeping the design a secret for security reasons. The prototype includes red 'target' nodes as well as 'weapon packages' and 'battle unit' nodes . Using a Samsung . SUR40 touch table, the mission name is shown in . the top right-hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing . the attack target. Below it is a network of connected nodes. Tapping on the red 'target' star causes blue wedges to pop up around it, with . icons such as lightning bolts or disks, as well as a . number. These numbers correspond to 'weapon packages' each containing different types of weapons, with . different costs and risks associated with them. Strategists can then pick battle units that detail the method of the intended attack. Other battle units can be selected to track how the mission is going, and strategists can change course if need be. As each node is selected, new . routes appear along the network and become more detailed. A prototype of the system was exclusively revealed to Noah Schachtman from Wired magazine by Dan Roelker, a cybersecurity . specialist who has been developing Plan X. He told Schachtman: 'Say you’re playing World of Warcraft, and you’ve got this type of sword, +5 or whatever. 'You don’t necessarily know what spells were used to create that sword, right? 'You just know it has these attributes and it helps you in this way. 'It’s the same type of concept. You don’t need the technical details.' Using a Samsung SUR40 touch table, Roelker explained that the mission name is shown in the top right-hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing the target, which in this instance was the botnet's server. Roelker taps on this red 'server' star and four blue wedges pop up around it, with icons such as lightning bolts or disks, as well as a number. These numbers are 'weapon packages' each containing different types of weapons, with different costs and risks associated with them. The team behind Plan X use a Samsung SUR40 touch table to manipulate the network topology. As each node is pressed, menu options appear. As more options are selected, more nodes appear and the more intricate the choices become. Strategists will be able to map out entire cyberattack scenarios using the system, weighing up cost and risk, before an attack is launched . Roelker continued: 'Maybe some technologies were more expensive to develop. Maybe it’s more risky or controversial. 'Maybe we spent $5 million building X, and if we use it, there’s a 50% chance we might lose it.' Although he adds that the numbers are meaningless on the prototype, they’re meant to convey each cyberattack has a different cost associated with it. During the demonstration, Roelker picked a weapon package called Sonic Boom, which cost him 10 points. He then picked from a list 'battle units'. Wired explained that these could potentially include downloading rootkits or launching a denial of service attack, although Roelker was reluctant to use these specific terms. Other units could measure how successful the mission is and as Roelker selected nodes, new routes along the network appeared and became more detailed. The Pentagon announced Darpa was working on Plan X in October last year, in a bid to upgrade its military force to be better prepared to fight in the digital age.

It was the first time the US government had sought outside support for its cyber strategies, and was hoping it would work in a similar way to its other military contracts. For example, Lockheed Martin holds contracts with the military . to build conventional weapons. The Defense . Department was quick to add that Plan X would not fund the development of . cyberweapons, but instead it would work to create tools to make existing ones more . effective.

Brave New World: The Pentagon's project titled 'Plan X' was launched in October 2012. It hopes to improve the US military's ability to wage cyberwars and prevent cyberattacks .

Lin, a cybersecurity expert with the National research Council told . the Washington Post. ‘If they achieve it, they’re talking about being able to . dominate the digital battlefield just like they do the traditional battlefield.' One of the main priorities for Plan X was creating this comprehensive, visual map that plots out the digital locations of tens of billions of computers around the world. Outside Help: The military is offering contracts to the private sector to encourage the development of new technology. Frog Design and illustrators from the Transformer films have already joined the team . This can be used to identify and target hostile servers and networks that they could then disable. They . also hope to create a stronger operating system that will allow for . quicker attacks, while also making computers at home less susceptible to . foreign attacks. Officials told the . Washington Post that they hope this new system will look like an armored . truck when compared to the SUV that is existing computer operating . systems. Plan X also hopes to set guidelines on how and when to use cyberattacks. Ultimately, they hope to use the prototype and have other technology and organisational capabilities in place to be able to carry out smaller, more precise attacks orchestrated by individual commanders in the field. The practical uses, though still far out, are incredible, says Daniel Kueh, an information warfare professor at National Defense University's iCollege. Specifically, he explains how eliminating power grids can be much more effective and less detrimental than during the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Serbia and Iraq. 'In all of those conflicts,' he said, 'we went after the other side’s electricity with bombs.' But now, the military can be much more humane, taking out power only when necessary and then being able to quickly restore it, without having to build an entirely new grid.","Apple product designers and Hollywood .

More than 15,000 people in Britain die every year as a result of cancer treatments rather than the disease itself, Lord Saatchi has said. The Tory peer said he had been given the estimate from someone in the medical profession. The advertising mogul has been campaigning for law changes to enable more innovation in treatment since his wife, novelist Josephine Hart, died from a form of ovarian cancer in 2011. Campaign: Lord Saatchi (right) with his wife Josephine Hart who died in 2011 from cancer . Lord Saatchi said: 'The point is we don't know if it is 1 per cent of patients or 100 per cent of patients who die as a result of the treatment. 'What we do know is that the cancer drugs do such damage to the immune system that the patient is helpless to resist fatal infections like E.coli or MRSA or septicaemia.' He said the Office for National Statistics under World Health Organisation guidelines only recorded 'the single underlying cause of death'. Lord Howe said statistics were collected for when cancer was the cause of death but not when treatment of cancer was the cause of death . 'In other words it doesn't record what is known as the sequence of causation, sometimes known as the sequence of conditions that led to the actual death,' he said. At question time in the House of Lords, he asked health minister Earl Howe: 'As this is supposed to be the era of big data, will you review the limitations of cancer mortality statistics in order to assist scientists and doctors to have the information to move forward innovation towards a cure for cancer?' Lord Howe said statistics were collected for when cancer was the cause of death but not when treatment of cancer was the cause of death. He agreed it was 'important to have more information about the effect of cancer treatments on mortality' but added that ""new data collections"" were under way to provide more detail. He said new figures would provide better information about deaths following the delivery of chemotherapy while others statistics would give information about death after surgical treatment. But he warned: 'It can be very hard to identify the precise cause or sequence of progression of factors resulting in death, particularly for those with end-stage cancer or who are particularly frail and are experiencing physical deterioration.

A businessman has been spared jail for a second time in nine months for downloading child porn because he has a brain tumour. Former company director, Stephen Pantlin, 49, downloaded hundreds of images of abused children on to his computers only months after being convicted of similar offences. The 49-year-old defendant had previously been ordered to adhere to strict conditions, including having special monitoring software on his computer. However, just a couple of months after his last conviction, he managed to get two new computers and a hard drive, so he could download hundreds of illegal images. Today he walked free from court after the judge again accepted that the tumour and operations to reduce its size had affected his judgment. Judge Jack Bayliss, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, sentenced Pantlin to an 18-month custodial sentence, suspended for two years. He was also told he will have to serve 240 hours unpaid community work, and restart a two-year community order to go on a paedophile rehabilitation program. Judge Bayliss said: 'The real evil of your substantive offences is the damage that’s done to children around the world. It’s horrendous. 'There’s only one thing stopping me from sending you straight to prison. That is the evidence of the removal of your fronto-temporal lobe and the effect that has had on you. 'I’m satisfied that has affected your breach of the sexual offence prevention order and your reoffending.' Charlene Sumnall, defending, said Pantlin had no prior convictions before he had contracted the tumour last year, which led to surgeons removing his fronto-temporal lobe. She said: 'It’s a slow-growing tumour that he’s got. The position of that tumour affects his judgement and impulse control, which is clearly a factor in his offending. 'This gentleman, who is now 49 years of age, had not been in trouble with the courts at all until that tumour. That must be a contributing factor. 'This offence has gone hand in hand with that tumour.' Prosecutor Lee Harris said police raided Pantlin's home after it emerged he had not told his estranged wife he was on the sexual offences register. The information came out at a family court hearing in January this year. A judge a Guildford Crown Court ordered Pantlin to undertake 240 hours of community service and to go on a community rehabilitation programme . Police officers found a new Sony Vaio laptop and iMac Apple computer which did not have police monitoring software installed on them as per the conditions of his original sentence. There was also an external hard-drive, on which forensic IT specialists found 458 indecent pictures of young children. The former company director, who is being divorced by his wife, was already serving a three-year community order imposed for similar offences last September. The judge also heard Pantlin violated a restraining order by sending his wife a Valentine’s Day card last February, with the message: 'This may be the last time I get to send you a ""wife"" card.' Ms Sumnall said that he had lost his job as a result of the offences and his marriage was over. 'This is a man at his lowest ebb. He came to court today with his bag packed to go to prison.' She said her client had contemplated taking his life and had even researched suicide sites on the internet. Ms Sumnall said that Pantlin’s grown-up daughter was in court to support him. 'He asks for one last chance,' she added. She said that Pantlin was working well with the Thames Valley programme to combat sex offending - and the organisers were keen for him to keep working on the project to rehabilitate him. Pantlin, of Guildford, admitted eight new counts of possessing indecent photographs of children, four counts of breaching a sexual offences prevention order, and one count of breaching a restraining order.","Stephen Pantlin, 49, was convicted for the second time in nine months .

Rare species perform unique roles in the way the world functions, claims new research, contradicting what was previously thought. A study from a team of researchers at the University of Montpellier in France has discovered that rare species perform tasks that more common species can't. Using data from three different ecosystems - coral reefs, tropical forests and alpine meadows - the researchers found that these unique functions are essential for maintaining balance within current ecosystems. Rare species, such as the giant moray eel found in coral reefs in the Red Sea, play a much more vital role in the balance of their ecosystems than was first thought . Coral reefs are underwater structures made from calcium carbonate released by corals. Reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters. Often called 'rainforests of the sea', coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They take up less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, yet are home to 25% of all marine species, including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms and sponges. The annual global economic value of coral reefs was estimated at US$ 375 billion in 2002. However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems because they are very sensitive to water temperature. And if these rare species disappear, our ecosystems could fail - or struggle to rebuild in the event of a global disaster. Lead researcher Dr David Mouillot said: 'These unique features are irreplaceable, as they could be important for the functioning of ecosystems if there is major environmental change.' As rare species and the biodiversity of . these regions decline, the unique traits and features these animals . bring to the areas are vulnerable to extinction because rare species are . likely to disappear first. Biodiverse environments are known by their large number of rare species. These rare species contribute to the diversity of an area but, up until now, their functional importance within these ecosystems has been largely unknown. Because there are fewer rare species . within a region, they were traditionally thought to have little bearing . on how other species interact and how the ecosystem functions, compared . with more common species. If rare species seen in places such as coral reefs and rainforests die out, the carefully balanced ecosystems of those regions could fail or be damaged. This is because rare species perform unique functions within these areas, say the researchers . The rare pyramidal saxifrage, an alpine plant, is an important resource for pollinators in the mountain regions of Europe . It . was previously assumed that rare species play the same roles within an . ecosystem as their common neighbours, yet have less impact because of . their low numbers. This phenomenon is known as ‘functional redundancy’. The . redundancy suggests that rare species merely serve as an 'insurance' policy for the ecosystem, in the event of an ecological loss. To test this, the researchers analysed the extent to which rarer species in the three different ecosystems performed the same ecological functions as the most common ones. They examined biological and bio-geographical information from 846 reef fish, 2,979 alpine plants and 662 tropical trees and found that most of the unique and vulnerable functions, carried out via a combination of traits, were associated with rare species. Examples of rare species that were found by the researchers to perform vulnerable functions include the giant moray, a predatory fish that hunts at night in the labyrinths of coral reefs and the pyramidal saxifrage, an alpine plant that is an important resource for pollinators. Another was the Pouteria maxima, a huge tree in the rainforest of Guyana, which is particularly resilient to fire and drought. Not only are these species rare, they also have few functional equivalents among the more common species in their respective ecosystems, according to the research published in the journal PLOS Biology. The Kaieteur National Park in Guyana. The rainforest in Guyana is a biodiverse environment because of the large number of species that live in relatively close proximity. Researchers have found that rare species, including the Guyanan tree Pouteria maxima, are fundamental to maintaining balance in biodiverse ecosystems . Dr Mouillot said: 'Our results suggest . that the loss of these species could heavily impact upon the functioning . of their ecosystems. 'This calls into question many current conservation strategies.' The work emphasises the importance of the conservation of rare species, even in diverse ecosystems. Dr Mouillot said rare species are more vulnerable and serve irreplaceable functions, the preservation of biodiversity as a whole - not just the most common species, but all those who perform vulnerable functions - appears to be crucial for the resilience of ecosystems. He added: 'Rare species are not just an ecological insurance - they perform additional ecological functions that could be important during rapid transitions experienced by ecosystems. 'The vulnerability of these functions, in particular biodiversity loss caused by climate change, highlights the underestimated role of rare species in the functioning and resilience of ecosystems. 'Our results call for new experiments to explicitly test the influence of species rarity and the uniqueness of combinations of traits on ecological processes.'","Researchers from the University of Montpellier in France analysed the role rare species play within coral reefs, tropical forests and alpine meadows .

Her husband Paul was forced to call the police because nurses repeatedly ignored her calls for help when she feared she was having a 'diabetic hypo' When no nurse arrived she called her . husband, Paul, at home. He immediately telephoned the ward at Tameside . Hospital in Greater Manchester and spoke to a nurse. But after a further 20 minutes a distraught Mrs Callan phoned him back and said a nurse still had not come to offer her a drink. In desperation Mr Callan telephoned . the police to ask for their help but the switchboard operator directed . him back to the hospital. Eventually Mrs Callan was given a . sugary drink which was necessary to prevent her becoming hypoglycaemic, a . diabetic condition caused by low blood sugars that can induce a coma . and even cause death. Paul Callan said said he was left with no choice but to dial 999 because he was worried his wife would go into a coma or die. Mrs Callan was eventually given the attention she needed but died four days later after contracting the superbug C-difficile . Tragically, the great-grandmother died . four days later in August last year from chronic heart failure and lung . disease, as well as contracting the superbug C.difficile in the . hospital. Last night her husband condemned . Tameside Hospital for failing to provide basic life-sustaining drinks . for a seriously ill patient. Mr Callan, 54, said: ‘What happened . to Bridget in Tameside was terrifying. She rang me around 4am and said . she had low blood sugar. She needed Lucozade. ‘She said she had been pressing the buzzer for more than 20 minutes, but no one was coming. ‘She asked me to ring the landline so I called the ward and spoke to a nurse who said, “Leave it with me”. Since the death of his wife, Paul (pictured here on her wedding day in 1986) said he has been waiting for answers . ‘But 20 minutes later my wife rang . back saying still no one had seen her. I tried to call the ward back but . the landline was engaged and I couldn’t get hold of anyone. ‘I didn’t know what to do. I was so worried I rang the police. ‘Eventually, my wife rang back and . said someone had been to give her a drink. The next day the matron on . the ward said I shouldn’t have rung the police – but  what would have . happened if Bridget hadn’t been able to call me for help? She would have . been  in a coma.’ Tameside Hospital has been at the . centre of dozens of complaints over standards and is one 14 hospitals . identified as needing an in-depth inspection because of its higher than . average death rates. Mr Callan is one of more than 100 relatives and former patients who recently met inspectors. He has made an official complaint to the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) about his  wife’s treatment. He said: ‘I think the hospital management need a kick up the backside. I can’t forget how Bridget  was treated.’ Last night a spokesman for Tameside . Hospital said: ‘We are sorry that Mr Callan was not reassured following . conversations with the PALS team and the consultant overseeing his late . wife’s care. ‘We are happy to look into his continuing concerns and would urge him to contact us via the complaints co-ordinator.’ The case echoes that of diabetic Kane . Gorny who died of dehydration at a London teaching hospital after he . phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty. An inquest heard police arrived at his bedside only to be sent away by nurses who said he was confused. Mr Gorny, who had previously had a . brain tumour, was in a side room in St George’s Hospital, Tooting, after . lashing out at nurses when they would not give him more water. A Westminster inquest heard he called his mother, Rita Cronin, who said: ‘He sounded really, really distressed. ‘He said, “They won’t give me anything . to drink”. He also said, “I’ve called the police. You better get here . quickly, they’re all standing around the bed getting their stories . straight”.’ His mother immediately went to the hospital where she found him delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue. She told the inquest that staff tutted . at her and refused to listen to her concerns that her son had not been . given vital medication. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner . Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: ‘Kane Gorny died as a result of dehydration . contributed to  by neglect.’","Bridget Callan, 62, suffered with diabetes, heart failure and lung disease and was hospitalised with a chest infection in August 2012 .

The stepfather of an Idonesian girl who worked herself to death has defended the advertising industry saying that 'long hours are expected.' Zafrul Sjahrial, who has had a 35-year career in advertising, said that Pradnya Paramita was entering a 'high note' of her career adding that she knew what it took to succeed. Paramita collapsed on Saturday while out with friends following the mammoth shift, slipped into a coma, and died on Sunday. Zafrul Sjahrial, the stepfather of Pradnya Paramita who died after a 30 hour shift, has defended the advertising industry saying Paramita knew what it took to succeed . Speaking to the South China Morning Post following her funeral, Sjahrial said: 'Life . in advertising is not like working in a bank or any other institution. 'The long hours are expected and already a prerequisite. I know how the industry works. Other industries are doing worse than this.' He also dismissed the claims that she had worked 30 hours solid as 'overblown', adding: 'There must be lunch breaks and dinner breaks, there must have been walks around the office. 'For a young lady – for 30 hours – she wouldn’t want to stay in the same clothes the whole day.' He also confirmed that the family would not be taking any action against her employer, Young & Rubicam, as they just wanted their daughter to rest in peace. Y&R are an advertising firm with headquarters in New York, 6,500 employees across the world and clients including Dell, Colgate, Xerox and Citibank. Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, frequently posted about her long hours online and collapsed while having dinner with friends just hours after this message . Paramita worked for advertising agency Young & Rubicam whose clients include Dell and Xerox . The copy writer slipped into a coma late on Saturday night and was pronounced dead on Sunday . Sjahrial said her tweets showed she was passionate about her job and was 'a girl ready for the next step' Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, often messaged about her long hours, and at 7pm on Saturday, shortly before she collapsed, said: '30 hours of working and still going strooong.' Speaking about the message Sjahrial said: 'She’s so enthusiastic and passionate. That tweet is by a girl ready for the next step. 'My daughter was strong. I know she knows what it takes to be in the advertising industry.' He described the 27-year-old as passionate, a keen reader, and strong headed. Weeks before her death Paramita had earned awards for her work. Sjahrial, an advertising creative director with 35 years' experience, said long hours were expected . The Thai version of Red Bull has been blamed for contributing to the death, and Sjahrial says Paramita had used it to stay awake since University, but stressed that the company had not asked her to drink it . Sjahrial confirmed that he would not be pressing charges against the company saying that if people wanted somebody to blame, they should blame the entire industry . Addressing claims that Thai Red Bull could have contributed to her death, he said she had used the drink to stay awake since going to University, and stressed that the company had not asked her to do so. He added that people looking for somebody to blame should blame the entire industry, not just one company. Y&R are investigating the death internally and closed their Jakarta office for the day on Monday as a mark of respect. Stepfather also said reports of continuous 30-hour shift were 'overblown' saying there must have been breaks for food or opportunities to walk around the office . In a Facebook post about the death Y&R expressed sympathy with the family, before telling other employees: ‘Please people. Know your own body limitation, don’t push yourself too hard.’ Meanwhile a state lawmaker has called for an independent inquiry and said the company may be taken to court if it was proved Paramita worked excessive hours. This case echoes that of German-born Merrill Lynch intern Moritz Erhardt, who was found dead in the shower of his London flat after a non-stop 72-hour shift . An inquest found he died of an epileptic seizure which could have been brought on by tiredness. Merrill Lynch was a one-time client of Y&R in the '80s.","Pradnya Paramita, 27, died Sunday after tweeting about a 30-hour shift .

It is nothing unusual for a recently divorced woman to spruce herself up a bit before reentering the dating game. But a growing number of divorcees are going one step further and turning to the scalpel in an attempt to reinvent themselves. Dubbed 'revenge plastic surgery', more and more newly single women (and men) are choosing to go under the knife, sometimes for drastic procedures, in a bid to transform their bodies and, it has been said, to make their ex jealous. Transform Plastic Surgery Group report that 26 per cent of plastic surgery patients are now recently divorced women, and 11 per cent are recently divorced men, a rise on last year. Procedures range from fillers and Botox to more invasive surgeries like full body lifts and breast implants. The trend has been on the rise in the U.S. for years, with demand there now so high that several plastic surgery clinics have started offering post-divorce discounts and procedure packages. And as is so often the case, the trend now seems to be reaching the UK. Many people feel they ‘let themselves go’ during a marriage and, once they find themselves back on the dating scene at an older age after a divorce, prompting a crisis in confidence. Or they simply wish to show their ex what they have lost - and what they are missing. But while going under the knife may seem like an easy way to make your ex jealous and hit single life with renewed confidence, plastic surgeons warn that having permanent procedures done for the benefit of somebody else is ill advised. Transform Plastic Surgery Group report that 26 per cent of plastic surgery patients are now recently divorced women, and 11 per cent are recently divorced men . Top plastic surgeon Dr. Brent Moelleken says of the trend in revenge surgery: 'I personally believe this is part of the grieving process when a relationship ends. ‘It's never a good idea to have plastic surgery for somebody else, only for yourself. ‘Some people are unhappy with their surgery because they did it for their ex. When things don't work out, they blame their surgery for not fixing the problem. 'So experienced plastic surgeons are watchful for patients who are doing surgery for the wrong reason.’","Over a quarter of female plastic surgery patients are recently divorced .

A collaboration between the founders of Frasca Food and Wine in Colorado and Chipotle Mexican Grill may change the way the Denver experiences pizza. The founders of Frasca, Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson and Bobby Stuckey, and Chipotle founder Steve Ells opened a restaurant in Denver in May called Pizzeria Locale that would create a fast food pizza restaurant with the same quality ingredients as other establishments but at half the price. They worked engineers to create a cutting edge pizza oven powered by gas and infrared that makes pizza in just two minutes.They plan to open two more locations in Denver soon. Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson(left) and Bobby Stuckey(right) have partnered with long time friend Chipotle Founder Steve Ells to create a unique dining experience . Steve Ells opened Chipotle 20 years ago and now has thousands of busy locations around the world . Mackinnon-Patterson and Stuckey opened their first Pizzeria Locale in Boulder, Colorado in 2011 which took a more classic approach to pizza making. They even sent their team to Italy before opening the pizza spot. Their other restaurant Frasca Food and Wine is fine dining and may seem like a far cry from Chipotle, which is known as being a quality yet inexpensive fast food chain. The business partners happen to see more similarities between their restaurants than differences. Westword.com reported that Steve Ells opened Chipotle Mexican Grill at 1644 East Evans Avenue 20 years ago and now has thousands of Chipotles around the world. Ells, who is good friends with Patterson and Stuckey says, 'we've always talked about the possibility of some kind of collaboration.' Ells told Westword that, 'The combination of the two businesses working together is a very lethal combination.' The partners realized that Combining Chipotle's skills of feeding many people with Mackinnon-Patterson's and Stuckey's knowledge of fine dining could create a casual and fine dining dining fusion. 'We realized we could change the ways people think about pizza...how can we serve the same ingredients at less than half the price. Shockingly, it's worked,' he said to Westword. 'Opening Pizzeria Locale using a model similar to Chipotle allows us to make extraordinary pizza, made with high-quality ingredients accessible to everyone,' he continued. Pizzeria Locale uses high quality ingredients but only charges half the price of other similar establishments . Chipotle also uses high quality ingredients at an affordable cost . Two years ago when Chipotle partnered up with Stuckey and Patterson, they had kept it a secret. Now the secret is no more. 'For me it's kind of been a pain in the tush,' said Stuckey of the secret partnership. 'We have this business in Boulder that's just us, with no investors, and you have this situation which is the whole other end of the spectrum -- and not to be in a position to discuss that was uncomfortable. I'm glad we can now.' 'Chipotle and Frasca have much more in common than they do apart, said Mackinnon-Patterson. 'They really care about the customer, about ingredients, about service. They don't want to compromise, and they don't.' Mackinnon-Patterson(pictured inside his restaurant Frasca) has a background in fine dining and brings a new kind of edge to the casual pizza collaboration . Gretchen Kurtz reviewed Pizzeria Locale for Westword in September and wrote it's, 'Pizzeria Locale, Steve Ells-style, where you order at the counter and watch a line of white-shirted, red-hatted employees spoon toppings from metal containers onto dough that's loaded onto the spinning oven floor.' She also said, 'The concept behind Denver's Pizzeria Locale sure has its strong points.How far can Patterson, Stuckey and crew take it? God only knows.' 'We've come a long way in a short time,' said Mackinnon-Patterson. 'We feel we can look at something more.' The partners say that their new locations will be based on the original Denver Pizzeria Locale but that they will keep working on their efficiency. 'We're going to continue to work on it, keep improving it,' said Mackinnon-Patterson. 'The full-service restaurant is a contemporary pizzeria inspired by the traditional pizzerias of Naples, Italy. The new Denver restaurant draws from the same inspiration. It also draws from a commitment to premium ingredients and an interactive service format similar to Chipotle, ' reads Chipotle's press release. The Detroit Free Press reported that this is not the first time Chipotle has ventured outside of Mexican Food. They also run six ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants in Washington and Los Angeles.","The 2 year collaboration between Chipotle founder Steve Ells and Frasca Food and Wine founders Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson and Bobby Stuckey is no longer a secret .
'The combination of the two businesses working together is a very lethal combination,'said Ells .
'We realized we could change the ways .

'I can't say exactly what's in it because people can be naughty with it,' explains Brandy Wright, product director and co-founder of experimental food group, The Robin Collective. 'And it's technically classified as a firearm.' But Brandy isn't talking about bombs or guns. Instead, she's discussing the magic behind an invention called the 'chicken rocket' - a device that allows you to shoot a spoonful of stuffing across a room directly into the cavity of the bird. It might sound bizarre but for Brandy, exploding stuffing is all in a day's work - and it's not even the most unusual method of decorating food on the Robin Collective's menu. Extreme garnishing: The concept is the brainchild of the Robin Collective's Brandy Wright and Robin Fegen . And it's certainly not all chickens and stuffing. At . their extreme garnishing classes, Brandy, and her partners, Robin Fegen and former child actress, Elspeth Rae, also show students how . to create cocktails that change colour, marshmallows that double as . medicine and bitters that taste like Charles Dickens or Alfred . Hitchcock. The point? To show the world how to take food to Heston Blumenthal style extremes - and beyond. All the same, it's hard to avoid mentioning the collective's impressive dedication to things that go bang - not always with the expected result. 'When Robin first started doing the . explosives, he tried to make a rocket sandwich where all the ingredients hang on wires before being blown together by the explosion,' reveals Brandy. 'He was testing it in the back garden and it . just kind of went everywhere. He also had an idea to blow up plastic balls,' she continues, 'and blew . up his hand but it wasn't so bad - he just had bruises.' Colourful: Brandy says that pine or Christmas pudding infused 'caviar' is perfect for livening up the big day . Creative: Workshops teach extreme garnishing and how to make the colour-changing Bizarregarita cocktail . Popular: According to Brandy, Heston Blumenthal has helped make theatrical food a big trend in Britain . And while the exploding sandwich went wrong, other flammable foods made the cut and are on the curriculum at the trio's workshops. 'The chicken rocket is pretty crazy but I . think the explosive icing was probably better because it explodes like a . firework and its really colourful and smoky,' adds Brandy. 'Doing a flaming pineapple . with the icing is amazing but the rocket chicken can be unreliable because if something goes wrong . then you can get stuffing all over your wall!' While turning your turkey into the gastronomic equivalent of a land mine isn't recommended, Brandy does have some creative ideas for making December 25th go with a bang. 'Robin would probably add food colouring . and glitter to everything,' she muses, 'whereas I'd just try and make everything bigger. 'You can do a lot with infusing,' she adds. 'Like pine infusing. Break it down and . make a bit molecular. Fake caviar is good, pine infused or Christmas . pudding flavoured. 'At the moment, you can go to any cocktail bar and pay £12 to £15 for a . molecular cocktail but really, you can easily make them at home. 'The great thing about . molecular cocktails is that they're easy and cheap and you can get guests to make them too. It's a good way of getting guests to serve themselves!' It's this that is at the root of the Robin Collective's mission - putting creative food concepts into the public arena and showing that despite appearances, getting involved is not only doable but simple. 'The whole idea behind is by taking children's science products and making it super fun for adults,' adds Brandy. 'Heston [Blumenthal] has helped to push the idea of food combined with a theatrical production and it's really trendy now. 'It's . just super easy and super fun, and the classes are just about showing people how easy it is . to do things we do. I don't think it will ever go away.'

Disgraced former Navy chaplain Gordon 'Dr. Chaps' Klingenschmitt has weighed in on a recent ruling by a Colorado court that forced a Denver bakery to serve wedding cakes to same-sex couples, slamming the plaintiffs at the center of the lawsuit have 'demonic spirits manifesting inside them' and are 'cooperating with the devil. In his latest anti-gay tirade, Klingenshmitt, who has become infamous for the pro-discrimination statements made on his daily 'Pray In Jesus Name' TV program, said Charlie Craig and David Mullins - who sued their local bakery for refusing to sell them a cake for their nuptials - are 'inhuman'. Klingenshmitt also said he is looking into having Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer - who made the bakery treat gay people as regular customers - impeached in the wake of the ruling, according to the Huffington Post. 'I admit that the two men are humans -- they're men,' Klingenshmitt said. Scroll down for video ... Controversial: Former Navy chaplain Gordon 'Dr. Chaps' Klingenschmitt has slammed a decision forcing a Denver baker to serve same-sex couple 'unhuman' on his TV program 'Pray In Jesus Name' David Mullins, left, and Charlie Craig, right, successfully sued a Colorado bakery after their order for a rainbow wedding cake was turned down by the owner . 'But when they manifest sexual immorality, there's something inside of them that is manifesting and, on this show, we like to discern the spirits and I would say that's a demonic spirit that is manifesting inside of them.' He then added: 'They're cooperating with the devil and there is something unhuman inside of them.' An evangelical Protestant chaplain, Klingenschmitt was involuntarily discharged from the Navy and fined $3000 in 2007 for wearing his military uniform at a protest in Washington that was trying to push the government to guarantee the right of chaplains to 'pray in the name of Jesus'. He is not the first to renounce the Denver ruling. Last week, the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer said Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips was a victim of what he described as 'the Secular Inquisition' on an installment of his 'Focal Point' radio show. In September Judge Spencer ruled that Phillips had illegally discriminated against the plaintiffs. He ordered Phillips to accommodate same-sex couples or face fines and other penalties. Owner: Jack Philips maintained in court that his belief in Jesus Christ preventing him from making cakes for same-sex couples. The judge ruled in September he had to make such cakes or face fines and other penalties . Ongoing: Charlie Craig and David Mullins said they knew of other gay couples who also had orders refused, not necessarily for wedding occasions . 'At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses,' Spencer wrote in his 13-page ruling. 'This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are.' Colorado allows civil unions for same-sex couples, but defines marriage as between one man and one woman. Craig, 33, and Mullins, 28, were wed in Massachusetts, one of 16 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, but wanted to have a celebration of their nuptials in Colorado. Phillips refused to bake the cake, saying his Christian beliefs prevented him from doing so. Priorities: In another instance a gay couple had their order refused but when told the order was for a dog, the bakery happily agreed to proceed . Winners:  Charlie Craig and David Mullins on their wedding day . Nicolle Martin, an attorney for Masterpiece Cakeshop, said the judge's order puts Phillips in an impossible position of going against his Christian faith. 'He can't violate his conscience in order to collect a paycheck,' she said. 'If Jack can't make wedding cakes, he can't continue to support his family. And in order to make wedding cakes, Jack must violate his belief system. That is a reprehensible choice. It is antithetical to everything America stands for.' The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, which ruled that Phillips had violated a state law barring discrimination at public accommodations based on race, gender or sexual orientation. Spencer then upheld the commission's findings. Mullins said in a statement it was 'offensive and dehumanizing' when he and Craig were denied service at the bakery. After venting such frustrations on Facebook, Mullins received an outpouring of support from the community, with the story 'catching fire' in the media. 'We felt that the best way to honor the support that they had given us was to follow this complaint through,' he said. 'No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are,' he said. Mullins said he and Craig were 'ecstatic' about the decision. 'To a certain extent, though, I don't think that this is necessarily a surprise,' he said. Phillips may appeal. The discrimination case of Charlie Craig and David Mullins (pictured) was far from the first legal hurdle same sex couples have had to jump over in Colorado . Recent advances on gay rights only underscore Colorado's difficult past on the issue. In 2006, voters banned gay marriage. More notably, in 1992, voters approved a ban on municipal anti-discrimination laws set up to protect gays, leading some to brand Colorado a 'hate state'. Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court said the law, known as Amendment 2, was unconstitutional.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:52 EST, 18 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:00 EST, 18 December 2013 . The American infant mortality rate has dropped just slightly to 6.14 deaths per 1,000 births, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control. The new figure, released by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, comes from an analysis of data from the most recent statistics from 2010 and though it does mark a decrease it is only a small one. The infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6.39 deaths per 1,000 children, meaning that the number dropped by just 4 per cent over that year span. Infant mortality rates are used for measuring a country's prosperity and the nation's overall health. Slowly decreasing: The infant mortality rate has not been released for 2011 yet, but it is expected to be down to 6.05 per cent, from 6.14 in 2010 and 6.39 in 2009 . In that vein, the 6.14 figure is not a good sign for the U.S. as it places the sole remaining superpower as one of the lowest of the world's wealthiest nations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development analyzes global health statistics and noted that the average infant mortality rate is only 4 deaths per 1,000 births. NBC News reported that Iceland held one of the lowest rankings with only 1.6 deaths per 1,000 while Japan, Sweden and Finland came in shortly after with 2 deaths. According to the OECD report, the US was ranked number 26 out of 34 wealthy countries, which is a statistic that has analysts worried. 'While life expectancy in the United States used to be one year above the OECD average in 1970, it is now more than one year below the average,' the report stated. Birth defects and low birth weight- which was cited as connected to young mothers- were named as the main causes of America's relatively low ranking. Still not stellar: The infant mortality rate in the United States is still higher than that of many other wealthy countries, as their average is 4 per cent and the US is still more than 2 percentage points higher. The US looks like it is ranked more favorably in this graphic because it looks at all countries- wealthy and poor- which boosts up the US . 'In reality, women with one risk . factor often have other risk factors as well,' a report by Save the . Children concluded when it was released in April. 'For . example, teenage mothers are more likely to be unmarried and of a . low-income status; mothers who do not receive prenatal care are more . likely to be of a low-income status and uninsured.' Causes: Premature births are the main cause for infant mortality in the US which often causes birth defects and low birth weight . Multiple births also play a factor as the infant mortality rate for triplets is ten times the rate for single births. At least one of those problems may be fixed in coming years, as Danish food ingredients maker Chr Hansen is in discussions with companies over using probiotic bacteria to reduce the risk of a deadly stomach disease among premature babies. An independent study by the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne has shown that daily intake of a mix of three of Chr Hansen's probiotic strains more than halved the risk among premature babies of developing necrotizing enterocolitis compared with infants that received a placebo. The study was conducted on 1,100 children. 'We are in dialogue with potential customers about products which addresses NEC directly,' Christian Barker, Executive Vice President of Chr Hansen's Health & Nutrition Division, told Reuters. He declined to reveal which companies are involved in the talks. Chr Hansen makes cultures, colors and enzymes and has food producers like Danone and Nestle as major customers.","American infant mortality rate was 6.39 deaths per 1,000 births in 2009 and data from 2010 has it down to 6.14 .

Short fuse: Southern Illinois coach Barry Hinson, 51, went on an epic rant about his 'uncoachable' team after their fourth straight loss, calling them 'soft' and 'mama's boys' Southern Illinois coach Barry Hinson held nothing back last night while lambasting his players, calling them 'uncoachable' and ‘mama’s boys’, and unfavorably comparing their scoring abilities that those of his wife in what is being called the best rant of the year. The ever-blunt Hinson, 51, delivered his viral invective Tuesday night while speaking to reporters just minutes after his team lost their fourth straight game. ‘They won’t let me coach them,’ Hinson fumed. ‘Any time I coach somebody they put their head down. We’re soft. We’ve been enabled for whatever reason. He continued, ‘I got a bunch of mama’s boys right now. And we just won’t buck up and bow our necks, and we’ve got to get through that.’ The irascible coach singled out one player in particular, calling starting point guard Marcus Fillyaw ‘absolutely awful.’ Hinson, a married father of two, also brought up his wife, Angie, during his on-air outburst. Speaking of rebounds, Hinson exclaimed: ‘I’ve been telling my wife this for years, size doesn’t matter.’ ‘My wife can score more than two buckets on 11 shots, because I know my wife will at least shot-fake one time,’ Hinson said, his voice rising. ‘But those guys aren’t listening. They’re uncoachable right now.’ 'Sorry bunch': The Southern Illinois Salukis lost 73-65 to Murray State Tuesday, prompting their coach to unleash a diatribe against his players, calling them 'soft', among other things . Unflattering analogy: Speaking of his young team, Hinson said training them was like housebreaking a young puppy . Hinson, who is currently in his second year as the head coach of the Salukis, was unrepentant this morning when asked about his tirade, only saying that he regretted targeting Fillyaw by name. Hinson said at a news conference in Carbondale, Illinois, Wednesday that he apologized to the player for calling him out for his lacklustre performance in a 73-65 loss at Murray State Tuesday night. The coach, however, said he wouldn’t take back calling his players names and comparing the disciplining of his young team to housebreaking a puppy. ‘If that ruffles your feathers, or ruffles somebody else’s feathers, then you know what, you’re going to have to deal with it,’ Hinson said. ‘And here’s the other thing, I’m going to have to deal with it.’ Fillyaw said he wasn’t surprised with the way Hinson voiced his displeasure. ‘Everything he said was true,’ Fillyaw said. ‘Right now our team is playing soft. That’s a big part of our identity right now ... It wasn’t so much him calling me out personally. I was just as upset with my performance. His statement about me was accurate.’ Fillyaw paused and added, ‘It was embarrassing that the whole world knows now.’ While Angie Hinson was initially blindsided by the media attention sparked by her husband's tongue-lashing, she was not in the least surprised or offended by it. 'Usually he says things at home, not in front of a camera,' Hinson told St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'But anybody that knows Barry knows he loves his players and is not abusive or bullying toward them.' Regarding her spouse's decision to mention her in the rant, Mrs Hinson said it has happened before. 'It's not anything new except that I'm getting a little more credit,' she said. Athletic director Mario Moccia said he took no disciplinary action against Hinson. ‘He’s very passionate. That’s why we hired him,’ Moccia said. ‘I just reinforced that we never want to specifically criticize a player. There’s a way to answer the media’s question about a specific player’s performance without being overly critical where people think you’re being too tough on the kid.’ Foot in mouth disease: Hinson later said he regretted calling starting point guard Marcus Fillyaw (left) 'absolutely awful,' and jokingly offered the hand of his younger daughter, Ashley (right), in marriage to him . Berry Hinson initially was calm Tuesday when he met with reporters minutes after the Salukis’ loss. He became more wound up the longer he discussed a performance in which his team shot 42 per cent, committed 18 turnovers and was outrebounded 40-29. Hinson added, ‘I’m tired of coaching a guy and having him roll his eyes, or put his head down or feel sorry for himself. I’m tired of that. This is big time. ... We’ve got men and women serving our country. ‘They don’t get to take days off. We’re going to college and getting it paid for.’ Several media outlets reported that senior center Davante Drinkard later tweeted, ‘I can’t believe the little man had the nerve to call us mama’s boys. Smh. I guess this is where Our team learns to point the finger.’ The tweet was later removed. As of Wednesday afternoon, Drinkard’s Twitter account was allowing access only to confirmed followers. Hinson said he wasn’t upset about Drinkard’s tweet. Proud husband: Hinson unfavorably compared his players' scoring ability to that of his wife, Angie (right), saying that she could more than two buckets on 11 shots . Patriarch: Hinson, pictured center with his grandson, has two daughters, Tiffany (second left), who is married, and her younger sister, Ashley (far right) ‘That’s why we live in this country. It’s freedom of speech,’ Hinson said. ‘He apologized for calling me ‘little man.’ I’m 5-foot-8. I am a little man. It’s OK.’ Jay Bilas, a standout at Duke and now an ESPN broadcaster, and Creighton coach Greg McDermott both said Hinson only wants the best for — and from — his players. ‘On one hand, we want our coaches and subjects to be candid with us and tell us the truth, and then when they do we want to criticize them for that, too,’ Bilas said. ‘I have no problem with coaches that want to perhaps motivate their teams through the media at times.

McDermott has known Hinson since the early 2000s, when he was coach at Northern Iowa and Hinson was at Missouri State, where he remained for 16 years until 2008. . ‘Barry is a great coach and better person,’ McDermott wrote in a text message. ‘He wears his passion on his sleeve, which was evident in the interview. If his players listen to him, they will be better because of it.’ Fillyaw was scoreless with three fouls, two turnovers and one assist in 14 minutes against Murray State. ‘Marcus was absolutely awful,’ Hinson said. ‘That’s about as PG-rated as I can say it. He was awful. Our guards were awful. Our three starting guards had one assist and seven turnovers. They must think it’s a tax credit. It’s unbelievable how our starting guards played.’ Hinson added, ‘We made three turnovers tonight where we just came down and threw them the ball. I swear I thought one time that one of our players said, “Merry Christmas.”’ Hinson also blasted his big men, who combined to go 2 for 11. Hinson suggested that he will make a point of having his players do push-ups or run on a treadmill if they don’t do as they’re told. ‘To me, when you’ve got a young team, it’s a lot like house training a puppy dog,’ Hinson said, rolling up a piece of paper and swatting the table in front of him. ‘You know what, when the dog does something wrong, “Bad dog.” ‘Well, I’m not going to hit ‘em. I’m not going to swat ‘em. But, “Bad dog, get on the treadmill.” That’s probably what we need to do.’ Forgiving spouse: Angie Hinson later said that she was neither surprised nor offended by her husband's mentioning her during his now-viral tirade . Seeking to smooth things over with Fillyaw Wednesday, Hinson essentially offered the hand of his younger daughter, Ashley, in marriage to the player, TMZ reported. '[Fillyaw]'s one of those young men you'd really like for your daughter to marry' ... He said. 'As a matter of fact, my youngest daughter is still out there.  I've got her on Craigslist for a husband right now.' The 52-year-old Hinson is in his second season at Southern Illinois. He went 14-17 after inheriting a program hamstrung by academic problems and personnel issues. He had spent the previous four seasons in an administrative position with the Kansas basketball program. He’s 221-165 in 13 seasons as a head coach at SIU, Oral Roberts and Missouri State.","Barry Hinson, 51, spoke to reporters Tuesday night just minutes after his team lost their fourth straight game .

Sexually-explicit text messages and a video were exchanged between former Detroit City Council President Charles Pugh and an 18-year-old boy who had been part of a school mentoring program that Pugh ran, according to a police report. The report, released on Tuesday by police in Madison Heights, details exchanges between Pugh's cellphone and the teen over six days between the end of May and early June. The teen also told investigators that he was in Pugh's car when the councilman placed a hand on his thigh after buying him clothing at a Madison Heights store, north of Detroit. Detroit City Council president Charles Pugh, pictured in 2012, allegedly bought a teenage boy clothes in return for a sexually-explicit video . Police had sought a fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge against Pugh based on the alleged touching, but Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper determined there was not enough evidence to take the case to court. Cooper said last week that no charges will be filed. Ms Cooper explained the decision behind not pressing charges, saying on Tuesday: 'We have to prove it occurred and was against his will. Why would he make those videos? Credibility is also going to be an issue here.' By the time the teen's family filed a police complaint against Pugh in late June, the popular councilman and former television news reporter had stopped attending council sessions. State-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr denied Pugh's request for a medical-related leave of absence and stripped him of his pay and title as president. Pugh, 42, officially resigned in September. The Associated Press has been unable to reach Pugh since the start of the police investigation.

Detroit defense attorney Steve Fishman had been representing Pugh in the case and said on Tuesday that he had no comment. 'I have no idea where he is. Have not talked to him for some time. Never saw the police report,' Fishman said in an email. An investigator wrote in the report released on Tuesday that the suspect offered money and video games to the victim in exchange for a video of the victim. 'The suspect specifically requested that the victim be naked, and he preferred that the victim to be alone,' the investigator wrote. According to the Detroit Free Press: 'The suspect further requested that the victim have quality lighting for the video.' The council chief also reportedly told the . young man that he would pay based on how much he . liked the video - the teenager later received $160. The teen, who was 17 when he initially met Pugh through the mentoring program at Frederick Douglass High School in Detroit, later provided a video of himself, according to the report. 'The suspect continuously pressured the victim for the video because he (the victim) wanted money and video games,' according to the police report.

A sheep born from a frozen embryo that was preserved in a bid to save a rare British breed at the height of the foot-and-mouth crisis over a decade ago has produced her own set of twins. Maggie, a rare Herdwick sheep, was born in Cumbria in April 2011 from an embryo that had been saved during the foot-and-mouth crisis 12 years ago. And now, two years on from Maggie's astounding birth, the next generation have arrived as Maggie gave birth her own little duo in April this year. Ewe beauties: Maggie the sheep, who was born in 2011 from a frozen embryo, with her two lambs . Proud: Mother Maggie stands with her twin lambs born in the North Yorkshire dales near Pateley Bridge . The adorable twin lambs are carrying on the incredible work which was set in motion in 2001 in a desperate attempt to preserve the rare Herdwick breed. The devastating epidemic that summer prompted Cumbrian farmers to find a way to safeguard the commercially-important breed's future. Prof Dianna Bowles worked with the farmers and set up the Sheep Trust during the crisis, which came up with the idea to freeze embryos. Prof Bowles told how Maggie suddenly became ill in October last year. Her owner, Margaret Hall, asked the Sheep Trust to look after her and she quickly became pregnant the following month. Maggie, a rare Herdwick sheep, was born in 2011 a decade after the foot-and-mouth crisis . Prof Bowles, 65, a lecturer at York University and founder and chair of the Sheep Trust, said it was all thanks to science that Maggie has given birth to her own young. 'This just goes to show that science is evolving everyday and to think this would happen 12 years after the height of the foot-and-mouth epidemic is astronomical,' she said. Maggie was born and raised with the help of schoolgirl Evie Church, now 15, who was integral in rearing and looking after the ewe. Evie vowed to help fight FMD on her dad's farm in the tiny village of Lofthouse in the Yorkshire Dales after her father told her terrible stories of affected animals being culled. Evie then passed the ewe onto her new owner Mrs Hall, who put her back into her flock. Prof Bowles said: 'We passed Maggie back to her owner Margaret around five months after she was born, and basically said 'Here are your embryos', and she put Maggie back in her flock as normal. 'She was doing amazingly well, but suddenly Maggie, along with another ewe, became ill and we were asked to take them back. 'Weeks later, Maggie and the other ewe became pregnant, but we didn't know if they would both make it through. 'However, thanks to the fantastic work by the Sheep Trust, Maggie and the other ewe each now have twins. 'Maggie's little ones are beautiful, just like their mother. They haven't got a name yet, but they're so precious. 'We're finding that science can help agriculture more and more as technologies get better and better, and research can only improve after this.' The Herdwicks are one of the most commercially important breeds, and a staggering 20,000 were culled at the height of foot-and-mouth, leading to the fears the breed could become extinct. Prof Bowles, of Harrogate, North Yorks., who has her own flock of Herdwicks, was approached by Cumbrian farmers at the height of the foot-and-mouth epidemic who asked her to use her science to help their sheep breeds threatened by the disease. Cute: The two lambs, who were born in April take a rest in their North Yorkshire field . Importance: The adorable twin lambs are carrying on the incredible work which was set in motion in 2001 in a desperate attempt to preserve the rare Herdwick breed . 'The foot-and-mouth crisis was horrendous for everyone in the farming industry,' she said. 'I set up the Sheep Trust at the height of the epidemic, and after I was approached by the farmers to help I thought 'Why not'. After that I have really become attached to them. 'Now I'm trying to get some top class scientists and farmers into the same room to discuss how technology can improve farming, and vice versa. 'The biggest possibility is speeding up breeding, whether it be plant or livestock breeding. The science is now there that you can possibly speed up the whole process of 10-15 years to just two to three years. 'It's an exciting time for farming and science, and Maggie's twins are a prime example of just how vital science is to the farming world.'","Maggie, a rare Herdwick sheep, was .

Rodney May signed the order on Tuesday for Anthony, who filed for bankruptcy in Florida earlier this year, claiming about $1,000 in assets and $792,000 in liabilities. Court papers list Anthony as unemployed, with no recent income. Most of her liabilities are legal bills. Anthony was acquitted of murder in 2011 in the death her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, and has been in hiding since then. Casey Anthony with her daughter Caylee: She was acquitted of murder in 2011 following the death of the 2-year-old . In November, the federal bankruptcy judge approved a settlement between Anthony and a Texas search group that helped look for Caylee whose remains were found in December 2008, about six months after she had gone missing in Orlando. Casey Anthony waited a month to report the toddler missing and was arrested in October 2008. The nationally televised trial lasted for six weeks and ended in her acquittal on the murder charge, but she was convicted on charges of lying to law enforcement. Texas Equusearch Mounted Search and Recovery will be allowed to have an unsecured claim of $75,000 in Anthony's bankruptcy case under the terms of the settlement. Hiding: Casey Anthony, pictured in March this year, has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter's murder two years ago . It's unclear if Equusearch will see any of the money. According to a court document signed by May, the discharge does not dismiss the case. 'It does not determine how much money, if any, the trustee will pay to creditors,' the document said. 'Most, but not all, types of debts are discharged if the debt existed on the date the bankruptcy case was filed.' Some debts are not discharged during a bankruptcy case, including most taxes, domestic support obligations, student loans and debts for personal injuries or death caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated.

A girl motorcyclist died after a collision with a teenage biker friend who was thought to have been  performing a ‘wheelie’ stunt at up to 100mph, an inquest was told. Hairdresser Leah Davies, 19, was  edging out of a side road on her motorbike when 18-year-old Ryan Smith, who also died, smashed into her on his yellow Honda 600cc. Her Yamaha collided with a third motorbike that was stationary, and all three riders were thrown from their bikes, suffering  horrendous injuries. Biker: Hairdresser Leah Davies, 19, suffered fatal injuries and died a week later in hospital after the incident . Miss Davies, who was an identical twin, and Mr Smith, an apprentice welder, both died later in hospital while the third motorcyclist spent weeks recovering from his injuries. They were part of a group of young friends who had met at Martland Mill Industrial Estate, in Wigan, during the evening of July 29 to show off their cars and motorbikes to each other. Oliver Pugh, 17, told the inquest that the group had gone to the  event after hearing about it  via Facebook. He said: ‘We walked around and looked at other cars and motor-cycles for about 20 minutes. We left more or less one after another.’ The inquest heard that when they left the meeting shortly before 11.30pm, Mr Smith went off on his own and circled a roundabout at the top of the road before roaring back towards his friends with his front wheel in the air. Mr Pugh said: ‘He must have been going between 80 to 100mph when he passed me. The front wheel was up because he was doing a wheelie. ‘I know it was a wheelie because it was off the floor for a long period of time. I only saw the wheel come down at the last second.’ Petrolheads: Leah Davies (left) and Ryan Smith (right) had met at an industrial Estate for a 'cruise' gathering where young people would take their cars and motorbikes to show them off to each other, an inquest was told . The teenager said he thought  Mr Smith’s vision could have been impaired by his raised front wheel. He added: ‘I saw Leah pull out of the junction, she was going up towards where we had been. At the time of the collision I believe Ryan was in the centre of the road.’ Another friend, Ryan Yates, 17, said: ‘Ryan overtook me very close. He was doing at least 100mph. ‘He was in third or fourth gear, I could hear the noise it was making – it was screaming.’ He added: ‘Leah was edging out and then she stopped. She would have seen Ryan at the last second.’ Her mother Mandy Lawrenson said: ‘Leah was a happy child and engaged in lots of activities. Family members: Ryan Smith's mother Rosemary Smith (in red skirt) and other relatives pictured outside Bolton Town Hall, where the inquest into the deaths of the two teenagers killed is taking place . 'She was very well liked and was a good singer and was always somebody who was positive, outgoing. ‘She met a friend who had  an interest in motorcycles  and through the friendship she became involved. ‘Leah’s grandfather had an  interest and helped her with  her motorcycle.’ She said her daughter had bought the Yamaha in January last  year and had taken a second job  to pay for the motorbike and  riding lessons. Devastated: The parents of Leah Davies - mother Mandy Lawrenson (white scarf) and father Andrew Davies (white and purple tie) outside Bolton Town Hall . Mrs Lawrenson said: ‘She kept the bike at her grandfather’s house most of the time and every Sunday she would go out on it.’ The inquest in Bolton was told there were no drugs or alcohol in Mr Smith’s system. His mother, Rosemary Smith, told the hearing: ‘From the age of four Ryan had a fascination with  anything with two wheels. ‘His family very much supervised him and my husband tried to  nurture him and show him the right way to ride cycles.’ Deputy Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a narrative verdict on the deaths of both teenagers and extended his sympathies to their families.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:05 EST, 4 March 2012 . A new chapter in the vicious Christie Brinkley-Peter Cook divorce saga has taken a new turn with the supermodel's claims that she's being bullied by him in a string of nasty emails. The seemingly ageless blonde beauty divorced the architect in 2008, a sensational case that brought his $3,000 a month online porn addiction and trysts with a then-18-year-old to light. Now, the former couple is locked in a bitter custody dispute over their children. Former family: Christie Brinkley is joined by Peter Cook and children Sailor and Jack in New York in 2004 . It was learned this weekend that Ms Brinkley, 58, wants Mr Cook to cough up $140,000 in fines over the emails, in addition to $32,000 in expenses for their two children, including school tuition and summer camp fees. A source told the New York Daily News: 'Peter keeps trying to control Christie, and he can’t deal with the fact that he can’t control her'. Glamorous: Model Christie Brinkley pictured at a fashion show last month in New York . Mr Brinkley's lawyer Tom Campagna told the paper that a judge smacked Mr Cook with an order after their divorce that he be fined $5,000 for each time he got out of hand with Ms Brinkley. She claims he has violated that order 28 times, but is not out for financial gain. Mr Campagna told the Daily News: 'This is not about the money. This is about what we're calling bullying'. Last week, Mr Cook lashed out at the supermodel in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support. Mr Cook, 53, reignited their bitter custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County Supreme Court in New York that she owes him money - calling her a 'narcissistic egomaniac'. The architect claims he is owed $25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, the New York Post reported. He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him 'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an email to their son that Mr Cook 'is jealous of my success'. Ms Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack. She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel. Ms Brinkley appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years. But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008. Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn. Happier times: Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook, pictured together in 2006, reached a divorce settlement in 2008 after months of very public court disputes . Christie Brinkley, right, has a daughter with first husband, Billy Joel, left, seen together in 1994 . He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time. During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet. Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when disciplining the children. The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy. Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school at age 18. She then spent three years as an illustrator before being noticed by an American photographer - and then proceeded to appear on 200 magazine covers in the 1980s. Ms Brinkley is most famous for appearing on three consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition covers from 1979 to 1981, and for her appearances in perfume and shampoo adverts.","Model claims ex-husband violated judge's orders 28 times .

Joshua Makin died after taking the nicotine patch-style painkiller fentanyl as a joke at a party in September 2012 . A trainee legal clerk died after swallowing a nicotine patch-style painkiller while experimenting with recreational drugs at a party. Joshua Makin ate the single super-strength opiate patch as a joke, not realising it would give him 50 times the recommended safe dose. Hours after the 20-year-old went to bed laughing with his girlfriend about taking the drugs, which should have been attached to his hip, he died in his sleep as he lay next to his girlfriend. Waking to discover her boyfriend lifeless next to her, Summer Harrison alerted a friend who called 999. But paramedics who rushed to help were unable to revive Mr Makin, an apprentice at a solicitor's firm. Investigations into what happened revealed the patch taken by Mr Makin was from a batch of fentanyl, which had been prescribed to a former airline pilot who suffered chronic back pain. The drugs had been stolen by the man's college dropout son and sold to friends at the party, Mr Makin and his girlfriend had been at the night before his death. A coroner today recorded a verdict of misadventure after examining the circumstances leading to the 20-year-old's death. Reacting to the verdict, his mother Louise said: 'Anybody trying recreational drugs is playing Russian roulette with their lives. 'If they truly knew what we had gone through after Josh’s death, I would hope they would never do it again. It’s been hell since he died.' The hearing heard Mr Makin, from Ashton-on-Mersey in Greater Manchester, and Miss Harrison had been invited to stay at the home of his friend Jonathan Drinkhill, while his parents were away in September last year. The pair played FIFA on a games console and listened to music, while taking recreational drugs including valium and ketamine. Joshua Makin, pictured left with his mother Louise, was found lifeless in bed the morning after a sleepover party at a friend's house, by his girlfriend Summer Harrison, right . Mr Makin ate the 100mg patch of fentanyl, pictured left is a 75mg version, giving himself 50 times the recommended dose according to toxicologist Julie Evans. Right, Louise Makin arriving at the inquest . Mr Drinkhill, 21, said: 'We got 10 tablets of valium and 1g of ketamine and made it last a few hours. 'We both felt fine and happy. We played on the computer and drank some lager and then Josh’s girlfriend came round.' Ambrose Murray was jailed in November to 18 months in prison for supplying Class A drugs. He stole the fentanyl patches from his father, who suffered chronic back pain . Later former grammar school dropout Ambrose Murray, 22, turned up at the sleepover with a batch of drugs he had stolen from his father, by sneaking a key from his dressing gown to open a locked draw. Murray, from Altrincham, had already posted messages on Facebook a week earlier saying: 'Does anyone there want to buy fents?' When he arrived at Mr Drinkhill’s house in Timperley he emptied the patches out of his pocket on to a table. Mr Drinkhill added: 'I had never heard of them before this and didn’t have any idea what they were. They looked like a nicotine patch and you had to break the seal to get in. 'We took one each and placed it on our waist like Ambrose said. 'Soon after that everyone left but Joshua placed a patch on his forehead and then placed the patch in his mouth. 'He was joking around when he put it on his forehead - trying to get a laugh out of me. 'He put the same patch in his mouth and swallowed it. He then went to sleep and so did I. 'In the morning I was woken by his girlfriend who said there was something wrong with him so I rushed in the front room and called an ambulance.' Mr Makin's girlfriend Miss Harrison wept as she told the hearing: 'Ambrose had the patches and they said they were going to buy them and they were going to give him the money the next day. 'They were asking about opiates and your tolerance levels and Ambrose said you just put it on your skin. Joshua put one on his hip. I didn’t see him do any more. 'When Ambrose and the others left I was tired so me and Joshua went to go to sleep on the sofa. He did go out the room to speak to Jonathan and came in with a patch on his head and I didn’t know what it was. 'He came in again laughing saying he had swallowed it but I didn’t know what it was so didn’t know if it was anything to worry about. We were lying down and talking until we went to sleep. 'When I woke up I noticed a rash on him which looked like purple blotches or bruises on his side. 'I tried to wake him but he didn’t wake up. I ran to get Jonathon then telephoned the ambulance and tried to start CPR. The ambulance arrived but he was dead.' A toxicology report found Josh had 52.4mg of fentanyl per litre of blood. Those using the prescription painkiller for its intended purpose require between 1.9 and 3.8mg per litre. Fentanyl is an opiate painkiller, similar to morphine. The drug has a rapid onset and short duration. It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine. Intravenous fentanyl is commonly used as anesthesia in the operating theatre. The patch is used in the management of chronic pain. They work by releasing the drug into body fat underneath the skin, which then slowly releases into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours. The patches provide long-lasting pain relief. A typical patch will start to take effect within eight to 12 hours. Dosage is based on the size of the patch. Toxicologist Julie Evans told the inquest Mr Makin took 50 times the recommended dose. She said: 'Fentanyl patches are designed to slowly release the drugs over three days - a trickle feed. If someone swallows them it’s released much quicker. 'The acid in the stomach breaks it down and the drug is released. A 100mg patch would contain 16,800mg of drug as it is designed to release 100mg per hour. 'It’s an opioid - a synthetic opiate. It’s a depressant for the central nervous system and slows the heart down which has a knock-on effect. 'It’s more falling asleep and not waking up as apposed to anything violent. You go to sleep and your heart rate stops.' Murray was jailed for 18 months in November for supplying Class A drugs. Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'Joshua was a young man who together with friends thought that using drugs was a way they wanted to spend time and money - but what happened was a highly tragic consequence. 'He was loved by his friends and he was outgoing and popular. This appears to be a mindless impulsive act which has tragically led to his death. 'Hopefully it can teach a lesson to any of his friends or young people who use drugs. I hope his death acts as a warning.' The medicine which is similar to morphine, is used for treating chronic pain and induces relaxation and euphoria. Skin patches containing fentanyl are designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the drug slowly into the bloodstream. It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off. But several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug.","Joshua Makin ate nicotine patch-style painkiller as a joke while at party .

A girl who wasn't expected to live past the age of two has defied the odds to celebrate her 16th birthday. Demi-Leigh Mahon was born with a condition which is so rare that doctors named it after her. It left her incredibly susceptible to infection after her lungs and heart failed to develop properly in the womb. Celebrating: Demi-Leigh Mahon was not expected to live more than two years after she was born with a rare medical condition . Survivor: Demi-Leigh (pictured aged two) was born with a condition which left her incredibly susceptible to infection after her lungs and heart failed to develop properly in the womb . Baffled doctors had never seen the condition before and warned her parents Kerry and Darren she was unlikely to see her second birthday. But the teenager - who is often so sapped of energy she needs to sleep for four days just to regain the strength to walk - turned 16 on Tuesday. As a result of her condition, Demi-Leigh, from Telford, Shropshire, suffers shortness of breath, chronic bronchiectasis (a disease of the lungs) and has a defective heart valve. Her tiny body is also unable to produce vital B-cells that fight infections and three years ago she underwent a lens transplant to remove cataracts in her eyes. Demi-Leigh, who is waiting for a double lung transplant, said: 'I’m so happy to be 16. I haven’t had the easiest time but with the help of my family and friends I’m determined to get on with life. 'I love seeing my friends and my birthday was brilliant. I just try to take life one day at a time and dealwith it as it comes. 'You have down days and up days, but the down days are a few more at the moment as I wait for the lung transplant. Caring: Demi-Leigh with her mother Kerry. As a result of her condition, the teenager also suffers shortness of breath, chronic bronchiectasis (a disease of the lungs) and has a defective heart valve . 'There are worse off people than me though, so I just want to help the make-a-wish foundation help other people. 'I enjoyed my party, although I couldn’t spend a lot of time with my friends as it was very tiring everyone was lovely.' Her mother Kerry was forced to give her up her job as a machine operator to care full time for her daughter when she was a baby. When Demi-Leigh was 18 months old, she rushed her to hospital after she struggled to breathe. Concerned doctors diagnosed her with chronic pneumonia and warned Demi-Leigh was unlikely to survive the night. Mrs Mahon, who has another son Darrell, . 19, said: 'It was so frustrating, I knew something was wrong with my . daughter but no-one would listen to me. Defiant: Despite doctors' expectations, DEmi-Leigh, who is waiting for a double lung transplant, turned 16 this week . 'I stood in the hospital after they told me to 'listen to my doctor and just give her Calpol' and said to the nurse that if I didn’t get a second opinion I would stand there and scream. 'A young doctor said he would have a look and shortly after he sounded an alarm and she was rushed into surgery. 'They told me she had bad pneumonia and needed emergency surgery within minutes or she would die. 'Ever since she has been in and out of hospital every few months. 'It's . amazing we've made every Christmas and birthday  because her immune . system means the slightest cold or chest infection is life threatening. 'What she goes through day to day is . unimaginable. She has three nebulisers, intravenous antibiotics and an . implant in her chest so she can have medication through that. Thoughtful: Rather than asking for birthday presents, Demi-Leigh asked friends to donate to the make-a-wish foundation, the charity which sent her to swim with dolphins in 2010 . 'In one week, she has been to Great Ormond Street, a hospital in Leicester, on in Birmingham and back to Telford hospital. 'But she takes it all in her stride. She’s an extraordinary girl. Everyone who meets her falls in love with her.' Demi-Leigh’s father Darren, 36, a construction worker, added: 'She can’t go to school at the moment, and can sleep for up to four days at a time. 'But she got herself up and ready to go in the limo for her 16th birthday. All the children from her school turned up and she had a fantastic time. 'She asked that no one giver her presents and they all give to the Make-a-Wish foundation, who sent her to swim with dolphins in 2010.'","Demi-Leigh Mahon has a condition so rare that doctors named it after her .

Labour leader Ed Miliband was today accused of wanting to 'forcibly rip-up' the countryside under controversial plans to allow towns and cities to spread. He used a major speech on housing to vow to take on ‘stick-in-the-mud’ rural and suburban councils that are refusing to build new homes. He condemned the Government’s hugely controversial reforms of the planning system  to encourage development as ‘tinkering’. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who today visited Chrysalis Park housing development in Stevenage, argued that cities and towns should be able to expand . Places such as Stevenage, Oxford, York and Luton would be handed a new ‘right to grow’, meaning the objections of surrounding authorities who block the construction of new homes would be overridden. But the Tories hit back at the idea of allowing metropolitan councils - which are often Labour-run - to force through house building in rural areas which are more often Conservative-controlled. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'Labour’s policy shows this is the same old Labour party. 'They would allow Labour councils to forcibly rip up Green Belt protection in neighbouring councils. While their new tax on planning permission would reduce housebuilding and discourage regeneration schemes. We know there is more to do to help build homes. 'But this must be done by working with hardworking families in communities across Britain, allowing councils to shape where development should and shouldn’t go via Local Plans, and safeguarding important environmental protections.’ It marks an escalation in the increasingly heated debate over . planning, and pitches Mr Miliband into an angry confrontation with shire councils . and countryside campaigners. The Labour leader condemned ‘home-blocking councils’ on the borders of towns and cities and also attack ‘land-hoarding developers’ who sit on plots even after they are granted planning permission. The Coalition’s attempts to speed up and encourage development has been condemned by organisations such as the National Trust. But Mr Miliband, speaking in Stevenage, where proposed development beyond its borders has been stalled for years, insisted that the shortage of new homes is a serious threat to Britain’s future prosperity. Row: Tories accused Mr Miliband of wanting to rip-up the countryside y forcing developments in the Green Belt . Labour is to set up an independent . commission on housing, to be headed by former council chief executive . and BBC chairman Sir Michael Lyons. It . will draw up detailed plans on how to increase the construction of new . homes in England to more than 200,000 a year by the end of the next . parliament if Labour wins power. Row: Tories accused Mr Miliband of wanting to rip-up the countryside y forcing developments in the Green Belt . Mr . Miliband said: ‘I want to send a clear message today: We will tackle . those councils that block homes, those developers that hoard land and . this government that fails to act on the worst housing shortages for a . generation. ‘We will stand up for home builders and . first-time buyers and take on those who stand in the way of working . people and their children having the decent homes they deserve.’ Mr Miliband said that Labour would side with local authorities such as Stevenage that want to build new homes – and condemn those such as  neighbouring North Hertfordshire Council that systematically block such development. He announced that four Labour-controlled councils – Stevenage, Oxford, Luton and York – have signed up to become the first ‘right to grow’ local authorities where there is immediate potential to build 40,000 new homes. Mr Miliband praised Stevenage as ‘an example of how successful new towns  can be’ and attack neighbouring North Herts as a ‘stick-in-the-mud’ council that was home-blocking. The Labour leader added: ‘Of course it is right that local communities have a say about where housing goes. ‘But councils cannot be allowed to frustrate continually the efforts of others councils to get homes built.’ He also commited Labour to giving communities controversial new ‘use it or lose it’ powers to release land that is being hoarded by developers even though it has planning permission.","Ed Miliband will condemn Government's planning reforms as 'tinkering'

The ex-wife of a software entrepreneur claims he conned her out of an equal share of his £150million fortune. Alison Sharland, 46, says she was misled by ex-husband Charlie, 53, about the value of his business when they divorced last year after 17 years together. At the time she accepted a £10million settlement – but now wants the case reopened so she can get a larger settlement. Battle: Alison Sharland, left, has asked the Court of Appeal to let her re-open divorce proceedings against her ex-husband Charlie Sharland, right, amid claims he misled her over the value of his software company . The Court of Appeal heard the . self-made millionaire claimed his shares were worth £7million, whereas . press reports suggested the company could be floated on the stockmarket . for more than £460million. Mrs . Sharland’s barrister, Patrick Chamberlayne QC, said the couple had been . equal partners in the marriage and that the divorce settlement was . supposed to be the same. ‘She was cheated into an agreement,’ said the . QC. ‘If someone dupes you into a deal, why should you be held to a deal? ‘This . was a case of equality. It was a long marriage. All the assets had been . acquired during the course of the marriage and each party had made . their full contribution. ‘Part . of the wife’s case was that she was busy making post-separation efforts . as well. She had the unusual task of lifelong care of the parties’ disabled child.’ The couple, . who lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, married in 1993 and had built a . substantial fortune before separating in 2010. Mr Sharland ran his . company, Appsense, from a business park in Daresbury, near Warrington, . while Mrs Sharland ran an autism charity. On . divorce, they agreed the assets should be split equally, but the couple . came to legal blows over the valuation of Mr Sharland’s shares in his . business. Court: The judges heard the case at the Court of Appeal, which sits in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, pictured . Accountants for Mrs Sharland valued them at £32million, but those working for her husband said they were worth just £7million. During . divorce proceedings last year they agreed to compromise, with Mrs . Sharland giving up her claim to an equal share of the firm. She . received £10.4million in cash and property and agreed to take only 30 . per cent of the proceeds from shares when they were put on the . stockmarket. Mr Chamberlayne said she based her agreement on the value . of the shares being worth no more than £32million and that the company . would not be floated for up to seven years. But . it soon emerged that Mr Sharland was already in the process of floating . the company. With an estimated value of more than £460million, it would . mean Mr Sharland’s shares were worth at least £132million after tax, . the QC explained. Mrs Sharland took her case to the Court of Appeal . after family judge, Sir Hugh Bennett, despite finding Mr Sharland’s . evidence to have been ‘dishonest’, refused to reopen his ex-wife’s . financial claims. Mr . Sharland does not dispute that he misled his ex-wife, but says the final . order made by Sir Hugh was a fair one and should stand.

Fires at an historic city centre pub will have to be put out after a landlord was told it was causing pollution following a passer-by's complaint about smoke in the street. Graham Rowson, 60, has traditionally lit three fires for customers at his real ale bar so they can keep warm over the Christmas period. But officials at Preston City Council have now said his 115-year-old Black Horse pub is pumping out fumes - putting it in breach of smokeless zone rules. Landlord Graham Rowson has been told he has to put out the fires in his pub following a complaint about smoke by a passer-by . Mr Rowson said an inspector turned up at the pub to say a 'passer-by' had seen smoke coming from the chimney 24 hours earlier and put in a complaint. Mr Rowson has now been ordered to stop burning wood in the Victorian fireplaces and could face a fine of up to £1,000, under the Clean Air Act 1993, if he refuses. Mr Rowson, who runs the pub with wife Angela, said: 'The fireplaces are part of the history of the building and what makes the pub so popular. 'We’ve actually been named Preston’s city pub of the year by the same council that is now trying to stop what we’re doing. 'All of our regulars are up in arms. Last night we had a party and four councillors, two police officers and two firemen signed our petition to keep the fires. We’ve already got 500 names on the petition and we’re thinking about talking it to court. 'There is no alternative to the log fire. A log burner would produce the same amount of smoke, and I maintain that our fires do not create any smoke anyway. Officials at Preston City Council have said Mr Rowson's 115-year-old Black Horse pub is pumping out fumes - putting it in breach of smokeless zone rules . 'I cannot understand the humbug attitudes of some people in authority. They’ll probably ban carol singers next for polluting the atmosphere if they can’t sing.' The Black Horse is a Grade II-listed building, highly commended by English Heritage, and is on the National Inventory of Historical Pub Interiors. It was voted Pub of the Year by the Preston Business Improvement District team just seven weeks ago. 'I cannot understand the humbug attitudes . of some people in authority. They’ll probably ban carol singers next . for polluting the atmosphere if they can’t sing' - Landlord Graham Rowson . It has also featured on a television series and attracts visitors from far afield because of its little-altered interior with wooden panelling, tiled bar and mosaic floor. The fireplaces and the interior in general led to the pub being awarded a Campaign for Real Ale blue plaque. But an inspector this week visited the pub to speak to Mr Rowson following a complaint. The landlord said: 'There was a complaint made on Monday and then straight away a council officer arrived at the pub to tell us to stop burning logs in the fire because we were in a smokeless zone. 'He said someone had complained about smoke outside in the street but that’s nonsense because I’ve stood outside and there isn’t any wafting about. 'I explained that all fires will make smoke when they start and that my fires do not make a lot of smoke. 'I ended up throwing him out of the pub because I couldn’t believe what he was saying. 'You can’t order an historic pub like ours to just stop burning wood in the fireplaces. What do the council want us to do? Get rid of the fireplaces and replace them with radiators? 'On the one hand we have all of the regulations that say that we must retain the character of the Grade II listed building and then you have the council jobsworths talking about health and safety.' Ray Jackson, the regional director of CAMRA, said: 'I have never heard of anything like it. 'The Black Horse is a cracking pub and it has been refurbished very tastefully by Graham since he went in there. It is part of the character of the building and it would be dreadful if they stopped them having a fire in there.' A Preston Council spokesman said: 'Burning logs creates pollution through smoke and soot and we have had complaints about the smoke at the Black Horse pub. 'Like most towns and cities, Preston city centre is covered by a smoke control order that means only smokeless fuels can be burned on an open fire. 'Logs can be burned, but only in special wood-burning appliances that take out the soot and smoke. The rules are for the benefit of everyone and we are happy to work with the business owner to help them comply.'","Graham Rowson traditionally lit fires at his pub to keep customers warm .

The 60th anniversary of the first ascent of the . world’s tallest peak has been commemorated with another record: the highest . leap ever taken off a mountain. To celebrate the first time anyone ever successfully made it . to the top of Mount Everest, Russian daredevil Valery Rozov, 48, donned a . special wingsuit and dove off the north side of Everest on May 5. His successful, albeit death defying, leap became the . highest BASE jump in history at 23,687 feet above sea level. SCROLL DOW FOR VIDEO . Record breaking: Valery Rozov had years of experience and 10,000 BASE jumps behind him, but his May leap at Mount Everest broke the record at 7,220 meters above sea level . His BASE jump, which stands for ‘buildings, antennas, spans, . and earth’ allowed him to glide through the air for a full minute with his specialized . suit at speeds as high as 125 miles per hour. The jump took him from Everest’s north peak on the Chinese . side to Rongbuk glacier on the Tibetan side. It took the veteran jumper, whose made 10,000 jumps in his . career, four days to reach the cliff off of which he made his record jump, . according to an announcement on jump sponsor Red Bull’s website. A team of four . Sherpas helped him along the way. Fancy equipment: To perform the highest BASE jump in history, Rozov trained for two years and constructed a special winged suit . Rozov spent around two years planning for the stunt, using . much of his prep time developing the customized wingsuit. And Rozov has cheated death before. In 2009, the Russian . leaped into an active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula in his country’s Far . East. Free falling: After flying free for nearly a minute at speeds up to 125mph, the Russian daredevil landed with a parachute on the Ronbuk glacier at an altitude of 5950 meters . Preparation: Rozov planned the jump for two years and designed a special wingsuit to help him meet the record-breaking challenge . In 2010, he would leap from Ulvetanna, a 1.24 mile high peak . in Antarctica. That led him to jump from Shivling, an over 21,000 foot mountain . in the Himalayas that has been described as Rozov’s precursor to the Everest . jump. Despite Rozov’s expertise, even he was shocked at his feat . in retrospect. ‘Only when I got back home did I see how hard it was for me . both physically and psychologically,’ he said.

A Washington man convicted in the brutal slaying of his ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him was given the maximum prison sentence of 33 years. Jarod Lane, 21, learned Friday as he stood in Kings County Superior Court, in Seattle, that he will remain in prison until he is 54-years-old for violently killing Jessica Scholl, 17, two years ago. Family and friends of hers were on hand for the sentencing. There were so many supporters, in fact, that extra seating had to be brought in to accommodate them, according to KOMO. Cold blooded: Jarod Lane will spend 33 years in prison for the excptionally violent killing of his ex-girlfriend . Fueled by jealousy, Mr Lane stabbed the young girl to death and then set her house on fire. His rage saw him first try to strangle and beat her to death. ‘He tried to strangle her with a belt, hit her head against the dresser multiple times, then he drug her to the bathroom where he tried to drown her in the toilet,’ King County deputy prosecutor Jennifer Worley said. ‘When that didn't work, he bashed her head against the toilet tank,’ she added. Officials said he stabbed the girl so hard with knives he found in the kitchen that he broke multiple blades. After torching the house, the murderer fled to Oklahoma and was arrested only days later. She couldn't escape him: Jessica Scholl was killed by Mr Lane only one week after ending their relationship . He pleaded guilty last month to first-degree-murder and first-degree arson, according to KOMO. Explaining that he never planned the murder, Mr Lane even tried apologizing to her family in court. ‘I can't express how apologetic and deeply sorry I am for my selfish acts on that unthinkable, unimaginable, and unforgettable day,’ said the cold-blooded killer. The apology didn’t fly with the dead girl’s family. Asking for the maximum sentence, mother Stephanie Scholl said that ‘he took the life of my 17-year-old daughter, who was just beginning to live her life.’ The judge swiftly handed down the maximum 33 ½ year sentence, adding that ‘Even though a sentence doesn't bring her back, I really hope that it brings resolution and ultimately some peace for each of you.’ The convicted killer’s lawyer has said more than once that Mr Lane has tried to commit suicide in prison on multiple occasions.","Jarod Lane will be behind bars until he is 54-years-old .

Theresa May, the Home Secretary, tried to prevent the Ismail from being released but was overruled . A Somali criminal with a history of violence has been allowed to walk free today after a High Court judge ruled detaining him longer would breach his human rights. Abdi Ismail, 33, has been convicted of a string of crimes since arriving in Britain in 1993, including  racially aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police. In 2011, he was sentenced to a 15-month jail term for assault and told he would be deported after attacking a friend with a knife. But a High Court judge ruled today that the criminal had been detained for too long and ordered his release. A deportation hearing is expected to be held at a later date. Home Office 'incompetence' was listed among the reasons behind the decision. It is understood that Ismail is also planning to sue Britain over his treatment using Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Mrs Justice Lang said the Somali, who has two children, had to be freed due to Home Office ""incompetence"" and a poor standard of investigation by the UK Border Agency. The Home Office's lack of 'due diligence' had prolonged his detention unreasonably, the judge added. Ismail was detained for a total of 18 months and was held pending deportation following a conviction for assault. Under . the 2007 Borders Act, those from outside the EU sentenced to at least a . year in jail should face automatic deportation to their home country. Ismail has launched a legal bid over his treatment, as he claims his liberty was breached under the human rights act . A bid by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, to continue to detain him further failed. The 33 year-old arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 after members of his family fled to escape civil war in Somalia. He worked in a variety of jobs, married and fathered two children but later divorced. He lived in London and Leicestershire. In the decade since arriving, he was convicted of a string of crimes, including racially-aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police. Home Office officials decided to deport him after he attacked a friend with a knife, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and given a 15-month jail term by a judge at Harrow Crown Court in 2011. The judge said Mr Ismail had claimed damages for false imprisonment, arguing that his detention was unlawful and he had been denied a fair right to liberty. But she made no decisions about any compensation award in the ruling. The Home Officeâ€™s initial decision to detain was justified, she added. But she concluded that investigations should have been completed within a year and Mr Ismail had been held too long. 'It was prolonged for an unreasonably long period as a result of (Home Office) incompetence, neglect and failure to show due diligence,' the judge said in a written ruling. '(He has) been in immigration detention for 18 months. There is likely to be a further delay of at least a year before the deportation appeal process is concluded. 'These are lengthy periods of time which, having regard to the risk of re-offending and absconding, I do not consider are justified.' Mrs Justice Lang said Mr Ismail should . be released subject to residence and reporting conditions and fitted . with a monitoring tag pending rulings on his deportation.

A second giant rare serpentine oarfish has washed up on a Southern California beach just days after the first creature surfaced from the depths. The silvery deep-sea monster washed ashore along the coast of Oceanside on Friday afternoon measuring 13 and-a-half feet long. The discovery came just days after an 18-foot dead oarfish was found in the waters off Catalina Island. Scroll down for video... Rare: This snakelike oarfish measuring nearly 14 feet long was found on a beach in Southern California on October 18. Speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake . Close-up: The head of the 18-foot-long oarfish that was found in the waters of Toyon Bay on Santa Catalina Island, California on October 13 . ‘It’s not the typical fish you see on shore,’ said Oceanside Police Officer Mark Bussey, adding the oarfish weighed over 200 pounds. Oceanside police contacted SeaWorld San Diego, the Scripps Research Institute and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Suzanne Kohin of NOAA Fisheries Serivice came and measured the fish before she took possession of it for research, Bussey told NBC News. Last week, on October 13, Jasmine Santana, a science instructor for the Catalina Marine Institute, CMI, was snorkeling off Toyon Bay when she discovered the body of the creature on a seabed. The fish was far too big for Santana to carry alone; it took 15 people to bring the beast to shore. Incredible: An 18-foot-long oarfish found dead in the water off Catalina Island near Los Angeles, California . 'We've . never seen a fish this big,' said Mark Waddington, senior captain of . the Tole Mour, CIMI's sail training ship. 'The last oarfish we saw was . three feet long.' But these two massive fish are puny by . oarfish standards, according to the NOAA. The oarfish is the largest . bony fish in the sea and can grow over 50 feet in length. Because . oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are . rare and they are largely unstudied, according to CIMI. The . obscure fish apparently died of natural causes. Tissue samples and . video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the University of . California, Santa Barbara. Science . instructor Santana spotted something shimmering about 30 feet deep . while snorkeling during a staff trip in Toyon Bay, about two dozen miles from the mainland. A mystery: Oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied . An illustration of Bank's Oarfish, circa 1850, the giant fish that inspired tales of sea serpents. The 18-foot oarfish found off California took 16 people to haul ashore . 'She was snorkeling and sees this giant fish at the bottom of the ocean,' Waddington told KTLA. 'She swims down and grabs it by the tail and swims it to the beach. It . was awesome. There were people sprinting to go and see this fish.' Waddington said Santana dragged the fish ashore because she said, 'nobody will believe me'. After she pulled the carcass by the tail for more than 75 feet, staffers waded in and helped her bring it to shore. The carcass was on display Tuesday for 5th, 6th, and 7th grade students studying at CIMI. The . oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet, is a deep-water pelagic . fish — the longest bony fish in the world, according to CIMI. They are . likely responsible for the supposed sea serpent legends throughout . history. The giant oarfish . was first discovered in 1772 by Norwegian biologist Peter Ascanius. Its . formal scientific title is Regalecus glesne, but the fish is also known . as king of the herring, Pacific oarfish, streamer fish and ribbon-fish. The longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet, however, the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds. Like . the equally mysterious giant squid, the oarfish would go on to enchant . fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters. The fish lives at extreme ocean depths, between 656 feet (0.2 kilometers) and 3,280 feet (1 kilometer) deep. In 1996, a group of Navy Seals found a 23-foot long oarfish off Coronado, near San Diego, California. In 1996, Navy Seals pulled ashore this 23-foot oarfish that was found off the coast near San Diego, California . The Catalina fish is currently on ice while the fate of the carcass is decided.

But, in a rare and candid interview with an Argentinian media group, Chapur has revealed that Sanford used to send cards with photos of his family to her at Christmas. Soul mates: Mark Sanford and his mistress turned fiancee in South Carolina after his election victory . Sanford was criticized after cameras caught the moment one of his sons met Chapur for the first time on stage at an election rally. But the former television journalist has now admitted that although she has met all four of her lover's sons, she rarely spends time with them. Politician's wife: Chapur is adapting to life with a congressman . 'I’ve seen them very little because there isn’t much time, but, yes, they’re doing great,' she told InfobaeTV, a video streaming website which Chapur still writes columns for. Although she coyly refused to say how the couple became romantically involved, Chapur said they first met in Uruguay in 2001 and were first friends for ten years. 'I would receive Christmas cards with photographs of his family,' the woman Sanford once described as his soul mate said. Their affair was revealed in 2009, when he told staff he was hiking in the mountains as a cover story for his romantic rendezvous with Chapur. Sanford was caught by reporters at the . airport after his trip, and he admitted the affair. His wife filed for . divorce in the aftermath. Last August, he proposed to Chapur and she appeared on stage with him in May, when he won a congressional seat.

She added: 'I’m starting out, I can’t tell you much yet,' before adding that she was happy being with Sanford. Despite the election being over, Chapur was keen to point out her fiance was driven by a desire to work for his country rather than earn lots of money. 'Everybody has a fantasy that governors or lawmakers make a lot of money,' Chapur said. 'I’m going to take away that fantasy because a governor in the United States makes $108,000 per year, and from that you have to take out 33 per cent in taxes ... it’s not even enough to pay for private school for his children.'

Blackman was the first British serviceman convicted of murder on active service abroad since at least the Second World War . The Royal Marine who executed a wounded Taliban prisoner will receive the same protection in prison as a convicted paedophile, it emerged yesterday. The country’s top judge said the Ministry of Justice would be ‘aware’ of the threat to Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Islamic extremists and ‘take steps to minimise it’ as they did with child abusers. But Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, defended allowing the disgraced 39-year-old commando to be named publicly because it was ‘very firmly’ in the interests of open justice. Explaining the decision to lift an anonymity order on Blackman - known previously as Marine A - he said it would be wrong to conceal the identity of a convicted murderer. The senior non-commissioned officer is serving at least ten years in a civilian prison for murder after being found guilty by a court martial last month. Blackman shot the unidentified injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol on September 15, 2011, then taunted him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil.’ He told colleagues on the patrol from Juliet Company, 42 Commando: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ Harrowing film and audio of the killing were recorded on a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade. Blackman, the first British serviceman convicted of murder on active service abroad since at least the Second World War, was finally named this month after losing a year-long legal battle to keep his identity secret. The senior non-commissioned officer is serving at least ten years in a civilian prison for murder after being found guilty by a court martial last month . Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Tugendhat and Mr Justice Holroyde, stripped the Marine of the anonymity granted during his court martial despite fears expressed by his legal team that he and his family would be targeted by Islamic terrorists. Outlining the reasons for the decision, he said there was ‘the greatest public interest in knowing who he was and his background, given his conviction’. He pointed out: ‘It would require an overwhelming case if a person convicted of murder in the course of an armed conflict were to remain anonymous.’ The judge said: ‘There is a risk to Marine A that he will be attacked in prison and after his release from what will have to be a life sentence. ‘The prison authorities will be well aware of that risk and take steps to minimise it, as they do for other offenders at risk of attack in prison such as paedophiles. ‘There is the threat assessed by the JTAC [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre] to his family and to Marine A on his release under licence from his life sentence. ‘It is a known risk. The MoD has taken steps in the past to protect the families of the Marines. There is nothing to suggest that they would not do in the future. ‘Balancing those considerations, we have no doubt that the balance comes very firmly down on the side of open justice; the identity of Marine A must be made public.’ The anonymity of Blackman’s acquitted co-accused, known as Marines B and C, was lifted by the court, but will remain in place, pending the outcome of a possible appeal. Blackman denied murder at a two-week court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, during which he was identified only as Marine A. He claimed he thought the insurgent was already dead. He was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum ten-year term and dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines. He is considering whether to appeal against conviction and sentence.","Ministry of Justice 'aware' of threat to Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Islamic extremists and 'minimise it' as they did with child abusers .

After all we are a party that believes in real localism and doesn’t think that the centre is the repository of all wisdom.’ Speaking about not being allowed into the secure zone of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester Mr Farage said: ‘It seems I am persona non grata.’ Writing in the Times he added: ‘To the Tory High Command I am a plague carrier.’ His remarks came as it emerged several Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with Ukip at the election. A handful of MPs  were said to be considering a ‘Unite the Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following a surge in support for Mr Farage’s party. The sitting Tory MP would stand as a Tory-Ukip candidate. In return for its support, Ukip would expect to be able to influence Conservative Party policy. Nadine Dorries was the first to float the idea earlier this year, saying she would be ‘having that kind of conversation’ with activists in her constituency and that many Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with Ukip. Farage has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Tories saying he is despised by David Cameron . David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties. In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration. He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’ Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries. Eight Tory-held seats are said to be at high risk of being lost because of Ukip splitting the traditional Tory vote and letting in Labour or the Lib Dems. The proposal comes as the latest YouGov poll shows Labour has surged ahead, mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, Ukip on 13 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Miss Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates espousing the same sort of values. ‘We’ll have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying much the same sort of things.’ Conservative Central Office yesterday said joint tickets would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their nomination papers signed. Foreign Secretary William Hague last night insisted Tories ‘don’t make pacts with other parties … we win over the voters of other parties’ and cautioned wavering supporters. He said: ‘If someone is contemplating voting Ukip who would otherwise vote Conservative they could, by default, produce a Labour government which is the absolute opposite of what they might want on Europe for instance.’","Nigel Farage indicated he would not stand in the way of local agreements with the most eurosceptic Conservative MPs .

Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based group linked to al-Qaeda, said on Twitter they had killed the agent, codenamed Denis Allex, yesterday at 4.30pm GMT. The group had previously said France had 'signed [Mr Allex's] death warrant' by launching a failed rescue operation over the weekend in which two French commandos lost their lives.

In a statement yesterday, al-Shabaab claimed that Mr Allex, who was kidnapped in July 2009, was alive and had been in another safe house that was not targeted by the French rescue force. It added ominously that the group had 'reached a unanimous decision' on the man's fate. The group said the execution was also to avenge what al-Shabaab called France's 'persecution' of Muslims at home and around the world - including in Mali, north Africa, where French troops today launched an assault on rebels. French troops this week launched the . country's first ground operation in a bid to dislodge the fighters who . have resisted six days of air strikes.

Denis Allex was the secret agent's pseudonym. He was captured in the east African country in 2009 while working . for France’s overseas intelligence agency DGSE. He had been training soldiers before he was captured. Mr Allex had appeared in propaganda . videos since he was seized, pleading for his release and for France to . drop its support for the Somali government. His . first appeal in 2010, a year after he was captured, saw him call on . then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to drop his backing for the regime. Then, . in July 2012, looking gaunt, he sent a video message to new President . Francois Hollande, telling how his hopes of a rescue were fading by the . day. He called on France to drop its 'oppressive attitude' towards Muslims and said Mr Hollande represented his last hope of rescue. Poignantly, he added: 'I am alive. But for how long?' French authorities believed he was dead after the botched raid on the weekend by French commandos. French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday, 12 January. Their mission was to free the agent but  within minutes of arriving, the commandos were involved in a firefight that saw a soldier killed. Up to 17 Somalis were killed in scenes reminiscent of the battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which is commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down  after a book and film about the incident. Then, a US army force  tried to seize Somali warlords in the city but two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters  were shot down, resulting  in the deaths and wounding of 18 Americans, and up to  3,000 Somalis.

Only recently made an appeal at the St Marks Missionary Baptist Church for a family to adopt him which captured the nation's attention. 'No one is going to do it for you,' Tuohy told Fox News. 'You have to make it happen. Go out there and be determined to get a family.' Adoptive mom: Leigh Anne Tuohy says orphans need to grab life 'by the bootstraps' and be proactive about finding a family . Tuohy and her husband Sean Tuohy adopted a teenaged Michael Oher and became the inspiration for the film The Blind Side, for which Sandra Bullock won an Oscar. Oher came from a broken home with addict parents. He went on to graduate college and become an NFL player, drafted by the Baltimore Ravens, who won the Superbowl last year. Needs a family: 15-year-old Davion Only has been inundated with people offering to adopt him after his public plea for a family . 'Look at our situation, Micahel has the same characteristics and we turned our car around. That random act changed his life,' said Touhy, referring to the couple's first meeting with Michael Oher, who they saw walking to school one day wearing a t-shirt and shorts in freezing cold weather. Only told parishioners, 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.'

Tuohy said she was shocked that no one in the congregation came forward to adopt the 15-year-old on the spot. But since news of his heartfelt plea broke, Only's adoption agency has been inundated with family's hoping to adopt him. Sadly, Only's story of lifetime in foster care is far from unique in the U.S. There are currently 399,548 children in the system across America, many being cared for by devoted, temporary parents, and yet lacking in a definite place they can call home. There are many older teenagers like Davion Only but fewer than 10 per cent of children adopted from foster care are between 14 and 17.

It was the Japanese car-maker whose generously equipped, modestly priced and most reliable vehicles began the assault on slapdash British cars in the Seventies and sounded the death-knell for the UK-owned motor industry. But just as it made its mark in revolutionising the UK car market, the name of Datsun then drifted from view as the firm from the land of the Rising Sun transformed itself into Nissan  - and built a state of the art car factory in Sunderland. But now after a gap of  more than a quarter of a century the Datsun name is bouncing back as a ‘budget’ brand for parent company Nissan which set out plans for a new small, reliable, affordable  and ‘green’  car bearing the Datsun badge. Roll out: Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn made the announcement today while in Indonesia - one of three markets alongside India and Russia, where the Datsun will go on sale from 2014 . Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn made the announcement yesterday while in Indonesia -one of three markets alongside India and Russia, where the Datsun will go on sale from 2014. But if the idea catches on there is the possibility that  budget-priced Datsuns could again be running on UK and other European roads. Mr Ghosn said the first of the new generation Datsuns – initially built in Indonesia - would go back to the firm’s origins: ‘It’s a green car, affordable car, small displacement, high local content. It’s going to be a generous car.’ Popular choice: At their peak in the 1970s  Datsun cars sold in Britain came keenly priced, packed with up-to-the-minute technology that would be a costly extra on British and European built cars. A Cherry 100A model, pictured, cost £765 . Sport Datsun: A rakish 240Z sport coupe. pictured, cost £2,389, but after a wind-down period when cars were badged 'Datsun by Nissan', the last cars to bear the Datsun name were the Stanza and Bluebird in 1985 . At their peak in the 1970s  Datsun cars sold in Britain came keenly priced, packed with up-to-the-minute technology that would be a costly extra on British and European built cars. Standard features included a heated rear screen, two-speed wipers, a dual band radio and reclining seats which were initially vinyl before being replaced in late 1976-77 by half vinyl-half cloth. Adverts from 1976, when Datsun had an incredible  6per cent share of the UK car market, show  a Cherry 100A model costing £765 and a rakish 240Z sport coupe at £2,389. After a wind-down period when cars were badged ‘Datsun by Nissan’, the last cars to bear the Datsun name were the Stanza and Bluebird in 1985. Update: The company introduced the Nissan Z Concept at the 1999 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The goal of the design,  was 'to take some of the elements of the original car and incorporate them into a totally new design' Most importantly, as the UK car . industry reeled under the onslaught of British Leyland’s militant car . workers, walk outs and strikes instigated by the likes of Derek ‘Red . Robbo’ Robinson, and declining levels of quality and workmanship, . Frustrated . British buyers were ripe for the hassle free Japanese cars. The Datsun . Cherry was the car used by many driving schools and launched many . L-plated earner drivers. The . sporty 240Z coupe gained a reputation as ‘the poor man’s E-Type’ and . sold phenomenally well. For the family there was the sedate Datsun . Laurel. Datsun made its . debut in Japan in 1931 when it was created by the DAT Motorcar Company.

New and old: A new Nissan Juke car model leaves the showroom building in Jakarta today after Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn announced the Japanese automaker company Nissan will revive its old and affordable brand Datsun . The Datsun name died completely in 1986 coinciding with the opening of the new UK factory in Sunderland building the Nissan Bluebird. Jay Nagley, managing director at the consultancy Redspy Automotive said:’It is ironic, as Nissan spent 10 years in the 1980s trying to get rid of Datsun. ‘Nissan wants to create a low cost brand without giving Nissan cars a low cost image.’ ‘It’s becoming quite common for car makers to develop low cost brands. Renault has been successful with Dacia, Volkswagen with Skoda. Earlier this month Nissan announced at the Geneva Motor Show that it is to create more than 2,000 new British jobs to build a brand  new family car at its UK car factory in  Sunderland.

A coroner has critised television programmes for trivialising the condition of compulsive hoarding after a pensioner died in a fire at her home which was filled floor to ceiling with rubbish. Firefighters had to spend 30 minutes tunneling through stacks of rubbish in a desperate bid to rescue Ann Bradshaw, 65. Her inquest heard that she might have survived the blaze had emergency services got to her sooner. 'Dangerous circumstances': The coroner said firefighters had to battle through a 'staggering' amount of stuff to try to rescue Ann Bradshaw . Firefighter Glen Crookes said getting up the stairs to reach Mrs Bradshaw was like 'swimming in shale' County Durham and Darlington Coroner . Andrew Tweddle said the stack of belongings was so deep the firefighters . could also have died during the rescue. He . hit out at the prime-time shows - such as Channel 4's 'The Hoarder Next . Door' and 'Obsessive Compulsive Hoarder, and the BBC documentary 'My . Hoarder Mum And Me' - which have 'made light' of the most extreme cases . of compulsive hoarding for purposes of entertainment. He is calling for more to be done to highlight the dangers and consequences of hoarding. Mr . Tweddle added that the inquest strongly emphasised the risks that . hoarders pose to themselves, and also others, including members of the . fire service, who may be called to try and affect a rescue in the most . difficult of circumstances. He said: 'Hoarding has even reached the TV and it is almost made light of and obviously makes good TV.' 'However, this shows that . people are at grave risk to themselves, potentially their neighbours, . but equally to those who try to save lives.' The coroner strongly emphasised the risks that hoarders pose to themselves, and also others, by filling properties with possessions . Coroner Andrew Tweddle said the stack of belongings was so deep the firefighters could also have died during the rescue . Rescue bid: Firefighters rushed to Honister Place, Newton Aycliffe, where they found the house of hoarder Ann Bradshaw full of rubbish . Criticism: Coroner Andrew Tweddle said hoarding was made light of for the purposes of television entertainment . When . fire crews arrived at Mrs Bradshaw’s home in Newton Aycliffe, County . Durham, on May 14 last year neighbours warned them they would struggle . to get inside because of her hoarding. Mr Tweddle said: 'The conditions were quite extreme on a number of levels.' 'The . physical state of the property with the amount of stuff is quite . staggering and made the job of the firefighters quite difficult and . dangerous. 'It would have been so easy to have two dead firefighters on the day. 'Therefore . there should be significant praise for the firefighters for their . determination in the face of extreme and dangerous circumstances to try . and rescue Ann Bradshaw.' It was so bad that her 37-year-old son Ian, who lived with her, would spend two hours moving items each time he wanted to leave. Grave risks: Coroner Andrew Tweddle said the tragic case of Ann Bradshaw, 65, who died in a house fire at her home in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, pictured, highlighted the dangers of hoarding . Having . rescued Mr Bradshaw from an upstairs bathroom window, firefighters were . unable to reach his mother, despite repeated attempts. When . they finally got through the front door, they reported there was little . space to carry out a search and the staircase was like a tunnel due to . all the belongings. The . blaze was caused by an electrical fault after an extension cable running . under the clutter was rubbed down to the bare wire by people walking . past the items. It was one of the hottest blazes fire crews reported having ever faced. Firefighter Glen Crookes said getting up the stairs to reach Mrs Bradshaw was like 'swimming in shale'. He had to use his hands to provide his colleague Graeme Norman with a platform to reach the first floor. Crew manager Andrew Ellison said: 'We . smashed a back window and the stuff in the house was about a foot from . the top of the room. It was too dangerous. It was impossible to get in. 'I . had hold of her arm when I was up the ladder but I couldn’t reach her . enough to pull her out. I did fear for my own safety. The smoke was so . thick and black.' Criticism: Coroner Andrew Tweddle said hoarding was made light of for the purposes of television entertainment. (File photo) Mrs Bradshaw died at the scene from smoke inhalation. She . had been in discussions with social housing provider livin, which . managed the house, weeks before the incident over her hoarding problem. Mr Tweddle plans to write to social housing providers about hoarding in the hope it will reduce the risk to both individuals and the emergency services. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Tweddle also called into question the radios used by firefighters after a malfunction believed to have been caused when climbing the stairs left them unable to confirm any change of plan with the rescue. He said although it did not contribute to Mrs Bradshaw’s death, he would be writing to the fire brigade to see if new measures could be put in place. Alan Boddy, livin’s executive director for people and communities, said: 'As the tenant was clearly overwhelmed by the amount of items that had accumulated in her home, livin’s community co-ordinator was working closely with the family and making good progress in supporting them to clear the vast amount of items being hoarded. 'We have also run articles in our tenants magazine and on our website to highlight the dangers of hoarding.'","Ann Bradshaw died of smoke inhalation as crews tried to reach her .

The children of his running mate Paul Ryan appear to be delighted by all the excitement, hamming it up for the cameras in campaign hats and T-shirts. By comparison, Barack Obama's 14-year-old daughter Malia and Sasha, 11, have hardly been seen at all on the campaign trail in 2012 compared to four years ago.

The girls appeared at the Democratic National Convention on September 6 in North Carolina, where they waved from the stage as their father accepted the presidential nomination. However, the girls' public appearances seem to have been kept to a minimum. They did not appear at the presidential debates - unlike many of Romney's grandchildren. In contrast, Romney is almost constantly accompanied by members of his large family, including his wife of 42 years Ann, his five sons and their wives and many of his 18 grandchildren, who are often photographed on his campaign jet. Republican Vice President nominee Paul Ryan has also had his children along for the ride in the last days of the campaign. His ten-year-old daughter Liza, who is close in age to Sasha Obama, has been pictured striking a number of comic poses while her father appears at events in swing states.

He drew criticism when he allowed his daughters to be interviewed by Access Hollywood four years ago. Malia and Sasha, ten and seven at the time, spoke on camera, in an interview which was then splashed across the TV networks. When asked about the decision, Obama said he was surprised by the attention the interview had garnered before adding: 'We wouldn’t do it again and we won’t be doing it again.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:29 EST, 5 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 5 November 2012 . CBS has quietly released an interview with Obama which was filmed one day after the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi - and in which he refuses to call the incident an act of terrorism. The footage, released seven weeks after it was filmed, shows Obama contradicting himself yet again on the attack that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead. When exactly Obama called the September 11 al Qaeda attack in Libya 'terrorism' has become an increasingly contentious area of debate - and the interview throws doubt on the president's previous and later claims. Scroll down for video . Details: In an interview on September 12, Obama would not confirm that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was an act of terrorism - despite his later claims. The interview was released this weekend . At the second presidential debate in October, Obama claimed he had first called the incident an act of terrorism during his Rose Garden speech just hours after the attack. But the newly-released footage, filmed 12 hours after the Rose Garden appearance, shows he was still apprehensive about the label. 'Mr. President, this morning you . went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in . connection with the Libya Attack, do you believe that this was a . terrorism attack?' interviewer Steve Kroft asked in the 60 Minutes interview. 'Well it's too early to tell exactly . how this came about, what group was involved,' he responded. 'But obviously it was an . attack on Americans. And we are going to be working with the Libyan . government to make sure that we bring these folks to justice, one way or . the other.' Attack:The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was set alight and four Americans were killed on September 11 . Kroft continued: 'It's been described as a mob action, but . there are reports that they were very heavily armed with grenades, that . doesn’t sound like your normal demonstration.' Obama responded: 'As I . said, we're still investigating exactly what happened, I don’t want to . jump the gun on this... And my suspicion is . there are folks involved in this. Who were looking to target Americans . from the start.' The interview previously aired on October 19, but this section was edited out, Bret Baier reported on Fox. CBS only released this footage on Sunday - more than seven weeks after the interview. The network even failed to offer it up when questions were raised during the presidential debate over whether he had called the attack terrorism before blaming it on rallies against an anti-Islamic film. Address: Obama is pictured with Hillary Clinton in the Rose Garden of the White House the day after the attack . Butting heads: In the second presidential debate on October 16, Romney said it took Obama two weeks before he called the incident an act of terrorism, which Obama refuted . September 11 Attack on U.S. consulate Benghazi leaves four Americans dead . September 12 Obama addressed nation from the Rose Garden: 'No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation' September 12 Obama filmed interview with CBS and refuses to call attack terrorism . September 13 Obama speaks at a campaign event in Las Vegas: 'No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world' September 16 Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations: 'We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated' September 19 Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center: The Americans 'were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy' September 20 White House spokesman Jay Carney: 'It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack' September 25 Obama went on The View and when asked if it was an act of terrorism, responded: 'We're still doing an investigation' October 16 At Presidential Debate Obama said he stood in the Rose Garden the day after the attack 'and I told the American people in the world... that this was an act of terror' Romney had argued in the debate: 'There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack. 'And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack, and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.' Obama responded: 'The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror. 'And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. That's not what we do.' Romney fact checked him, adding: 'It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.' In the debate, moderator Candy Crowley intervened on Obama's behalf, claiming he had called the attack an . act of terror in his Rose Garden statement. In the Rose Garden, Obama had said: 'No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.' While this shows Obama had referred to the attack as an act of terror in the Rose Garden, the latest CBS footage shows that Romney was correct about Obama's confusion and mixed messages to the public. Questions now remain over why CBS originally released the edited clip that appeared to back up his claims in the debate, but left out the remainder of the interview. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens . and three other U.S. citizens came under fire in the six-hour attack, . for which al-Qaeda and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia have been . blamed.

It recently emerged that the U.S. government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants, not a spontaneous mob, within just 24 hours of its taking place. A diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate, and used the excuse of protests against the anti-Muslim video as a cover. It is unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went, yet the statement directly contradicts the explanation of the attack given by the administration over the following two weeks.

On a mission: David Cameron (pictured today) announced the Help to Buy Scheme will be launched next week . Ambitious plans to offer 200,000 people access to cheaper mortgages are to be rushed forward, David Cameron revealed today. The Prime Minister announced the Help To Buy scheme, which provides 95 per cent mortgages part-guaranteed by the Government, will start from next week – three months ahead of schedule. Thousands of people will get the chance to purchase a house worth up to £600,000 with a deposit of just five per cent. The Government will underwrite an additional 15 per cent of the loan to make the deal attractive to lenders. The £12billion initiative will last for three years. Mr Cameron believes bringing forward the scheme is vital to helping speed up economic recovery. A defiant PM insisted he would not 'stand back’ while people could not afford to get on the housing ladder. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The Bank of England (said) expressly, there isn’t a bubble. The housing market is recovering, but from a low base. ‘If you look at prices outside London and the South East, they’re only going up by 0.8 per cent. Talk of a housing bubble to people here in Manchester or Salford and they will literally laugh in your face. ‘As Prime Minister, I’m not going to stand back while people’s aspirations to get on the housing ladder, to own their own flat, to own their own home, are being trashed. ‘That’s why we need to act, and that’s why it’s good news that we’re bringing forward the Help to Buy scheme, and I can tell you today that NatWest, RBS, Halifax, are all going to be putting forward these products.’He dismissed claims that the scheme . would cause a housing bubble, and said the Bank of England had been . given the tools to ‘report on these things and stop bubbles from . occurring’. Cameron said he brought forward the plan - which was due to begin in three months time - to help hard working Britons struggling to get a mortgage . David Cameron would block a mansion tax after the next election, even if he was forced into another coalition. The Liberal Democrat's have long argued for a levy on multi-million pound homes, with Labour also backing the idea. But Mr Cameron made clear that for as long as the Tories are in power he will block the plan. But he suggested council tax and stamp duty could be used to raise more money. He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I don't think this is a good idea. 'I want to live in a country where people work hard, they save and they put money into their homes. 'I think it's right people pay council tax, it's right people pay stamp duty - and we put that up - but to go after someone's house every year with a wealth tax, I don't think that's a sensible thing to do. 'I have never been in favour of this idea. I think it's a bad idea.' Asked if voters could be sure that there would be no mansion tax if he was Prime Minister after the next election, Mr Cameron added: . 'That's correct. Stamp duty yes, council tax yes, but I think wealth taxes are not sensible for a country if it wants to support wealth creation, wants to reward saving and people who work hard and do the right thing.' Mr Cameron also . told the Sunday Telegraph that a housing market which requires young . professionals to come up with a deposit of a £40,000 or £50,000 is . ‘broken’. He said: ‘If you haven’t got rich parents you can’t get that sort of money. 'So . that scheme comes forward, starting next week. That is a major move in . terms of backing aspiration and home ownership which is something very . close to my heart.’ A number of high profile figures have warned that it could lead to more problems than it solves. Liberal . Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable warned the scheme 'could . inflate the market' and said he feared there was a 'danger of getting . into another housing bubble'. Former . Bank of England governor Lord King warned that the scheme is 'too close . for comfort' to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'If . David Cameron is serious about helping first time buyers he should be . bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes. 'Rising . demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this . government housebuilding is at its lowest level since the 1920s. 'Unless . David Cameron acts now to build more affordable homes, as Labour has . urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first time . buyers to get on the housing ladder. 'The Bank of England . should immediately review the details of the scheme now before they are . set in stone.' Mr . Cameron dismissed concerns, telling The Sun people outside the M25 . 'laugh, quite rightly, in your face' at the suggestion there is a . housing boom. He said: 'Look at the number of first time buyers - it is still almost half what it was before the difficulties that we faced. 'The number of mortgage approvals is still way below where it was.' 'Don't take it from me, take it from the Bank of England who looked at this last week and said there isn't one.' Concerns: Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable warned the scheme 'could inflate the market' and said he feared there was a 'danger of getting into another housing bubble' Meanwhile, Mr Cameron denied claims he was 'chasing off to the right' with certain policies and was 'very firmly anchored where I have always been'. 'Yes, I want to win back voters from Ukip,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'But let me be clear, I am also a Prime Minister who is a modern compassionate Conservative who believes that there is a very important role for government in making sure that we look after the poorest in our society, that we are a compassionate society, that we give people opportunities who aren't necessarily born with them. We are not going to abandon that.' Mr Cameron may find himself debunking other claims in the following days as further revelations about those at the heart of government were revealed yesterday in new book In It Together by Matthew d'Ancona. Mr Cameron, pictured today with his wife Samantha at a cancer ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said he was desperate to win back voters from Ukip, but was unwilling to waiver further right to do so . The book claims that the PM expressed . private regret over pushing ahead with gay marriage reforms in the face . of fierce opposition from many of his backbenchers. Clashes . between George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith reportedly led to the . Chancellor claiming the Work and Pensions Secretary is 'not clever . enough'. 'I am impatient to help young people get on the housing ladder. The need is now. I have always wanted this to come in and frankly the earlier the better' Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Duncan Smith, however, found Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne being in office comparable to 'Ant and Dec' running the country, according to a friend. The series of revelations comes just days before the Conservative conference, held this year in Manchester. Going in to the conference, the party is suffering from a slight dip in the polls - it was revealed yesterday. The YouGov poll for The Sunday Times puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, Ukip on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on nine per cent.","Help To Buy .

One of the men filmed destroying a 20-million-year-old rock formation in a Utah state park only last month sued another driver claiming his back was severely injured in a 2009 chain-reaction accident. Seen in the video toppling the rock formation in Goblin Valley State Park, Glenn Taylor is able to force it off it's wobbly perch before high-fiving son Dylan Taylor - all on a back he claims was severely injured. The footage, which the Taylors and friend Dave Hall posted to their Facebook pages, shows Glenn Taylor and son Dylan enthusiastically celebrating the destruction of the rock formation. The elder Taylor even jokingly flexes his muscles, proud of his achievement. Scroll down for video . Claims he's debilitated:: Glenn Taylor tipped over the rock while his son cheered him on just a month after filing a personal injury suit . Chip off the old block: Dylan Taylor high-fived his father after defacing the natural wonder and jumped for joy over its demise . The cameraman: Dave Hall told local media he is receiving death threats since the stunt . Filed at the beginning of September, the lawsuit claims that Glenn Taylor severely injured his back in the 2009 lawsuit. The Utah man has had to 'endure great pain and suffering, disability, impairment, loss of joy of life,' the suit says, according to an attorney who spoke to KUTV. The lawsuit also called the accident 'debilitating,' the station noted. Alan Macdonald, the attorney representing the woman being sued, told the station that Glenn Taylor was one of many motorists rear-ended, and that no one involved complained of pain or went to a hospital. After seeing the ridiculous video, the attorney feels the case has no merit. 'He's climbing over other rocks, then he lines up, gets leverage and pushes that big old rock several times before he finally pushes it over,' the confused attorney told the station. 'Then he turns and twists and high fives and yucks it up and flexes his muscles he just doesn't look like a terribly disabled person to me,' Mr Macdonald adds. In his client's defense, attorney Mark Stubbs told KUTV that Glenn Taylor is suing for payment of prior medical bills stemming from the accident and that medical bills may continue into the future. He does admit, though, that a jusry trial involving the tape might not go particularly well. Utah State Parks officials have said . that the three men could face felony charges for destroying the . formation, which has been there for 20 million years. Speaking to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mr Hall said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week. 'I’ve got over 100 death threats on the Internet already,' said Mr Hall. 'I’ve . got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me . because I made the decision that lives are more important than this rock . staying here a few more hours,' he added. Despite . attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people . across the globe, Mr Hall continued to defend his group's actions. 'I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method,' he explained . to the Tribune. 'we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we . made, and we’re open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy . Scouts’ office, etc.' Caught on camera: Glenn Taylor is filmed pushing the 'loose' rock in Goblin Valley State Park . Destroyed: The massive rock, which had been in place for 20 million years, crashes to the ground beneath . Celebration: Glenn and Dylan Taylor high-five while the cameraman, Dave Hall, laughs and whoops for joy . A criminal investigation is now underway in the incident, which occurred on October 11, spokesman Eugene Swalberg told the Tribune. 'It . is not only wrong, but there will . be consequences,' he said. 'This is highly, highly inappropriate. This . is not what you do at state parks. It’s disturbing and upsetting.' Deputy Emery County Attorney . Brent Langston said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet . reached his office. If it does, he will consider whether to bring . charges. He said they could face anywhere from a . class B misdemeanor (up to six months in prison) to a second-degree felony (one to 15 years in prison) depending on how much the . formation is valued, the Tribune reported. He added: 'Some things can’t be replaced, like photographs in a family album, but they have great sentimental value.' The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock . Proud: The men said they were 'saving lives' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child . Showing off: Glenn Taylor, a Boy Scout leader, flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch . But the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby. On the video, Hall says: 'Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it’s all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.' Taylor said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it, it was loose. 'I put my hand on a rock and it moved,' he said. 'While we were sitting right there we thought, ""Man if this . rock falls it’ll kill them"".' I didn’t have to push hard.' But when they left, he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action. But the men said they had only seen one in the park that day. Goblin Valley is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in Utah . 'Civic service': Dylan Taylor, left, watched as Glenn Taylor, right, pushed the rock down on October 11 . Stunning: The rock formation at Goblin Valley State Park, pictured, was 20 million years old . Still, they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently. 'Glad we did it, wish we wouldn’t have done it,' Glenn Taylor said. Hall added: 'We're extremely sorry for . our actions. There was no in way shape or form any intent to go out . there and cause any harm to our natural resources.' Swalbery added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over. Glenn Taylor and Hall are leaders for the local Boy Scouts troop and that they are also Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints youth leaders. They said authorities have not yet contacted them about the incident.","Dave Hall, Glenn Taylor and Dylan Taylor posted video to Facebook showing them pushing the rock in Goblin Valley State Park .

Everyone who has spent time in the company of tired people knows that yawning is infectious, but now scientists have shown for the first time that chimpanzees can catch yawns from humans. Swedish researchers believe a chimpanzee's susceptibility to catching yawns develops gradually with age, exactly as it does in humans. Juvenile chimpanzees who are between five and eight years old catch human yawns but younger primates seem to be immune, according to the the study, which suggests that humans and other animals share a general developmental pattern. Scroll down for video . Juvenile chimpanzees who are between five and eight years old catch human yawns but younger primates seem to be immune, according to research, which suggests that humans and other animals share a general developmental pattern . Previous studies have proved that yawning together is not a sign of being tired at the same time and that contagious yawning among humans, chimpanzees, baboons and dogs could be a measure of empathy. Researchers from Lund University, who carried out the latest study at Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Sierra Leone, found yawning, but not nose-wiping was contagious. They interacted with 33 orphaned chimpanzees aged between 13 months and 8 years and one researcher repeatedly yawned, gaped (opened her mouth without yawning) and wiped her nose with her hand to see how the animals responded. The scientists found that while the younger chimpanzees did not respond to yawning, those five years and older yawned continuously. As a way of examining the role that empathy with the yawner played for contagion, the study also compared the chimpanzees’ reactions towards yawns from their human surrogate mother and a stranger. Researchers from Lund University found yawning was contagious between humans and chimpanzees. Elainie Madsen (pictured) repeatedly yawned at 33 orphaned chimps and found that while the younger chimpanzees did not respond to yawning (pictured) those five years and older yawned continuously . Cross-species yawn contagion has . previously only been demonstrated in dogs. Research suggests that man’s best friend yawns when he yawns, as a way of empathising with its master. Contrary to prediction, there was no difference in the likelihood of yawning when engaging with an unfamiliar person from someone with whom the chimpanzees had a close relationship, questioning previous research that showed humans and animals tend to be more susceptible to catching yawns from those they are close to. The developmental pattern found in the study is consistent with what previous research has found for humans. Humans also show a developmental increase in susceptibility to yawn contagion, with children seemingly beginning to yawn contagiously around the age of four, at a time when empathy-related behaviours and the ability to accurately identify others’ emotions begin to manifest clearly. The scientists think that their research might reflect a general developmental pattern, shared by humans and other animals. Given that contagious yawning may be an empathetic response, the results can also be taken to mean that empathy develops slowly over the first years of a chimpanzee’s life. However, the researchers wanted to know why the chimpanzees did not differentiate between their surrogate mother and unfamiliar humans in the study. The developmental pattern found in the study is consistent with what previous research has found for humans. Children seemingly beginning to yawn contagiously around the age of four, at a time when empathy-related behaviours and the ability to accurately identify others' emotions begin to manifest clearly . 'We do not have the full explanation yet, as it is a complex phenomenon that is being explored', said Elainie Madsen, a researcher in the study. She believes there are at least two possible explanations. One is that familiarity seems to play out differently in immature and adult individuals as the present study suggests that juvenile chimpanzees generalise their yawn responses to humans, irrespective of familiarity and attachment history. In contrast, previous research on adult chimpanzees has shown that contagious yawning is targeted mostly towards familiar individuals. This research on adult individuals has, however, been conducted on chimpanzees that have seen other chimpanzees yawn on video. The researchers are therefore cautious. Cross-species yawn contagion has previously only been demonstrated in dogs. Previous research suggests that man's best friend yawns when he yawns, as a way of empathising with its master . 'Future research will have to examine whether there might be multiple reasons for yawning in response to others’ yawns, and whether these differences apply differently within and between these two species. 'That is, whether chimpanzees may apply ‘targeted empathy’ to interactions with members of their own species – and selectively catch yawns from familiar chimpanzees - while they apply a more generalised form of empathy to interactions with humans' Dr Madsen said. A reason for this may be that chimpanzees typically engage in competitive, even hostile, relationships with unfamiliar members of their own species, but rarely do so with humans, who they mostly experience as cooperative, according to the study. She said: 'It is possible that younger chimpanzees switch from a ""generalised empathy"" to all individuals - irrespective of species - to a more ""targeted empathy"" as they mature into adults and possibly have stronger reasons to differentiate friends from foes', Madsen concludes. Cross-species yawn contagion has . previously only been demonstrated in dogs.","Swedish researchers believe a chimp's susceptibility to catching yawns develops gradually with age, exactly as it does in humans .

An investigation has been launched into whether moves to make diesel cleaner could be putting millions of drivers at risk of breakdowns in potentially dangerous situations. Fuel suppliers have been implementing European Union regulations to mix conventional diesel with environmentally-friendly biofuels, made from crops including corn, sugarcane and rapeseed. But there has been a surge in sudden breakdowns of diesel cars in cold weather since the greener fuel was introduced, and the concentration of biofuel in the mixture increased. New cleaner diesel could be putting drivers at risk of breakdowns according to the RAC . The RAC revealed it attended 600 call-outs last month from motorists whose fuel filters have become clogged by a build-up of thick gel in the engine, compared with 280 incidents in November 2012. The organisation said the problem disappeared last summer when weather was warmer. Drivers only become aware of the issue when their car suffers a sudden loss of power – and mechanics found that on affected cars the fuel filter has been clogged by the fuel ‘waxing’ – a similar effect to when olive oil clouds in a bottle. One affected motorist, Jon Harvey, from Oxfordshire, said the engine of his Citroen C3 VTR cut out suddenly while overtaking on a dual carriageway. He said: ‘I put my foot on the accelerator and it suddenly cut out. It cost me £160 to fix.’ Britain has 9.4 million diesel vehicles which could be affected. Fuel suppliers have to add biofuel to road fuels under the EU’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation. The RAC has warned that drivers who use cleaner diesel could be in danger of winter breakdowns . The investigation into whether blended diesel is being carried out by industry bodies the UK Petroleum Industry Association, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and the Downstream Fuel Association, working with the British Standards Institution. David Bizley, technical director of the RAC, said biofuel content in diesel was being probed because it was the newest element to be added to diesel – and that the problem had not occurred before. He said: ‘It's clear that we still don't fully understand all aspects of the underlying cause.’ The Department for Transport said Transport Minister Baroness Kramer had asked the industry to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. According to RAC data, breakdowns due to clogged fuel filters on diesel vehicles have been more prevalent in eastern parts of England and Scotland, which bore the brunt of cold weather in recent weeks, but other parts of the country have also been affected. The UK Petroleum Industry Association, which represents oil refining and marketing companies, said it was aware of the problems and that the investigation would work to reveal the cause. Meanwhile, the Petrol Retailers’ Association is urging the Office of Fair Trading to reopen an investigation into ‘loss-leading’ supermarket fuel promotions which it believes are driving independent garages to the wall. Supermarkets have been offering promotions such as 10 pence off a litre of fuel for motorists spending £50 or £60 on their groceries – bringing petrol and diesel below cost price. Brian Madderson, head of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ‘Such practices are causing the continuing trend of independent forecourt closures.’ In Australia, two of the country’s biggest supermarkets have agreed to end heaving promotions in a deal brokered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.","RAC warns that drivers who use new cleaner diesel could be at risk .

Could we one day do away with the traditional guitar for a version with no body or neck? According to the makers of the world's first all-titanium, futuristic-looking Gittler guitar, that may soon be the case. The idea of a body-less guitar was the brainchild of a musician and minimalist artist Alan Gittler back in the 1970s. Gittler’s vision was to strip away individual elements of a functional guitar to find out what lay within the heart that could not be removed. Scroll down for video... The world's first all-titanium, futuristic-looking Gittler guitar was the brainchild of a musician and minimalist artist Alan Gittler back in the 1970s. Gittler's vision was to strip away individual elements of a functional guitar to find out what lay within the heart that could not be removed . He discovered that although wood had been used since the guitar's creation, it wasn’t needed for the instrument to the function. He also believed that electric guitars only look the way they do because nobody has bothered to change them since the 1930s. ‘The basic elements of vibration and gain were the only truly indespensable elements at play when making sound,’ claims New York-based Gittler Instruments. Everything else, it said, simply existed to shape and mould that sound to the individual player's taste. By paring the instrument down to the point of pure function, the idea was that it would become more responsive to every nuance of playing, however subtle. Gittler did away with not only the body but most of the neck and all volume and tone controls. Now, Gittler's son Jonathan is carrying on his father's legacy by reinventing the bare bones bass. The latest version of the guitar is manufactured entirely of 6AL-4V aircraft grade titanium. Like the original design, it has no neck or body - although an acrylic guitar neck can be added, if needed. Fret marking is done with built-in LED lights installed in tiny cross holes across the guitar's central channel. By paring the instrument down to the point of pure function, the idea was that it would become more responsive to every nuance of playing, however subtle. Pictured is the instrument's inventor Alan Gittler . An electronic box in the back of the guitar contains a volume wheel, dual tone controls for treble and bass. The 30.25 inch and three inch wide Gittler guitars are thought to be the world's first model to include six transducers in a single guitar unit. Gittler Instruments said it is now ready to bring a fully realised concept, and not just a prototype, to the market. It has launched a campaign via crowdsourcing site Kickstarter to raise $80,000 by November 14. A $2,000 pledge will get you one of the first Gittler guitars made for the mass market. Although you'll have to follow that up with another $1,995 payment to receive the instrument, which the group promises will provide a 'guitar playing experience that is out of this world.'","Body-less guitar claims to be more responsive to every nuance of playing .

Lynne Wakefield, pictured on her wedding day, lost 6 stone after she and her daughter went on a diet before the big day. Sadly, her daughter, 23, passed away before the nuptials . Selfless mother Lynne devoted herself to nursing Rachael, her only child, after she fell ill aged 13. At her heaviest, Lynne Wakefield was a size 22 - however, she managed to slim down to a 14 in time for her wedding, spurred on by her promise to her daughter . With little time to cook or plan meals, she often resorted to junk food or takeaways as she visited her daughter during lengthy stretches in hospital. She had twice postponed her marriage to partner Phil due to Rachaelâ€™s treatment, which included a gruelling double lung transplant.

Mercury, the closest planet to our sun, may hold the key to understanding how the Earth’s moon  formed. Nasa scientists have highlighted how Mercury has some striking similarities to Earth’s satellite, particularly in relation to its geological history. At the recent Origin of the Moon conference held at the Royal Society, London, scientists said that the finding could shed light on a popular theory on how the moon was created. Mercury (pictured), the closest planet to our sun, may hold the key to understanding how the Earth's moon was formed . Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for Nasa’s Messenger mission to Mercury, told Space.com that the similarities show that Earth and the moon are not unique in having a similar isotopic composition. He said, ‘aspects of the moon are common to rocky bodies that are similar in size despite being different in bulk composition.’ There is currently no theory that can fully answer all the questions about how the moon formed. The most popular theory is that the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago. The most popular theory is that the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago . This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the moon. The best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the Earth. The hypothesis, however, has been called into question by measurements that find that the Earth and Moon have the same isotopic composition. In March this year, the Messenger spacecraft finished mapping the Mercury’s entire surface, and scientists are now ploughing through the data that was beamed back. One of the most significant findings is the similarities in geological history of both the moon and Mercury. Just like the moon, a part of Mercury's surface is relatively smooth. On Mercury, the smooth area covers 27 per cent of the surface; on the moon this is around 16 per cent. The surface of Mercury (left) and the Moon (right) has some striking similarities. Mercury's ancient cratered land has a very similar topography and age to that of the moon . Scientists believe these areas were formed billions of years ago from volcanic eruptions that covered the surface with lava. Mercury's ancient cratered land also has a very similar topography and age to that of the moon. Both bodies have polar ice deposits and also have two sides that are strikingly different from each other. Solomon believes to get a better understanding of how the moon formed we need to get a sample from Mercury. If Mercury happens to be isotopically similar, it could suggest that the objects that collided to grow the final stages of the Earth and created the moon were made out of similar material. ‘If there was [such a process],’ said Solomon, ‘all our puzzles about why the Moon and Earth are so similar isotopically then evaporate.’ A . controversial theory has been proposed that a giant explosion . equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the Earth's core . somehow led to the formation of the moon. Planetary . scientist Wim van Westrenen believes this violent event took place . approximately four-and-a-half billion years ago and could answer the . hotly contested question of where our moon comes from. The . scientist, from VU University in Amsterdam, told New Scientist magazine . that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not . add up.Chemical analysis of the rocks last year by the University of . Chicago found that they shared identical oxygen, silicon and potassium . isotopes with Earth, hinting that the Moon shares its origin with the . Earth. Van Westeren said . that taken at face value, the findings suggest that the moon was once . part of the Earth that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion . from the Earth's fiery core. To . do this, he believes that there must have been a 'massive energy kick' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength . of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on Hiroshima.","Just .

Facebook may be to blame for turning the word Like into a verb, but Google is set to take this a step further. According to a new patent filed by the internet giant, Google wants its Glass wearers to like brands, products and locations simply by making a heart shape with their hands. A camera on the headmounted device scans and recognises the item being liked and stores its details in a list of favourites, which can then be shared. A patent filed in the U.S. shows Google's plans to let its Glass users generate a like by creating a heart shape with their hands in front of real-life objects, pictured. The headmounted device would then scan the item to record that the wearer likes that particular brand, product or location . Google is putting the finishing touches to a smartwatch that could be unveiled 'within weeks', according to industry insiders. The watch, believed to be codenamed Gem, could take advantage of the work Google has been doing on its Glass wearable computer. It could also use the same Google Now alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear. The patent is called 'Hand gestures to signify what is important' and was made public on Wednesday. In one diagram, hands shaped as a heart are shown in front of a painting, while another shows the hand gesture being used in front of building sign. Google explains in the patent: 'Hand gestures can be used to provide user input to a wearable computing device, and in particular to identify, signify, or otherwise indicate what may be considered or classified as important or worthy of attention or notice. 'A wearable computing device, which could include a headmounted display (HMD) and a video camera, may recognise known hand gestures and carry out particular actions in response. 'Particular hand gestures could be used . for selecting portions of a field of view of the HMD, and generating . images from the selected portions.' It is thought the technology could use, or build on, Google's existing Goggles app, demonstration image pictured,  that lets people take photos of items and find them online. This includes scanning products in shops, to compare online prices, for example, or landmarks to find a location on a map . This flow chart from Google's patent explains the process of how a head-mounted device could scan a hand gesture, recognise the object and save it online . In simple terms, a user would frame any real-world object with a heart-shaped hand gesture and a built-in camera would scan the frame and 'like' the highlighted product or location. Google could also expand the type and number of hand gestures the technology recognises to include thumbs-up gestures, pointing, forming an L (for like) with a thumb and forefinger or circling items with a loop. The 'wearable computing device' likely refers to Google's Glass technology, yet the patent's wording suggests it could be applied to any form of headmounted wearable technology. It is also thought the technology could use, or build upon, Google's existing Goggles app that lets people take photos of items and find them online.

In a move that adds new meaning to the term surfing the web, researchers are working on creating a 'deep-sea internet'. A team of scientists from New York have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in Lake Erie, and are now hoping to create an industry standard for underwater communications in the world's seas and oceans. The technology could be used to send data between submarines, for example, collect and send data from the sea floor to help detect tsunamis and other disasters sooner, as well as monitor fish and mammal numbers. A team of scientists from New York have begun testing an underwater Wi-Fi network. The system involves data being sent to and from two 40lb sensors, pictured, using sound waves. The data can be sent in real-time from a laptop and the sensors have a wider underwater range than current radio wave technology does . Traditional networks, used on land, use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae. Radio waves have a weak range . underwater so agencies such as the Navy and National Oceanic and . Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) use . sound wave-based methods to communicate underwater. Melodia's system sends commands and data from a laptop to two 40lb sensors placed on the sea bed. These commands are converted into sound waves that transmit data back to laptops and other wireless devices in real-time. Other examples given by the team, led by Tommaso Melodia, associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, include offshore oil and natural gas exploration, surveillance, pollution monitoring and more. 'A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time,' said Melodia. 'Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives.' Traditional networks, used on land, use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae. Radio waves have a weak range underwater so agencies such as the Navy and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) use . sound wave-based methods to communicate underwater. For example, NOAA relies on . acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to . surface buoys. The buoys convert the acoustic waves into radio waves to . send the data to a satellite, which then redirects the radio waves back . to land-based computers - a slow and lengthy process. Melodia's system would solve this problem by sending data between a network of underwater sensors to laptops, . smartphones and other wireless devices in real-time using sound waves. Electrical engineering students including Hovannes Kulhandjia, pictured, have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in Lake Erie, pictured. The team hopes to use the technology to detect tsunamis more accurately, monitor the levels of fish and mammals, search for natural gas and more . During tests, Hovannes Kulhandjian, left, and Zahed Hossain, right, sent a command to the sensors. They knew it had been successful when the soundwaves ricocheted off a nearby concrete wall . Melodia recently tested the system in . Lake Erie by dropping . two, 40lb sensors into the water. Reserachers Hovannes Kulhandjian . and Zahed Hossain typed a command into a . laptop that was transmitted to the sensors. A series of high-pitched chirps bounced off a . nearby concrete wall seconds later, indicating that the command had been received by the sensors and activated the sound from the sensor. A deep-sea internet could, for example, join networks of buoys together that can detect . tsunamis quicker and more reliably than current methods, said Melodia. It could also be used by the energy industry to search for underwater oil and natural gas. 'We could even use it to monitor fish . and marine mammals, and find out how to best protect them from shipping . traffic and other dangers,' Melodia continued. 'An internet underwater has . so many possibilities.'

Still, police were less than impressed when they were first told that a van failed to display a proper tax disc because a snail had nibbled away at it. Luckily, mechanic Jon Roles and his father Steve provided undeniable photographic evidence – and police waived the £100 fine. A motorist was spared a fine for a missing car tax disc after photographs proved it had been eaten by a snail . Jon Roles was handed the £100 penalty notice after failing to display the certificate in a van he picked up . They even jokingly suggested the men could ‘interrogate the offender, preferably with a teaspoon of salt’. The insatiable snail slid into the white Peugeot while it was broken down, giving it time to get to work on the tempting tax disc. When Jon Roles, 33, picked the van up in order to repair it, he found a penalty notice for the ruined disc. But on closer inspection he realised the hungry mollusc was to blame. So Mr Roles’s father Steve, who helps out at his son’s garage, set about contesting the fine. The 70-year-old said: ‘It’s almost unbelievable. I had a bit of a chuckle as I just couldn’t believe what I saw. ‘I think snails like glue and ink so maybe that’s why it ate the disc. ‘It was very much a “dog ate my homework” moment, but we still had the penalty notice to deal with.’ Steve Roles, 70, said: 'It's almost unbelievable. I had a bit of a chuckle as I just couldn't believe what I saw' The van’s owner had left it in the Roles’s care, so they felt it was their duty to either pay up – or persuade police that no one was at fault. Steve Roles said: ‘We explained the situation but [police] weren’t too keen to see the evidence. ‘They said it was still an offence as the disc was not properly displayed. ‘As it had been partially eaten by the snail, it only said “August” and you couldn’t see the year. ‘But we knew for a fact the customer had taxed the vehicle.’ He wrote to the police to state his case – and this time included photos of the greedy snail. Mr Roles, of J H Norman and Sons Ltd, in Yeovil, Somerset, said: ‘We felt it was unjust. We tried to make the letter light-hearted but also explain that this all happened by chance.’ Luckily, Avon and Somerset Police agreed, replying: ‘After consideration of all the facts I have decided to excuse payment of the fixed penalty. ‘Please feel free to interrogate the offender, preferably with a teaspoon of salt. Merry Christmas.’ Sadly, the snail died after his taxing meal. Snails often eat paper, which is made up of plant fibres, and are a common pest in postboxes, where they eat both letters and envelope glue, according to Royal Mail. In last week’s Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne said tax discs will be scrapped next year and replaced with an electronic system.","Police cancelled the £100 penalty notice after seeing picture .

Humans feel the pain of their enemies more strongly than the discomfort of than their friends because that is when their opponents are most dangerous and unpredictable, scientists said . Humans feel the pain of their enemies more strongly than the discomfort of their friends - because that is when their opponents are most dangerous and unpredictable, scientists claim. While many people might assume that they would empathise most with those they care about, a study has found that the opposite is true and the reason is one of self preservation as humans need to understand why an enemy is in pain to rule out the risk of retribution. U.S. scientists discovered the part of the brain that is associated with empathising with the pain of others is activated more strongly by watching the suffering of hated enemies. But the reaction is natural as it might indicate that the human brain is programmed to focus more on the need to monitor enemies closely, especially when they are suffering and unpredictable. Lisa Aziz-Zadeh of the Brain and Creativity Institute of the University of Southern California said: 'When you watch an action movie and the bad guy appears to be defeated, the moment of his demise draws our focus intensely. 'We watch him closely to see whether he's really down for the count, because it's critical for predicting his potential for retribution in the future.' The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, examined activity in the 'pain matrix' of the brain - a network that includes the insula cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the somatosensory cortices - regions known to activate when an individual watches another person suffer. The pain matrix is thought to be a related to empathy and allows humans to understand one another's pain. However the study revealed the pain matrix may be more involved in processing pain in general and not necessarily tied to processing feelings of empathy. A person's strong reaction to when an enemy is in pain is natural. Scientists believe it might indicate that the human brain is programmed to focus more on the need to monitor enemies closely, especially when they are suffering and unpredictable . The researchers studied a group of white Jewish males who first watched videos of hateful, anti-Semitic individuals in pain and then other videos of tolerant, non-hateful individuals in pain. Their brains were scanned to show activity levels in the pain matrix and surprisingly, the participants' pain matrices were more activated by watching the anti-Semites suffer compared to the tolerant individuals. Researcher Glenn Fox, who was also involved in the study, added: 'The results further reveal the brain's flexibility in processing complex social situations. 'The brain uses the complete context of the situation to mount an appropriate response. 'In this case, the brain's response is likely tied to the relative increase in the need to attend to and understand the pain of the hateful person.' The study examined activity in the 'pain matrix' of the brain regions known to activate when an individual watches another person suffer. While the matrix is thought to be related to empathy, the researchers now think it may be more involved in processing pain in general.

Conservationists are using a new weapon against poachers in Kenya in the shape of 1,000 microchips that they are implanting into rare rhino horns. In a bid to fight back against increasingly sophisticated hunters, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is using the chips along with the DNA records to track the decreasing rhino population and their valuable horns. The technology, gifted by charity World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is designed to protect the remaining 1,000 rhinos in the country as well as to collect evidence to use against poachers in court. A Kenya Wildlife Services vet approaches a wild male black rhino named Sambu after it was tranquilized in Lewa conservancy in August. The horn of each  rhino is cut and a tracking device is fitted to monitor its movements to help combat poaching . Robert Magori, Kenya’s spokesman for the WWF, said: 'This is the first time we have used technology or done anything like this to try to preserve the rhino population.' He warned that poachers are using technology to kill animals in some of the country's most secure reserves. 'We are facing an even . greater challenge because the poachers are becoming increasingly . sophisticated. They have night-vision goggles and long-range rifles,' he told NBC News. In a statement, KWS said the 1,000 microchips and five scanners will 'be instrumental in strengthening active rhino monitoring as well as stockpile audits of rhino horn'. The microchips and five scanners cost around £10,000 but the price of fitting the technology will likely cost significantly more. A microchip will be embedded into a rhino's horn and another in its body to ensure that tracking still works if the horn is removed. Experts have warned that if the current trend continues, more than 1,000 rhinos could be poached by 2014 and Kenya alone saw 23 of its rhinos killed last year . KWS believes that the systems, combined with forensic DNA technology, will allow for 100 per cent traceability of every rhino horn and live animal within Kenya. 'This will serve to strengthen rhino monitoring, protect the animals on site and also support anti-trafficking mechanisms nationally and regionally,' it said. Investigators will be able to link cases of poaching to a recovered or confiscated horn and this forms crucial evidence in court contributing towards the prosecution’s ability to push for sentencing of a suspected rhino criminal. The technology is being used internationally to support criminal justice responses to wildlife crimes and means that every marked rhino in the country is traceable and every rhino horn tracked globally can be matched to the rhino from which it was taken. KWS said the microchips and five scanners will be used to monitor trade of rhino horns. The microchips and five scanners, cost around £10,000 but the price of fitting the technology will likely cost significantly more. Here, KWS rangers fit a tracking device to a tranquilised rhino . It is hoped the technology will expose and provide new insight into the rhino horn trade chain. Mr Magori said the number of rhinos being poached in Kenya has risen dramatically in recent years and the reason is their valuable horns, that can sell for £40,150 per kilogram, which is more valuable than gold. While trading of the horns was regulated in the 1990s and poaching figures fell sharply as a result, there is increasing demand for the horns in South East Asia after a Vietnamese politician claimed the ingredient, used in traditional medicine, cured his cancer. It is not just Kenya that has seen incidences of rhino poaching soar, as other African countries, including South Africa, which is home to some 22,000 rhinos, has noticed the impact. Experts have warned that if the current trend continues, more than 1,000 rhinos could be poached by 2014 and Kenya alone saw 23 of its rhinos killed last year.","The technology, which is worth around £10,000, was gifted to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) by charity WWF .

Campaigners against the £34billion HS2 rail project  yesterday won their fight for higher compensation. The High Court ruled that a consultation on payouts for thousands of blighted homes was ‘so unfair as to be unlawful’. Objections from protesters were not ‘conscientiously considered’ by ministers, according to a judge. Blow: The Government  suffered a humiliating set-back to its £34billion High speed rail project today. A high speed train is pictured . The Government will now have to hold the £3.6million consultation again and bills picked up by the taxpayer could soar. The decision was hailed as a stunning . victory for ‘Middle England’ and for the High Speed 2 Action Alliance, . which comprises more than 70 action and residents’ associations. The court heard that around 172,000 . homes within 0.6 miles of the first phase of the line from London to . Birmingham are affected by ‘HS2 blight’. However some campaigners put . the figure as high as 350,000 with a compensation bill of around . £2.5billion. The Government won nine other cases . yesterday relating to the plan to run 225mph trains from London to the . Midlands and beyond in a  Y-shaped route to Leeds and Manchester. Under the compensation scheme, those . living in a ‘safeguarded zone’ within 60 metres of the line will receive . a package involving the unblighted value of their property plus 10 per . cent and moving costs. Outside this zone there are a number . of less generous discretionary compensation schemes including for those . living between 60 metres and 120 metres from the line. The HS2 plan has proved unpopular with many and questions have been raised about the benefits it will bring . An ‘exceptional hardship’ scheme . exists for those who can prove they are forced to move. The scheme has . provoked a revolt in Tory heartlands because it runs through areas of . outstanding natural beauty, including the Chilterns and parts of . Warwickshire. Allowing the challenge by HS2AA, Mr . Justice Ouseley ruled: ‘All in all, the consultation on compensation was . so unfair as to be unlawful.’ David Wolfe QC, appearing for HS2AA, . argued successfully that tens of thousands of people who ‘just happen to . live and own properties’ along the high-speed route faced loss of value . on their homes and being unable to move or remortgage for 15 years or . more. The nine legal claims rejected by the . judge included attacks on the manner in which the project had been . steered through Parliament and alleged breaches of EU environmental and . habitat directives. Ministers say the 351-mile scheme – . which won’t be completed until 2033 – is in the national interest, will . regenerate the North, boost jobs and help Britain compete in the world. Journey times will be cut. Rail minister Simon Burns said: ‘This is a major landmark victory for HS2 and the future of Britain. ‘The judge has categorically given the green light for the Government to press ahead without delay.’ Campaigners against the high speed rail link claimed today's judgement was a 'huge victory'.

Rescue dog: Ridley the Cairn Terriesaves hundreds of rare sea turtles every year by sniffing out their eggs on the beach. He was originally bought as a family pet eight years ago, but his talents were quickly realised and he was put to work to save the turtles . Endangered: These turtles are endangered and the eggs must be collected and incubated to increase the species chance of survival . Ridley's owner Donna Shaver, 54, from Texas, USA, is the chief of the division of sea turtle science and recovery at Padre Island National Seashore. She has 33 years experience of working with sea turtles. She has trained Ridley to locate the nests and eggs when they cannot be found by humans. The eggs are then transported to the incubation unit for specialist care. Good team: Ridley's owner Donna Shaver, 54, from Texas, USA, is the chief of the division of sea turtle science and recovery at Padre Island National Seashore . Saved: The eggs are then transported to the incubation unit for specialist care. Ridley is thought to have saved as many as hundreds of turtles throughout his career . Search: When Ridley is first brought to a site he is told to 'find the nest'. The dog understands the instructions and sniffs the sand to find the eggs . Donna said: 'We use Ridley when we can see tracks left by the female but they have disappeared in the soft sand and we cannot find the nests. 'We only take Ridley into the field a few times a year. My staff are very good at finding nests, and Ridley is only brought out after they have searched a site for hours. 'We do not want to bring him out to a lot of sites because the beach is a very harsh environment. It is quite hot and to access sites we must drive on the beach, which can be quite bumpy. 'First and foremost he is my beloved pet and we do not want any harm to come to him.' When Ridley is first brought to a site he is told to 'find the nest'. The dog understands the instructions and sniffs the sand to find the eggs. When he finds the nest he stops and gently paws at the sand. Staff then carefully dig down further to determine if eggs are there. Donna said: 'We use Ridley when we can see tracks left by the female but they have disappeared in the soft sand and we cannot find the nests' Donna said: 'Ridley knows it is important to me to find the eggs - he has watched me work with the eggs and hatchlings since he was a young pup. 'When we bring him to a site we walk him up and down the beach where the tracks are located and where we think the nest could be. He continues to sniff. 'Sometimes there is no nest and the turtle has just come out of the sea, but by using Ridley we can be sure we do not miss any nests.' After the eggs are found they are carefully packed into foam incubation boxes and transported to the incubation facility for protected care. Recovered: Turtles being examined at the Padre Island National.  Last year, a record 206 nests were recovered . The eggs remain in the facility for about 48-53 days prior to hatching. The hatchlings are then released on the beach and allowed to go free. Ridley is the first dog on the team to become a fully independent searcher. There were two other dogs on the team, but neither were able to search alone. Donna said: 'I had two other dogs that we started training, but neither became fully independent searchers. 'Unfortunately, one of those died at 22 months. After she died Ridley became despondent so we soon got another red Cairn Terrier female that we named Kayleigh. 'Kayleigh is still in training, but she has never gone to a site without Ridley. She occasionally goes with Ridley for training, but they do not work as a team.' Donna says it is impossible to say how many turtles Ridley has saved, but thinks the number would be well into the hundreds. Such are the efforts the number of found nests increased from 5 in 1996 to 50 in 2005. Last year, a record 206 nests were recovered.","Ridley the Cairn Terrier was originally bought as a pet eight years ago .

"New film, Theory Of . Everything, tells story of scientist's love life . By . Chris Hastings . PUBLISHED: . 17:07 EST, 19 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 20 October 2013 . On A wind-battered British beach, a frail figure in a wheelchair gazes out over the pallid grey waves as a woman crouches attentively at his bare feet. The man, almost impossible to recognise, is big-screen heart-throb and fashion icon Eddie Redmayne, who has undergone an incredible transformation for his new movie. In the film, called Theory Of Everything, the Les Miserables star plays the brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking – and on Friday he and the rest of the crew were on the dunes of Camber Sands in East Sussex to film pivotal scenes. In character: Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking filming the new movieTheory Of Everything . The movie tells the poignant and inspirational story of the scientist’s love for his first wife Jane Wilde. They met while they were both students in Cambridge in the 1960s, just as Hawking was beginning to suffer the early effects of the motor neurone disease which would eventually leave him almost entirely paralysed, dependent upon a speech synthesiser to communicate. Redmayne – who has modelled for the Burberry fashion label and been named as one of Vanity Fair’s best-dressed people – had to put aside his normal sartorial elegance for a shabby suit and brown brogues to capture Hawking’s more ramshackle look. The movie tells the poignant and inspirational story of the scientist's love for his first wife Jane Wilde . Our exclusive pictures show him . shooting a scene opposite Felicity Jones, who plays Jane. She is seen . frolicking on the beach, plastic bucket in hand, before filming a tender . kiss with her co-star. Co-star: Felicity Jones plays Stephen Hawking's first wife Jane . In between shots, Redmayne dons a pair of wellington boots to ensure his costume isn’t damaged by the wintry waves. On other occasions he has to be carried along the beach by an obliging member of the film’s crew. Both actors are rising fast through their profession. Redmayne, 31, won an Olivier award for his role in  the West End and Broadway play Red, and was last seen as Marius in Les Miserables. Professor Hawking has reportedly welcomed his casting and has made a series of visits to the film’s sets in Cambridge where the bulk of shooting is taking place. Meanwhile, Jones will star in the new Spider-Man film as well as playing Charles Dickens’s mistress Nelly Ternan opposite Ralph Fiennes in The Invisible Woman, both out next year. Theory Of Everything, which is due for release in 2015, also co-stars Emily Watson, Maxine Peake and David Thewlis, and is inspired by Jane Hawking’s memoir, Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen. It was just after Hawking’s 21st birthday in 1963 when he was diagnosed. Doctors initially gave him two years to live, and he soon had difficulty walking very far on his own so started using a wheelchair. The cosmologist has credited his love for Jane with helping him escape the depression which threatened to engulf his life. The couple married in 1965 and went on to have three children. Hawking’s brilliance was recognised relatively early, and his theories on black holes and the creation of the universe established him as an intellectual force. His 1987 book A Brief History Of Time sold ten million copies and catapulted him to widespread public recognition. Location: The crew were spotted filming pivotal scenes on Camber Sands in East Sussex last week . But Hawking’s success and his increasingly reliance on live-in carers took its toll on the marriage. In 1977 Jane took up singing lessons and found herself increasingly close to widowed choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones. The couple’s relationship remained platonic for years, but by the 1980s they had become lovers. Hawking, who was initially tolerant of the affair, subsequently left Jane and began a relationship with his carer Elaine Mason, whom he married in 1995 but divorced 11 years later. He continues to work at Cambridge University. Normal look: Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne in a Burberry Ad Campaign .","Normally dapper star has modelled for the Burberry fashion label .

New York financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost two-thirds of its employees in the September 11 attacks, revealed a $135 million settlement with American Airlines and insurance carriers on Tuesday to a judge who said it will end the final airplane-focused case resulting from claims of wrongful death and personal injuries. The original lawsuit, filed in 2004, was seeking $1 billion in damages. Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into its top-floor offices in the World Trade Center's North Tower and claimed the airline had been negligent in allowing the terrorists to board the plane. This weeks agreement averts a trial scheduled for next month, which means there will be no airing of such questions as how terrorists got through security before hijacking planes on September 11, the best way to stop terrorists, whether there was any real wrongdoing and negligence and how best to preserve liberties amid such threats, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said. 'All this will remain a mystery,' he said. Howard Lutnick - the head of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald who lost 658 employees, including in his brother, in the 9/11 attacks - visits the North Pool of the Memorial during the 10th anniversary of September 11 in 2011. Cantor Fitzgerald this week settled a damages lawsuit with American Airlines for $135 million . Calling the settlement a significant conclusion after 12 years of litigation that resulted in scores of settlements and no trial involving airlines, the judge said: 'Hopefully what was achieved was a measure of justice, a measure of reparation and closure.' 'But the lives that were lost were irreparable, and being irreparable, there now are no words to describe that loss,' he added. The deal was announced by Cantor Fitzgerald attorney John Stoviak, who said money from various insurers is in escrow and ready to be paid out pending formal approval by the court at or after a January 13 hearing. Afterward, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard W. Lutnick said in a statement that the case for insurance companies 'was just another case, just another settlement, but not for us'. Lutnick, whose brother Gary Lutnick was killed in the attacks, added: 'We could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.' American Airlines Flight 11 was a passenger flight that was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists. It was the first plane flown into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2011, crashing into the Northern Tower, which held the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald . The north tower of the World Trade Center burns after s hijacked airplane hit it September 11, 2001 in New York City. Inside the building were the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, who have sued American Airlines for damages over the attacks . Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 of 1,000 people in its New York workforce when the 101st through 105th floors of its One World Trade Center headquarters were destroyed when a hijacked airplane struck the tower. - Left Boston's Logan Airport at 7.59am . - Destination was Los Angeles . - On board were a crew of 11 and 76 passengers . - Five terrorists hijacked the plane once it was in the air . - The hijackers flew the plane into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8.46am . Howard Lutnick wasn't in the office at the time. Anthoula Katsimatides, who lost her brother John Katsimatides, a bonds broker, said she was 'disheartened' to hear the case had been settled instead of going to trial. 'It would have been nice to hold people accountable over issues including security,' she said. But she wasn't upset with Cantor Fitzgerald. 'I'm so confident that they are always thinking about the best interests of their September 11 families ... there must have been a reason why they settled,' she said. Of this being the last airplane-focused case and therefore ending the chance to bring these issues up in open court, she said she was disappointed, but 'I guess we just have to live with it'. A spokesman for American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and is part of American Airlines Group Inc., said in a statement the airline had 'vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that American should have done what the government could not do: prevent the terrorist attacks'. After American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center (right) another hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 175, prepares to slam into the south tower . The spokesman, Sean Collins, also noted that 'the courageous crew members and passengers on Flight 77 and Flight 11 were all victims of the terrorist attacks'. The judge praised lawyers on both sides, saying he once thought a deal was impossible. He noted that some litigation from September 11, 2001, remains, including claims involving the trade center, developer Larry Silverstein, first responders and others. Cantor Fitzgerald, meanwhile, has risen dramatically from a low of about 150 employees in the months after the attacks. It now has 3,200 employees in New York and about 8,000 worldwide, including the employees of a spinoff, BGC Partners. In total, almost 3,000 people died in the 9/11 attacks, including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes.","The brokerage firm sued American Airlines, whose Flight 11 plowed into its offices during the terrorist attacks .

Cleared: British multi-millionaire entrepreneur Gregory Cox (pictured at court this week) was today found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman, 21 . A British tycoon accused of forcing a woman to perform oral sex on him on Australia's Bondi Beach was today found not guilty. Gregory Charles Cox, 32, faced two charges of sexual intercourse without consent with a 21-year-old tourist on the iconic beach in Sydney. The holidaymaker from Bermuda claimed Cox had said: ‘You . can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never . go anywhere – I’ve got a lot of money.’ But after a trial that lasted three weeks at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, the jury found him not guilty of the two charges today. Crown Prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC had . told the court that the woman had kissed and exchanged phone . numbers with Cox’s friend Christopher Galea. The . court heard that the 21-year-old woman also spoke to Cox, who founded . his own financial services firm, about the English private school he . went to while at beachfront bar The Bucket List in January 2012. She claimed the pair then went to the beach after many hours drinking together when she . remembers Cox sitting against a concrete wall while she had her back to . the ocean. In . his opening address to the jury in May, prosecutor Huw Baker said: ‘She . recalls being on her knees and she tried to stand up but being unable . to stand up because something was holding her down,’ he said. ‘She . recalls being terrified at that point.’ Cox is then said to have forced her to perform a sex act on him. Afterwards she cried and hit Cox on the thighs as she told him: ‘Please stop, please stop – I don’t want this.’ Mr Baker said: ‘She was trying to get up but felt the accused’s hand on the back of her head.’ 'Will go nowhere': The court heard that Cox (pictured leaving court) told the woman that 'you can tell the police, you can tell whoever you like but this will never go anywhere - I've got a lot of money'. A jury today cleared him of the charges . The court was told her cries for help were later heard . by a young couple and she was taken to a police station, where officers . described her as being ‘distressed, shivering and crying’. Police were also said to have heard her say: ‘He told me over and over again that he had a lot of money.’ Cox, who founded the Manchester-based . Quintessential Finance Group, was on holiday in Australia in January last year when he met the woman. He had been staying in a luxury beach-side apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi. The businessman, who lists Peaches . Geldof among his Facebook friends, was arrested four days after the . alleged incident when he returned to the bar and was spotted by staff . who had been supplied with his description by police.

As she left her belongings on the . beach, said Mr Turnbull, Cox had handed them in to a city centre police . station, where he gave his own details. Mr Turnbull also said that his client had gone back to the Bondi beach bar to ask if anyone knew the woman. ‘If he is a rapist, is that consistent?’ he asked the court.

'Destructive force': Culture Secretary Maria Miller has slammed Labour for involving Hacked Off in political negotiations on Press regulation . Maria Miller has slammed Labour for involving the lobby group Hacked Off in political negotiations on Press regulation, saying its presence had been a destructive force creating lasting damage. Hacked Off, which campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press, was involved in late-night talks with representatives of the three main political parties in Labour leader Ed Miliband’s Commons office in March. The meeting resulted in the Government unveiling its Royal Charter to underpin a new Press regulator. The presence of Hacked Off and the exclusion of newspaper representatives led to universal rejection of the charter by publishers. Mrs Miller, the Culture Secretary, was also forced to concede that protections against political interference in the regulation of the Press could be swept away after the next election. She said a future government could  vote to override a clause demanding that a two-thirds parliamentary majority be reached before any changes are made to a Royal Charter. Mrs Miller told MPs the presence of Hacked Off at the talks this year had been a ‘hijacking of government business’. ‘I assume the Labour Party invited them to that meeting... It proved to be deeply unhelpful. We had been working very closely with [deputy Labour leader] Harriet Harman prior to that point. Labour leader: Hacked Off was involved in late-night talks in March with representatives of the three main political parties in the Commons office of Ed Miliband (pictured on Monday in Stevenage, Hertfordshire) ‘We had extensive and exhaustive meetings over some months. I had thought we got to a position... where I felt we had an effective system where we could take the Press and public with us.’ She told MPs on the Culture Select Committee that the campaigners’ presence ‘became quite a destructive force in the perception of the Press’. She said: ‘I think it made some lasting damage. We had managed to get to a stage where we were on the verge of agreement. Some of the interventions over that weekend created a great deal of bad will.’ Mrs Miller added that the presence of Hacked Off ‘wasn’t something the Prime Minister or I was willing to accept. It was a very difficult situation. ‘We were facing the very real probability of statutory Press regulation. It wasn’t something we felt was the right answer. It was absolutely philosophically the wrong thing to do.’ The Culture Secretary also addressed claims by MPs that the so-called two-thirds safeguard against political interference was a ‘parliamentary nonsense’ that senior Commons officials believe could be replaced or changed after the 2015 general election. Talks: Mrs Miller said that the presence of Hacked Off was not something that she and Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured last Friday on an East Coast train to Darlington) were 'willing to accept' Conservative Conor Burns told the committee: ‘The advice that I have had when I have gone to talk to very senior clerks is that the two-thirds is a parliamentary nonsense; that no parliament can bind a successor parliament, and that if a successor parliament wanted to amend or change or bring in a different charter, they could do that by a simple majority.’ Mrs Miller replied: ‘The principle behind that provision was to very much ensure that the charter could not be changed simply on the whim of ministers who are Privy Counsellors at the time. 'We had managed to get to a stage where we were on the verge of agreement. Some of the interventions over that weekend created a great deal of bad will' Culture Secretary Maria Miller . ‘Of course a government can pass laws, and with a simple majority in the House of Commons can change anything it wants to change, but what I think we are doing in putting that provision in place is giving Parliament a very clear ability to be able to press any government on why it might not adhere to that, and I think that is a really rather important thing to have been done.’ Last month, Mrs Miller indicated that the Royal Charter could become redundant if the industry’s new watchdog, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, proved to be successful. Asked if she had meant to make such a suggestion, Mrs Miller told MPs it was not possible to mandate Press involvement in a Royal Charter process, ‘otherwise you will be having statutory regulation’. She added: ‘I’m very pleased indeed with the progress the Press has been making in setting up Ipso and the support that is being garnered within the industry for the approach that is being taken.’","Lobby group Hacked Off campaigns for state-imposed regulation of Press .

Stepping down: Judge Sir Paul Coleridge claimed to have strong backing within the judiciary . A High Court judge, who is stepping down after being rebuked for campaigning in favour of marriage, claimed yesterday to have strong backing within the judiciary. Sir Paul Coleridge said only ‘one or two’ of his colleagues were opposed to his traditional views. He spoke out after being given a formal warning by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling for judicial misconduct. An inquiry by the Office for Judicial Complaints, the body that polices the behaviour of judges, had found his speeches and newspaper articles were ‘incompatible with his judicial responsibilities’. Last December the office advised Sir Paul to take a lower profile after he had protested about the devastating impact of family break-up on children, criticised cohabitation, and called for greater support for marriage. Sir Paul, who handles family cases as Mr Justice  Coleridge, could have served for another five years and was effectively forced out. He said: ‘I would like to refute the erroneous suggestion that my fellow judges are opposed to what I have been doing. With one or two exceptions they have been very, if quietly, supportive.’ Sir Paul said he was a whistleblower who needed to speak out against the collapse of family life. He confirmed his decision to step down as a judge in April – a resignation announced earlier this year – was linked to his public attempt to speak up for marriage. Sir Paul set up the Marriage Foundation think tank to champion the institution on a national basis and promote ‘healthy, stable relationships’. He said he strongly disagreed with the inquiry’s conclusion that his ‘occasional comments on the huge social problem of family breakdown or my public support for the Marriage Foundation amounts to misconduct or brings the judiciary into disrepute’. Campaigning: Sir Paul has protested about the devastating impact of family break-up on children, criticised cohabitation, and called for greater support for marriage (file picture) The judge added: ‘Indeed I think the contrary is true. ‘One or two members of the public may resent my intervention for their own particular reasons, hence their complaints, but, judging by the support I have received, that is not the view of the majority.’ He said his work with the think tank might be ‘unusual and unconventional for a judge’ but it had not interfered with his work in the courtroom. ‘Tackling these urgent problems calls for those of us who know more about them than anyone else occasionally to blow the whistle publicly and do something,’ Sir Paul said. 'I would like to refute the erroneous suggestion that my fellow judges are opposed to what I have been doing. With one or two exceptions they have been very, if quietly, supportive' Sir Paul Coleridge . He said he would quit the High Court at Easter, adding: ‘I could have carried on for a further five years – and been prepared to complete them – but it is not really feasible if I have to look over my shoulder every time I want publicly to support the Marriage Foundation or its work.

Gholdoian was murdered Tuesday when a suicidal gunman police now say was on a mission of violence entered the Reno hospital where he worked and opened fire . Police think a suicidal gunman was also on a mission of violence when he calmly entered a third-floor urology office and opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, killing one doctor, critically wounding another and shooting a third victim after warning patients and their children in a waiting area to ‘get out.’ Charles G. Gholdoian, 46, was shot and killed at the scene. His colleague Dr. Christine Lajeunesse and a visitor to the hospital, Shawntae Spears, 20, were each shot once, but survived. As Spears and Lajeunesse try to recover in the very hospital where they were shot, police have undertaken an investigation of the unnamed gunman, who motive eludes them thus far. ‘But the fact the shooter went through . the first and second floor, made his way to the third floor of the . building, would indicate to me it is not a random event,’ said Reno . Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzo. A . witness who was among those the shooter passed in the waiting room said . Wednesday that the Northern California man could have killed many more . people at the Reno medical complex if that was his intent. Holding on: Dr. Christine Lajeunesse, left, was a colleague of the slain Dr. Gholdoian's and was critical condition but conscious on Wednesday. Shawntae Spears, 20, (right) was shot by the 12-guage shotgun as well. Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious on Wednesday . Gun violence: the gunman turned the shotgun on himself after opening fire on the third floor of Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada . Detectives . have not been able to establish any relationship the man may have had . with the two doctors and the relative of a patient who were shot Tuesday . before the gunman killed himself. ‘While . we piece this thing together, we are trying to figure out what that . relationship is, if there is a relationship at all,’ said Chief Mac . Venzo. Innocent victim? Lajeunesse is a urologist at Urology Nevada and remained listed in critical condition on Wednesday as police struggled to determine why a still unnamed Northern California man burst into her department and shot up the place before killing himself . Gholdoian, a . urologist at Urology Nevada within the Center for Advanced Medicine on . the campus of the Renown Regional Medical Center was killed at the . scene. ‘Urology Nevada . is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred,’ the medical center . said in a statement. ‘At this time we have no information as to why . these terrible events occurred, and we are cooperating with the . authorities in every way possible to learn more.’ Dr. Michael Morkin, an emergency room surgeon and the incoming chief of . staff at Renown, where the victims were taken, said both doctors were . his friends. He described them as ‘exceptional physicians.’ ‘It is a very difficult time for the medical community,’ he told reporters. Spears' condition improved Wednesday from critical to serious, the hospital said. Friends told Reno Gazette Journal the mother of two was in good spirits Wednesday and wrote on Facebook, ‘I am OK. Message me if you want to visit.’ ‘She has two little boys and she so enjoys being a mom,’ said Spears' friend Denna Tinnin Klink. Lajeunesse was conscious Wednesday but remained in critical condition at Renown, hospital officials said. Police were withholding the name of the killer because they said they still have not been able to reach his next of kin. 'I am OK': Spears has two sons and friends say she is a deeply devoted mother. Thankfully, it appears she'll be reunited with her boys very soon . No connection? Police had yet to find a connection between the victims including Spears (left) and the unnamed shooter, who was a resident of the Northern California town of Lake Almanor . But . Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood confirmed in neighboring Northern . California on Wednesday that Reno police searched the gunman's home . Tuesday night in Lake Almanor, a small community about 130 miles north . of Reno. The search was first reported by the Reno Gazette-Journal. Hagwood said the man was a long-time resident of the community and lived alone. ‘Part . of the investigation and service of the search warrant was to help . identify next of kin,’ Hagwood told AP, adding that authorities have . established he has California relatives outside of Plumas County. He . said investigators were ‘taking every measure possible to make . notification of family as quickly as they can so they're not watching . the news and having the unsettling experience of finding out that way.’ City of Reno spokeswoman Sharon Spangler said her office could not confirm or comment on the developments. She said Wednesday night she did not anticipate any additional information would be released before Thursday. Crime scene: The shooting happened inside Centers for Advanced Medicine B on East 2nd Street, but the shooter confusingly lived 120 miles from Reno, in Lake Almanor . Bringing the big guns: SWAT team members are trucked from near the Renown helicopter pad to the Renown Medical Center on Tuesday after shots rang out around 2pm . Police said there were about 100 people in the office building when authorities were alerted at 2:05 p.m. Tuesday about an ‘active shooter.’ Venzo said investigators have talked to 29 witnesses so far, with more interviews pending. Vitalis Ozoude, a state auditor, was in the reception area of Urology Nevada with his wife and 3-year-old son waiting for his child's appointment when the gunman walked in and eventually told them and others to leave. ‘I don't think he meant to kill everybody because if he did he had ample opportunity to do that,’ Ozoude told AP. He said the dozen or so people in the waiting room didn't immediately react to the sight of a man carrying the gun because he seemed calm. ‘He looked like he belonged. I thought he worked there, and he was just getting a gun from his car or taking it to his office,’ he said. Lockdown: Police swarmed the hospital following the deadly incident . Vicki Green, another patient who said she was standing within an arm's length of the shooter at one time, said he ‘seemed calm, yet agitated at the same time.’ ‘He started swinging the gun and telling everybody in the waiting room, `You need to get out, you better get out, you should get out,'‘ Green told KRNV-TV. ‘People started picking up their stuff and their kids and running.’ Venzo said the gunman went past the front desk at the urologist's office and entered the patient examination rooms. Moving through the exam area, he fired at least four rounds from the shotgun, striking the three victims, before making his way back to the office's waiting area and turning the gun on himself, police said. The shooting comes nearly two months after a 12-year-old boy opened fire at an area middle school, killing a math teacher before killing himself. Two victims from that attack were treated at Renown Regional. The medical center also has treated . victims of other recent tragedies, including a crash at a Reno air race . in 2011 that killed 11 people and a shooting rampage at a Carson City . restaurant the same year that killed three uniformed Nevada National .

The European Parliament has blocked Tory moves to scrap its second headquarters in Strasbourg to stop the monthly travelling circus between France and Brussels. Most of the European Parliament’s work is done at a huge complex of offices and debating chambers in Brussels. But once a month 766 MEPs, their 3,000 staff, and 25 trucks carrying documents move from Brussels to Strasbourg for a week long session at a cost of £150million-a-year. Spared: The European Parliament has blocked Tory moves to scrap its second headquarters in Strasbourg (pictured) The costs and CO2 emissions have soared as the Parliament has become bigger and more powerful. The French have led opposition to the cost-saving move because the Strasbourg economy depends heavily on the monthly influx of MEPs, their officials and an army of lobbyists on fat expenses accounts. An additional £12 million would be saved on maintenance on the Strasbourg building which is empty 300 days a year. With the French economy on the verge of slipping into a triple dip recession the country’s MEPs are desperate to protect the historic and economic importance of the town ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. Hotels in Strasbourg are known to double or even triple their costs during the parliament’s sessions. Strasbourg symbolises the European reconciliation after the Second World War as Germany is on the opposite bank of the river. Upheaval: Once a month 766 MEPs, their 3,000 staff, and 25 trucks carrying documents move from Brussels (pictured) to Strasbourg for a week long session at a cost of £150-million-a-year . Last year the French government, which . has plumbed record lows in popularity as the economy hovers close to . triple dip recession, took legal action when MEPs tried to cut the . number of sessions in Strasbourg each year. Only . last week a report by the British Tory MEP Ashley Fox was adopted by . 483 votes to 141 in favour of ending the link with Strasbourg on cost . and efficiency grounds. But the parliament’s Constitutional committee, in a closed session, quietly this week shelved the report. With the eurozone also in a deep recession MEPs were trying to put an end to the cost of having two parliamentary bases and to use Brussels as the sole HQ. There are a further 2.400 staff working in Luxembourg. More than one million EU citizens have signed a petition calling for the Parliament to be restricted to Brussels. Headquarters: Inside the European Parliament building in Brussels . Ashley Fox, the Tory MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, whose report was accepted by three quarters of MEPs, said: ‘The vote this week is very disappointing. ‘Rotating between two different countries costs at least £150 million a year and is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers’ money.  Over the parliament’s seven-year long term budget this will in fact cost taxpayers a staggering £928 million. In hard economic times, there are so many better things that could be spent on rather than empty buildings and needless and often complex journeys.’ The transport alone to Strasbourg creates an estimated 19,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. ‘Think how foolish the parliament looks when it allows this while lecturing its citizens about climate change,’ said Mr Fox. ‘The French led the opposition as they are desperate to stop this happening before the European elections in May when the ruling Socialists are going to be hammered because of the state of their economy.’ Dan Hannan, a fellow British Tory MEP, said: ‘The principle that the European Parliament should meet in just one place is a small thing – a tiny thing, when we consider the billions squandered in regional, structural and agricultural boondoggles. But, in the current economic climate, saving £150 million a year matters.‘ . But one French MEP Constance le Grip defended Strasbourg’s role. ‘You are turning your backs on the history and the founding principles of the EU,’ she said.","Most of the European Parliament's work is done in offices in Belgium .

More than 30 million  people are in work for  the first time in British  history after a further fall in unemployment was revealed yesterday. David Cameron claimed that the Government’s economic plan ‘is working’ as unemployment fell by 99,000 in the three months to October, reducing the jobless rate from 7.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent, the lowest level since 2009. There were drops in almost every region outside the South –  especially the West Midlands, the North West and the East. The unemployment rate fell to 0.74 per cent in the three months to October, down 0.3 percentage points on May to July . However, if the trend continues and . unemployment falls to 7 per cent, interest rates could be allowed to . rise by the Bank of England from their current record low of 0.5 per . cent. Millions of . homeowners would then see their monthly mortgage repayments start to . rise, although experts believe this is unlikely to happen before 2015. There are now 2.39 million out of work after the largest quarterly fall in more than a decade. The . number of people in work reached 30.09 million – an increase of 250,000 . over the quarter and of almost half a million compared with a year ago. There were 30.09 million people in employment aged 16 and over, up 250,000 from May to July 2013 and up 485,000 from a year earlier . For the first time 10 per cent of over-65s are still in work, the Office for National Statistics said . A record 1.1 million pensioners are still working into retirement years, official figures showed yesterday. With the employment rate jumping from 9.2 per cent a year ago to 10 per cent, this equates to another 109,000 OAP workers, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘People are living longer, so many want to carry on working. However rock-bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they cannot afford to retire.’ Mr . Cameron said: ‘There should not be one ounce of complacency because we . have still got work to do to get our country back to work, and everyone . back in work means greater stability for them, greater ability to plan . for their future, greater help for their families. But the plan is working, let’s stick at it and get unemployment down even further.’ The . number unemployed for more than 12 months fell by 33,000 to 866,000, . the lowest rate for a year, while youth unemployment dipped by 19,000 to . 941,000. And the . number claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance fell by 36,700 in November to . 1.27 million, the thirteenth consecutive monthly reduction. The Prime Minister told the Commons 1.2 million more people were in work than when the Coalition came to power in 2010. But Labour leader Ed Miliband seized on figures showing a record 1.47 million were working part-time. ‘It’s . good our economy is creating more jobs, but the problem is too many of . them are part-time or low paid or insecure,’ he said.

Robert Ekaireb, who is accused of murdering his pregnant wife Li Hua Cao, arriving at the Old Bailey . A 'paranoid' millionaire accused of murdering his pregnant wife did not to tell police about bank statements 'proving' she was alive for five years, the Old Bailey heard today. The jury heard the 'paranoid' 38-year-old, who suffered from OCD and depression, claimed the letters were proof his missing wife Li Hua Cao was still alive. But he claims he failed to hand them over to police, because he did not like the detective in charge of the investigation. The 38-year-old allegedly murdered his wife when he flew into a jealous rage at their home in Hampstead, north London. He wanted Li Hua to take a lie detector test to prove the paternity of her unborn baby. The property developer spent the night at a nightclub in Londonâ€™s West End after she vanished, before arranging for their luxury flat to be be redecorated, professionally cleaned and recarpeted the next day. Ekaireb claims that she had packed her . bags and left him for a better life - but she has not been seen alive . since October 23, 2006. The couple moved into at a luxury one-bed apartment at Pavilion Court in the Mount Vernon complex, a private gated community in Hampstead, north London, at the beginning of August 2006, the court heard. Despite only living there for three months, Ekarieb allegedly undertook extensive cleaning and decorating, even hiring professional marble cleaners to ensure the flat was spotless. He also fitted new cream carpets which were identical to the original ones - and then could not remember doing it, the jury were told. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'When he was asked by the police about work done to the apartment, although saying he recalled he had the place professionally cleaned as a condition of the letting he claimed to have completely forgotten about the re-carpeting and he flatly denied having any other work done to the flat.' The carpets were so similar, that the . previous owner was not able to distinguish any difference from . photographs shown to him by the police. It emerged Ekaireb also owned a three-bedroom apartment on the same gated estate. He . had lived there with his Slovakian ex-lover Martina Kamenistiakova . before abandoning the property when their relationship ended. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and re-decorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared . 'Gainsborough House was kept locked by him and resembled a time capsule when police entered it six years later, rather than a shrine to a lost romance,' said Mr Altman. When police first entered that property in February last year the apartment, which had not been rented out for years, was 'in a state of deep freeze', the prosecutor explained. 'They found the place as it was when the defendant had last left it, even to the point of items of food being left uneaten or half-eaten,' he said. Nearby: Ekarieb also owned a three-bedroom apartment in Gainsborough House (pictured), which is part of the same gated complex in north London . 'And although the defendant had provided the security men on the estate with the keys for all the properties, they never had the keys for Gainsborough House.' Li Hua's family had made contact with that address after her disappearance believing she was living there. 'We know the defendant had access to two apartments in two blocks for his own private purposes,' said Mr Altman. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007 . 'If he killed her it took place in private where there were no eye witnesses and no one to tell tales.' After his wife's disappearance, Ekaireb kept computer generated bank letters as 'dynamite' proof she was still alive. He only handed the letters from HSBC to the police five years after Li Hua went missing, it was said. Mr . Altman said the letters were sent to Gainsborough House 'a few weeks . after she had disappeared' from her bank advising her they were going . to close her account as they mistakenly believed the Chinese passport . she used to set up the account had expired. 'He thought it was dynamite - showing 'my wife is alive and well',' said Mr Altman. Ekaireb . said he did not hand in the letters because he disliked a detective . working on the investigation, claiming he was 'obstructive and . unhelpful'. But Mr Altman dismissed this as 'a lame excuse'. But . when Li Hua visited him in London on a tourist visa, he did not allow . her to sleep at Gainsborough House because 'to him that didn't feel . right'. It was said that Li Hua's principal ambition was to marry a wealthy man who could support a lavish lifestyle and send money to her family in China. The couple met at the lapdancing club where Li Hua was working in Ireland in late 2005. They married on October 4, 2006, by which time the 27-year-pld was already pregnant. But Li Hua had become disillusioned with her marriage and the 'superficiality of her married existence' and repeatedly attempted to leave Ekaireb who was growing paranoid and jealous. Ekaireb was so paranoid about his wife cheating on him that he tried to hire a private investigator and set up a lie detector test, the court heard. He made an appointment for a test at 3pm on October 9, 2006 but either cancelled or did not turn up, it is claimed. On 28 August Ekaireb assaulted Li Hua in public after an argument on the way home from a restaurant, the jury were told. A passer-by called police and officers found Li Hua in East Finchley Food and Wine with cuts and grazes to both arms. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007 . She claimed that Ekaireb pushed her to the ground after they rowed about her past and him smoking in the car while she was pregnant. Li Hua told her sister that Ekaireb's father Rex had persuaded her to withdraw her allegation of assault, jurors heard. Ekaireb told police that Li Hua fell over after kicking him. Li Hau was 22 weeks pregnant when she 'simply vanished' on Monday 23 October 2006, jurors were told and no record of a birth has been discovered. Phone records show that Li Hau contacted her brother Li Bin Cao in Denmark earlier that day but never contacted him or her family in China again. Ekaireb allegedly arrived back at Pavilion Court at 11.07pm and at 11.44pm he rang his parents' home. He then phoned the manager's office at Club Tantra nightclub at around 1am before heading there in the early hours. That was the last phone call ever made from the flat, the court heard. He also made no attempts to track down his wife or report her disappearance to police, the court heard. Li Hau was finally reported missing by her brother in February 2007 but no evidence has been found that she is alive. In 2010 the investigation being taken over by a team from the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police. The court heard Ekaireb was too embarrassed about meeting Li Hua at the lap-dancing club in Cork to introduce her to his mother. 'He did not want to lie to his mother about the circumstances in which they met,' Mr Altman said. They married in a Chinese wedding ceremony after Ekaireb gave her a wedding ring which he claimed was worth Â£10,000. But he looked down on her family, who originated from a fishing village. He reportedly said:'They had no sign of money, no sign of finesse, no sign of class'. Ekaireb, of Corrigan Close, Hendon, northwest London, denies murder.

It was the first day the market grew following three losing sessions.

Applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since September. The number of applications is close to where it was before the Great Recession. The Dow rose 109 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,010 Thursday. Although investors remain unsure about the timing of the Federal Reserve's scaling back of its $85 billion per month in bond buying, some say the market will weather the eventual pullback in that stimulus. Investors largely believe markets are due to pull back, even though the rally may continue, thanks to the Fed. The U.S. central bank has said repeatedly that it will not withdraw support until the economy can stand on its own. A combination of a growing economy and Fed support gives investors a good reason to buy stocks, Steven Einhorn, vice chairman of Omega Advisors, told the Summit.

There is ‘a whole host of things the Fed can do to mitigate and moderate the sting’ of a pullback in bond buying, Einhorn said. That includes more forward guidance for markets, which the members of the Federal Open Market Committee discussed during their most recent meeting, minutes released on Wednesday showed. The annual inflation rate is at 1 percent, below the Fed's target of 2 percent. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting member of the FOMC, said on Thursday that the inflation data gives the central bank some leeway to keep the current accommodative policy in place. ‘What we need to do is continue with the program for now as we have, but if an inflation problem starts to develop, we have to be willing to move to arrest that problem,’ Bullard told a University of Arkansas event. ‘At that point, I'd put on my inflation hawk hat and spring into action.’ Expectations that the Fed could start . cutting stimulus - but without raising interest rates - have helped to . widen the spread between long- and short-run debt.

A rough and tumble Cincinnati Reds baseball star who killed himself after years of mental instability suffered from trauma-induced brain disease, researchers revealed Sunday. The Boston University School of Medicine announced that former fan favorite Ryan Freel, 36, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, making him the first major league baseball player diagnoses with the illness. The concussion prone father of three, who was forced into early retirement in 2009 after eight seasons of repeated head and body injuries, died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 2012 and researchers diagnosed him after running post-mortem tests. Scroll down for video... Suffered: Ryan Freel, who suffered from mental issues and drug problems in the years leading to his 2012 suicide, suffered from concussion-related  degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy . Freel is now the first MLB star diagnosed with CTE, a disease that has increasingly become a plague to former pro football players. ‘The real important issue is that he hit his head multiple times--small hits, big hits, in baseball and outside of baseball,’ Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University, told CNN. Freel showed no fear as he ran into walls, hurtled into the seats and crashed into other players trying to make catches. His jarring, diving grabs often made the highlight reels, and he was praised by those he played with and against for always having a dirt-stained uniform. Rough and tumble: Freel became known during his 8 season career for his daring dives and cringe-inducing tumbles on the field. He suffered at least 10 concussions as a major leaguer . Brain disease: The daring right-fielder killed himself in December 2012. Post-mortem tests led researchers at Boston University to announce Sunday they'd discovered he suffered from the disease . In May of 2007, he was in center field when he collided with right fielder Norris Hopper's elbow on—an injury that caused Freel to be taken off the field in an ambulance. Freel sustained a concussion that caused headaches and an impaired memory, and he didn't return until early July. It was one of ten concussions Freel once said he suffered in total while a major leaguer.CTE is a progressive disease linked to multiple concussions. It has made headlines in recent years with the deaths of some former professional athletes, and lawsuits filed against the NFL by others worried about the still unclear toll of a sport that can bring repeated blows to the head. Symptoms include memory problems, behavior changes including aggression, and eventually dementia. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the progressive accumulation of a protein called tau in nerve cells within certain regions of the brain. The effects of protein accumulation are often seen amongst boxers and football players, or anyone who's suffered multiple head trauma - and it often disturbs brain function. Freel is the first pro baseball player, a sport less associated with concussions, to be diagnosed with the disease. 'Baseball is just as dangerous,' said Freel's mother. Pictured: Brain tissue from a normal brain (left), a football player (center), and a champion boxer (right) with severe dementia. The brown areas are buildups of tau protein deposits, which are linked to head trauma and concussions . Freel suffered from depression and alcohol and drug abuse problems in the years leading to his death, reports CNN. Freel raised more than a few eyebrows in 2006 when he was quoted by the Dayton Daily News as saying he had an imaginary friend, Farney. ‘He's a little guy who lives in my head who talks to me and I talk to him,’ Freel said. ‘Everybody thinks I talk to myself, so I tell 'em I'm talking to Farney.’ He was arrested in northern Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, in April 2005 and was charged with drunken driving, careless driving and driving with an open container in a motor vehicle. A month later, he pleaded guilty. More common in football: Former Kansas City Chiefs' linebacker Jovan Belcher's body was exhumed Friday, more than a year after he killed his girlfriend and himself so that his brain can be examined for signs of the degenerative condition linked to repeated concussions . The NFL has reached a $765 million settlement in August over concussion-related brain injuries among its 18,000 retired players, agreeing to compensate victims, pay for medical exams and underwrite research. Plaintiffs included Junior Seau (pictured here with George W Bush), who suffered from CTE . The following January, he was arrested at a pool hall in Tampa, Fla., and charged with disorderly intoxication, a misdemeanor. Prosecutors settled the case by having Freel do community service. And months before his death, Freel and his wife of 11 years were divorced. ‘It provides some solace that there is a reason now for Ryan having done what he did,’ Freel’s stepfather Clark Vargas told CNN. ‘Knowing that he's been suffering for 11 years and that CTE is a progressive disease, it gives explanation (for) some of the irrational things that he may have done. You know, he had a reason.’ Freel’s mother Norma Vargas echoed her husband’s sentiment and hopes the revelation their father was suffering from a disease might cushion the blow for Freel’s three bereaved daughters. ‘He's gone no matter what,’ Norma Vargas said. ‘But I want that closure for his daughters.’","Post-mortem tests have revealed Ryan Freel suffered from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy .

A single mother was devastated to discover the man she planned to marry was actually a con artist who stole from her to pay for his wedding to another woman. Stephen Sutton, 48, swept Dawn Rothwell, 46, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, off her feet after they met online in May 2011 and they soon became engaged. But she told The Mirror she was stunned when she found out their relationship was based on a 'pack of lies' and he actually had three other fiancees. Conned: Dawn Rothwell believed her fiance had a brain tumour but his 'hospital visits' gave him an excuse to see another woman . One of his shocking betrayals involved telling Dawn he had a brain tumour so he wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with her. She explains: 'I was horrified. He told . me his only hope was Proton therapy in the States straight away. Christmas disappeared. All I wanted was for him to get better.' But while Dawn spent Christmas 2011 praying Stephen would survive his treatment, he was actually 20 miles away enjoying dinner with his other fiancee - Beverley Wright, 59. Jailed: Stephen Sutton stole from Dawn to pay for his wedding to Beverley Wright . Beverley and Dawn had no idea they were both engaged to the father-of-two, who they later discovered also had another two fiancees. When Dawn saw Sutton after Christmas he lied that the treatment in the U.S. hadn't worked and he now needed chemotherapy. She believes he even shaved his head to make it appear he was losing his hair. He also convinced Dawn she would need to care for his sons, aged six and 12, after his death. She said: 'He seemed to be in hospital . for weeks, texting most days, saying how much he loved me. But even . after he was supposedly discharged he claimed he didn't feel ready to . see me.' All the time she thought Sutton was getting life-saving treatment, he was actually with his other women. He married Beverley in March 2012 and in another blow to Dawn, paid for the wedding using money he had stolen from her. Dawn, who has two children from a previous relationship, had given Sutton valuable family heirlooms to look after. He used her £30,000 jewellery collection to fund his nuptials, telling his other bride that he had found the bag of gold in his father's attic. Dawn said: 'It was mainly family heirlooms - . hundreds of pieces, including solid gold necklaces, earrings and diamond . rings. He warned me I shouldn't leave it lying around in case I got . burgled. I knew he was right. It had a lot of sentimental value too. Most of it could never be replaced. So when he offered to store it in . his safe, I let him.' Around the time Sutton married Beverley, Dawn finally suspected he was up to no good but still believed his tumour was the reason they were 'drifting apart'. She arranged to meet him to end their relationship and get her valuables back but the jewellery boxes he returned were virtually empty. Betrayed: Dawn had no idea Stephen and Beverley, pictured, had married - or that he used her family heirlooms to pay for it . She recalled: 'There were only a few cheap brooches left. All my family heirlooms had gone. Even the 'I Love Nanny' necklace my grandson had given me had vanished. Stephen had taken the lot. I went straight to the police.' Sutton was arrested and charged with theft. He pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court last April and jailed for two years. The judge told him he had carried out a 'cruel and persistent deception' adding he had played with Dawn's emotions 'to deflect her attention from the theft.' Equally shocked: Beverley didn't know about Dawn and said she's angry Stephen 'pulled the wool over my eyes' Dawn said she's glad Sutton is now behind bars so he 'can't con anyone else'. It was only in court that she discovered he had never been ill and had three other women. His wife, care assistant Beverley, was equally stunned to discover she was not Sutton's one and only and they are now getting divorced. She told the Mirror: 'I felt completely humiliated. I was disgusted in him but I more angry with myself. I'd let him pull the wool over my eyes and the more I thought about it, the more clues I’d ignored.'","Stephen Sutton swept Dawn Rothwell off her feet after they met online .

Left lying on the floor as the elevator door closed again and again on her, Waters survived - but is now paralyzed and is at the forefront of a state campaign to get cyberstalking recognized as part of protective orders in Kentucky. Arriving back home to live with her parents in Florence, Waters is now waiting for her father to finish converting the garage to help with her new disability. Reflecting on the morning when she was shot, Waters told WCPO that her husband of five-years appeared from nowhere brandishing a firearm. 'I remember everything,' said Waters. 'I remember turning around, seeing him standing there with a gun pointed at me.' Pleading with Mathis by using his nickname, DJ, Waters remembered that sadly it had no effect on her husband.

Reason to live: Alisha barely survived the attempt on her life - but is desperate now to make sure that she gets an amendment to domestic violence legislation in Kentucky . 'The next thing I know, he started firing.' said Waters whose spinal cord was severed by one of her husband's volleys. Before: Alisha and her husband split after five-years of marriage - this image was taken before her shooting . Her husband unleashed four shots at her and then walked up to her in the elevator and fired one more shot. 'He fired one more shot and I remember looking back and seeing him put the gun to his head,' said Waters. 'I put my head down and the next thing I knew the medics were there.' Before the shooting, Waters had faced the terrifying and relentless attentions of her husband - which followed their separation. Mathis had texted Waters 186 times in two weeks before she sought an emergency protection order, but a judge refused because cyberstalking is not grounds for a domestic violence order in Kentucky. If the judge had granted the order then Mathis would have been prevented from buying the gun in the store the very day before he shot her. Strangely, Waters has sought to justify her husband's actions that day, by claiming that he had been declining to take his anti-depression medication. 'No. The D.J. I knew was a good person,' Alisha said. Attack: Alisha was shot at work in an ambush by her estranged husband Dennis Mathis . Back at home, Waters and her family are battling for the creation of the Alisha Waters Law. They want domestic violence laws changed to include cyberstalking. Waters believes she is meant to advocate for the increased protection. 'I’m always thinking about the Alisha Waters bill,' she said. 'I feel the need to protect other women – and men, for that matter – that in the future may get in the same position I found myself in,' said Waterst to Cincinnati.Com.

Charged: Robert Dellinger, pictured, . slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway, killing two people . A former Fortune 500 executive who plowed his car into an SUV killing a pregnant woman and her fiance in a botched suicide attempt last week could be charged with murder. Robert Dellinger, 53, told police he was depressed and aiming to kill himself when he drove his full-size pick-up truck across a grassy median on Interstate 89 in North Hampshire, went airborne and crushed to death a young Vermont couple expecting their first child in January. Dellinger, from Sunapee, survived the suicide attempt with cuts on his head and face. He was charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, a crime that carries 15-30 years in prison if convicted. But what was going through Dellinger's mind and whether he showed 'extreme indifference' to human life could get him a more serious charge of second-degree murder that carries up to life in prison. Jason Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, suffered injuries a medical examiner said were consistent with a plane crash. The unborn child did not survive. Veteran defense attorney and University of New Hampshire law school professor Albert Scherr said he has no doubt prosecutors are considering elevating the charges to murder, but hastened to add there's little precedent for a case like Dellinger's. 'It's such strange and outrageous behavior. There's a vacuum in terms of the details of what was in his mind,' Scherr said. 'If he's focused on committing suicide, is he thinking about other people's lives? Or does it fall closer to driving really fast and hoping you go so fast you go off the road and kill yourself and you're not thinking about anyone else?' Tragic: Dellinger is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the horrific crash, which left 29-year-old Jason Timmons, left, 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, right, and their unborn baby dead . Reagan: An ultrasound shows Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons' unborn baby, who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell said last week they are considering additional charges against Dellinger, who left as a senior vice president and chief financial officer of PPG Industries in 2011 because of health issues. He had also worked for Sprint, Delphi and General Electric. Asked why Dellinger wasn't charged with second-degree murder at the outset, Morrell said, 'We're still collecting evidence. We examine the evidence and pursue the appropriate charges.' Dellinger has not been charged in connection with the loss of the fetus. Former Governor John Lynch in 2012 vetoed legislation that would have expanded the state's homicide laws to include the death of a fetus eight weeks or older. Dellinger's lawyer, Peter DeCato, did not return calls seeking comment. Dellinger, who lives in Sunapee but maintains a home in Kansas, is free on $250,000 cash bond and must wear an electronic monitoring device and undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Prosecutors said in court on . Wednesday that Dellinger's truck crossed the median on Interstate 89 . early afternoon on December 7, became airborne and sheared off the top . of the couple's car, killing them instantly. According . to prosecutors, Dellinger told troopers after the crash that he had . argued with his wife over medication he was taking for depression and . was driving around when he decided to commit suicide. 'He told us that Saturday in the hospital that he intended to cross that median at a high rate of speed,' Morrell said. Father: According to Valley News, Timmons, pictured, was a father of three children, including this child . Angry: Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter . Attorney Jonathan Cohen, who is not involved in Dellinger's case, said it's not a stretch to think prosecutors may seek to increase the charges once all the evidence is in. 'I think a prosecutor could make the argument to a jury that intentionally driving your car across the median of a roadway manifests an extreme indifference to human life,' Cohen said. He'll have to stay in New Hampshire despite a request by his lawyer to allow him to travel for mental health treatment in Kansas, where he has property. Timmons and Murphy got engaged in March this year, according to Timmons' Facebook account. They lived in Wilder, Vermont, and met while working at valley Terrace Assisted Living Facility. Timmons has three children from another relationship, Faith, Aubrey and Gavin Timmons. He enjoyed the outdoors, especially fishing with his fiance, the Valley News reported. Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter. Blanchard's girlfriend wrote on his behalf on December 8: 'As some of you may already know we lost two amazing individuals that we were so blessed to be apart of their lives ..we also lost the chance to meet lil Raegan .. Jasons brother Ray is unable to respond but my kids and I will send him your thoughts if anyone would like to write to him please feel free I will give you his address.... RIP !!! Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy .... We all love you so much !!' Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was arraigned by video at Lebanon . District Court in New Hampshire on Wednesday on two counts of manslaughter . Amanda Murphy was very excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their daughter Reagan Elizabeth. Catherine Amarante, executive director at the care facility, where Murphy was lead caregiver said of the pair, 'He certainly was very, very loving, as was she. She really wanted to have this baby.' She added to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the facility held a baby shower for Murphy last Wednesday and she was 'glowing.' 'So it's shocking. We're still in shock,' she said. 'We deal with death in elders, and that's hard in and of itself, but this is totally different.' Amarante said Murphy was trustworthy, intuitive, and worked well with dementia patients. Timmons was 'a gentle giant.' 'Just a big tall guy and a really, really good caregiver and really loved by the patients and staff,' she said.","Robert Dellinger, 53, is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in the December 7 crash, but could be charged with second-degree murder .

While some phones continue to function . after being immersed in liquid, many often go on to fail in the weeks . that follow as mineral deposits that have got inside the phone corrode . its motherboard. The young businessman’s enterprising background has already seen him hailed as ‘the next Alan Sugar’ and his easy-to-use creation impressed dragon Kelly Hoppen MBE in the Den. She said: 'I have every faith in Oliver’s passion for Reviveaphone and believe the product he has created is a must-have for any household with a mobile phone. 'The major appeal is that it fixes your drowned smartphone without the need for you to mess around dismantling the thing. It’s just a case of popping it in a bag with solution.' Fixed: The product could potentially save unlucky mobile phone owners from expensive insurance claims . Mr Murphy’s skills for fixing broken phones emerged as a schoolboy, and alongside studying, he became a young eBay entrepreneur, buying damaged phones in bulk and selling the units he restored for a profit online. He hit on the idea for Reviveaphone during a ski season when his solution was able to fix phones that had been damaged from being dropped in the snow. Mr Murphy's skills for fixing broken phones emerged as a schoolboy. He has now received backing from Dragons' Den . Reviveaphone was launched online last summer and soon began attracting around 200 customers a month on Amazon, Ebay and its own website. Mr Murphy is one of the youngest Dragons’ Den candidates to secure investment. 'I’m made-up that Kelly has invested in me,' he said. 'I know she’s a very creative person and has worked with other young entrepreneurs through the Prince’s Trust so I was really hoping she’d see the potential returns for a product like Reviveaphone. 'There is nothing else like this on the market and I can’t wait to spread the word. 'People will never stop dropping their phones down the loo, in the bath - wherever - and this is a much more convenient and economical way of repairing them than dealing with insurance companies and paying excess fees.' Reviveaphone can work up to a month after the initial damage, but Mr Murphy advises turning the phone off and using the product as soon as possible after it gets wet, and not using the phone until is completely dry. As well as repairing mobiles and smartphones, Reviveaphone can fix other electronic devices that have come been immersed in liquid, including cameras, MP3 players and mini tablets.

And their position as man’s best friend is getting stronger all the time – because their ability  to understand and predict human behaviour  is actually growing with each generation, according to animal psychologists. A study from the University of Abertay in Dundee shows that a dog’s ability to understand humans is innate and does not depend on training. Animal psychologists say dogs are evolving their ability to understand and predict human behaviour . It is a result of breeding and genetic selection, so it will only get more advanced in the future. Scientists observed how 24 dogs, . ranging from the highly trained to the totally untrained, reacted to . people’s unspoken commands, such as pointing at a location for the dog . to move to. They found the dogs’ training levels made no difference to . their responsiveness. Dr Clare Cunningham, who led the study published . in the journal Animal Cognition, said: ‘We found that training levels didn’t . make any difference - no matter how well trained they were, it did not . make their ability to pick up cues better or worse. ‘What made the difference was . whether they were familiar with the human who was giving the cues. ‘As . they get to know particular humans, they pay more attention to them and . this may mean they can read and even predict human behaviour with more . efficiency as familiarity grows.’ She . added: ‘If such abilities can be passed on from one generation to the . next, then over time we will see them getting better and better and . better at predicting human behaviour.’ The unspoken commands included pointing to or gazing at a location for the dogs to move to, and recording how they reacted. Dr Cunningham, who co-wrote the paper with her colleague Mari Ramos, said: ‘Dogs have been selected through the domestication process to accept humans as social partners and as such, are very good at attending to their behaviour. ‘If such abilities can be passed on from one generation to the next than over time we will see them getting better and better and better at predicting human behaviour.’","Study was led by scientists at the University of Abertay, Dundee .

Your Facebook posts and the pages you like already give away a lot about you including what music you listen to, or your favourite restaurant. But now researchers are using people’s Facebook photos to identify what sub-culture they belong to, from goths and bikers to hipsters and surfers. They have created an algorithm that can identify certain elements associated with each of these groups, such as distinctive tattoos, hats and jewellery, before scanning other photos to find similar people. By scanning photos for elements commonly associated with certain sub-cultures, including bikers, hipsters, goths, and surfers, researchers could categorise Facebook photos into each of these groups. The results could one day be used by advertisers to customise ads online . Researchers used a so-called ‘multi-label classification algorithm’. The algorithm scans photos that have already been tagged, and looks for identifying features. For example, if a picture is tagged as ‘dog’, it will pick out the shapes and sizes of objects in the image. It will then scan other photos looking for similar features and elements that match, or closely resemble, the original dog. The software assumes that the new image contains similar elements as the original image and tags it with the same label. This is called a ‘parts and attributes’ approach. The University of California researchers used this model to scan photos of elements most commonly associated with different sub-cultures. It started by scanning the head, neck and arms for tattoos. It then checked for certain haircuts or jewellery, as well as the type of clothing and the colours the subjects wore. These results could then be used by advertisers and websites to customise the type of content these people see, or the products they’re more likely to buy.

It is already used by certain photo editing software, for example, to help tag and categorise images.

It started by scanning the head, neck and arms of the sample images for tattoos. It then checked for certain haircuts or jewellery, as well as the type of clothing and the colours the subjects wore, as well as poses. According to the algorithm, hipsters, for example, may wear glasses, have longer hair and beards. Photos of Goths may predominantly feature the colour black and there may be tattoos or piercings. Bikers are either stood near bikes, wearing bandanas or certain types of jackets or are in more urban environments. Whereas surfers stand in more relaxed poses, for example, and wear shirts over T-shirts as well as caps. The software uses a 'multi-label classification' algorithm that is often used in photo-editing programs to help tag and organise images.

They also looked at identifying ‘Formal photos’ by suits and long dresses, and the way groups of people pose in quite rigid, uniform stances. Unfortunately, the researchers claim that the algorithm is only accurate in 48 per cent of cases and only correctly identified groups in 9 per cent. This means that it is unlikely to be used by websites any time soon without the software being enhanced. According to members of the Urban Tribes project: 'Image sharing via social networks has produced exciting opportunities for the computer vision community in areas including face, text, product and scene recognition. 'People can guess plenty of implicit information from the visual aspect of a group of people, but what can we automatically determine about the social subculture to which these people may belong? 'We propose a framework that integrates state-of-the art person and face detection and uses low- and mid-level features to capture the visual attributes distinctive to a variety of social groups.'","The software uses what’s called a ‘multi-label classification algorithm’

A study found that mothers routinely underestimate the height of their youngest child, in a phenomenon that may also explain why an older brother or sister often seems to grow up overnight on the birth of a sibling. The Australian researchers began by asking more than 700 mothers if their child had  suddenly seemed bigger on the birth of a brother or sister. More than 70 per cent said this was the case. The study found most mothers underestimated the height of their youngest child by almost 3 inches but accurately estimated how tall their oldest child was . To work out why, the Swinburne . University of Technology team asked a second group of women to estimate . the height of one of their children and mark it on the wall. The . children, aged between two and six, were then measured and the results . compared with the estimates. Mothers got the height of elder children . roughly right, but underestimated the height of their youngest children . by three inches on average. Study . author Jordy Kaufman said: ‘The key implication is that we may treat . our youngest child as if they are actually younger than they really are. ‘Our research potentially . explains why the “baby of the family” never outgrows the label. To the . parents, the baby of the family may always be “the baby”.’’ The . researchers say their results show the perception that the eldest child . suddenly appears bigger on the birth of a second child cannot simply be . explained away by everything looking big compared to the newborn. Australian scientists set out to uncover why it feels to many parents that their firstborn seems suddenly grown-up and bigger once they have brought a newborn baby home . Instead, parents seems to be subject to a ‘baby illusion’, in which they . perceive the youngest child as being more fragile than he or she really . is, and so the older child instantly seems bigger. The . study’s authors said: ‘This isn’t happening just because the older . child looks so big compared to the baby, it happens because all along . the parents were under an illusion that their first child was smaller . than he or she really was. 'When the new baby is born, the spell is . broken and parents see their older child as he or she really is.’ The . journal Current Biology reports that the mental trick could be nature’s . way of ensuring the youngest child gets the care it needs when it is at . its most vulnerable.

Little is known about what causes the disorder, but experts hope Ella will grow out of it before she reaches adulthood. Ella's mother Charlotte said: 'I just want to take her pain away, but even a hug can make it feel worse for her' Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a poorly understood condition in which a person develops a persistent burning pain. The pain usually develops after a minor injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what a person would normally expect. The skin of the affected body part can become very sensitive, and even the slightest touch, bump, or change in temperature can provoke a feeling of intense pain. If left untreated, the pain can spread to other parts of the body. In some cases of CRPS the pain passes after a few weeks but it can persist for months or even years. The cause of CRPS is unknown but the condition appears linked to an abnormal brain response to injury. It appears something causes certain nerves to misfire in some way triggering pain, but scientists are not sure what. A combination of physical therapy, medication - such as anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers - as well as emotional support to help people cope with the pain, are usually prescribed as treatment. SOURCE: NHS Choices . Ella lives in the village of Langport, near Yeovil, Somerset with her mother Charlotte, 44, and her father Shaun, 45, a website support technician. Mrs Murphy, who works in a premature baby unit, said: ‘The pain can come on because she has knocked herself or it can develop by itself or through stress. ‘She has had it in a variety of places including her hips, shoulder, knees, and currently it is in her ankle so she is using crutches and a wheelchair to get around. ‘The pain can last from days and weeks to months and the only way to get through it is to make sure she keeps moving, as if she doesn’t it can spread.’ Mrs Murphy explained the condition is especially horrible as she instinctively wants to give Ella a cuddle to make her feel better, but she is unable to hug her when she has pain in her upper body. ‘I just want to take her pain away but even a hug can make it feel worse for her,’ she said. ‘She is currently using crutches and a wheelchair to get around as the pain is in her ankles so luckily I can cuddle her at the moment, but that can change on a regular basis. 'As soon as the pain is in her arm or anywhere like that, we have to be so careful,’ she added.

Consultants could face the sack for refusing to work at weekends as part of a shake-up ordered by the NHS’s top doctor. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh also plans to impose fines of around £12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care on Saturdays and Sundays. The changes are being brought in after research published in the summer showed that 4,400 lives are being lost needlessly in hospitals every year because of a lack of senior doctors and because key scans and tests are not carried out. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh plans to impose fines of around £12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care at the weekends . Patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday rather than on a Wednesday, another study found. But for certain operations it can be much higher. Other research showed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend rather than on a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die. At weekends, patients are usually left under the care of junior doctors who may only have a few months’ experience with one or two consultants ‘on-call’ answering their mobile phones from home. Yesterday senior doctors refused to confirm whether they will ask for more money to work weekends although many believe they deserve higher hourly rates. The British Medical Association, their union, is holding talks with NHS officials about changes to consultants’ contracts. BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter would not discuss details of these negotiations but pointed out that hourly rates for nurses and other staff who work weekends is far more attractive. Sir Bruce, the medical director of NHS . England, wants to remove a key clause in consultants’ contracts that . allows them to opt out of non-urgent weekend work. Patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday rather than a Wednesday and for some operations it can be even higher . This would mean they would be . sacked for refusing to work at this time, although officials said this . would only be in the worst circumstances. Hospitals that fail to have enough . consultants working over the weekend or to provide X-rays, ultrasound . scans and other key tests could also be fined up to 2.5 per cent of . their annual income from the NHS. A typical hospital gets £500million a . year so the maximum penalty would be £12.5million. The plans – which will be rolled out . over the next three years – will mean all patients admitted to hospital . will see a consultant within 14 hours. Some currently wait three days if . they come in on a Friday. Critically-ill . patients will have X-rays, heart scans, MRI scans or blood tests within . one hour, urgent cases within 12 hours and everyone else within 24 . hours. Sir Bruce, NHS . England’s medical director who is also a heart surgeon, said: ‘It seems . strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a Friday . afternoon and warm up on a Sunday while operating theatres are empty, . outpatient clinics echo, expensive diagnostic kit isn’t being used and . in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment. ‘When those patients are admitted they get a diagnosis quicker and the appropriate treatment is started more quickly.’ Maria De Jesus died after surgeons removed her ovary instead of her appendix . Mother-to-be Maria De Jesus died after two trainee surgeons operating on a Sunday removed the wrong body part. The 32-year-old – who was five months’ pregnant with her fourth child – was admitted to Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex with appendicitis but medics took out an ovary instead. She was discharged but forced to return a fortnight later with severe abdominal pain after the untreated appendix caused the onset of the life-threatening blood infection sepsis. Mrs De Jesus suffered a miscarriage shortly after being re-admitted in October 2011. Just 48 hours later, the teaching assistant died of major organ failure on the operating table just as doctors were finally removing the infected appendix. Her husband Adelino, 53, said earlier this year: ‘My wife’s death could have been prevented, I am sure of it. 'By the time they realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the best consultants – it was too late. ‘This is neglect, this is an unlawful killing.’ He . said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘That means that patients spend . less time in hospital and the hospital as a whole runs more efficiently. ‘People . are still kept waiting at the weekend for a diagnosis. We have a system . that is not built around the convenience of patients and is not . compassionate to patients for part of the week.’ If hospitals are relying too . heavily on junior doctors at weekends, the NHS will force managers to . bring in consultants in their place. Patients will also be able to have . minor surgery at the weekend such as for hernias and on hips and knees . so they do not have to take time off work. British Medical Association chairman Dr Mark Porter would not say whether it would ask for more money consultants to work weekends . Sir . Bruce added: ‘Why should somebody have to take time off work, why . should someone else have to take time off work to take them to and from . hospital, when, if they were to have their operations on a Saturday, . they could spend Sunday recovering and, in many cases, get back to work . sooner?’ The Care Quality Commission watchdog has been urged to check for levels of weekend care during routine inspections of hospitals. NHS England – which runs the Health Service – estimates the plans will cost the NHS an extra £1billion a year. Its annual budget is about £105billion. But BMA chairman Dr Porter said other NHS staff including X-ray specialists, administration staff and social workers also needed to work at weekends to ensure high levels of care. He refused to comment on whether the BMA would ask for more money for consultants to work weekends as part of discussions about their contract. Nurses currently get time and a half for working weekends while doctors receive time and a third, he said. A survey of 4,500 consultants by the BMA in September found that most were in favour of ‘increased financial remuneration’ for working in the evening and at weekends. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Patients should be at the heart of the NHS and be able to depend on it every day – not just Monday to Friday.’ The weekend working shake-up follows a number of key studies which warned that patients are far more likely to die or suffer major complications if they are admitted at the weekend. NHS England has calculated that 4,400 lives could be saved every year if hospitals offered the same level of care at weekends as they do during the week. Patients undergoing planned surgery on Saturday or Sunday are 82 per cent more likely to die than if they have their operation on a Monday, according to a study by researchers at Imperial College London published in the spring. Last year, scientists from University College London found patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if they are admitted on a Sunday compared to a Wednesday. The figure for Saturday was 11 per cent. Other studies also revealed an alarming difference in weekend death rates between hospitals. Hillingdon in West London had a rate of 27 per cent, while it was 25 per cent at the Royal Cornwall, according to Dr Foster research. Only last month, a report by the National Audit Office discovered that babies are 13 per cent more likely to come harm if they are born at the weekend than during the week.","NHS's top doctor said system 'not built around patient convenience'

The Japanese division of lingerie maker Triumph International has unveiled an 'Abenomics' bra, a special edition it says offers a 'growth strategy' and a potential lift towards Japan's elusive inflation target. Launches of Triumph's concept bras in Tokyo have become a regular event over the past quarter of a century and are an important publicity tool for the 127-year-old, Swiss-headquartered company. The latest 'Branomics Bra"" follows earlier solar-powered, recycled and 'husband-hunting' models but, like its predecessors, will not go on sale. Models present lingerie maker Triumph's new concept underwear, the 'Branomics Bra', during its unveiling in Tokyo today . The bra is nspired by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's moves to stimulate inflation, dubbed 'Abenomics' Triumph has created a brassiere that features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding . The 'Branomics Bra' is a playful take on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 'three-arrow' economic revival plan that combines monetary strategy aiming to reach 2 per cent inflation in two years and pro-growth reforms. It features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding. 'We hope that, as the Japanese economy grows, we can also help bust sizes to get bigger,' said Triumph spokeswoman Keiko Masuda. Its benefits for Japan's policymakers were less clear. Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei surged above 14,000 for the first time in nearly five years today. The index jumped 2.8 per cent to break the benchmark for the first time since June 2008 after aggressive new policies to try to revive the stagnant economy. The Nikkei was up 389.22 points by the midday break after closing for public holidays on Friday and Monday. Japan's Nikkei topped 14,000 for the first time since June 2008 after a strong show from the export sector . Of the 65 Nikkei companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 54 per cent of them either beat or met market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Japan's economy was helped by the yen weakening further against the U.S. dollar, which was a boost for the export market. It has weakened 22 per cent against the dollar since mid-November, while the Nikkei has jumped 63 per cent after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began promising to revive the economy. His expansionary monetary and fiscal policies were dubbed 'Abenomics' during his election campaign. Last month, the Bank of Japan announced a radical monetary expansion campaign that doubled the money supply. A rise in export sales, particularly to the U.S. and China, also boosted the Nikkei companies. Japanese exporters led the rally, with . Toyota Motor Corp, Sony Corp, semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo . Electron Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp up between 4.5 and 6 per cent. The yen has further weakened against the U.S. dollar, which will also help exporters . Sony was the most traded stock on the main board by turnover, while Toyota took third spot. Stefan Worrall, director of equity cash sales at Credit Suisse, said Tuesday's rally mirrored the trend in overseas markets in the last few days while Japan was on holiday and may not last the rest of the week. 'The question is ""where to now?"",' Worrall said. 'We still have the majority of corporate earnings to come through in the next two weeks.' JPMorgan said it expected the Nikkei to trade around 14,150 based on the correlation between the yen/won exchange rate and Tokyo index. The yen hit a more than five-year low of 11.0057 won on Tuesday. Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 was 6.7 points ahead at 6528, following a strong performance from Asian markets. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 0.50 per cent which have encouraged the markets.

A woman has spoken of the heartbreaking moment she was told she was infertile because she had unprotected sex with one partner as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, was undergoing exploratory tests in hospital to find out why she and her fiancé had been unable to conceive a baby when she was given the devastating news that she may never be a mother. She was stunned to be told her infertility had been caused by an STD she had contracted and been treated for as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, caught chlamydia when she was 16. When she started trying for a baby with her fiancé James Jackson, 30, she found the disease had left her infertile . Now, as she struggles to raise money for IVF, Ms Watson has made the brave decision to talk about her heartbreak in the hope that it will stop other teenagers from repeating her mistake. She said: ‘I was young and I made one foolish mistake that I will pay for forever. ‘That single mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life and I want other young women to know that when they have unprotected sex they are dicing with their future and their fertility. ‘My dreams have been destroyed because of something that happened five years ago but I want to talk about it to stop it happening to anyone else.’ Ms Watson thought she was being sensible when she protected herself against pregnancy before sleeping with a partner when she was 16. But after going for an STI test she was told she had contracted chlamydia. She was treated with antibiotics and put it behind her. She says: ‘I’d learned a horrible lesson at a young age, but what young woman doesn’t make mistakes? ‘I put it behind me and vowed it would never happen again.’ Ms Watson had treatment when she was 16 and thought she was cured. When she struggled to conceive tests revealed her fallopian tubes were irreversibly damaged . But Ms Watson was unaware that the damage had already been done. It wasn’t until she met James Jackson through her work in a care home, that she was to discover just how much her life had been affected by one mistake. The couple quickly became serious and Mr Jackson proposed. When they moved into their own home in Hartlepool, County Durham, the couple started trying for a baby. But after a year with no joy Jodie saw her GP in April 2012. Ms Watson and her fiancé are now trying to raise the money needed to pay for IVF treatment . Blood tests came back normal so she was referred to a gynaecologist in June 2012. She underwent a series of ultrasounds and X-rays in October 2012, which revealed blockages in her tubes. Ms Watson said: ‘I was stunned when they told us what they had found, but was not prepared at all when they said it was usually caused by chlamydia. I hadn’t even told James about it because it had happened so long ago, I thought it was in the past.’ But now it was affecting her future dreams of motherhood and Ms Watson was told she was infertile. ‘I broke down and cried. I just couldn’t believe it. I was ashamed, embarrassed and shocked. ‘I thought because I had been treated I would be fine but the consultant said the damage had likely already been done. I had no idea.’ Their only hope of a family lies in IVF but as Mr Jackson had a daughter with an ex-partner the couple do not qualify for treatment on the NHS. After being dealt the bombshell Ms Watson suffered with depression. She said: ‘I was just blaming myself every day and wishing I could turn back the clock.’ After researching her condition she read about an operation, which could help to unblock her tubes and increase her chances of becoming pregnant. Her GP explained there was just a 15 per cent chance it would work but gave the go ahead. Ms Watson underwent the operation in January this year but has still not become pregnant. Ms Watson wants to raise awareness about the dangers of unprotected sex as she says she regrets her decision every day and doesn't want other teenagers to make the same mistake . ‘They managed to partially unblock the right tube but the left was too badly damaged,’ she explains. ‘There is still a tiny chance I might fall pregnant so I cling to that but I know deep down the only real chance is likely IVF.’ Ms Watson applied to take part in an egg sharing scheme but was rejected because of the STD. At between £4,000 and £6,000 per cycle the couple are now fundraising to pay for IVF. She says: ‘After the bills there is hardly anything left to save so I’m doing what I can to raise the money including car boot sales. Ms Watson has also started a Facebook page to spread her warning to as many teens as possible. Ms Watson said: 'Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak' ‘I think it’s unfair that I don’t qualify for help on the NHS because my partner already has a child. That shouldn’t stop me from being a mum. I would like to see that rule reviewed. ‘Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak. ‘I know there are people who will judge me, but we all make mistakes and nobody regrets it more than me. ‘I wish I had never had unprotected sex and I wish I had known the full extent of the damage that can be caused. ‘I’m praying for a miracle and hope that one day I will get the chance to be a mother. ‘In the meantime I will do what I can to help other women by raising awareness.’ If it is not treated, chlamydia can cause long-term problems. In women it can spread to the womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes - this can cause a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility and persistent pelvic pain. It also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydia can also spread to cause inflammation in the fallopian tubes - this can make it difficult for an egg to travel from the ovary to the womb making conception more difficult. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis - swelling of the part of the man's reproductive system that carries sperm from the testicles. If left untreated, it can lead to infertility.","Jodie Watson caught chlamydia from a partner when she was 16 .

Fungus can be used to make bread and beer, but few people might imagine it could play a key role in creating safer insecticides, medical implants or green fuel. But a group of scientists who are fans of mushrooms and their other spore-producing  relatives believe we could be entering the ‘Age of the Fungus’ - and it could help save the world. Most of a mushroom’s power lies beneath the soil in a bundle of filaments called that mycelium that secrete enzymes capable of breaking down soil and rocks. They also produce potent chemicals to defend their territory, and release nutrients into the soil. Scroll down for video . Gary Strobel, a microbiologist at Montana University, Bozeman, has developed a biofuel after discovering a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides (pictured) that has volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels. He turned them into biofuel, which he has tested in his motorbike . And it is this mycelium that is of predominant interest to mycologists, who believe mushrooms could be used to produce superior drugs and green materials of the future, New Scientist's Richard Webb reported. Gary Strobel, a microbiologist at Montana University, Bozeman, has developed a biofuel after discovering that a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides contains volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels. Dr Strobel worked with the ‘jelly drop’ mushrooms to turn what he described as ‘dead leaf matter’ into biofuel, which he has since tested in his motorbike. Unlike biofuels made from fermented crops, the fungus-derived fuel could be made from agricultural waste and Dr Strobel is keen to commercialise the idea. And Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, believes he can take the idea a step further - with a car made from fungus. Mycelium is a flexible polymer, like . plastic, which is biodegradable and can be persuaded to grow into . different densities to produce a variety of materials with different . properties. His company already supplies mushroom packaging to Dell computers called EcoCradle, which acts as a subsitute for polystyrene, which is not very environmentally friendly. Ecolative design makes packaging components from fungi to replace fabricated polyethylene foam parts that provide cushioning in large packages. A wine case is pictured but the company also makes packing material for Dell's computers . It uses agricultural by-products like husks and . plant stalks from rice, buckwheat and cottonseed combined with mycelium . to grow the material. Bower is now working on making synthetic bone made using mycelium as a scaffold, as well as moulded parts for electric cars and fire-resistant insulating foam. The company is creating a sustainable surfboard made from mushrooms and is working with partners to create materials with 'unique performance properties' to meet specific needs. Paul Stamets, mycologist and adviser to the Programme of Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona’s College of Medicine, has 30 mushroom-based patents for environmental and medical devices, with his company Fungi Perfecti. His stand-put idea is ‘mycorestoration’ which involves adding groups of specific fungi to soil to clean up contamination and speed up the amount of carbon absorbed to help mitigate climate change. He also believes that Laricifomes officinalis can be used to make ‘universal insecticide’. Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, believes fungi fuel could one day power an electric car, composed of parts made of mushrooms .","A microbiologist at Montana University has developed a biofuel using a  fungus that has volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel .

Some 23 per cent of students admit to having caught a sexually transmitted infection . during their first year alone, according to a new survey. Nearly a quarter of students admit to having caught a sexually transmitted infection during their first year of university. The majority of encounters happened after drinking alcohol . The poll, rather ironically conducted by the website www.shagatuni.com, also revealed that 21 per cent caught an STI after their first year but before they finished their studies. The research . also revealed that theatre studies students appeared to be the most promiscuous, . with an average of 28 sexual partners while at university. The next most promiscuous are dance students, who have an average of 25 sexual partners. Media studies students have an average of 22 sexual partners and biology students have 19. 1.

The poll, which only involved people who . had remained single while at university, also revealed that 73 per cent . of students were under the influence of alcohol when engaging in the majority of their sexual encounters. More than half – 54 per cent – also admitted to being unable to recall who gave them their STI. Of . the respondents, 32 per cent said they found out about their infection . after being contacted by someone they had slept with who had been . diagnosed. Another 27 per cent said they were only diagnosed after being given a free testing kit. More than half of students who have had an STI - 54 per cent - admit to being unable to recall who gave them the STI . Nearly 60 per cent of students who caught an STI contracted chlamydia, 18 per cent caught herpes and 14 per cent genital warts. Possibly the most worrying finding was that 67 per cent of respondents said they would rather risk another STI than use a condom. In the past ten years, the number of under-25s being diagnosed with STIs had increased by almost 50 per cent. Gonorrhoea rates are increasing particularly rapidly - they have risen by a fifth in the last year. This is thought to be because of a new super-strain of the disease that cannot easily be treated with antibiotics. A report by Public Health England shows there were 448,422 new cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 2012, including chlamydia, herpes and genital warts. The total was up by five per cent on the previous year and 46 per cent higher than 2003, when figures were first collected. Rates are highest among the under-25s, with nearly two-third of chlamydia cases, and more than half of gonorrhoea infections, occurring in this age group. The Public Health England report states: ‘The continuing high STI rates in England suggest too many people are still putting themselves at risk through unsafe sex, especially young adults and men who have sex with men.’ It urges the under-25s to ensure they use protection with ‘casual partners’ and have regular checks at sexual health clinics. Audrey Simpson, of the Family Planning Association, said there was less awareness of the importance of contraception among the young, adding: ‘The worry is that condom use is not being taught in schools.

Not knowing what to do with the money, Crist kept the win a secret even from his own four children, hung up the phone, and finished his round. But yesterday 64-year-old went public, saying that he will donate every single cent to cancer charities after his wife Jan died from the disease in February last year, aged just 57. Scroll down for video . Tom Crist, 64, won the lottery last year but kept it a secret until yesterday when he announced he would be donating his $40million windfall to cancer charities . The couple had been married for 33 years. Speaking to CBC News, the former company CEO said: 'I’ve been fortunate enough, through my career, 44 years with a company. 'I did very well for myself. I’ve done enough that I can look after myself, for my kids, so they can get looked after into the future. I don’t really need that money.' He added that his wife would be ecstatic to know he was donating the win, and says he will start with the Tom Baker centre who helped treat Jan during her illness. He added: 'She was fairly young and stuff. She beat it for six years before it finally caught up to her.' The family, who are backing Crist's plan, will then set up a trust fund which will parcel out the rest of the money to various cancer causes over the years. Crist retired as CEO of EECOL Electric in September, following the company's CAD$1.14billion sale in December last year. The retired CEO's wife, Jan, died from cancer in February last year and he says she would be ecstatic to learn he was giving the money away to a good cause . Crist won the May 3 Lotto Max draw with the numbers 4, 6, 21, 26, 30, 34 and 35 but pays for his tickets by subscription, and so didn't pick the numbers himself. He said: 'I wasn’t even sure which game I’d won on, or what the numbers were. I’ve paid for the subscription when I get the renewal notice every year, and then I just file it — sometimes I’d get a cheque for $10 or $20, but I never expected this.' During his photocall and interview, mandatory for all big lottery winners, Crist opted for a baseball cap and dark sunglasses to take as much attention away from himself as possible.

You feel desperate to do something, anything, to stop the pain but whatever you try seems to fail. And much as you try to distract yourself, one thought dominates: it hurts. Being in pain is not only physical but also a mental battle against the painful sensations, wishing them away and trying to endure them. But doctors now think that struggling like this actually makes your suffering worse. In fact, the latest medical advances show that accepting and exploring sensations of pain and illness can bring more powerful relief than the most commonly prescribed painkillers. One high-profile practitioner of 'mindfulness' meditation to reduce chronic pain is actress Goldie Hawn . This approach constitutes a new treatment based on the ancient practice of 'mindfulness' meditation, which clinical trials show can reduce chronic pain by 57 per cent. Accomplished meditators can reduce their pain by more than 90 per cent. One high-profile practitioner is actress Goldie Hawn. She has said that through mindfulness, 'we can move our set point of happiness'. She set up a programme called MindUp under her Goldie Hawn Foundation to help children deal with stress and emotions and reduce their anxiety. This forms the basis of her book 10 Mindful Minutes, which teaches techniques such as mindful breathing and thinking. Her faith in the procedure is backed up by science. Brain imaging studies show that mindfulness not only soothes the brain patterns underlying pain but alters the structure of the brain itself, so patients no longer feel such intense pain. Such is its effectiveness that pain clinics now prescribe mindfulness meditation to help patients with diseases such as cancer (and chemotherapy side effects), heart disease, diabetes and arthritis, as well as other conditions such as migraine, coeliac disease and multiple sclerosis. Pain comes in two forms, primary and secondary, each with very different causes. Primary pain is the raw information sent by the body to the brain and arises from illness, injury or damage to the body. Secondary pain is the mind's reaction to primary pain and is often more intense and long-lasting. This type is controlled by an 'amplifier' in the brain that governs the overall intensity of suffering. Through mindfulness meditation you can learn to differentiate between  the two - and turn off the latter. Mindfulness soothes the brain patterns underlying pain, so patients no longer feel it so intensely . We do not passively feel pain. The brain processes the information  and teases apart the different sensations to try to find their underlying causes in order to avoid further damage to the body. In effect, the mind zooms in on pain looking for a solution. But this 'zooming-in' amplifies pain. Over time the brain fine-tunes itself to sense pain more quickly - and with greater intensity - in a futile attempt to avoid it. Brain scans confirm that people with chronic pain have more tissue dedicated to feeling its sensations. Mindfulness soothes the circuits that amplify secondary pain by dampening an area of the brain called the primary somatosensory cortex (PSC), which contains a 'map' of the human body in which nerve cells fire corresponding to pain in a region of your body. If you feel a lot of pain, this can be clearly seen in a brain scanner - it lights up like a Christmas tree. The PSC's nerve firing is modulated by a great many other brain regions too, however, and they are affected by emotions, so anxiety or stress can prime the PSC and make it more sensitive to pain signals. The Body Scan nvolves focusing on all the different parts of the body . We call this ten-minute exercise The Body Scan, as it involves focusing on all the different parts of the body, wherever your pain may be. Do it twice a day in quiet surroundings. Lie on your back on the floor, place your hands on your stomach. Close your eyes. Relax until it feels as if you are sinking into the floor . Focus on your breathing. Is it deep or shallow, smooth or ragged? Feel the rhythm in as much detail as you can. Does the breath 'echo' in the pelvis? The lower back? How do you feel in these regions? Are they warm or cold? Do they ache? Move your awareness to your middle back, then the upper back, then the whole back. Focus on your shoulders, neck, face, arms, hands. Move your awareness through your legs, starting at your hips. If it aches too much, gently broaden your focus so you hold the discomfort in a wider space - such as your entire legs rather than your thigh. Spend a couple of minutes observing the whole body breathing as one. Gently open your eyes, and  soak in the world around you. Try to carry this awareness with you as you continue with your day. But if you are a meditator, with reduced stress and anxiety and better coping mechanisms, you get the initial pain spike but it fades to nothing very quickly - and this too can be seen on a brain scanner. I used mindfulness after a paragliding accident seven years ago, when I fell 30ft on to a rocky hillside and the lower half of my leg was driven several inches through my knee and into my thigh. Through three major operations and two years of physiotherapy, I found it to be an extremely powerful painkiller and I'm convinced it also accelerated my healing. Over the next three weeks I'll lead you through meditations from my new book. The programme was developed by my  co-author Vidyamala Burch, a mindfulness expert who runs a UK training centre and became a convert after two serious spinal injuries. The exercises are based on solid science as well as our own experience and have helped tens of thousands of people worldwide.

Geraint Davies, Labour MP, found that NHS doctors were inadvertently referring vulnerable patients . A bill calling for the regulation of mental health therapists will be introduced by Labour MP Geraint Davies this week after he found that NHS doctors were inadvertently referring vulnerable patients for quack 'gay conversion' treatment. Although there are several existing professional bodies, such as the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, they are all private, independent organisations and membership is voluntary. Mr Davies said: 'This year a million Britons will seek psychotherapy, but currently anyone can set themselves  up as a psychotherapist with no training or recourse for the patient if something goes wrong. 'If accepted, this Bill would mean psychotherapist and counsellor become protected titles, so to work as one you would have to meet the necessary standards of qualifications and experience.' His Bill seeks to bring all those who claim to treat mental illness under the Health and Care Professionals Council. The last Labour Government's plans to regulate mental health therapists were shelved by the Coalition. The . taste of food depends on the cutlery used, a new study suggests.

Trouble brewing: President Francoise Hollande is struggling with a faltering economy and unemployment at a 16-year high of 11 per cent . France was branded the new 'sick man of Europe' today amid fears it may slip back into recession. President Francois Hollande is struggling with a faltering economy and unemployment at a 16-year high of 11 per cent while production in Europe's second largest economy fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Germany, however, enjoyed a rise of 0.3 per cent while Britain's economy grey by 0.8 per cent. But the Bank of France vowed that the economy will gather steam in the fourth quarter with growth of 0.5 per cent. The Insee statistics office sees growth at 0.4 per cent in the same period. 'Itâ€™s the unbalanced nature of the upturn among member states that is the most worrying,' said Markitâ€™s Chris Williamson. 'France looks increasingly like the new sick man of Europe.' He said Europe's second-largest economy could fall back into recession following its 0.1 per cent quarterly contraction in the third quarter. A recession is commonly defined as two straight quarters of negative growth. Markit's monthly composite purchasing managers' index, known as PMI, for the eurozone did bring some good news for Europe's economy. The index rose to a three-month high of 52.1 in December from 51.7 in November. The increase took the index, where anything about 50 indicates expansion, close to the 27-month peak seen in September. GDP graph: Production in Europe's second largest economy fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Germany, however, enjoyed a rise of 0.3 per cent while the United Kingdom's economy grey by 0.8 per cent . Since the recession ended, the eurozone has grown for two straight quarters but the recovery has been unspectacular - in the third quarter the eurozone only grew by 0.1 per cent from the previous three-month period. That corresponds to an annualized rate of around 0.4 per cent, way down on the US's 3.6 per cent. Though Markit thinks the fourth quarter may see the rate of growth double, its headline index masks worrying developments, particularly over the state of France, which saw its PMI fall to a seven-month low of 47.0 in December from 48.0 the previous month. Overall, the survey may ease the immediate pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to shore up the recovery despite below-target inflation and ongoing budget restraints in a number of economies, such as Greece, Spain and Italy. However, with growth likely to remain modest over the months ahead, many analysts think the bank will need to do more. Though the bank has little room to cut its benchmark interest rate following last month's reduction to a record low of 0.25 per cent, the ECB has other potential tools at its disposal. Production fall: Experts say Europe's second-largest economy could fall back into recession following its 0.1 per cent fall in production in the third quarter. A recession is commonly defined as two straight quarters of negative growth . It could give banks more long-term, cheap loans so they can lend more. It could even decide to make banks pay to keep funds on deposit at the central bank - again, to encourage them to lend rather than hoard cash. Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, said today that the bank continues to expect its key interest rates to remain at present, or lower, levels, for an extended period of time. 'Thus, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary,' he told the European Parliament's committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels. While noting that it takes time for policy decisions to work their way through markets and affect the wider economy, Draghi said the ECB is 'ready and able to act if needed' in the event that a protracted period of low inflation entails. The November rate cut was largely predicated on the fact that consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell to 0.7 per cent in the year to October. That was way below the ECB's target of keeping price rises just below 2 per cent. The latest count saw inflation edge back up to 0.9 per cent in the year to November.","France saw production continue to drop with fall of 0.1% in third quarter .

'Jail bait': Metropolitan Police Constable Adam Holbrook was today spared jail after 3,000 images of young girls were found on his computer . A decorated policeman caught with thousands of pictures of young girls on his computer - some of them naked - was today spared jail. Metropolitan Police Constable Adam Holbrook, who was based in Waltham Forest, was found with 3000 pictures of underage girls on his computer, of which 16 were of them posing naked or half naked. Holbrook was arrested on August 7 last year following an investigation which found he had surfed sites which promoted themselves as sources of 'jailbait' images. The 29-year-old had received a commendation award in 2007 for his work at a murder scene in East London where music producer Richie Holmes was shot dead. Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard that a search of his laptop recovered the images, which included 16 classified as indecent. Detective Constable James Low from the Met Police Paedophile Unit said the haul included girls aged between 13 and 16 posing semi-naked in the shower and a girl of about 14 embracing another girl while semi-naked on a bed. They were deemed to be of level one, the lowest category of five. 'It was based on what the girls look like, how formed they were and their faces in terms of determining how old they were,' he told the court. 'In my opinion 16 of these images were children.' Of the rest of the photos, DC Low said: 'They depicted more girls aged mainly 13 to 18 years old. 'They were predominately schoolgirls, in school uniform at school, or bikinis at the beach. They were not indecent but they were in variety of settings and scenarios.' During his evidence, Holbrook claimed that the images downloaded onto his machine without his knowledge while he was searching for legitimate pornographic material. However, District Judge Nicholas . Evans, dismissed this claim. He said there was no way that the officer . did not know what he was doing. 'Mr Holbrook has given evidence and I have said that I did not find it terribly convincing,' said the judge. '[His claim that] ""I am looking for 18 . or 19 year olds which seek to pass themselves off as being younger"", is . neither realistic or credible. 'It is clear that if he is looking . for, as he accepts he was, the underage look, he finds that interesting, . simulating or whatever, and he is looking for that. 'I don’t think he is looking for 18 or 19-year-olds that look younger, he would be likely to look at younger women.' He added: 'It does not matter where these images came from and when they were downloaded, it is sufficient in this case for the court to conclude that the defendant was browsing for such images of people under 16. 'I am satisfied that he deliberately, knowingly brought these images onto his screen.' The court heard that an analysis of . Holbrook’s computer showed he was browsing a website with a name . including the sick term 'jail bait', while his search history included . terms such as 'teen jail bait'. During . the trial, the court heard evidence from forensic computer expert DC . Patrick Hyde. He said the site would be shut down under UK rules but . continues running because it is based in the U.S. Despite . 36 complaints to the Internet Watch Foundation accusing the website of . hosting inappropriate photos of children, Mr Hyde said it continued to . operate because American legislation was different than that in the UK. 'He deliberately, knowingly brought these images onto his screen': Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, where Holbrook was ordered to pay a £640 fine, £450 in court costs and a victims surcharge of £15 . The court heard in a police interview, Holbrook submitted a statement which said he believed all the girls in the pictures were over 18. Holbrook denied one count of making sixteen Level 1 indecent images of children. He was ordered to pay a £640 fine, £450 in court costs and a victims surcharge of £15. The officer was suspended from his duties with the Met, but after his conviction faces being sacked.","PC Adam Holbrook had 16 indecent images of young girls on his laptop .
