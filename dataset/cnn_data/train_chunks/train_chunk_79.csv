"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Volunteering with local law enforcement, Shaquille O'Neal has learned from his peers that domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous for police officers. NBA star Shaquille O'Neal praises Karen Earl for her efforts on behalf of domestic abuse victims. ""[It's] a very disturbing thing,"" said the NBA star, who has dealt mainly with children's cases. ""I don't really think a lot of women know what to do."" That's where Karen Earl comes in. As executive director of the Jenesse Center, the oldest domestic violence intervention program in south central Los Angeles, California, Earl is a ""tireless and fearless"" champion of women and children living in abusive situations, O'Neal said. The Phoenix Suns center called Earl ""the pillow of women's society."" For more than two decades, Earl has helped give victims a way out through the Jenesse Center, which provides shelter, education, outreach and legal services to more than 8,500 victims of domestic violence every year. ""Thank God for Miss Earl,"" O'Neal said. ""She takes women that have been involved in domestic abuse situations and gives them a place to come rest their head."" According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an estimated 1.3 million women are victims of physical assault by an intimate partner each year, and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. Earl has heard countless stories of domestic abuse and has seen a range of tipping points before victims seek help. She is working to lower these statistics. She recalled one woman whose husband beat her with an iron; for another, ""the beatings were standard, but when he sold their refrigerator and she couldn't keep her baby's milk cold anymore, she knew it was time to go."" These women were able to find shelter and support -- and ultimately safety and success -- through the Jenesse Center. ""It is not normal to go to bed afraid,"" Earl said. ""And the thing that I know for sure is that there is help."" When Earl began volunteering at the center in 1986, she said, she often thought of what her own mother went through. ""I remember us having to run out of the house at midnight with sheets wrapped around us. I know the impact it had on my mom, and of course the impact on me and my siblings,"" she said. ""I wish there were a place back then, but nobody talked about it. It was just family business; it was personal.""  Watch Earl discuss the center's mission to heal through art Â» . Today, Earl serves as Jenesse Center's executive director and calls her work with staff, fundraising and volunteer recruitment ""a 24-hour thing."" The process of healing for victims generally starts with a phone call to the center's hot line, she said. The center provides counseling and literature and has a 30-day emergency shelter for women and their families. Earl said this emergency period ""is a time of regrouping"" and lets the women know that they're not alone and that they didn't do anything wrong. The center also provides long-term support. ""Women and their children can stay for two years,"" Earl said. ""Every able body, every day, gets up and takes classes. And when they're not taking classes, they're looking for employment, going through counseling sessions or [getting] legal assistance."" For Earl, comprehensive care through a team approach is the key to the center's success. She said she has seen women at the center earn graduate degrees and become ""full-fledge"" professionals -- and that changing lives is what keeps her going. O'Neal said the center helps point women in the right direction and gives them the chance to overcome adversity. ""They'll help you get an apartment. They'll help you get a job. They help you get back on your feet and become the beautiful woman that you are.""","O'Neal's work in law enforcement taught him the serious nature of domestic violence .

"(CNN) -- Serie A leaders AC Milan remain on course for a domestic double after reaching the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup with a 3-0 home win over Bari. Milan, with Antonio Cassano making his debut for the club, were always in control at the San Siro, and they now travel to Cassano's former club Sampdoria -- with a place in the semifinals up for grabs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic continued his impressive recent form by opening the scoring for the home side in the 19th minute. And there was no way back for Bari once young German midfielder Alexander Merkel had doubled Milan's advantage on the stroke of halftime. Man-of-the-match Robinho made the opening two goals before deservedly getting on the scoresheet himself midway through the second half, converting a pass from Merkel. The other quarterfinal ties will see Napoli entertain holders Inter Milan, Juventus play host to Roma and Palermo facing Parma.","Serie A leaders AC Milan reach the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Victorious on the ground Sunday afternoon, the New York Jets got a special welcome home in the air Sunday night when the pilot of their large charter plane and air traffic controllers lined them up for a view of the Empire State Building, which was lit up for the occasion in the team colors -- green and white. As the plane approached Newark International Airport at around midnight Sunday, the crew of Continental Flight 1915 asked air traffic controllers if the building was still lit up. After confirming it was, a controller put the plane on a course down New York's Hudson River, telling the pilot they could see the west side of the skyscraper. ""We got 200 people looking at it,"" the crew of the Boeing 767 responded. ""Really pretty night for it, too."" ""I planned that,"" the air traffic controller deadpanned. A string of air traffic controllers -- neutral on most occasions, partisan on this one -- chimed in as the plane landed and taxied, proclaiming, ""Go Jets!"" The radio traffic was recorded and placed on LiveATC.net, a website for aviation hobbyists and devotees. The Jets beat the favored New England Patriots 28-21 Sunday in a National Football League playoff game, a result that evidently lightened the mood on board the Continental Boeing 767. ""You've got a happy bunch on board, huh?"" a controller says in the first transmission on the tape. ""Very happy,"" the pilot or first officer says. ""We have a question for you: Is the Empire State Building still lit up right now?... I've got an unusual request. If it's green and white, the guys actually want us to get as close as we can to see it."" After the pilot was given a heading that put the building within view, he said to the controller, ""You guys are awesome."" Asked later by another controller if they enjoyed the trip down the river, the flight crew responded: ""We did, and the team did too. It was great. I know the coach liked it."" A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Paul Takemoto, said Tuesday the plane followed a normal course down the river, and the controllers did not divert from that course it to fulfill the players' wish.","The Empire State Building was lit up in green and white .

"(CNN)  -- Sierra Leone international Rodney Strasser scored a vital goal five minutes from time to send AC Milan five points clear as Serie A resumed Thursday after its short mid-winter break. Strasser first goal in the Italian top-flight gave Milan a 1-0 win over Cagliari in Sardinia to increase their lead in the title race as Lazio were held to a 0-0 draw at Genoa. In the evening kickoff, Inter Milan gave new coach Leonardo a superb start with a 3-1 win at home to Napoli, who would have cut the gap on Milan at the top to three points with victory at the San Siro. Brazilian Leonardo, who replaced Rafael Benitez, saw Thiago Motta  score twice with Esteban Cambiasso also on target. Napoli replied through Michele Pazienza, as the win takes reigning champions Inter to within 13 points of their city rivals, but they have two games in hand. Juventus' championship challenge hit the buffers after a humiliating 4-1 home defeat to mid-table Parma. Juve's chances were hardly helped by the 17th minute dismissal of Felipe Melo for violent conduct. But they were also undone by one of the own players, striker Sebastian Giovinco, who is out on loan to Parma this season. He scored a double before defender Nicola Legrottaglie pulled a goal back for the Turin giants. But Hernan Crespo's penalty sealed the three points before substitute Raffaele Palladino scored a fourth in added time. The defeat leaves Juventus eight points adrift of Milan, who made their breakthrough late as new signing Antonio Cassano played in fellow substitute Strasser to net. In other action, Roma leapfrogged Juventus into fourth after winning 4-2 against Catania, with Marco Borriello and Mirko Vucinic scoring two apiece.","NEW: Inter Milan beat Napoli 3-1 in Leonardo's first match in charge .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona battled into the quarterfinals of the Copa Del Rey on Wednesday night as veteran French defender Eric Abidal scored his first goal for the Spanish champions in a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao. Pep Guardiola's team set up a clash with either La Liga rivals Getafe or second division Real Betis after winning on away goals following the 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou last month. The 31-year-old Abidal, who was brought on as a second-half substitute, netted only the second goal of his career in the 75th minute to leave Bilbao needing two goals to go through.

The Basques threatened to take the match into extra-time when Spain striker Fernando Llorente continued his fine scoring run with an 85th-minute equalizer, but Barcelona held on. ""When I get a chance like that, I shoot. Now I hope to score more this season,"" Abidal told AFP. Defending champions Sevilla cruised into the last eight with an 8-3 aggregate victory over La Liga rivals Malaga, winning 3-0 in the away leg. Ivory Coast midfielder Ndri Romaric scored the opener with a deflected freekick six minutes after halftime, then substitute Diego Perotti made it 2-0 before Malaga defender Weligton was sent off for a second booking and Brazil striker Luis Fabiano netted late with another setpiece. What were the top sporting moments of 2010? Sevilla will next play either Villarreal or Valencia, who meet on Thursday following a 0-0 first-leg draw. Top-flight team Deportivo La Coruna needed extra-time before ending the hopes of second division Cordoba as Adrian scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win. The Spain under-21 international's treble ultimately gave the Galicians a 4-2 aggregate victory, but he needed to convert a penalty late in regulation time to stop his side crashing out after David Arteaga struck in the 86th minute. Cordoba collapsed after Miguel Angel Tena was sent off in extra-time as Deportivo set up a clash with either Mallorca or Almeria, who lead 4-3. Real Madrid also play on Thursday, holding an 8-0 advantage over Levante, while last season's runners-up Atletico Madrid take a 1-0 lead to Espanyol.","Barcelona reach Spanish Cup quarterfinals on away goals after 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Top flight golf is a high-stakes, high-stress sport -- but it's not just the pros who are feeling the strain. Stress can affect golfers of all abilities. Swede Robert Karlsson returned from a four-month layoff recently with an eye condition that's thought to be stress-related, while England's Ian Poulter defended his decision not to play in the Vivendi Trophy by saying that he wanted to avoid fatigue -- mental as well as physical. While professional sport is bound to have its pressures, recreational golf is usually regarded as a way to unwind and relieve stress. But it seems that weekend players are having to deal with anxieties of their own. Victor Thompson, a London-based sports psychologist, told CNN that golf is a much more psychological sport than most. ""It can be particularly stressful because, unlike team sports, you very much have the spotlight on you while you're playing,"" he said. ""You've got a lot of time between your shots for you to think, time for other people to watch you and time for you to think about what people will think of you if you don't play well."" That doesn't just apply when there's an audience of millions watching on TV -- it's just as true when you're playing at your local municipal course with your friends. ""It can actually be tougher playing against your mates and people you know because they can ridicule you or laugh at you, or you might worry about disappointing them if you're playing on their team,"" said Thompson. That would appear to be borne out by a 2004 study on the moods of older recreational golfers. The subjects reported being no happier or calmer after playing golf -- in fact, they reported feeling more angry and depressed. One of the researchers, Haydn Jarrett, senior lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Worcester, told CNN that the study also showed that golfers reported feeling more fatigued and less vigorous after playing golf, as most players walked an average 10.2 km during a game. Jarrett's study was carried out on ""senior"" golfers, with an average age of 68, but he said the findings on mood change tied in with other studies carried out on younger recreational golfers. ""Golf does appear to be stressful for recreational players,"" he told CNN. ""If we wanted golfers to enjoy it more fully it might be nice to engage with golfers and bring potential negative moods to their attention."" While those negative feelings probably don't last for long, they can have disastrous effects on your golf. Thompson says negative thoughts on the golf course can make you tense and frustrated, giving you an adrenaline rush that can affect your swing and timing. As you start dropping shots you can overanalyze your game, which just make things worse. The secret of dealing with golf stress is to get on top of your thoughts, says Thompson. Rather than thinking in terms of how badly you're playing or what other people will think of you, you need to realize that your emotions are getting the better of you and that anxiety is the problem, not your technique. So with all that stress, could playing golf actually be bad for you? ""If you're beating yourself up emotionally and getting angry that's not very good for your health,"" said Thompson. ""But it's all a matter of attitude. Somebody might go out and enjoy it, see it as a chance to get away from work, have a nice stroll and catch up with their mates."" And Jarrett has encouraging news when it comes to golf and health. He has carried out unpublished work showing that a round of golf can give a significant reduction in blood pressure. ""My gut feeling is that golf is incredibly positive for health,"" he told CNN. ""The positives of the distance walked, the heart-rate increase and the blood-pressure suppression will outweigh any negative mood states. But it might be that we need to recognize that mood profiles can go down and mediate against that.""","Golf is especially stressful, says sports psychologist Victor Thompson .

"(CNN) -- Police in Bolivia used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who took to the streets protesting a hike on the price of fuels Monday. The price of gasoline has risen 73 percent while diesel fuel rose at least 80 percent. The unions representing the public transit workers called for an indefinite national strike in protest which was partially successful Monday. Bolivian President Evo Morales defended the increase, saying it was needed partly because of Bolivian fuel being sold illegally to other countries, the state-run news agency ABI reported. The government had frozen the price of gasoline and diesel for six years and subsidized the cost -- making the fuel a lot cheaper than in neighboring countries. As a result, trafficking in fuels made it a very profitable business, said Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera. ""The profit margin is so great that anybody who sells 10 liters of gasoline in Brazil or Peru makes enough money to live a week or two. Only 10 liters! That can't be. That can't be,"" he said. The government estimates that Bolivia loses as much as $150 million a year in fuel sold outside the country. But the ""Gasolinazo,"" as the hike is being called, could be a big challenge to Morales who has enjoyed public support for his populist policies. Many are now questioning his commitment to the people. ""Why did he lie? His ministers said the price wouldn't go up a single peso and now this,"" said Marta Zurita, a homemaker in the capital Bolivia. ""How can we move forward? This is bad, very bad."" Many fear the price increase won't be limited to fuel. Taxi drivers raised their fares by as much as a 100% even though the government warned them not to go higher than 25%. The drivers' union agreed to continue negotiations with the government Tuesday to reach an agreement on the new rates. Others rushed to local markets to buy groceries fearing prices will soon go up. Retiree Mary Ortuno said she wishes she could go shopping with a government official to see how much they could afford using only her income. Journalist Gloria Carrasco contributed to this report from La Paz.","The price of gasoline has risen 73 percent .

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona began 2011 with an 11th successive league victory on Sunday night to move five points clear of title rivals Real Madrid. Young winger Pedro Gonzalez, standing in for the absent Lionel Messi, scored both goals in the 2-1 victory over Levante while World Cup winner Xavi equaled the Catalan club's all-time appearance record of 549 matches. After a scoreless first half in which Barcelona struggled to break down the Valencia side's defense, Gonzalez broke the deadlock two minutes into the second period as he did well to make space inside the penalty and fire in a deflected low shot from Daniel Alves' agonizingly delayed pass. With Messi allowed to take an extended winter holiday, the 23-year-old continued to make the most of his starting chance by adding his eight league goal this season in the 59th minute after Brazilian right-back Alves delivered a better-judged low cross into his path. Messi to miss Barcelona's 2011 opener . Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola was also without the services of injured captain Carles Puyol and the suspended Gerard Pique, and his depleted defense had to withstand a determined Levante fightback after Stuani's superb left-foot volley reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go. The 30-year-old Xavi, who made an all-Barcelona three-man shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award to be named this month, matched the milestone set by defender Migueli 20 years ago. ""It is an honor for Xavi, a home-bred player, to have worn the Barca shirt so many times,"" club president Sandro Rosell said. ""Xavi has won everything and he represents the Barca values: effort, loyalty, work and heart. Loyalty is a difficult value to find, and what Xavi has done for Barca is extraordinary."" Levante, who have not beaten Barcelona in six visits to the Camp Nou, remained just two points above the relegation despite a marked improvement on the team's last outing of 2010 -- an 8-0 drubbing by Real Madrid in the first leg of their last-16 Spanish Cup tie. Spanish league strike called off . Second-placed Real will be boosted by the long-awaited return of Brazilian midfielder Kaka for Monday night's derby with city rivals Getafe. Kaka, the second-most expensive signing in the Real squad behind Cristiano Ronaldo, has been sidelined since requiring knee surgery in early August before the start of this season. ""Kaka won't start, he can't yet. He can give us 15 or 20 minutes of his very great quality, but no more,"" coach Jose Mourinho told reporters on Sunday. In the day's other 17th-round matches, Valencia consolidated fourth place with a controversial 2-1 win over fellow Champions League hopefuls Espanyol, despite having striker Aritz Aduriz sent off in the 61st minute for hitting Francisco Chica with a flailing arm. Aduriz scored his seventh league goal this season and his 11th overall to put the home side ahead in the 29th minute, but fifth-placed Espanyol leveled when Portuguese defender Ricardo Costa inexplicably stooped to head Jose Callejon's innocuous cross into his own net in first-half injury time. Espanyol could not take advantage of their numerical advantage, and Juan Mata nodded the winner in the second minute of time added on despite being in an offside position when Costa headed the ball across the goal. Sevilla seek to revive their own European qualification bid with a 1-0 victory at home to Osasuna that lifted the club into ninth place -- 23 points behind Barcelona. Striker Fredi Kanoute scored the only goal in the 36th minute as he raced to the near post to head in a freekick from Jesus Navas. The defeat left Osasuna in 15th place, four points above the bottom three. Deportivo La Coruna moved up to 11th place with a 2-1 victory at nine-man Athletic Bilbao, who stayed eighth. Forward Adrian Alvarez scored in each half for the visitors, the first from the penalty spot on 22 minutes and the second seven minutes after the break. Both teams were reduced to 10 men by the end of the first period, with Bilbao defender Mikel San Jose receiving a straight red card on 35 and Deportivo midfielder Juan Rodriguez also sent off for a second booking just before the interval. Striker Fernando Llorente reduced the deficit with four minutes to play with his 11th La Liga strike, but his teammate Ustaritz Aldekoaotalora was also marched for a second yellow card at the end. Malaga moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 win at second-bottom Sporting Gijon, coming from behind with goals from defender Weligton and midfielder Apono, who netted a 59th-minute penalty.","Spain midfielder Xavi matches Barcelona's all-time appearance record of 549 games .

"(CNN) -- Jose Maria Olazabal is looking forward to the biggest challenge of his career after being named as Europe's new team captain for the 2012 Ryder Cup. The 44-year-old Spaniard takes over from Colin Montgomerie, having been one of the Scot's vice-captains as Europe regained golf's most prestigious prize from the the United States in October. He has a rich playing record in the biennial event, having been a winner on three occasions in seven appearances since his debut in 1987. ""The Ryder Cup is welded in my heart. I do have wonderful memories. It has meant so much to me,"" Olazabal told reporters at his unveiling in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. ""It's a huge responsibility to be the next captain, and it's I think one of the biggest challenges, if not the biggest challenge, I will have in my career, especially at this time of my career."" Olazabal is a two-time major winner having triumphed at the U.S. Masters in 1994 and 1999, and he is eighth on the European Tour's all-time list with 23 victories, but he has battled ill health in recent years. His last Ryder Cup appearance was a winning one in Ireland in 2006, though he played only three events last year as he continued his fight against rheumatism -- a factor that had forced him to play down reports that he would become Europe's captain. ""That was the main concern. Regarding that, the last couple of months, since I played Valderrama last year, I felt a noticeable improvement in my health condition,"" Olazabal said. ""There should be no problem. I'm feeling much better and that's the reason why I said yes."" While Montgomerie said following the epic final-match victory at Celtic Manor in Wales that he expected changes to the team selection policy, Olazabal does not intend to make any drastic moves ahead of the qualification period starting in September. The U.S. team allows for four captain's picks to be made outside the eight places on offer through rankings points, but Olazabal said he was considering asking to reduce his wildcard selection from three to two for the trip to Illinois. ""The more picks you get, well, the less value I think you give to the players that finish from eight to 10, and I think to finish in the top 10 you have to play great golf, and it was proven the last time,"" he said. McDowell clinches Ryder Cup for Europe . ""And to make the top 10, five through the world rankings and four through the European Tour rankings, you need to have an extremely great year. And it would be a shame to tell any of those guys, you're not in."" Former Ryder Cup star Thomas Bjorn, who heads the European Tour Tournament Committee, said Olazabal had been a unanimous choice. ""Speaking to players on tour and speaking to committee members, it was probably the easiest decision I've ever have to make for Ryder Cup captain,"" the Dane told reporters. ""We normally do it at a committee meeting. But there was a general feeling from the whole membership that Jose needed to be the next captain. We didn't feel that we needed to sit in a committee meeting and discuss this, because it was the one man that everybody on this tour wanted to be captain.""","European Tour members choose Jose Maria Olazabal as Ryder Cup captain .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester City crushed Aston Villa 4-0 with Mario Balotelli scoring a hat-trick to go temporarily top of the English Premier League ahead of city rivals Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Birmingham later Tuesday. Although City were only at the head of affairs for a few hours, the manner of their victory suggested they will be a factor in the title race, but for Gerard Houllier's Villa it was another dispiriting defeat. Tottenham Hotspur, who won 2-1 at Villa on Boxing Day, beat Newcastle 2-0 in another afternoon kick-off to leapfrog Chelsea into fourth place. Goals from Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale in the second half maintained Tottenham's impressive recent run and spelt a second straight defeat for Newcastle under new manager Alan Pardew. Man Utd regain top spot despite draw . Bale scored the clinching second after a trademark surging run after Younes Kaboul had been sent off for the home side after tangling with Cheick Tiote. At Eastlands, Balotelli proved a real handful for Villa, winning an early penalty after being hauled down by Eric Lichaj. The Italian got up to convert the penalty and City were 2-0 ahead inside the first 15 minutes as Joleon Lescott headed home Adam Johnson's corner. Balotelli scored his second from close range before the break and completed his hat-trick in the second half with his second successful penalty after Johnson was fouled by Marc Alrighton. Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini took a realistic view of their hgih placing. ""I know that we are top but I think it will only be for three hours. It is important to be there at the end of the season,"" the Italian told BBC Sport. Elsewhere, promoted Blackpool continued their remarkable season under Ian Holloway with a 2-0 win at Sunderland to go eighth, having been the favorites to go straight back down at the start of the campaign. Two second half goals from DJ Campbell gave Blackpool three points in their first match since December 11 after their own Bloomfield Road ground was unfit to play due to a frozen pitch. Chris Baird scored two early goals as Fulham relieved some of the pressure on manager Mark Hughes with a 2-0 win at Stoke, while Blackburn's fans will be happier after Nikoli Kalinic scored twice in a 3-1 victory at West Brom. Kalinic blotted his copybook by being sent off for a wild challenge in the second half, but it was the first win for new manager Steve Kean, who took over from the sacked Sam Allardyce. In Tuesday's evening kickoff, West Ham missed the chance to move out of the bottom three when they were held 1-1 at home by Everton. The Hammers took the lead when Tony Hibbert diverted Radoslav Kovac's overhead kick into his own net. Everton leveled just before halftime through Seamus Coleman, before Carlton Cole missed a great opportunity to seal victory for the home side after the break.","Manchester City beat Aston Villa 4-0 to go temporarily top of English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Charl Schwartzel kickstarted the defense of his Joburg Open title with a superb 10-under-par-61 in a weather-affected second round on Friday. The 26-year-old, seeking his sixth European Tour title, fired a flawless 10-birdie effort to claim a tie for the lead with fellow South African Garth Mulroy and England's Jamie Elson at the halfway stage. He moved up 39 places, having opened with a 68, as three hours were lost due to a thunderstorm. Schwartzel played on the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington club's West Course, while Mulroy and Elson carded 64s on the more testing East Course. The weekend rounds will be played at the East Course once the second round is finally completed on Saturday morning. ""It really fell into place and I hit some great tee shots and iron shots, and I used just about every opportunity I had on the greens,"" Schwartzel, who has having problems with his swing before the tournament started, told the European Tour website. The world No. 32 is the highest-ranked player in the co-sanctioned Sunshine Tour event. By comparison, Elson is 493rd in the standings, having failed to retain his European Tour card after making the halfway cut in 13 of the 26 events he played. He fired five successive birdies from the fifth hole as he moved up from his overnight position of sixth, as did Mulroy. Their 36-hole total of 129 was a shot ahead of the South African trio of James Kingston, Thomas Aiken (66) and joint first-round leader Tyrone Mordt (68). The 45-year-old Kingston almost matched Schwartzel's score but bogeyed his final hole on the West Course to sign for a 62. The second event of the U.S. PGA Tour season has also been affected by weather, with Thursday's opening round of the Sony Open in Hawaii washed out. The tournament finally began on Friday morning, with American golfer Ryan Palmer seeking to become the fourth player to defend his title at Waialae. Joseph Bramlett, the first African-American golfer to get through qualifying school since 1985, is one of 27 rookies making PGA Tour debuts.","Defending champion Charl Schwartzel in a three-way tie for the lead at Joburg Open .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Michael will take a one shot lead going into the final round of the Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club in South Africa. Michael made a faltering start to his third round with bogeys at the first, third and seventh holes, but improved as the round progressed eventually picking up four birdies. The South African carded a third round 71 to finish on 10-under par, one stroke ahead compatriot Dawie Van Der Walt and last year's champion Spain's Pablo Martin. The 24-year-old Spaniard was one of only a handful of players to break 70 on Saturday thanks to eagles at the par five 13th followed by another at the 15th where he smashed his three-wood to eight feet and then holed the putt.

"(CNN) -- Ian Poulter struck a flawless round of 60 to seize the lead at the halfway stage of the Hong Kong Open. The Englishman's ten-under-par round was a career best and catapulted him to the top of the leaderboard on 13-under -- one shot in front of American Anthony Kang, who hit a 61. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy looked to be on course for a share of the lead until he tarnished his superb round with a double bogey at the last. But it was Poulter who led the way with ten birdies, including five in a row from hole seven. The 34-year-old hit some sparkling shots, including an approach to within three feet on the 11th, a 15 foot birdie putt on 13 and a 12-foot putt at the next. Despite his stellar performance, the European Ryder Cup star still felt he could have got under the 60 barrier. ""It is one of those courses where if you can get off to a good start you really feel you can shoot a good number,"" he told the European Tour website. ""I had five birdies from the seventh and as soon as that happened I felt there were plenty of chances coming in. I am happy but slightly disappointed."" Poulter's Ryder Cup teammate McIlroy should have hit the summit but after five birdies and an eagle, he dropped two shots at the last after finding a bunker and then water to sit on 11-under. McIlroy said: ""The great thing about this golf course is the front nine is a bit tricky and the back nine offers you chances. ""You have to make yourself stay patient. It's only Friday, and I had to keep myself under control out there. ""He (Poulter) is playing very well and he'll be tough to beat this week. I'll just have to go out this weekend and try and play really well."" Kang smashed in nine birdies in his round, while U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell is on ten-under after a five-under round of 65. He is battling to overtake Martin Kaymer in the European Tour's Race to Dubai standings before next week's season-ending Dubai World Championships.

"London, England (CNN) -- Roger Federer enjoyed a comfortable 6-1 6-4 victory over David Ferrer to join Andy Murray at the top of Group B at the ATP World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena on Sunday evening. The four-time winner of the season finale had never lost to the Spaniard in 10 previous meetings and it became clear from the start that an upset was unlikely. The 29-year-old Swiss broke the seventh seed twice to open up a 4-0 lead in the opening set, before Ferrer hit back with a break of his own. But normal service was resumed in the sixth game, despite the Spaniard's best efforts as Federer broke his serve again and then served out the set. The second set was less one sided, with Federer taking five games to secure a break of serve, but the result was the same. Serving for the match at 5-4, the number two seed experienced an uncharacteristic lapse in concentration, handing his opponent three break points. But, as so often with Federer, he immediately regained his composure to save all three and then promptly served an ace to wrap up the match. ATP World Tour Finals preview . Earlier in the day, Andy Murray made the perfect start to his campaign defeating Robin Soderling in straight sets 6-2 6-4. The 23-year-old Scot swept the Swede aside in just one hour and 20 minutes. Murray, who hadn't beaten Soderling since 2006, found the new world number four in curiously sedate mood. Soderling, who won his first Masters title in Paris last weekend, never managed to get going and was comprehensively outplayed. In front of a partisan crowd at the 17,500 capacity arena Murray quickly found his rhythm breaking Soderling in the third and seventh games to establish a 5-2 lead. He made no mistake on his next service game and duly served out the first set in 29 minutes. The second set was closer and Soderling, a semi-finalist here last year, earned himself an opportunity to break in the sixth game, but Murray held his nerve serving an ace. To compound his frustration, Soderling then concluded a messy service game with a double fault, handing Murray a crucial advantage which he never looked like surrendering. The world number five duly served out the match to record his 45th victory of the season. In the opening Group A doubles matches, defending champions Bob and Mike Bryan opened with a 6-3 7-5 win over Jurgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner. Sixth seeds Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski overcame third seeds Lukas Dlouhy and Leander Paes 6-3 7-6.","Roger Federer enjoys comfortable opening 6-1 6-4 victory over Spain's David Ferrer .

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer began the defense of his Australian Open crown with a straight sets victory over Slovakian Lukas Lacko at Melbourne Park on Monday. The world number two took just an hour and 24 minutes to dispatch Lacko 6-1 6-1 6-3 in their first round match on the Rod Laver Arena. Federer, who beat Britain's Andy Murray in last year's final, is chasing his 17th grand slam title and could not have made a more convincing start. ""I thought I played great,"" the Swiss maestro told the official Australian Open website. ""I was able to keep on pressing, you know, put him on the back foot ... That it worked was obviously great. But at the end, I'm obviously very happy."" Australian Open: From nomad to nouveau riche . The unfortunate Lacko, who played world number one and then defending champion Rafael Nadal in the second round last year, was always in trouble after losing the opener 6-1 in just 22 minutes. He trailed 3-0 in the second before daring to break Federer's service for the first and only time only to then lose the next three games. World number 97 Lacko offered stiffer resistance in the third set, but a single break of service was enough for Federer to secure a second round match against Gilles Simon after the Frenchman beat Yen-Hsun Lu of Chinese Tapei 6-7 6-2 6-4 6-2. While Federer breezed through, there were opening round defeats for two seeds, Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Sam Querrey of the United States. Should the Australian Open be played in February? On the comeback trail after injury, 23rd seed Davydenko lost in four sets to German Florian Mayer, who won 6-3 4-6 7-6 6-4. Querrey, ranked 18th, was involved in a thrilling five-setter against world No. 72 Lukasz Kubot from Poland. Kubot trailed two sets to one on court two, but cheered by a big contingent from Poland, hit back to win 5-7 6-2 3-6 6-1 7-6. Gael Monfils looked set to join the list of upsets when he trailed young Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker two sets to love. But the popular Frenchman, who is seeded 12th, battled back on the Hisense Arena for a stunning 6-7 2-6 7-5 6-2 6-1 victory. On the same court, eighth seed Andy Roddick of the United States, showed fine early form with a 6-1 6-2 6-2 victory over Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic. The first night session in Melbourne saw a comfortable straight sets win for third seed and 2009 champion Novak Djokovic. The Serbian eased past Marcel Granollers of Spain 6-1 6-3 6-1 as he bids to reach his second grand slam final in succession after losing to Nadal at the U.S. Open. It earns him a clash against Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Djokovic urged fans to be on their best behavior. Previous Australian Opens have been marred by clashes between Croatian and Serbian supporters after the war between the two countries in the 1990s. ""Well, I just hope that it's not gonna happen,"" Djokovic said. ""It's a very bad image that they send for their countries, you know.""","NEW: Third seed Novak Djokovic beats Marcel Granollers in first night session .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is on track to win his fourth successive grand slam after Marcos Daniel was forced to retire during their first-round match at the Australian Open on Tuesday. World number one Nadal had already opened up a 6-0 5-0 lead before the Brazilian suffered a knee injury after 47 minutes of the match. Nadal, a nine-time major winner, is hoping to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four consecutive Grand Slams. ""I think I played right,"" the 24-year-old told the ATP Tour's website ahead of his next match against American debutant Ryan Sweeting, who is ranked 116th. ""I played some good shots, some long shots. The serve can be a little bit better. That's the only point that I think I can improve."" The Australian Open should be in February! British fifth seed Andy Murray progressed to round two after his opponent also became injured. Murray, who was a beaten finalist in Melbourne last year, led Slovakia's Karol Beck 6-3 6-1 4-2 when the world number 101 succumbed to a shoulder problem. The match lasted for one hour and 42 minutes before Beck withdrew, meaning the 23-year-old Murray will now face Illya Marchenko of the Ukraine who beat Spain's Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo. ""I thought it was a pretty good match,"" said Murray. ""Obviously you'd rather finish the match off without your opponent being hurt, but it does happen quite a lot. So you just have to move on and get yourself ready for the next round."" Juan Martin del Potro scored a victory on his return to Grand Slam action, as he defeated Israel's Dudi Sela 7-6 6-4 6-4. Argentina's Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, has not played in one of the four majors since last year's Melbourne Park tournament after struggling with a wrist injury. ""Today I played good tennis again,"" the former world number four said. ""But I'm really enjoying this week. I met with all the players, especially the top-10 players. They supported me when I was very bad. So now I am face to face with them I can say thank you."" Del Potro will now play the 2006 Australian Open champion Marcos Baghdatis, who beat Slovenia's Grega Zemlja 3-6 7-5 6-1 4-6 6-2. Australia's Lleyton Hewitt and David Nalbandian of Argentina played out a five-set clash which lasted four hours and 48 minutes at the Rod Laver Arena in a rematch of the 2002 Wimbledon final. Nalbandian eventually sealed a 3-6 6-4 3-6 7-6 9-7 victory, with the final set lasting 93 minutes, as he avenged that defeat and also his reverse to Hewitt in the 2005 Austalian Open quarterfinals. Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis will be Nalbandian's second-round opponent after he beat another Australian Marinko Matosevic 6-4 6-2 7-5. France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga came from two sets down to claim a 4-6 2-6 6-2 6-3 6-4 triumph over Philipp Petzschner of Germany. Tsonga, seeded 13th, eventually won the match after 194 minutes to set up a tie against Andreas Seppi after the Italian defeated Arnaud Clement. America's John Isner hit 26 aces on his way to a 6-3 7-6 6-3 win over Florent Serra of France.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Andy Roddick advanced to the quarterfinals of the season-opening Brisbane International in Australia with a 6-4 6-1 triumph over Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov on Wednesday. The 28-year-old recovered from an early break of serve to record his straight-sets victory in 56 minutes. The second seed will now face Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the last eight. World number eight Roddick was pleased with his performance and his ability to execute his game plan at the Pat Rafter Arena. ""The scouting report was that he [Dolgopolov] was aggressive to the point of psychosis at times,"" Roddick told the ATP World Tour's official website. What were the top tennis moments of 2010? ""It was my plan to make him have to come up with those kinds of shots for the better part of a couple of hours and it caught up to him a little bit. Then when it caught up to him it got away from him pretty quickly."" Baghdatis eased past Polish opponent Lukasz Kubot 6-2 6-2 to set up his meeting with the 2003 U.S. Open champion Roddick. American fourth seed Mardy Fish was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Radek Stepanek. The Czech, who won the title in 2009, will next face German seventh seed Florian Mayer.

Elsewhere, John Isner earned a 7-6 4-6 6-4 success against Potito Starace to help edge the U.S. one step closer to the Hopman Cup final after a 2-1 win over Italy in Group B. Bethanie Mattek-Sands gave the American team a 1-0 lead in Perth, with a win over world number seven Francesca Schiavone before the 25-year-old Isner secured an unassailable lead for the pairing. Italy did manage to clinch the final rubber with a 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 10-3  victory in the mixed doubles, winning the match tie-break to keep alive their hopes alive. The U.S. now need to win two rubbers in their match against Britain's Andy Murray and Laura Robson to guarantee their participation in Saturday's final. ""We're in the driver's seat right now,"" Isner, ranked 32 in the world, told the Hopman Cup website. ""But nothing's set in stone that's for sure. ""I know Great Britain is good and France is still good and everybody is still alive so we can't let up any. Hopefully we'll get out of our group and go into the final."" France bounced back from Monday's 3-0 defeat by the U.S. to beat Britain 2-1 with a 6-4 6-2 victory in the decisive doubles. Kristina Mladenovic beat 16-year-old Laura Robson 6-4 3-6 6-0, but world No. 4 Andy Murray leveled the tie with a 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-5) win over Nicolas Mahut before the French gave the UK duo a second successive reverse this week.

"(CNN)  -- Defending champion  Serena Williams will miss the Australian Open in January to give herself more time to recover from foot surgery. The former world number one has not played competitively since winning her fourth Wimbledon crown in July. She sustained the original injury after standing on broken glass at a restaurant shortly after winning her second grand slam of the year and 13th of her glittering career. Williams attempted to come back ahead of the season-ending WTA Championships in Qatar, but had to abandon her attempts after aggravating the injury in training. The American was also due to compete in the Hopman Cup in Australia next month, but in a statement released Thursday said she had been left with no choice but to pull out. She said: ""As I continue to rehabilitate my foot after the second surgery last month, it is with the utmost regret that I am withdrawing from the Hopman Cup and the 2011 Australian Open Championships. ""As I recently learned, pushing myself back into my intense training too early only caused me further injury and damage. ""While I desperately want to be back on the court and competing in the first grand slam tournament of the year, it is imperative for my health that I continue to work with my doctors to ensure my foot heals properly."" Williams dominated the early part of the 2010 season, with victories at the Australian Open and the grass of Wimbledon, but in her absence Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark claimed top spot in the global rankings. Belgian rival Kim Clijsters also claimed the final grand slam of the season at the U.S. Open and the WTA Championships, making her a warm favorite for the Australian Open which kicks off the 2011 season, particularly with Williams sidelined.

"(CNN) -- World No. 3 Novak Djokovic hopes home advantage will give Serbia the edge in the Davis Cup final against France, starting on Friday. Djokovic, Serbia's No. 1 player, has been drawn to face Gilles Simon in the second singles match in Belgrade, following Janko Tipsarevic's opener against Gael Monfils. He comes into the event after losing to eventual winner Roger Federer in the semifinals of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals. ""We're all very excited and can't wait for the first point to start. Hopefully [the home support] will be an advantage for us over our opponents. We are all in good shape, physically and mentally fresh to perform our best tennis,"" the 23-year-old said at Thursday's draw. Simon, once ranked sixth in the world but now down at 42 after suffering with injuries, beat Djokovic in their first encounter in 2008 but has lost all five since. ""I think the pressure I have on my back will for sure help me to forget the crowd is against me. I will see how I will react, but I will be natural so if I have to let my emotions out, I will,"" the 25-year-old Frenchman said. ""Since I was a young child it was a dream to play in the Davis Cup final. Also with my friend, Gael Monfils, it's just unbelievable. I really hope we're going to win the trophy -- that would be perfect."" Monfils, ranked 12th in the world, has a 2-2 record against No. 49 Tipsarevic -- who was Serbia's semifinal hero with two singles victories against the Czech Republic on home soil. ""I know Janko.

"(CNN) -- Third seed Kim Clijsters booked a place in her sixth Australian Open quarterfinal with a straight-sets success over Russia's Ekaterina Makarova Monday. Clijsters, a finalist at Melbourne Park in 2004, needed a tie-break to take the opening set before she clinched a 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 triumph in one hour and 28 minutes. The start of the match was delayed after Portuguese umpire Mariana Alves instructed the unseeded Makarova to change her outfit because a sponsor's logo on her shirt was too large. ""I really felt that I really stayed focused throughout all my matches,"" the 27-year-old Clijsters told the Australian Open's website. ""In a couple I really didn't feel my best out there, but I'm happy with the way that I was playing, but you have to always be a little bit better."" Clijsters, bidding for back-to-back grand slams after retaining her U.S. Open title, will come up against 12th seed Agnieszka Radwanska in the next round. The Pole had to save two match points in her victory against China's Shuai Peng. Radwanska, who has never advanced beyond the quarterfinals of a grand slam, was 4-5 down in the final set before she clinched a 7-5 3-6 7-5 win.

""I thought I was a little bit slow,"" the Russian said. ""A little bit passive at the start, but then I found the right momentum and kept it until the end of the match. I'm happy I won, this year has started well."" The 26-year-old Zvonareva was a beaten finalist at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2010 and has won more matches than any other female player at the last three grand slams.

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott hopes his third Singapore Open title triumph on Monday will act as a springboard for an assault on golf's four major tournaments next year. The Australian completed a final-round 68 after the tournament went into a fifth day following weather disruptions, finishing on 17-under-par 267 -- three shots clear of Denmark's second-placed Anders Hansen. The victory, his first at Sentosa since the Asian Tour event became co-sanctioned by the European Tour last year, launched him back into the top-20 of golf's world rankings. It was the seventh European Tour title of the 30-year-old's career, and he will now turn his attention to claiming a maiden major title in 2011. ""You just want your game to be in good shape when you get to Augusta [the Masters] or the U.S. Open, the British Open, PGA Championship,"" Scott told the tournament's website after following up his 2005 and 2006 successes. ""I haven't prepared myself very successfully over the past years, but I sit back at the end of every year and look back at what I've learnt and how I can do things better. ""If I need to do them differently, I'll do that in a couple of weeks when the season's over."" The Adelaide native reached the top-10 of the rankings in 2005 and the following year achieved his best finish at a major -- tied for third at the U.S. PGA Championship. He spent over 180 weeks among golf's elite, but his form deteriorated in the following few years and he dropped out of the top-50 in 2009. Scott was happy with the form he showed in the rain-affected tournament at the Sentosa Golf Club -- his second success of 2010 after winning the PGA Tour's Valero Texas Open in May -- although he admitted to finding the harsh weather conditions challenging. ""It was a great win but it was a tough week for us. Testing weather conditions with delays and even when we were on the course, it can get uncomfortable at times as it was not easy to play,"" he said.

The Spaniard was selected in Group A in the season-ending event, which sees the top eight players in the world compete against each other. World number two Roger Federer, from Switzerland, has been drawn in Group B alongside Sweden's Robin Soderling, Briton Andy Murray and David Ferrer, of Spain.

In rankings released on Monday, Soderling climbed to fourth after his victory at the Paris Masters on Sunday, and despite Murray slipping to fifth he is hoping home advantage can inspire him in London. He told his website: ""It's an incredible atmosphere, a huge arena and it's one of the biggest competitions in tennis behind the Grand Slams, so I'm really looking forward to it. ""The last couple of weeks weren't as good as I'd have liked, although I actually won my first doubles competition with my brother, which was cool, but playing in front of a home crowd is always great.

"London, England (CNN) -- Roger Federer recorded a resounding 6-4 6-2 win over Britain's Andy Murray in their Group B match at the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in London on Tuesday. Federer wasted little time in exploiting a misfiring Murray, breaking his second service game to love to establish an early 3-1 lead. He never looked back, holding his serve with ease, while continuing to make Murray work for his. Murray sniffed a chance to break back when Federer was serving for the set, taking the first two points of the game. But the 29-year-old regained his composure winning four points on the bounce to take the opening set 6-4. The second set started in the same fashion. Murray working hard just to hold his serve, and a back and forth opening game eventually went Federer's way. Becker backs Federer to be year-end champ . The Swiss, in contrast, continued to hold his service with ease and when Murray went two breaks down to trail 0-3, there was no way back. The 23-year-old avoided the humiliation of a second set whitewash, scrapping his way to two service games. But it only delayed the inevitable as Federer, a four-time winner of the event, closed out the match in style to go top of Group B. Federer, who now has a 6-8 head-to-head record against Murray, admitted his surprise at the margin of victory. ""Andy has beaten me the last few times so I'm surprised how clean the score was today, but I don't think Andy played his best match, that is for sure,"" Federer told BBC Sport. Murray will likely have to beat David Ferrer in his final group match on Thursday if he is to progress to the semi-finals stage. ""I did the two most important things in tennis very poorly today, which is serve and return. Against someone as good as Roger, you can't do them badly. You're not going to win the match and that's why the score line was like it was,"" Murray told BBC Sport. Meanwhile, in the evening match, Robin Soderling won a hard fought straight sets victory over David Ferrer, 7-5 7-5. The first set seemed destined to go to a tie-break as both men held serve for the first 11 eleven games, but Soderling gained the crucial break in the 12th. A curling forehand winner closed out the set for the Swede after 48 minutes. The second set was heading the way of the first it seemed as Soderling and then Ferrer continued to hold serve. Despite some spirited defence from the Spaniard in the fifth game, Soderling prevailed to take a 4-2 lead, which quickly became 5-2. With defeat and an early exit from the competition looming, Ferrer burst into life winning the next three games to draw level. But Soderling regained his form while Ferrer's waned and the Swede completed his first win at this year's event. ""I played well last year and I've enjoyed coming back. I'm very relieved. It was tough. I served very well but I have a few things I need to improve,"" Soderling told BBC Sport after the match.

"(CNN) -- British Formula One team Williams will have an all-South American line-up next year, with Pastor Maldonado signing up to drive alongside Rubens Barrichello. Maldonado will be the first Venezuelan since Johnny Cecotto in 1984 to drive an F1 car when he lines up alongside Brazilian veteran Barrichello at the Bahrain Grand prix in March. The 25-year-old takes the seat of young German Nico Hulkenberg, who left after being unable to agree a new contract following his successful rookie year. Maldonado won the GP2 Series title this year, becoming the first driver to win six successive races, and tested for Williams in Abu Dhabi. ""I will be doing my best over the winter to prepare myself, and I know the team will be working hard to ensure a successful season,"" he told the Williams website on Thursday. ""2011 will be the first time in nearly 30 years that a Venezuelan has driven a Formula One car, so I will be looking to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today."" A seven-time national kart champion, he won at Monaco in his debut GP2 season in 2007. ""Since then, he has regularly reminded us of his unquestionable talent with some skilful wins, particularly during this year's GP2 championship,"" team principal Frank Williams said. ""Of course, we already know Pastor from the time he spent with the team at the Abu Dhabi test, but we are very much looking forward to developing his talent over the winter and a fruitful season with him next year.""","Pastor Maldonado will be the first Venezuelan to drive in F1 since the 1980s .

"(CNN)  -- Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen have kept their places in the rebranded Team Lotus line-up for the 2011 Formula One season. Italian Trulli and Finn Kovalainen were the line-up for Lotus Racing last season as a team bearing the name of the famous marque returned to the world championship for the first time since 1994. The 36-year-old Trulli is preparing for his 15th season in F1, racing for six different teams, winning his only grand prix in Monaco in 2004 with Renault. Former McLaren star Kovalainen claimed the new team's best result in 2011 when he finished 12th in Japan, but suffered a heavy crash in Sunday's Race of Champions. He was knocked unconscious and he wrote on his Twitter blog: ""I've been put to bed-rest at home as a precaution, heavy concussion, further tests in the next few days as head took a big hit."" The Team Lotus, who are sponsored by CNN, line-up was confirmed as the sports's governing body, the FIA, released the provisional drivers' list for the 2011 season. Force India, Toro Rosso, Hispania and the renamed Marussia Virgin Racing have yet to confirm their driver line-ups. Williams announced Tuesday that Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado has been drafted in to drive alongside Rubens Barrichello, although he is not included on the initial list. He would replace German Nico Hulkenberg, whose contract was not renewed. Renault have named only Robert Kubica after Russian Vitaly Petrov's seat was placed into question after an inconsistent first season. The leading teams of Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari have, as expected, unchanged line-ups. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel claimed the 2010 world title and paired with Mark Webber to help the team win the constructors' crown.","Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen confirmed in Lotus team for 2011 F1 season .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton is confident the return of the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) to McLaren cars for the 2011 Formula One season will give the team a big advantage over their rivals. The system -- which stores up energy created when a car brakes to enhance the vehicle's acceleration -- was first used in the sport in 2009, and teams such McLaren and Ferrari used it to great effect. The technology was banned in 2010 as a cost-cutting measure, however, the device will return to F1 next year after a more affordable solution was found and 2008 champion Hamilton believes McLaren's version is the finest on the grid. ""Our KERS is the best. It shud [should] deliver,"" the 25-year-old wrote on his Twitter blog Tuesday. Hamilton's teammate and compatriot Jenson Button also hoped the energy-saving modification could help the team to get the better of Ferrari and 2010 constructors' title winners Red Bull. ""I've never driven with KERS before, but this team used KERS last year and used it well, I know because they kept coming by me at the start!"" the former Brawn GP driver said during a McLaren web chat. ""They have so much experience in that area that I think we'll have an advantage - as will Mercedes and Force India, who use Mercedes engines. ""We'll have an advantage on Red Bull and Ferrari I think, which is great. We'll take every advantage we possibly can."" McLaren finished the season second in the constructors' standings, 44 points behind first-placed Red Bull with Ferrari in third place.

"(CNN) -- Spain's Dani Pedrosa will miss the Malaysian MotoGP on Sunday, after the rider broke his collarbone in practice for the Grand Prix in Japan last week. Pedrosa's absence means championship leader Jorge Lorenzo will now only have to finish in the top 10 at the race in Sepang, in order to be crowned 2010 champion. Respol Honda racer Pedrosa suffered a double fracture of the collarbone in Motegi, and has subsequently undergone surgery. It was thought that the 25-year-old, who currently lies in second place behind Lorenzo in the MotoGP standings, might have recovered in time to challenge for the championship in Malaysia. However, in an announcement on the sport's website on Thursday his team confirmed he would not be racing. ""Pedrosa has made the understandable decision to stay at home to continue his recovery,"" the statement from Respol Honda read. ""The target for his return remains the Australian Grand Prix, practice for which begins on October 15."" The team also confirmed that they would not be fielding a replacement driver for the race, leaving Italy's Andrea Dovizioso as their sole representative. With Pedrosa not competing, Yamaha driver Lorenzo is now more than 100 points clear of his nearest challenger -- Australian Ducati driver Casey Stoner.

"(CNN)  -- It has all the right ingredients for a tense situation: Scorching hot weather. Relentless humidity. Sidewalks, subways and hotels packed to capacity. Long lines. Nerds and jocks. But instead of being a pressure cooker, downtown Atlanta, Georgia, is serving up a huge party. Labor Day weekend finds the city of Atlanta host to several well-attended events, including Nascar, Georgia Tech's season opening football game, the Decatur Book Festival and Atlanta Black Gay Pride. The weekend's two largest events, DragonCon and the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, happen only a few blocks away from each other, essentially taking over the downtown area. Atlanta's long-established science fiction and fantasy convention DragonCon and Chick-fil-A's college football extravaganza are the strangest of bedfellows. Event organizers and attendees readily admit that three years ago, the first pairing of DragonCon and the kickoff game was as an awkward, giggly mashup of Storm Troopers and face-painted alumni. But all are quick to point out that it didn't take long for fans to foster an enthusiastic weekend of unabashed celebration and mutual respect. ""It's kind of like the ultimate pop culture weekend,"" said Katie Wall, a digital marketing consultant. ""Where else can you find a place full of sci-fi and fantasy fans next to beer-guzzling football fans, all decked out in their school colors? It's like everyone's in costume for the weekend. ""But I think at the end of the day it's just a lot of people getting excited about what they love and coming together to celebrate it with other people who love the same thing,"" she said. ""I don't know that there's so much of a difference, except that we'll all be wearing Carolina Blue and they'll all be wearing costumes."" The University of North Carolina will be playing Louisiana State University in the big game. Kris Harter, a chemist and DragonCon attendee, says it's not always easy for the two groups to get along, but there's enough room for everyone. ""I think they are as amicable as possible with each other,"" Harter said. She says that three years on, DragonCon attendees are more accepting of the football fans and are joining in during the buildup toward the game. ""They're more willing to say 'Roll Tide!' or 'Go War Eagles!' or 'Geaux Tigers!' which you'll hear a lot of this weekend,"" she said. As early as Thursday night, people dressed in Steampunk garb were checking into hotels next to people dressed in purple and gold or Carolina blue. And the organizers of the two events are digging the vibe. ""The truth is, most of DragonCon attendees have a college football preference. It's not the old style stereotype of someone who's reading comic books and avoiding sports or not caring about sports, it's someone who's reading comic books while they're watching sports. I've had a running e-mail chain for weeks with the chairman of DragonCon about ACC versus SEC,"" said DragonCon spokesman Dan Carroll. Chick-fil-A Bowl president and CEO Gary Stokan sent an open invitation to DragonCon attendees for exactly that reason. ""We've reached out to them this year to say, 'Hey, you have your parade, if you want to come down to Centennial Olympic Park [for the ESPN College Game Day broadcast prior to the Kickoff Game] let's get the groups together and see what happens here,'"" Stokan said. ""I actually know they'll be getting a lot of takers,"" Carroll said. ""We do have a group that's all ready to go right after the parade. A lot of people [will be] in costume, and we're going to be going over to ESPN, to their Game Zone area by the stadium, and just getting to meet some of the football fans."" Sometimes called ""Comic Con's little brother,"" but fiercely defended by attendees as the country's most fan-oriented convention, DragonCon had more than 30,000 preregistered guests as of Thursday night, Carroll said. Celebrities on the Con circuit anticipate an attendance closer to 70,000 people this year, based on over-packed hotel rooms and local visitors. ""It's not intimate. It's not a small convention,"" Harter said. Because it's so massive, DragonCon attendees need to prepare, Harter said. ""First thing on my list, a good pair of shoes. ""You definitely need to bring your patience. There are long lines, there's a lot of people, you definitely need to fight your way through crowds. And you need to bring something nerdy,"" she said. Harter suggests wearing a T-shirt with a nerdy quote on it (like one from ""The Big Bang Theory"" that says ""Bazinga,"" or ""See DOS run"") or a costume. Bringing food can also be advantageous for long lines, she said. This year the convention spans four of downtown's largest hotels. Sharing some of those packed rooms will be the close to 20,000 LSU and UNC fans in town for the Kickoff Game. Stokan said they are still selling tickets and hopes this year will be another sold-out game.","What happens when nerds and jocks share Atlanta for Labor Day weekend?

"(CNN) -- A onetime contestant on ""The Dating Game"" was sentenced to die Tuesday for murdering four women and a child, Orange County, California, officials said. Rodney Alcala, 66, was convicted in February of kidnapping and murdering a 12-year-old girl and raping and murdering four Los Angeles County women in the 1970s. ""Losing Robin, we lost so many things,"" said Marianne Connelly, the mother of Robin Samsoe, 12, whom authorities said Alcala murdered in 1979. ""We didn't get to watch her grow up. We didn't get to see her graduate high school or college, see her have a dance career, get married and/or have children,"" Connelly told the court Tuesday. ""He took her life, her future and our joy."" Deidreann Parenteau, Jill Parenteau's sister, said she never understood why her sister had to die at Alcala's hands. ""If there is a hell, I hope Rodney Alcala burns eternally,"" she told the court. ""I wish he would experience the terror that he put his victims through."" The crimes took place between November 1977 and June 1979, and covered a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles, California, from Burbank to El Segundo, authorities said. A jury recommended this month that Alcala receive the death penalty. He was found guilty February 25 of murder, kidnapping and an array of sexual offenses. He acted as his own attorney during the penalty phase of the trial. In 1978, Alcala was a winning bachelor on the television show ""The Dating Game."" At the time, he had been convicted in the 1968 rape of an 8-year-old girl, authorities said. He served a 34-month sentence. A year earlier, according to the Orange County district attorney, Alcala had raped, sodomized and killed two women: Jill Barcomb, an 18-year-old New Yorker who had recently moved to California, and Georgia Wixted, a 27-year-old nurse. The district attorney said Alcala used a large rock to smash in Barcomb's face and then ""strangled her to death by tying a belt and pant leg around her neck."" Her body was left in a mountainous area in the foothills near Hollywood. Wixted was beaten with the claw end of a hammer, the district attorney said. Alcala ""strangled her to death using a nylon stocking and left her body in her Malibu apartment,"" according to the district attorney's Web site. On ""The Dating Game,"" Alcala -- who was introduced as a ""successful photographer"" who might also be found sky diving or motorcycling -- succeeded in charming bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from behind a wall. ""Who will it be?"" the host asked Bradshaw at the end. ""I'll take One,"" she said, and Alcala strode out. Three more murders followed Alcala's appearance on the show, the district attorney said. In June 1979, he beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, with her shoelace in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, according to the district attorney's office. The case was investigated but went cold. The same month, according to the district attorney's office, Alcala raped and murdered 21-year-old Parenteau in her Burbank apartment. She was also strangled with a cord or nylon. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling out a window, the district attorney said. ""Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder,"" the district attorney said. Though he was charged with murdering Parenteau, the case was dismissed after his first conviction in the Samsoe case. In that 1979 case, Alcala approached the 12-year-old at the beach in Huntington Beach and asked her to pose for pictures, the district attorney said. She did and then rode off on her bicycle to dance class. She never made it. ""The defendant kidnapped and murdered Samsoe and dumped her body near Sierra Madre in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains,"" the district attorney said. Alcala was convicted in 1980 of Samsoe's murder and was sentenced to death, but the conviction was overturned by the California State Supreme Court. A second trial in 1986 also resulted in a conviction and death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. As he awaited a third trial, Alcala's DNA was linked to the crime scenes in the Barcomb, Wixted and Lamb cases. He was charged with the four Los Angeles murders, including Parenteau's. Police investigating Alcala discovered dozens of photographs of women and children in a storage unit he kept in Seattle, Washington. The locker also contained earrings belonging to Samsoe, according to the Orange County district attorney's office. Police have asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs are victims of Alcala's.","Rodney Alcala convicted last month in deaths of four women, child .

"(CNN) -- One of the exhibits at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry has come to life, literally. It's reminiscent of the wildly popular ""Night at the Museum,"" movies, except this is real. Twenty-four-year-old Kate McGroarty is living at the museum for a month, roaming the large 14-acre space, exploring every nook and cranny at all hours of the day and night, sleeping where she wants, and basically seeing sights that most people never get to see. McGroarty won a ""Month at the Museum"" promotional contest, beating out 1,500 other applicants for the opportunity to call the museum home for a few weeks. She won based in part on her answer to a question about how a month in a museum could change or transform a person's life. ""I've always loved this museum, and I've always really loved adventure. And I'm hugely passionate about education, and I saw this as really interesting social experiment and an interesting education-through-social-media kind of experiment,"" says, McGroarty, who will get $10,000 at the end of her month-long stay. Museum of Science Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Rob Gallus concedes that the ""Night at the Museum"" movies were part of the whole ""whimsy"" of the Month at the Museum promotion. ""Everybody wonders, 'Wow, what would I do if I were alone in the museum at night? Where would I go? What would I see? What strange things do happen after dark in the museum?'"" says Gallus. McGroarty, who works for a travel company in Chicago as well as working in local theater, moved into the largest science center in the Western Hemisphere last week. She has a couple of private rooms near the museum's administrative offices and a large, glass cube science office. It's her exhibit display case on the museum's main level, where she updates her daily online blog and tweets about what she's learning and seeing. ""She has unlimited access to every nook and cranny of the museum. She can sleep on the U-505 submarine or in the smart home. She can get to all those out of the way places that people can't get to,"" Gallus told CNN Radio. Her meals are catered, and she can leave the museum as needed for errands or other reasons. Part of McGroarty's responsibilities for the month require that she mingle with museum guests. And she says that's been a lot of fun. She's become a sort of rock star of sorts, with crowds flocking to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry to see her and follow her online. ""I love, love interacting with the school groups that come by. They have the best questions,"" she says. ""They're so inquisitive. They're so energetic. I love them. And just seeing how they react to all the exhibits is so exciting for me."" At night, museum staff members are on duty as are the usual security personnel, but in the sprawling complex they may be under the same roof yet not-so-near at the same time. ""It is a completely different world,"" says McGroarty. ""It's not spooky. If anything it's just a very quick and hard transition from there being so many people -- like on Saturday, we had 4,200 people in attendance. Then to go from that to just the security staff -- it's a big staff, but it's also an enormous museum. So you can walk around for long periods of time without seeing absolutely anyone. I wouldn't call it scary. I would say it is a different kind of experience, maybe a little bit spooky, but nothing to keep me in my room at night."" McGroarty doesn't have a set schedule of displays or exhibits she plans to explore during her month-long adventure, but she said she does have one very definite must-do before her adventure is over. She plans to climb to the top of the museum's dome to see the sunrise over Lake Michigan. McGroarty explains, ""I've found that a key part of this program is trying to find a balance between experience and exploring things, and then interacting with people who are physically at the museum and interacting with people who are in the online community."" McGroarty, originally from Minnesota, attended Northwestern University in Illinois and majored in theater. She graduated two years ago and has spent time teaching, performing and writing. She laughingly jokes, ""I'm not certain if anyone ever had this particular job in mind."" McGroarty says the whole experience, so far, has been very overwhelming. She's shot to sudden fame -- she's getting tweets from people around the country who are following her adventures in the museum. ""Last night I was talking to a woman who said that her daughter, her 7-year-old daughter, is so into this, she comes home every day and checks to see if I've made a blog update,"" says McGroarty. ""This is day five. And she has to tell her daughter that she has to finish her homework before she can read my blog post.""","Kate McGroarty won a promotion contest to spend a month in a museum .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The recent news item about a Connecticut worker fired for Facebook postings that annoyed her employer, like other accounts of employees sacked for private speech, was bound to draw a lot of attention. Americans hold First Amendment rights to free speech as a kind of sacrosanct birthright, and for many of us the idea that you can lose your job for expressing private thoughts away from work offends the core principle of freedom of expression. In fact, though, firing a worker for off-the-job speech that unsettles an employer is pretty routine, and for the most part very legal. The First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights protect us from infringements on our liberties by acts of government, not from the oppressive acts of nongovernmental actors such as private-sector employers. Combine that with the labor law concept of ""employment at will,"" which makes it possible to fire someone without due process for just about anything short of discrimination, and you are left with an American workplace where free expression has scarcely more moral credibility than employee theft. A particularly eye-catching example is an Alabama woman who lost her job -- with no legal recourse -- during the 2004 election season because her Republican boss didn't like the John Kerry bumper sticker on her car in the factory parking lot. Widespread use by just about everyone of online networks and social media opens new opportunities for workers to engage in personal expressive activity that might arouse the notice and disapproval of one's employer, and by extension opportunities for touchy or paranoid employers to police and punish essentially harmless extracurricular speech. So in a sense, the situation involving Dawnmarie Souza, the Connecticut emergency medical technician fired by an ambulance services firm for posting negative comments about her boss on Facebook, is just the latest skirmish in an ongoing conflict between employers' desire to keep workers in line and the rights of employees to live their private expressive lives without unwarranted employer interference. But there's a wrinkle that makes this case important: the involvement of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which contends that Souza's Facebook comments could be protected activity under labor law. Americans don't enjoy general free speech protections against infringement by a private employer (with some limited exceptions, such as certain kinds of whistle-blowing). But federal labor law does grant union-eligible workers the right to engage in ""concerted activity"" for the purpose of ""mutual aid or protection"" -- essentially, to communicate with each other about working conditions and terms of employment. Those same federal laws bar employers from interfering with workers' efforts to improve their work situations. If Souza had dissed her boss in, say, a blog post or a letter to the editor, her expressive act would likely earn no protection against her employer's wrath. But on Facebook her comments catalyzed responses from and interaction with some of her co-workers. That online ""conversation"" involving Souza and other employees of the same firm is what the NLRB alleges could amount to protected concerted activity. If the courts agree (at this point it's just a charge by the NLRB, with a hearing slated for early next year) then Souza's dismissal was illegal. When this case does reach a courtroom, lawyers will tussle over the nature of social media sites. Does interaction within a closed Facebook circle of friends amount to private conversation, or are negative comments about one's job or boss on Facebook the equivalent of a public statement that could affect a firm's reputation? Does it matter how big one's network is? How many co-workers have to chime in to the conversation to make it ""concerted"" activity? Until this works its way through the courts, employment lawyers are advising corporate clients to ensure that employee policies regarding internet use are not written so broadly that they chill workers' exercise of their associational rights under labor law. Souza's situation turns more on labor law protections than on constitutional free-speech rights because she worked for a private-sector employer. The First Amendment does afford more protection to public-sector workers, but government employees reading this shouldn't get their hopes up. Federal court decisions along with developments in management practice have combined to make even the public-sector workplace rather inhospitable to employee free-speech claims. Consider the cautionary tale of Ashley Payne, a Georgia public school teacher forced to resign last year when administrators learned in an anonymous email about pictures of her on Facebook holding an alcoholic beverage during a trip to Europe. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Payne kept her network settings private, and never friended any students. A year later, as her case crawls through the legal system and she awaits her day in court, Payne is still unable to find a teaching position. A common reaction among working professionals to stories such as Souza's and Payne's is to advise people to manage their online presence and their digital footprints more carefully and prudently. Avoid giving your employer a reason to frown on your online expressive activity, goes the argument, even when you do it on your own time, on your own device, and on private networks. This is reasonable advice to the extent that it equates to ""avoid being really stupid,"" but it's unfortunate advice if it counsels individuals to suppress their own private expressive life as a career strategy. To be sure, employers need not tolerate any and all extracurricular speech by workers that might genuinely pose a legitimate threat to the firm's interests or to its workplace harmony. If I worked for CNN, with a spare-time hobby maintaining the web site timewarnerisevil.com, it certainly shouldn't behoove my employer to retain my services in the name of some abstract notion of off-work freedom of personal expression. Employers need not allow workplaces to become debating societies or free-for-alls for hostility and harassment. But it's troublesome when employers favor a management culture so bent on predictability and control that even mild or tangential departures from expressive conformity are treated with suspicion and rebuke. Employees will kvetch about jobs and bosses until the day there no longer are jobs and bosses, and enlightened employers understand that new technological vehicles for said kvetching will inevitable emerge and evolve. Holding a job should not require giving up your right to an expressive private life, even if you might be prone to the occasional untoward remark about the people who sign your paycheck. Cultivating a thin-skinned managerial impulse to treat workers' expressive activities as existential threats to the enterprise isn't how you manage a workforce; it's how you chase talent away to your competitors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Barry.","Bruce Barry: Losing private-sector job over a Facebook remark doesn't violate freedom of speech .

"(CNN) -- Aaron Douglas, better known as ""Chief Tyrol"" on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" is a Dragon*Con veteran. Well known for being open with fans and the life of the Dragon*Con party, Douglas made a pit-stop at CNN to answer some of our BSG-fan questions. CNN: Had you seen the original BSG before taking the role? Aaron Douglas: Absolutely, I grew up on the original BSG, I grew up on ""Star Wars."" The great thing about ""Battlestar"" was that it was basically ""Star Wars"" but once a week, as opposed to waiting for three years for the movie to come out. I was a huge ""Battlestar"" fan. CNN: Tell us about when you first auditioned for ""Battlestar Galactica"" -- was it for the part of Capt. Tyrol? Douglas: No, no I originally auditioned for the part of Apollo (Capt. Lee Adama) which Jamie Bamber got, which is good because Bamber has to go to the gym and I never did. That was good for me. And my callback was for [the role of] Lt. Gaeta, which went to Alessandro, who's great. He's a great actor and he can do the tech talk really well. When they got to the end of the casting there was just no one for the Chief, this Tyrol character that they had left, and David Eick [one of the creators of the show] said, ""Why don't we get Aaron to do this?"" because David had seen my auditions and quite liked me. So, they offered me this and it grew into what it was. CNN: At what point did you find out that your character was a Cylon? [a robot] . Douglas: Officially, the day before we started shooting it. But we shot that scene in December, and I had seen some papers that I wasn't supposed to see over at [director] Michael Rymer's house, in September. So I had to sit very quietly for three months, not say a word, furious the whole time. And constantly walking past Ron Moore and David Eick, who are the creators of the show, and say, ""So, anything coming up for the Chief?"" And they'd say, ""Oh no, just fixing vipers, just the usual."" Just lying to me! So we finally found out officially and I got Ron [Moore] on the phone, yelled at him for five minutes and then he talked me off the ledge and convinced me that it was a good thing, and he was right. CNN: Did you suspect that you might be one of the Cylons? Douglas: God, no. Absolutely not. I thought that the great thing about the Tyrol character is he's such a human, and I guess if they want to humanize the Cylons there's no better character to do it than him and Col. Tigh, but I did not see it coming. I thought it was going to be new people revealed, I didn't think that it was going to be cast revealed to be. CNN: Did you draw inspiration for your own character from having watched the original BSG? Douglas: No, my character wasn't in the original BSG, and I don't really know how I do what I do. I literally, I just show up and I say the words as simply as I can. I have a new show now called ""The Bridge,"" where I  play a guy who's a real-life guy. My character's based on the life of a guy named Craig Bromell who was a cop for 12 years and then became head of the police association, so basically the president of the union for 85,000 cops. It was the decision to either play it like him or just play it as I see it, so I just play stuff as I see it. CNN: What were your thoughts about the ending of BSG? Douglas: I loved it. Other than, what the hell was Starbuck? I still don't know what Starbuck was. But I loved the ending, I thought it was a brilliant piece of writing, certainly Ron's opus. There was no better way to end it. And I love the fact that the Chief just walks off and goes up to Scotland and lives alone. Yep, makes whiskey and builds castles and herds sheep. Yeah. CNN: Was ""The Bridge"" your next project, then? Douglas: I literally wrapped the last day of Battlestar, I wrapped at 5 a.m. on Friday and on Monday I was on a plane to Toronto to start the new show. So, yeah, there wasn't much of a break. CNN: How would you compare the character you're playing now to Chief Tyrol? Douglas: You know, they're very similar guys. They're both blue-collar guys, they're both in charge of a group of people that they are fiercely loyal to, they will do whatever it takes to get the right thing done, they're both very flawed, which makes them interesting to watch and interesting to play, they're two guys that you could definitely go to a ball game and have a beer and make fun of people around you. CNN: How did you get into acting in the first place? Douglas: My mom says that when I was a little kid I always used to say I wanted to be an actor, but I don't remember that. I remember in high school thinking that I wanted to be a lawyer, and now I realize I saw that movie ""And Justice for All"" when I was a kid and thought, ""That's what lawyers do, and I want to get up and yell and scream in the middle of a courtroom."" I want to be a lawyer on TV is what I finally figured out. I fell into it late. I think I was 27 or 28. I was working with a sports nutrition company doing diets for athletes and I met a guy who was working on his nutrition and he was an actor. I eventually quit my job and went back to theater school and that was it, the rest is history. CNN: Besides acting, what are your hobbies? Douglas: Sitting quietly and reading a book. I play hockey, I'm a goalie, so people fire pucks at me. And I like to golf and I travel, I travel a lot. But mostly I'm a pretty quiet guy. I just kind of go home and hide away. CNN: I see you're wearing a shirt that says ""Chronicles of the Nerds."" Douglas: ""Chronicles of the Nerds,"" yeah! These are some friends of mine from Oregon that have a website, chroniclesofthenerds.com. I have literally almost 400 T-shirts, because everywhere I go the fans know I like T-shirts. So they're constantly giving me T-shirts. So, any time I get a chance to plug one of my friends or plug a band or something like that, I like to wear their shirts. And the fans think it's really cool. So when I'm at ComicCon or Dragon*Con I'll switch shirts throughout the day, so people get pictures. CNN: You were at Dragon*Con last year, right? Douglas: I've been at Dragon*Con, I think five of the last six years. I love coming here. It's unbelievable fun. Last year I came as a fan. I snuck in. I didn't do any panels except for the one that I crashed.  I didn't sign or do anything, I just wanted to experience it from the fan's point of view, and it was really, really cool. I come here with, literally, like 25 friends and we take over an entire floor of the hotel and we just have a blast, it's a great place. It's like Vegas without the gambling. CNN: What's your favorite part of Dragon*Con? Douglas: The best times are usually in one of our rooms, where we're all just sitting around having a drink and just laughing our faces off. It's just hilarity for four or five days. It's just hanging out with friends. I travel so much and I work so much and we're all from such disparate parts of the country in different jobs. It's hard for us all to get in the same place at the same time and Dragon*Con creates a good venue for that. CNN: Anything you want to say to your fans? Douglas: Everybody, go to CNN.com every day! Every, frackin day!","Aaron Douglas auditioned for 2 parts on ""Battlestar Galactica"" before landing role of Chief Tyrol .

"(CNN) -- Actress and filmmaker Ricki Lake has a special connection to CNN Heroes. Her friend and onetime nanny, Marie Da Silva, was chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2008 for her work starting a school for AIDS orphans in her native Malawi. Lake sat down with CNN Entertainment senior producer Denise Quan to talk about CNN Heroes. Below are excerpts from that interview. Denise Quan: You have a very personal connection with Marie Da Silva, don't you? Ricki Lake: Well, let me just say that I'm the one who discovered Marie. I knew! No, Marie was my employee; she worked as my nanny for a decade. I knew from the second Marie walked in to the interview there was something special about her. She leads her life in such a positive way that she's just a great example for me. Quan: So besides the personal connection, why is this cause so important to you? Lake: My grandfather died of AIDS back in the late '80s, when a blood transfusion in a hospital could give you HIV and AIDS. So I'm personally, obviously, connected to this disease and wanting to find a cure. But then you look at continents like Africa and how the population is completely annihilated by it. With Marie, to see her family members that have succumbed to the disease and the children in her village that are all left behind -- not only without parents, but without an education -- it just seems like an obvious cause to get behind. And it's just remarkable when you think of what one person, a nanny of all professions, was able to do while working for me full time. To me, Marie's picture is in the dictionary next to the word ""hero."" Quan: This is your third year of involvement with CNN Heroes -- . Lake: Riding Marie's coattails. [laughter] Yes, I'm so appreciative of all that you guys do and personally how I've been affected by what you do. Quan: How have you been inspired by some of the CNN Heroes that you've met? Lake: They're amazing. The fact that they do so much in their own lives, it's like they're so separate but so organically similar. There are so many parallels about these remarkable people that give so much of themselves to help others for very little fanfare. That's what I love about this event. It gives this, you know, just due recognition, knowing firsthand what Marie did pre-CNN Heroes acknowledgment, and post. She's been able to build a secondary school. Now they have a school bus. Now her goal is to change the curriculum of AIDS education in all of Africa. It feels like none of that would have been possible without the exposure that CNN Heroes has given her. Quan: Why do you think celebrities like you keep coming back to help us out, year after year? Lake: I think we're all inspired. We're all just regular people and want to do our part. I want to be close to what you guys are doing, I want to do more. I can't wait to see who's being honored this year. I look forward to that night and just being a part of it. Being there live, it's in your blood, you know? You just feel like you're walking on air to meet these people. Quan: Why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes? Lake: We all could use a little inspiring. To see what our neighbor is doing to help others, I think, makes us do better and be better. It makes you feel good. It makes you feel like you're doing something worthwhile. We all can do a lot more than we're doing.","Marie Da Silva, a top 10 CNN Hero in 2008, was once a nanny for actress Ricki Lake .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Sandeep Parikh, Jeff Lewis and Sean Becker were fresh from their raucous ""The Guild"" panel at Dragon*Con when they sat down with CNN to answer our fan-oriented questions. It was their first time at Dragon*Con, and the crowds did not disappoint. One fan in the question line even dressed as Lewis' ""Vork"" character from the ""Game On"" video, eight arms and all! Here's what they had to say about ""The Guild,"" gaming and what happens when Felicia Day makes you play ""World of Warcraft."" CNN: How psyched were all of you when the ""Game On"" video bumped Katy Perry off the top of iTunes? Parikh: Stoked! Lewis: I'm OK with, I mean, I don't hate Katy Perry. Parikh: I did get to tweet something like, ""I finally got on top of Katy Perry."" Becker: I screen-grabbed the hell out of that page on iTunes. Parikh: It's just so cool. We don't have a record label; we don't have anyone besides ourselves, Felicia, Kim, George Ruiz and some other folks that are pushing our show. It's very grass-roots. Microsoft [""The Guild"" sponsor] is not like, ""here's a budget for marketing."" It doesn't really happen. I mean, they do some internal marketing, but ultimately it's up to us to push our own stuff. So, to be in the same breath as, you know, Justin Bieber and all these people and to watch our video climb the charts ... Becker: We've done the work, and now it's the fans who are deciding and buying. I mean, it happened with ""Date My Avatar,"" too. That was No. 1. We got No. 1 on Pop. Parikh: We were 2 overall; we couldn't beat Kenny Chesney. Becker: Who came out with a video the exact same day about football. Lewis: Nobody can beat him. Becker: And we put that thing together in like a month total, from writing it to recording it to filming it to editing it. It had to be quick. And it was in the middle of all the season four stuff we were currently doing, too. So it was really ambitious, but I think we're all happy with how it turned out. CNN: Fans will want to know, what did Zaboo do with the dancers once it was all over? Parikh: With the hour that I had them for, or the 58 minutes that I had left on the clock? We had some improvs where I was like, ""I don't pay them not to dance, DANCE!!"" I don't know, I think Zaboo probably just kind of danced around with them, learned more about their history and background, took blood samples and, like, added them to his database. Becker: Sounds like another viral hit! Parikh: That's what I think Zaboo would do. He's very friendly, so he would want to get to know them. He would just ask very invasive, personal questions. CNN: Sandeep and Jeff, you both do a very good job portraying very specific types of gamers. How did you research your roles? Lewis: For me, I didn't really understand a lot of the stuff when I read the pilot, so I went on and played. Felicia got me membership into it, into ""World of Warcraft,"" and I went on and played. And I came back a few weeks later and said, ""Oh, now I understand it. Now I understand the phrases and the words and all that stuff, all the three-letter things that people say."" Parikh: QQ more nub [which in ""World of Warcraft"" circles is a way of making fun of new players. The two Qs look like crying eyes.] And for me, I read a lot of fantasy and grew up playing some RPG games and some Ultima and stuff like that. I didn't play WoW specifically. In fact, I specifically stayed away from it because I didn't want the addiction. And someone had already written a funny show about it, so I couldn't turn that addiction into something profitable, like Felicia [Day] did. So I didn't play WoW specifically, but I knew all the terms, roughly what they meant, and Felicia filled us in with stuff we didn't know. But we all got subscriptions. The president of Blizzard [the game company that distributes ""World of Warcraft""] was a fan of the show after the first couple seasons. We got a tour, and everybody there was awesome to us. They were into it and into the show. That was cool. And we all got free subscriptions to play around and got hooked for a little while. I can say that I'm not hooked on WoW anymore. It was intense for about two months, but then the real world came calling. I like to play games that I can beat, that have a beginning, middle and end. So that's what I play these days, mostly XBox stuff. CNN: So none of you mentioned ""Ever-crack."" Parikh: Yeah, I stayed away from ""EverQuest"" too. We actually appeared in the ""EverQuest"" documentary called ""EverCrack."" We shot on set of ""The Guild"" just a tiny little thing where we're playing hard-core fans with the creators of ""EverQuest."" But I didn't actually get into that game either. ""EverQuest"" was really hot during the end of my college years, so I was like trying to get good grades. But if that stuff was out in high school, I would have been toast. CNN: Of you three, who has the maddest keyboard skills, and who has the maddest controller skills? Becker: I have zero keyboard skills. I don't play any computer games. I only play console stuff. Lewis: I have the keyboard skills, just for playing WoW for a year straight after I got addicted. So, definitely me. Parikh: I don't know, I played like the old, the ""King's Quests"" and those games, so my keyboard skills are probably pretty raw. Now, I like playing with my XBox and my Wii. Soon, hopefully, I'll have no controller and be playing with that new thing Microsoft has, Kinect, which would be rad. Lewis: Yeah, I've been switching over to XBox and DS and PSP . Parikh: We sound like total ... Becker: Let's name every system. Lewis: Yeah, I've got an N64. Becker: Virtual boy. Parikh: See, I feel like I have to segment my life. My computer is for work/stalking my friends on Facebook. And my console is for gaming. CNN: How do you create buzz for your online series? Now that ""The Guild"" and ""The Legend of Neil"" have momentum behind them, is it easier now than it used to be? Becker: The audience for ""The Guild"" has continued to grow and grow and grow, but at first it was just a community of gamers. Then it was people outside of gaming. I direct the show, and I don't play ""Warcraft."" I've never played ""Warcraft,"" and I'm a big fan of the show. I understand the characters and what's going on, and I have a lot of friends who do the exact same. But one thing we've been doing lately are these music videos. When ""Do you want to date my avatar"" came out, all of a sudden we had a whole new crop of people who saw the video and loved it, but they didn't know that it was part of a show. And then now we've got the ""Game On"" video, which did the same thing -- people just wanted to watch this fun video, but then it's like, ""oh, wait, this is part of a series."" Lately, people have been -- even here at Dragon*Con -- people tell me, ""Oh, I just got into your show."" Parikh: Whether it's through Netflix or XBox, every new place we distribute we find new fans. Becker: Actually, the Netflix thing is huge, because people take it more seriously. You may look at it and think, ""oh, this is just a Web show,"" but then you see, ""this is a Netflix show,"" and it's on a DVD. Parikh: And it holds up. You watch it on your TV, and it's shot very well, it's lit well, and it can look like a TV show, really, or a movie. So keeping the production value very high is important. Lewis: And we're lucky, too. The next projects we do from this day forward, we can ride the coattails of ""The Guild."" We have the fanbase, so we can do the online buzz, but we also have the fans from ""The Guild"" and ""Legend of Neil"" to take advantage of, too. CNN: What's the difference between a nerd and a geek? Lewis: God, that's a good question. I envision this, I don't know if this is right or not, but a nerd to me is a guy who like in high school has pimples and maybe glasses and sort of socially awkward. Whereas a geek to me is anybody who's doing something that's not the general norm. Becker: Like, a geek embraces it, maybe? I've always thought of nerd as someone who's into nerdy stuff, pop culture stuff like comics. I think a geek is someone who embellishes. Parikh: For me, I feel like a nerd is more knowledgeable about their geekdom. Lewis: Maybe even arrogant? Becker: Where a geek is more of a fan, maybe? Parikh: Yeah, that's it. If you're a nerd, it's because you know something. You're a nerd about that. But if you're a geek about it, that means you just love it.","""The Guild"" created ""Game On"" in about a month and landed at the top of the iTunes chart .

"(CNN) -- Young German driver Nico Hulkenberg is looking for a new Formula One team after failing to agree a contract extension with Williams, the motorsport's official website reported on Monday. While the British-based team has retained veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello for 2011, the 23-year-old Hulkenberg will seek a new race seat following an impressive rookie season. ""I heavily regret that, because I would have been happy to stay with Williams,"" said Hulkenberg, who secured the team's first pole position since 2005 in Brazil this month. ""I want to thank the team for a great time and I wish Williams all the best for the future."" His agent Willi Weber, who also represents seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, said the 2009 GP2 Series winner would remain in motorsport's elite class next year. ""Nico will have his seat in F1 in 2011,"" Weber told the official website. Williams finished the season in sixth place overall, repeating last year's effort, despite not scoring any points at the final race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The 38-year-old Barrichello was 12th to finish 10th in the drivers' standings on 47 points in his first season at Williams, while Hulkenberg -- Williams' test driver for two years before making his F1 debut this year -- was 16th to be 14th overall on 22 points. ""'First, I would like to thank Nico for his hard work this year, and before that in preparing himself for Formula One,"" team boss Frank Williams told his outfit's official website. ""We are very proud to have supported him as he secured the Formula 3 and GP2 titles and during his debut in Formula One. At Williams we have for many years tried to bring new talent into the sport, and we are convinced that Nico will go on to great things. We wish him well and hope that our paths will cross again in the future. ""We recruited Rubens to Williams knowing that he would bring technical expertise, experience and passion. He has delivered everything we could have hoped for this season and we are delighted to confirm that he will drive for us again in 2011."" Williams said Barrichello's teammate for his 19th season driving in F1 will be announced before the end of this year.","Nico Hulkenberg leaves Williams after contract negotiations for 2011 break down .

"(CNN) -- Actress Debi Mazar is passionate about food, and she recently used her cooking skills to raise money for The Midnight Mission, a Los Angeles-based organization that helps the homeless. Mazar is also an enthusiastic supporter of CNN Heroes, and she recently sat down with CNN Entertainment senior producer Denise Quan to talk about the campaign and her philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. Denise Quan: Why did you decide to get involved with the feeding the homeless? Debi Mazar: I grew up on food stamps. I come from a very humble background. And I've had many friends that have been destitute -- you know, running into trouble -- and places like The Midnight Mission have given them hope and have fed them and gotten them back on the right path. It can happen to anybody, and with the economy crashing and what's going on in the world today, I just thought it was time to try to find a place to go to help people. They're the oldest food bank in Los Angeles ... and I like to cook, I like to serve people. So we cooked up a bunch of food, and they let us use their truck, helped us serve it, and we raised a lot of money. Quan: What's so special about The Midnight Mission? Mazar: Not only are they feeding people, but they are giving them housing, they are giving them beds, a shower, fresh sheets, fresh clothing. They are finding them jobs. There is a recovery program for addiction, a program to learn to get back on your feet and to adjust within the community again. It's incredible what they do and how many people walk through their doors, rich and poor, no questions asked. They just open these doors and they give these people a fresh start. Quan: What is a hero to you? Mazar: A hero is somebody who is selfless, who is generous in spirit, who just tries to give back as much as possible and help people. A hero to me is someone who saves people and who really deeply cares. Quan: You attended ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year. What was that like? Mazar: Being at the CNN Heroes event last year was almost life-changing. I saw the prior year from my living room, and when I got invited I was so excited. Each person that went up and each little film that was played brought me and my husband to tears because of the generosity of their soul and spirit. These people came from nothing, had nothing, and yet did the unimaginable. They weren't Hollywood people. They weren't rich people. They were just people that wanted to help other people. It just really made me think, ""Wow. I want to help, too."" Watching those people made me feel like I wasn't doing enough. They were so inspirational. So now I'm on the bandwagon, and I'm just trying to help as well because it makes you feel really great and we need it. We need a sense of community again. Quan: Did any of those CNN Heroes particularly inspire you? Mazar: There was one young Filipino man [CNN Hero of the Year Efren Penaflorida] who would go into the slums and help bring education to all these children that had nothing and teach them how to read and write. It was just beautiful what he did. There was Jorge Munoz from Queens, [New York], who just had like a regular job, had no money, but he and his family would cook in their little kitchen that was, you know, New York-style -- I'm talking closet-size -- and half of their house was stocked with restaurant supplies. And every night he would cook and bring out food and serve the homeless on the streets of New York City. This guy was just selfless. I just thought, ""How wonderful."" Quan: Why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes? Mazar: There's so much importance in honoring your everyday hero. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take connections. What matters is that people get involved. Whether your passion is gun control or food or whatever it may be, everybody needs to stop being so self-absorbed.","Actress Debi Mazar has raised money for The Midnight Mission, a Los Angeles food bank .

"(CNN)  -- An outbreak of the deadly ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo has prompted neighboring Angola to close its border with that country, Angola's state news agency reported Tuesday. Angolan Health Minister Jose Van-Dunem announced the ""suspension of migratory movements"" at the country's north-eastern border Sunday, the Angop news agency reported. The World Health Organization reports 41 suspected cases of the deadly fever in Congo since November 27. Thirteen people have died, and 183 cases are under observation. Two people are being held in quarantine. The handling of dead monkeys may be the source of the outbreak, the WHO suspects, according to Angop. Diosdado Nsue-Micawg, the WHO representative in the Angolan capital of Luanda, said the health agency does not know the source of the virus, but fears that hunters and women who visit the forest might have been in contact with infected monkeys. The outbreak is centered in the western Kassi province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been reporting intermittent cases of the disease since 1976, according to Angop.","Democratic Republic of Congo has reported intermittent cases of ebola since 1976 .

"(CNN) -- He was the first Spanish player to reach the top of the tennis world rankings, but now Carlos Moya is contemplating life away from the sport that he has played at the top level for the past 15 years. The 34-year-old has been unable to overcome a foot problem, with his last match on the ATP Tour circuit being a first-round defeat at the Madrid Open in May. ""I wanted to play the big tournaments and say goodbye, but I got to the Madrid tournament and I still wasn't 100 percent. I am still young for life, but for sport I am already knocking on a bit,"" he told reporters at a press conference. ""I realized with that match that the moment had arrived. It's not how I dreamed of ending my career."" Moya won the French Open in 1998 before taking the top men's spot in March the following year, holding it for just two weeks as he became the first Spaniard at the summit since the introduction of the rankings system in 1973. Born on the island of Majorca but now resident in Switzerland, he has earned more than $13 million in prize money since his debut in 1995. Moya has slumped to 519th in the world, but can look back to better days when he won 20 titles on the main circuit, lost in the final of the 1997 Australian Open and reached the semis of the 1998 U.S. Open. That year he also reached the title match of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals, losing to compatriot Alex Corretja. In 2004, alongside a youthful Rafael Nadal -- the current No. 1 -- Moya helped Spain to win the Davis Cup for the second time as he was victorious in both his singles matches against the United States . Moya -- who plays right-handed despite being a natural lefty -- will bow out in a farewell tournament in Seville next month, according to the ATP Tour website, then look to a life outside tennis. ""I'll keep on with my gym in Majorca. I have a sports business and I'll dedicate more time to my wife, my daughter and my family. But I'll definitely miss tennis,"" said Moya, whose baby Carla arrived in August.","Former world No. 1 Carlos Moya calls time on his tennis career due to injury problems .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In the late 1980s through the end of the 1990s, an unusual show on Comedy Central (once called the Comedy Channel) cultivated a devoted audience that loved bad B-grade movies and inspired heckling. ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" showed series creator Joel Hodgson as a man stranded in space with some wisecracking robots. As original cast members left the show and new comedians were introduced, the show continued to deliver a unique brand of humor. Years later, ""MST3K"" has given rise to Cinematic Titanic, comprised of Hodgson, J. Elvis Weinstein, Trace Beaulieu, Mary Jo Pehl and Frank Conniff. Cinematic Titanic met with CNN to discuss their process and something called ""Weisenheimer's."" CNN: What's it like being back with some of the old ""MST3K"" gang? Hodgson: It's been great. We're kind of like different gangs all intersected because our times at ""Mystery Science Theater"" didn't all overlap. But we all knew each other before ""Mystery Science Theater"" even started, because we were all comics. So it's been great. It's been fun to hang out with these guys after so many years. We hang out a lot now because we're on the road together quite a bit. Conniff: It feels safe. [Everyone giggles.] . Weinstein: This is like our third year doing this, so we've had a lot of experience. We've done 60 shows on the road these last three years, and each time we go to a new location, so we're spending a lot of time with each other now. Or, just enough time. Pehl: And we all share one room, so that's ... [Mary Jo rolls her eyes.] . CNN: Can you explain the process of finding the movies that you're going to give the Cinematic Titanic treatment to? Hodgson: I do it now. Frank did it for ""Mystery Science Theater,"" so he can give you his take on it for that. For Cinematic Titanic we use certain vendors who search for movies, so occasionally they'll bring stuff to me. Or I'll just look for stuff. Half of our stuff is licensed, so they're representing different producers, and half of it is public domain, so that's a whole different process. You find a movie, and you have to find the right print and you have to do a copyright search, talk to the lawyer, make sure it's OK to use. Then, once we have those that fit that profile, then I show it to everybody and we go through the process of everyone signing off on it, saying if this will work. We just did that with a new movie we're working on right now. It's called ""Watch Out for Snakes."" [Cinematic Titanic grins and snickers.] . Pehl: People get ravaged. Is that a bad way to use that word? Beaulieu: They don't get ravaged in a good way, they get ravaged in a bad way. By snakes. Conniff: For ""Mystery Science Theater"" it was a little different, in that we would be sent a bunch of screeners. When we were working with Comedy Central they would find screeners and send them to us, and I would just do the initial process of going through the boxes and watching them, find the ones I thought could work as a show, and then show them to everybody else. But back then we had the machinery of a cable network to help us with that kind of stuff, but now we're on our own. CNN: How is Cinematic Titanic distributed? What's working, what's not and what are your future plans? Weinstein: We're self-financed and self-distributing. Trace and his wife do fulfillment stuff. We also offer the show through download at a site called easytakes.com. And it seems like it's about half and half. Beaulieu: Yeah, it runs, hard disks maybe twice as much as downloads. Hodgson: Plus easytakes is packaging our movies as apps for the Droid so you can buy the app and it will just play the movie. Weinstein: The Droid thing has yet to launch. Beaulieu: We sell a good number of DVDs here [at Dragon*Con] and at our live shows, too. It's a real manufacturing to customer direct line. Conniff: We leave out the middle man and pass the savings on to you! Hodgson: He's waited his whole life to say that. CNN: Do you find that audiences at Dragon*Con are especially tuned in to your brand of humor? What is the con circuit like for you? Hodgson: Well we don't really do the circuit, we sort of just go to the occasional con. Beaulieu: This is the one we've been to the most. This is our third year. This one fits our sensibility more because our MO has always been do-it-yourself, and this one is all that. It's really people-powered. Comic-Con is really just Hollywood blowing you away with how much money it has and awing you with its giant displays and you really are, as a fan or an observer, you're really put in this category. Here it really just, like, flows everywhere. You just can see people being creative and kind of doing their own thing. I think this one fits much better, I prefer this con way more than Comic-Con. Weinstein: We did the Cinematic Titanic panel last night to a packed ballroom and then we showed our episode and then came back afterwards and did some signing afterwards. But 90 percent of that audience stayed to watch the episode. Beaulieu: Yeah and they were a great audience for that episode. Weinstein: Yes, they were totally tuned in and it was exciting to see. CNN: Josh, how did you decide on the moniker J. Elvis? Weinstein: I decided on it because when I joined the writer's guild there already was a Josh Weinstein, and I gave myself the Elvis because I loved that it gave me the initials J. E. W. and also somewhat inspired by being a fan of Elvis Costello, but mostly it's about J. E. W. Hodgson: In LA there are very few people not named Josh Weinstein. CNN: Can you describe the transition from ""Mystery Science Theater"" to what you're doing with Cinematic Titanic and what your old coworkers are doing with RiffTrax? Hodgson: Well, when we started we were really interested in doing very quirky movies, and [RiffTrax] were doing big movies. They did ""Lord of the Rings,"" and any big blockbuster that came out. It seemed really clear that we're working this side of the street with old movies and they're working new movies. But that's getting kind of muddled now because they're coming back and doing old movies. Like we did in ""Mystery Science Theater."" CNN: What's the secret to making wisecracks for a living? Conniff: That's a long process. We all started out as stand-up comics, so we all set out for careers being weisenheimers, making wisecracks. Beaulieu: You have Weisenheimers, don't you? [Everyone laughs.] . Conniff: I do, actually, it's painful. Hodgson: I'm grappling with Weisenheimer's disease. Pehl: We're having a walk for you. Weinstein: But we were lucky enough, when we started ""Mystery Science Theater"" to have a UHF station that sort of gave us free reign. So we had a little laboratory to create this art form, if you will. Hodgson: Back then we did 20 shows, and we just improvised. It was unheard of back then to make a show where you just kind of talk over a movie. Prior to that there had been people who re-synched, added sound, redone the dialogue on movies, but this was really different so it grew very organically. By the end of it we kind of had it figured out. If we didn't have that, I can't imagine just walking in and trying to pitch this idea to anybody. Conniff: And we had 20 shows that we could edit down to a four-minute sizzle reel that we could show them. Hodgson: We had a thousand people in a fan club, so we had this kind of packet that we could lay down when we went to the Comedy Channel. And we said, ""Hey, this is happening,"" and they just happened to need content. So it was just 'cause it was the beginning of basic cable and they needed to fill time more than anything. Conniff: Sad but true. Hodgson: It worked for us. CNN: What's the difference between a geek and a nerd? Weinstein: Geeks will talk to us, nerds find us too weird. Hodgson: To me, for geeks there's an extra level of involvement for whatever it is they're focused on. A geek kind of implies a specificity of interest for whatever it is they're geeking out about. Beaulieu: Geek is more intense than nerd . Conniff: I think a nerd gets beat up, and a geek gets beat up and then goes and watches an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Weinstein: Yeah, and starts a software company.","Cinematic Titanic take their wisecracking brand of movie-heckling humor on the road .

"(CNN) -- Evan Lysacek became a household name in February when he won the Olympic gold medal in men's figure skating. Since his rise to fame, he has made it a point to get involved with charitable work. He currently works with Help USA, a nonprofit organization that provides housing and support services so the homeless and other people in need can become self-sufficient. Lysacek, a supporter of CNN Heroes, recently spoke to CNN producer Megan Clifford about the Heroes campaign and his humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Megan Clifford: Why did you decide to get involved with Help USA? Evan Lysacek: Well, I've always looked up to -- in my lifetime and in my career -- athletes and people who are strong members of the community. As I've gained a little bit of success, I thought the most important thing to do, first and foremost, was to give back and help out. Homelessness can happen to anyone within the blink of an eye. Job loss is so prevalent in the country today with the state of our economy ... a lot of people have become homeless or jobless very quickly, and they did not see it coming. Help USA is the largest homeless advocate in the country. Knowing their reputation, I wanted to get involved immediately and asked how. They said, ""Come on down, we'll film a public service announcement."" Clifford: What exactly does Help USA do? Lysacek: Help USA helps [its] clients by teaching the skills that they're going to need to go out and reclaim their lives ... life skills, education, job placement and training, child care, as well as counseling. They provide a variety of services at their residences to help their clients get their lives back on track. Clifford: How has your work with Help USA affected you? Lysacek: It's inspired me more than I could have imagined. I thought I would be signing on to teach and give as much as I could ... but in turn, they've taught me so much about working and remaining positive with the circumstances that you're dealt. As gratifying as it was for me to work my entire life for my Olympic dream and somehow, someway achieve it in Vancouver by winning gold, I get so much more appreciation and I feel so much more heart when I can help more than one person. As memories of competitions, of medals and podiums, fade away, there are pictures that are embedded in my head with families in need that will really stick with me for the rest of my life. Clifford: You're a sports hero to many people. What is a hero to you? Lysacek: A hero to me is a person that leads by example, and they don't always take the easy road. Sometimes, they're the only one on a certain path, but they always do what they think is right and they're positive members of their community. Clifford: Why did you get involved with CNN Heroes? Lysacek: CNN Heroes honors everyday people who've given extraordinary things to their communities. It inspires everyone to get up, go out and do something -- take a stand for what you believe in, team up with an organization you really care about, help someone in need. That's something everyone in this world could learn from -- seeing a positive force within their community. It's sometimes difficult to comprehend how you can possibly make a difference, but when it's right there in front of your eyes through a program like CNN Heroes, it's easy to believe that you truly can. And that's why I feel like this is so important.","Olympic champion Evan Lysacek supports Help USA, the nation's largest homeless advocate .

"(CNN) -- Born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dikembe Mutombo came to the United States on an academic scholarship to study medicine at Georgetown University. But his career path soon changed after joining the school's basketball team. Mutombo would go on to play in the NBA for 18 years and become one of the league's all-time best defensive players. Mutombo has always been involved in humanitarian work, particularly through the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation. He has been involved with CNN Heroes since 2007, when he served on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selects the top Heroes of the year. Mutombo recently sat down with CNN producer Allison Blakely to talk about Heroes and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allison Blakely: What was your inspiration for starting the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation? Dikembe Mutombo: After traveling so much in Africa, doing some work for different organizations, we [had] witnessed so much suffering and pain. The Democratic Republic of Congo [has suffered] more than 10 years of civil unrest, where more than 5.3 million people have died. People have [called it] the World War III of Africa. (shakes his head) People are left with nothing. I decided to create the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation to change the living condition of my people in Africa. Blakely: You originally intended to be a doctor. Now you've built a hospital in your homeland. Tell me about it. Mutombo: [It] was my [hope] in building a hospital to let people know that things can be much better in the future. ... The Old Testament says, ""People perish because of lack of education,"" and that's what we are trying to do. It's through education we will reduce the mortality rate: telling those moms how they can keep their babies away from mosquitoes, how they can get their baby vaccinated and deliver the baby in better circumstances. There was a woman that delivered a premature baby; I think that baby was like the size of my hands. We were the only hospital that was well-equipped with the high technology. The baby was able to grow stronger until it was able to go home. To see that child every time I go home is like I gave life to somebody. I think each one of us in this world, we have a duty to fulfill our mission. God has blessed some of us in the position to touch many people, and so many people can hear our voices from distances away, and I think I am capable to do it. Blakely: What is a hero to you, and what do you think inspires some of these people? Mutombo: A hero is someone who inspires you with their voice or with their acts or with their hands. That's a hero. Blakely: You were on the CNN Heroes Blue Ribbon Panel back in 2007. What was that like? Mutombo: I think it's great. I [would] encourage more people who have the strength and the courage and the love and the commitment of going out and making a difference to go and try. ... You can't just live in a society where you think, ""I don't have anything to contribute."" It's all about the gift that you have. ... You can inspire so many people. Blakely: You went out to the ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year, right? How was that? Mutombo: I was just walking down the red carpet, able to meet Anderson Cooper and everybody who came from the different parts of the world, celebrating our work and our contribution to this world. It was amazing. Blakely: So, you've met some of the CNN Heroes. How have you been inspired by them? Mutombo: Oh, inspired a lot. To see some of the people -- how they have gone on with no money, with no mean[s] -- there's a lot of people out there who are contributing. We all have some obligation to fulfill something in this world we're living in. It doesn't matter how long your life [is]. It is about your contribution, how much difference you're making. That's what those people are doing. I thank them, and I compliment them, and I salute them for their effort.","Former NBA star is committed to helping people in Democratic Republic of Congo .

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over allaged war crimes in Darfur. Al-Bashir landed in Qatar on Sunday and met with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. On Monday, he expressed his gratitude to the Arab League Summit. ""We appreciate your support for Sudan in many areas,"" al-Bashir said. ""This support will, God willing, lead to issuing clear and unequivocal decisions -- rejecting the decision [the ICC arrest warrant]."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also attended the meeting but avoided any confrontation with al-Bashir. The U.N. leader focused instead on efforts to have humanitarian aid workers allowed back into Sudan. Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant. The March 4 arrest warrant is the first issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. But the ICC has no arrest powers and depends on its 106 member states to take suspects into custody. Qatar, site of the summit, is not a member of the tribunal. Sudan refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC, and has made no efforts to hand over two other officials indicted by the court. Al-Bashir has called the charges an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan. The International Criminal Court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government's campaign against rebels in Darfur, in western Sudan. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict. Qatar had been mediating talks between Sudanese officials and representatives of one of the rebel factions, who signed a confidence-building agreement in February. At the State Department, deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur. ""We would hope that while [al-Bashir] is in Doha that the Arab League would focus on the immediate and urgent needs of the people on the ground in Sudan and address the humanitarian situation in Darfur and meet the priorities of the comprehensive peace agreement,"" he said. ""The discussions should be on how to stop the violence and support the people. ""The presence of Bashir at this conference should be used as an opportunity to bring forth the international concern to what is happening in Darfur and southern Sudan."" In another development, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi walked out of the summit after a dispute over whether he would be allowed to talk. ""I am an international leader,"" Gadhafi said before leaving. ""The dean of Arab rulers. The king of kings in Africa. The imam to Muslims. My international position does not allow me to be reduced. Thank you."" State Department spokesman Duguid declined to comment. CNN's Stan Grant contributed to this report.","Sudanese president asks Arab League Summit to reject arrest warrant against him .

"Washington (CNN) -- Iraqi authorities have shared information obtained from captured insurgents who claim al Qaeda is planning suicide attacks in the United States and Europe during the Christmas holiday season, a U.S. official said Thursday. The official said the threat report is being taken seriously, but there is no intelligence indicating there is a specific or credible threat against the U.S. homeland.  But, the official added, al Qaeda in Iraq remains a dangerous force. The official indicated the United States remains vigilant, especially during the holidays, in light of what happened last Christmas -- a reference to the failed attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit. Another U.S. official said ""we are looking closely"" at the information coming from Iraq. Interpol spokesman Pietro Calcaterra told CNN that ""we have received information from our office in Baghdad about possible al Qaeda attacks on U.S. and European targets."" He didn't elaborate. Two Iraqi officials, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh, are saying there is no specific information about a Christmas attack. The U.S. military in Baghdad told CNN the American mission in Iraq ""will work closely with the government of Iraq and our interagency partners to help determine the extent of any potential threat.""","No specific threat is indicated against the United States .

"(CNN) -- Not everyone wishes others well in fulfilling their New Year's resolutions. Giyen Kim has gone from 190 to 186 pounds in four weeks. A doctor says that's ""very reasonable."" On a video that Giyen Kim recently posted on iReport.com about her frustration with trying to lose weight, one user commented, ""Who cares how much you have lost you are still a fat a**. Stop eating and go to the gym."" In the past, Kim might have cried and turned to a pint of ice cream for comfort, she reflected. But this time, she hit the gym -- a reaction she views as a revelation. ""I think that when you are doing what you need to be doing, things like that don't matter,"" she said. See Kim talk about losing weight . Kim, 34, is one of many CNN readers who are using CNN's iReport.com to share frequent updates of progress on their New Year's resolutions. iReport.com: Share your journey to change . Kim started out at 190 pounds on January 1 with the intention of losing about a pound or two a week throughout the year. Lately she has been cooking more for herself and trying to stay away from foods that have refined carbohydrates. She also tries to eat one vegan meal every day, but still occasionally indulges in bacon, the namesake for her blog Bacon is My Enemy. She exercises six days a week, mostly cardio, but wants to work on strength training and resistance training. She would also like to take step classes. So far she's shed four pounds in four weeks, but the pace feels slow compared with her diet regimens in the past, she said. She found that those extreme diet plans were not realistic options in the long run for maintaining a comfortable weight. Still, Kim maintains a positive outlook on her situation. ""No matter if you get derailed, if you just pick yourself up again and get back on track, it makes a big difference,"" she said. ""If you're in a place of feeling good about yourself, regardless of how your self-image has been in the past, it propels you to go forward."" Dr. Melina Jampolis, a physician nutrition specialist from San Francisco, California, said losing a pound per week is very reasonable. At most, Kim could probably lose an additional half-pound to pound a week, ""but any more than that and she would probably be losing water weight and muscle,"" Jampolis said. Jampolis recommends that Kim keep a daily journal of what she eats, and review it to see where she might be able to cut 50 to 100 calories, and where there might be hidden calories in her diet. Kim should also make sure she is varying the intensity, duration, and type of workout, Jampolis said. ""As she loses weight and becomes more fit, she is burning fewer calories doing the same thing, so it is critical to change things up,"" Jampolis said. But generally Kim's current pace is great -- ""At that rate, she will be down another 20 pounds by summer!"" Jampolis said. As far as Kim's professional goals, she has secured an interim position at a non-profit organization, and continues to do video blogs for Momversation.com. The market for freelance writers is tough, particularly with many newspapers struggling, she said. Still, Kim is optimistic about following her dream to become a writer. ""I'm not optimistic about our economic future as a country, but as far as me and my journey to find happiness, and accomplish some of these goals that I've had -- weight loss and following my writing passion -- absolutely, I'm still really positive about it,"" she said.","iReporter Giyen Kim has been losing a pound per week since the start of 2009 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- I don't do dogs and I don't do yoga. CNN's Lola Ogunnaike, right, conquers her fear of dogs and yoga with a doga class in Manhattan. Having inherited my mother's abject fear of animals, I try to stay clear of anything with four legs and fur. Yoga is too slow for me. All that breathing and stretching and chanting and centeredness. Boring. I'd rather jump and kick and pump and gasp for air. But my curiosity got the best of me when I discovered that Bideawee, an animal welfare organization in Manhattan, offers a yoga class for dogs -- doga. During the 45-minute session, pooches and their masters give new meaning to the phrase ""downward facing dog."" The room was small but comfortable, and the dogs, I must admit, were adorable with saccharine-sweet names such as Picasso, Bailey and Sophie. Awww. Since I didn't have my own pup, I borrowed Sophie, a 10-pound Shih Tzu, who was so calm I wondered if she'd been slipped a quaalude before class. In ""child's pose,"" she stood on my back and slowly surveyed the room. I lifted her with my legs. Held her in ""warrior pose."" Stretched her hind legs. Stroked her little head as we chanted Ommmmmm and Boooone.   Watch this special yoga class Â» . Were we bonding? I think so. It was as bizarre as it was sweet. And some women in the class admitted as much. ""There are a lot of people who think it's a little silly, but the class is very lighthearted,"" said Sophie's ""mother,"" Grace. She carries Sophie around in a Louis Vuitton bag that's bigger than my apartment. ""No one takes it too seriously. It's just a chance to bond with your dog and have fun,"" she said. Another class member brought her ""baby"" because she thinks he's a bit too hyper and needs to chill out. Instructor Kari Harendorf has been teaching doga for several years. She said she believes the classes are perfect for these stressful times. ""It's actually been proven scientifically that just the simple act of petting a dog will release happy hormones in humans and will lower their cortisol, which is the stress hormone,"" she said. ""Studies have also shown that it goes both ways, that when dogs receive the petting and attention that their stress levels decrease."" By the end of our session, the dogs did appear to be more ""blissed out,"" to borrow a term from Harendorf. Not a bark or a growl was heard. The only person panting was me. As I lay on my mat contemplating how I'd become so inflexible, everyone filed out quietly. I was one step closer to conquering my fear of animals and touching my toes.","CNN reporter borrows dog for special yoga class .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama told CNN's Larry King on Thursday that he is furious about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but his job is to fix things instead of just yelling at people. In a White House interview for the 25th anniversary of ""Larry King Live"" on CNN, Obama called the oil spill an unprecedented crisis for the country but added it could have been worse. Despite the challenges posed by the oil spill, global threats involving North Korea and Iran and political battles with Congress, Obama called being president ""the best job on Earth."" ""It's an extraordinary privilege to wake up every day and know you have the opportunity to serve the American people and make life better,"" he said. King noted that the latest CNN Poll of Polls showed Obama at 48 percent support among the American people, which the president called pretty good, considering the circumstances. ""Given everything that's going on, my poll numbers are all right,"" Obama said. Asked about his anger toward the oil spill situation, Obama said he was furious because ""somebody didn't think through the consequences of their actions."" Obama also said he had not seen enough of a rapid response from BP to the environmental catastrophe. ""I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people, but that's not the job I was hired to do,"" Obama said. ""My job is to solve this problem and ultimately this isn't about me and how angry I am. Ultimately this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that they're able to salvage their way of life."" Oil giant BP caused the spill and is responsible for paying the costs, Obama said, adding: ""My job is to make sure they're being held accountable."" In the wide-ranging interview to be broadcast Thursday night, Obama also acknowledged Israel's security concerns while questioning the Israeli blockade of Gaza following this week's military raid on a flotilla of ships carrying relief supplies to the Palestinian territory. The president called the incident that killed nine people, including a Turkish-American man, a ""tragic situation"" that could serve as ""an opportunity"" to advance the Middle East peace process."" On the oil spill, Obama said BP has the best technology and know-how to try to stop the leak, but the president indicated that the spill could continue until relief wells being drilled now are completed in August. Despite the havoc that the oil spill is causing to Gulf fisheries and fragile wetlands, Obama said he still supports off-shore drilling ""if it can be done safely."" Asked about reports that his administration had extended a moratorium on offshore drilling to shallow water rigs, Obama denied it. ""Actually the moratorium is not extended to the shallow waters,"" the president said. On another topic, Obama criticized Arizona's controversial new immigration law because it could lead to ""50 different laws in 50 different states"" regarding border security, which is a federal concern. The interview took place shortly after Obama met with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who said Obama pledged to work with her on solving the immigration problem. The new Arizona law, which takes effect in July, allows police officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident. Critics, including Attorney General Eric Holder, have said the law will promote racial profiling. Obama told CNN that the issue required a broader response than just strengthening border security, and he urged Congress to work with him on comprehensive immigration reform that would tighten the border while requiring illegal immigrants to register, pay back taxes and penalties, learn English and seek citizenship through normal channels. The president also discussed the status of pending free agent basketball star Lebron James, saying that part of him hoped James would re-sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers because it would be a ""great story."" Obama, who is from Chicago and a known fan of the hometown Bulls, acknowledged his response might make people there unhappy. The president also called Wednesday night's White House concert honoring former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney a great event, particularly when McCartney serenaded the first lady with the love ballad that shares her first name, ""Michelle."" ""When she was a little girl growing up on the South Side (of Chicago), I don't think she ever imagined that happening,"" Obama said.","President Obama says he's furious about the Gulf oil spill, but his job is to fix it, not vent .

"(CNN) -- This week, Giyen Kim, 34, reached a personal milestone: She has lost 10 pounds since the beginning of the year. Giyen Kim, 34, has lost 10 pounds since January 1. She said she feels like it will be easier to lose more weight. This progress feels slow, she said, in comparison with her previous weight loss attempts, which consisted of crash dieting. But she found that those diets weren't sustainable. This time, she's looking to find a lifestyle she can keep.

""You feel definitely more motivated when you actually quantify it in a number that feels good,"" she said. Visit CNNhealth, your connection for better living . She doesn't feel physically different, but she does notice a change from previous pictures of herself, she said. Her original goal for the year was to get closer to her pre-pregnancy weight of 120 pounds. Kim has had a hard time exercising recently because her uncle, 90, passed away, and the grieving process has been difficult. But she plans to resume working out soon and wants to take classes at her gym. She also eats one vegan meal every day. Kim felt frustrated earlier this month because her progress felt slow, losing a pound a week. Read about her weight loss journey . Often, the initial weight loss will seem the easiest, and then the loss slows somewhat over time, said Tara Gidus, dietician for the Orlando Magic NBA team and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting in Orlando, Florida. Exercise is key in speeding things up when you've reached a plateau, she said. It's important to find a physical activity that you enjoy doing and to vary the exercise routine -- for example, raising the incline on a treadmill to step up the intensity, she said. Gidus usually recommends losing about 2 pounds a week, or about 5 to 8 pounds a month. At that rate, someone like Kim could lose 50 pounds in six months, she said. A pace faster than that -- such as 10 pounds per month -- would be hard to keep up, Gidus said. People with on weight-loss journeys should have encouragement from friends, family or people in support groups or online communities, she said. Kim certainly has people supporting her in the virtual world: A video she posted a few weeks ago after she'd lost 4 pounds had more than a dozen motivational comments from others on iReport.com. Watch her video . Her next goal is to lose 15 more pounds -- for a total of 25 -- by her birthday, March 24, and reward herself with a digital single-lens reflex camera, which professional photographers use.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police have launched an investigation after a young disabled sportsman traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide, UK media report. Daniel James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was paralyzed during match practice last year. Daniel James, 23, from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice, dislocating his spine, the UK's Press Association has reported. Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he ""traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died."" The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. West Mercia police say that a man and a woman are helping the force with their enquiries. Assisting someone to commit suicide is illegal in the UK, as it is in most other European countries. What do you think of assisted suicide? James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was a university student at the time of his injury last year. He is believed to be the youngest person from the UK to have traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide. In a statement Friday, reported by PA, James' parents said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already.  Watch why James opted for suicide Â» . ""His death was an extremely sad loss for his family, friends and all those that care for him but no doubt a welcome relief from the 'prison' he felt his body had become and the day-to-day fear and loathing of his living existence, as a result of which he took his own life. ""This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed and some say determined young man,"" PA reported James' parents as saying. ""The family suffered considerably over the last few months and do wish to be left in peace to allow them to grieve appropriately."" James' parents added that their son, ""an intelligent young man of sound mind,"" had never come to terms with his condition and was ""not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence"". Adrian Harling, the family solicitor, would not comment on the investigation, PA reported. More than 100 people from the UK who have committed suicide in Switzerland have traveled to the Dignitas Clinic in Forch. It is not known if James attended the clinic. Switzerland, along with Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, are the only European countries where authorities will not prosecute those who assist with suicide.","Young rugby player, paralyzed after accident, commits suicide in Switzerland .

"CANTON, Georgia (CNN) -- Meet Kaden, bomb-sniffing dog in training. Jeff Schettler coaches handlers on how to work with detection dogs, including Kaden, far right, in the field. His name, a Gaelic word meaning ""little battle,"" is fitting for the energetic 12-pound puppy with a perky tail that curls like a cinnamon bun. At 4 months old, Kaden is a playful, black- and white-coated basenji being schooled at Georgia K9 National Training Center. Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events. His detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks. ""Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,"" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s. Demand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action Â» . Official records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset. Dogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? Â» . Other animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers. Police dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports. ""They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,"" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades. Earlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people. Two weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down. Trainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association. Most trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used. ""We're not trying to fix anything,"" Schettler says. ""We're trying to enhance it."" Schettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds, enabling him seamlessly to sift between cramped luggage and lockers. Kaden is barkless because basenjis have an oddly shaped larynx, ideal for quiet searches. On a recent rainy Saturday morning at the Georgia K9 National Training Center, little Kaden undergoes testing. Passing the exam depends on his whiffing talents. Upon the instructor's command, Kaden's pencil-thin legs playfully trot along the damp grass to an oversize wall scattered with dozens of holes. His instructor has hidden black gunpowder wrapped in pantyhose in one of the holes. If Kaden's nose sniffs out the gunpowder, he will immediately sit. Kaden begins on the left side, quickly taking a zigzag pattern from one hole to another. His pace is methodical, a sniff for each hole. Soon he slows, pauses, inhales again and then sinks his tiny hindquarters to the ground. ""What a good boy,"" coo several of Kaden's trainers, stroking his sleek fur and rewarding him with one of his favorite treats, torn bits of venison jerky. As Kaden nibbles on his treat, Schettler admits there are drawbacks to training basenjis. Basenjis don't have a furry coat to endure cold weather like a German shepherd. Basenjis are also a highly independent, stubborn breed with personalities similar to cats, making them difficult to train. Kaden's personality, however, is contrary to most basenjis. He was culled from a litter in Atlanta at 7 days old because of his unusual sociability with humans. ""At eight weeks, he was in the airport going up to people and running around like he owned the place,"" Schettler says. Training detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say. Puppies are selected based on breed purity, confidence, sociability and temperament. In any training program, there are doggie dropouts. In those instances, the puppies become pets. On the job, dogs can suffer from on-site injuries, such as mild sprains and bruises. Some dogs have even been killed when a bomb explodes or buildings collapse. As police dogs age, health problems such as arthritis can send them into early retirement.  A work dog's career typically spans about seven years, instructors say. Different breeds specialize in certain detection jobs, says Joseph Morelli, a canine handler for the Connecticut State Police. Morelli says he relies on Labrador retrievers for arson cases. German shepherds at his school are saved for patrolling or drug cases. ""People are really starting to see how useful these dogs can be,"" says Morelli, who has started to train dogs from neighboring states in recent years. ""We're really seeing our program take off.""","Police dogs can nose out explosives, drugs, bodies and missing people .

"(CNN)  -- Harry Kewell scored a dramatic extra-time winner as Australia beat holders Iraq 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup in Doha Saturday. The former Liverpool star struck with three minutes left of added time to deal a hammer blow to Iraq's title defense. The Socceroos will now take on Uzbekistan for a place in Saturday's final in Qatar. Kewell, who now plays for Galatasaray in Turkey, headed a cross from Matt McKay past Iraqi goalkeeper Mohammed Kassid to settle a tense encounter. Victory was sweet revenge for the Australians, who were beaten 3-1 by eventual winners Iraq in the group stages of the competition four years ago. Chances were few and far between in the first half of normal time, although McKay and Kewell came close just before the break. But in the second half, the Lions of Mesopotamia started to roar and Emad Mohammed hit the post with Mark Schwarzer beaten. Into extra-time, it was Australia who looked the more likely to make the breakthrough with Sasa Ognenovski nearly scoring with a spectacular overhead kick. Penalties were looming though when 32-year-old Kewell cropped up to score the vital goal to send Holgier Osieck's men through. ""We showed great character in this game. It was delightful for the coach to watch."" he told AFP. ""Basically, we should have done it in the regular 90 minutes. Iraq played better in extra time."" Meanwhile, South Korea beat Iran 1-0 in in the later quarterfinal, again after extra-time, to set up a last-four meeting with Japan. South Korea dominated for most the match but created few clear-cut chances at the Qatar Sport Club stadium. However, a goal from South Korean midfielder Bit Ka Ram Yoon in the 105th minute was enough to knock out the three-time champions. Both semifinals are scheduled to take place on Tuesday.","South Korea score in extra-time to beat Iran 1-0 in Asian Cup quarterfinals .

"(AOL Autos) -- Chrysler and General Motors announced this week that they would shrink their dealer base in the U.S. Chrysler will close 789 dealers. General Motors announced the closing of 1,100 dealers. Chrysler will close 789 dealers, leaving them with approximately 2400 stores in the U.S. General Motors announced the closing of 1,100 dealers and hopes to be at a size of 3,600 dealers at the end of 2010. While Chrysler dealers will be ""forced out"" by June 9, GM is positioning for a smoother closing of its stores, with each shutting down when it runs out of inventory. Unlike Chrysler's announcement, GM's list of closing dealers will not be made public, leaving that decision to each dealer. What happens to my GM or Chrysler vehicle warranty? Your warranty is valid through its term, regardless of where you bought your vehicle. In March, President Obama announced that the U.S. government would provide the backing for Chrysler and GM vehicle warranties under the ""Warrantee Commitment Program."" Can I take my vehicle for service and warranty work to another (surviving) dealer? Yes, but make sure it's a certified dealer. If you're going to take your Chrysler, Jeep or Dodge vehicle in for warranty work, you can do so at a closing dealership until June 9. After that time, Chrysler will no longer pay those dealers for warranty work. GM vehicles will receive service and warranty work at closing dealers until they shut down. Will there be good deals on these vehicles? The Chrysler dealerships to close will have about 44,000 units on hand, or roughly what Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge sell across the country every 2-3 weeks (using April's sales numbers as a guide). There will be deals, but be warned that if those 44,000 aren't sold before June 9, Chrysler will work to redistribute them to other dealers. Whether the best deals will be had before or after June 9 is likely negligible; if you're interested in a Chrysler, Jeep or Dodge product, you will save a lot of money on a new purchase right now. One important factor to keep in mind is that approximately 10% of those remaining units are 2008 vehicles. Be careful the car you're looking at hasn't been sitting on the lot inactive for too long; cars actually do ""rot."" GM's dealer announcement is a different story, since the company isn't releasing the names of the closing dealers. Dealers who chose to disclose their shutdown may provide better deals. AOL Autos: Why do cars rot on the lot? How many people and jobs are affected by closing dealers? The impact on communities will be significant. Since dealers typically employ about 50 people and contract with a handful of suppliers (consider the business that sells paper or office furniture to each dealer), there will be impact within the community. Some economists, however, believe that the impact will be less than expected, since dealers typically have a high turnover rate and technician jobs were in a short supply already. But, the related aspects of dealer closings are certain: think of the little league baseball teams and charities that receive funding from do-gooding dealers. Even real estate is affected; car dealerships usually set the market for commercial real estate in smaller communities. When those go empty, the entire city feels the pain. AOL Autos: Pressure to buy American . Why were these dealers chosen? Both Chrysler and GM have expressed interest to shrink their dealer base. Company officials cite various data points related to choosing these dealers, but the main one is performance. GM said that the average dealer of the 1,100 affected only sold 35 cars in all of 2008. Chrysler cites similar numbers, with half their closing dealerships selling less than 100. But, even after these reductions by Chrysler and GM, they still have more dealers than other manufacturers. Using April 2009's sales data as a proxy, Toyota has approximately 95 dealers per 1 point of market share in the U.S., while Chrysler has 256 and GM will have 172 (at the end of 2010). This means that, effectively, Toyota is able to sell more vehicles per dealership. AOL Autos: Fate of the GM brands . Can dealers do anything about this? Typically, dealers would have protection under state franchise laws against such events. However, in Chrysler's case, those franchise laws are not applicable since the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Chrysler dealers can (and likely will) protest the process by which they were chosen (sales volume, number of brands in the store, the area in which the dealership operated). But after June 9, the selected Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge dealers will have to take down their signs. GM dealers will likely organize their own group, but details of that are unclear at this time. AOL Autos: Are extended warranties worth it? Even after cuts, do the big three still have too many U.S. dealers? Some companies need fewer dealers to sell the same amount of cars: . Chrysler LLC  Number of dealers: 2411  Market share: 9.4  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 256 . Ford Motor Co.  Number of dealers: 3723  Market share: 15.7  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 237 . General Motors  Number of dealers: 3600  Market share: 20.9  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 172 AOL Autos: Six cars to save the big three . Honda Motor Co.  Number of dealers: 1304  Market share: 12.4  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 105 . Toyota Motor Corp.  Number of dealers: 1470  Market share: 15.4  Dealers per 1 pt. market share: 95 .

"LAUREL, Maryland (CNN)  -- Seth Owusu knew at a young age that he wanted to help his countrymen. Seth Owusu shows children in his native Ghana how to use a computer during his visit in June. ""I came from Ghana,"" Owusu recalls. ""It all started when I was in primary school and we had some missionaries come to the school."" The visit touched Owusu, who was 8 years old at the time. He tried to figure out why these missionaries had journeyed so far. ""I couldn't understand why somebody would travel thousands of miles just to come to a very rural, poor dirt road,"" he said. ""I thought it was great. I wanted to transfer that feeling to somebody else."" That passion followed Owusu when he immigrated to the United States at age 24. He began working at hardware store, where he was tasked to pick up and deliver items. Owusu used a small bar code scanner to enter information about the items he'd pick up, his first encounter with a computer-like device. ""I had no idea what a computer was,"" he said. After work one day, he went home and decided to learn as much as he could about computers. Just after he graduated from a technical college, Owusu established Entire Village Computer Organization, a small nonprofit organization that donates refurbished used computers to schools. He runs EVCO with the help of four volunteer staff members in Ghana.  Watch Owusu and children with the new computers Â» . EVCO goes much further than simply dropping off the computers in villages. ""We make a three-calendar-year commitment because we don't want it to be a teaser, where it's working two months and after that, it's gone,"" Owusu said. He says technicians go to the schools if there is a broken computer, and they also show teachers how computers can be fixed if they fail again. Owusu and other members of EVCO spend hours in each village, not only installing and teaching about computers, but also giving motivational speeches and teaching about other topics. ""In the donation ceremony ... we have everybody there,"" Owusu said. ""We talk about how the Internet has revolutionized everything; how we live in the global community. We talk about staying in school. We talk about HIV/AIDS. We talk about kids' behavior, peer pressure. We talk about a whole range of things. So it's a community affair."" Before each trip to Africa, Owusu picks up and refurbishes donated computers, doing most of the work himself. The garage and his shop in the basement of his home in suburban Maryland are crowded with piles of CPUs and monitors. But most of the work goes into planning his trips, he says. Much of his free time is spent combing through applications from various villages and working out logistics. ""Before we visit a village, it takes about six months,"" he said. ""My wife, she thinks I'm crazy ... I work eight hours and I come home, and the moment I sit down ... I work for the next eight or 10 hours."" Owusu traveled to Ghana again late this spring and was able to incorporate a new program -- this time for younger children who have traditionally been left out. ""There's nothing we can give them, other than little school supplies and soccer balls and things like that,"" he said. The new program, Photos and Fun, lets the children take photos and display them in classrooms. ""Most of these kids haven't ever seen a digital camera before,"" Owusu said. Last year, EVCO also began to donate computers to villages in Nigeria. Owusu hopes to add one more African country to the list each year. ""If we can go to a country and plant the seed there, this program can take care of itself,"" Owusu said. ""We can be a major player in education in rural communities and help the people who need help and cannot get it."" EVCO has donated 120 computers and visited 18 villages in Ghana and Nigeria. Owusu says the nonprofit group has seen an improvement in villages and a higher interest in education in schools that have received EVCO donations. ""The first school we donated to in 2005 ... the population was 700 when we donated the computers. Two years later, the school grew to 1,300 students. In order for Owusu's dream to come true, he has had to sacrifice many things. ""I sold my house in 2006 to support one of the trips,"" he said. He works in the ""Geek Squad"" department at a Best Buy electronics store in Washington. He says his employer has been very accommodating, but because of the economy, his hours have been cut. He recently decided to step down from his supervisor position because it was too demanding and he wasn't able to put in the hours needed to spend with EVCO. But for Owusu, it's all worth it. ""It's been amazing,"" he said. ""It's been just amazing.""","Seth Owusu grew up in Ghana, where he was inspired by missionaries .

"(CNN) -- A three-goal blitz in 17 minutes preserved Manchester United's unbeaten record in the English Premier League and saved them from an embarrassing defeat at Blackpool. The league leaders eventually won 3-2 at Bloomfield Road after newly-promoted Blackpool had stunned Alex Ferguson's side by leading 2-0 at the interval. But two goals from Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov and one from Mexican Javier Hernandez spared United's blushes and extended their lead at the top of the table to five points over Arsenal. Blackpool, entertaining United in a top flight game for the first time in 40 years, flew out of the traps against their illustrious opponents and were ahead inside a quarter of an hour. Defender Craig Cathcart, who joined Blackpool from United in August last year, rose to head Charlie Adam's corner into the net. When Blackpool doubled their advantage on 42 minutes a major shock looked to be on the cards. Again United failed to deal with a Blackpool corner and DJ Campbell nodded home at the far post. Ferguson sent his side out five minutes before the restart in an attempt to kick start their reply but they very nearly conceded a penalty when Rafael upended Luke Varney in the penalty area. Blackpool began to tire as United upped the tempo and they pulled a goal back when Berbatov turned home Darren Fletcher's cross on 72 minutes. Just two minutes later Hernandez, on as a substitute for Wayne Rooney, collected Ryan Giggs' pinpoint pass before firing low into the net. And with 88 minutes on the watch Berbatov grabbed his second and United's winner when he ran onto a Paul Scholes pass and drilled a left foot shot into the net. After the match Ferguson told Sky Sports: ""In the first half we were battered. We were all over the place. Maybe we were too confident. ""We changed at half-time, Ryan Giggs made a tremendous difference. We started to penetrate and I think we were deserved winners in the end."" Aston Villa made it two wins in four days as they beat Wigan Athletic 2-1. Gabriel Agbonlahor put Gerard Houllier's side in front when he pounced on a loose ball to head past Wigan's Omani goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. Ashley Young then extended Villa's lead from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Hendry Thomas. Wigan pulled a goal back with ten minutes left after James McCarthy's long range effort deflected off James Collins but Villa held on for a win that takes them up to 13th in the table. Arsenal booked their place in the League Cup final after beating second division side Ipswich 3-0 at Emirates Stadium. The Premier League side trailed 1-0 from the first leg but sealed their place at Wembley thanks to goals from Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner, French defender Laurent Koscielny and Spain international Cesc Fabregas.","Manchester United come back from two goals down to beat Blackpool 3-2 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Seven midshipmen were expelled from the Naval Academy for using a drug called ""spice"" in violation of the Navy's policies on illicit substance abuse, officials said. The midshipmen were ""separated from the Naval Academy"" as of Thursday, said Cmdr. Joe Carpenter, spokesman for the academy. ""While we will not go into the details of individual cases, the violations of the Navy's substance abuse policies included use and possession,"" Carpenter said in a statement. ""These cases involved 'spice,' which is considered a banned substance by the departments of Defense and Navy."" ""Spice,"" also known as K2, is a mixture of herbs and spices that typically is sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. ""K2 is commonly purchased in head shops, tobacco shops, various retail outlets and over the Internet,"" the DEA said. ""It is often marketed as incense or 'fake weed.'"" Its effects on the body are similar to that of marijuana. The midshipmen included juniors and sophomores, Carpenter said. The academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, did not identify them. On whether they will have to repay the cost of their education, Carpenter said the decision is up to the Department of the Navy. ""Consistent with Navy policy, the Naval Academy has a zero tolerance policy regarding illicit drug use or possession,"" Carpenter said. The investigation is ongoing, he said. Other midshipmen told academy leadership about the allegations after the fall semester began, he said. In 2009, 11 midshipmen were found to be in violation of the Navy's substance abuse policy. In 2010, four other midshipmen were found to be in violation. Spice is usually smoked in joints or pipes, according to the DEA, but some users make it into a tea. Its key ingredients are not regulated in the United States, but they have been banned or declared illegal in some European countries. The U.S. military has banned their use, the DEA noted. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","'Spice' is a form of synthetic marijuana .

"(CNN) -- The Polar Bear Plunge is not an event for the coldhearted. Participants actually pay up to jump into freezing-cold water, with the proceeds benefiting Special Olympics. Last year, the various Polar Bear Plunges held by each state raised a collective $16 million. ""Each event is so much more than just a Plunge, with hot tubs and huge heated tents, bands, vendors, costume contests, DJs and more,"" said Bronwyn Schaefer Pope, vice president of marketing and communications for Special Olympics Minnesota. The events ""allow people of all ages and abilities to do something wild and crazy to shake off the winter blues."" Be it a lake, an ocean or a river, plungers continue to jump. CNN looks at the five biggest Plunges in the United States: . Maryland -- January 29, 2011 . Unlike many of the other Polar Bear Plunges in the United States, Maryland holds one massive event instead of multiple smaller ones. ""We determined that we would invest our time and energy into one event and maximize the craziness of that one event,"" said Tom Schniedwind, executive vice president for sports marketing for Special Olympics Maryland. He says that Maryland's Plunge, which takes place in Chesapeake Bay, has five giant festival tents on the day of the event, including an extreme sports tent and a music tent. ""It's kind of a bucket list thing for our plungers, whether they're veteran plungers or first-timers,"" Schniedwind said. Wisconsin -- February 5, 2011-March 5, 2011 . Plungers can choose from a dozen different Polar Bear Plunge locations and a variety of dates. However, the Madison Plunge, which takes place on February 19, and the Oshkosh Plunge, which also takes place on February 19, are the largest. ""In Madison, you walk out onto the ice, turn around and face the crowd, and jump into a 20-by-20-foot hole that's cut in the ice,"" said Kelly Kloepping, vice president of communications for Special Olympics Wisconsin. At other locations, you might jump off of a dock or run off the beach into the water. Minnesota -- January 29, 2011-March 12, 2011 . What started in 1998 with 65 plungers has grown into a massive fundraising effort, including 14 different plunge locations. Last year, the Minneapolis location alone had 1,800 plungers and raised more than $320,000. ""Each site has unique aspects which build on the character of the local community,"" Schaefer Pope said. In Rochester, Super Plungers can jump 24 times in 24 hours. In Minneapolis, those too chicken to plunge can run a 5K. ""The Plunges in Minnesota are not for the faint of heart and can definitely be considered an extreme sport,"" Schaefer Pope said. ""But they are also accessible to people of all ages and abilities."" New Jersey -- November 27, 2010-February 26, 2011 . In New Jersey, Polar Bear Plunge participants can take a dip in the frigid Atlantic Ocean at two different locations. The Seaside Heights Plunge is the largest, with more than 4,500 plungers. ""They know exactly why they are jumping into the 30-degree water: for the athletes,"" said Doreen Pustizzi, senior director of communications for Special Olympics New Jersey. Last year's event at Seaside Heights had more plungers than ever, despite being postponed a week because of bad weather. Illinois -- February 25, 2011-March 19, 2011 . More than 10,000 people attended the various Plunges in Illinois in 2010, and with 18 locations in 2011, Special Olympics Illinois is expecting plenty of participants. ""We strive to have a consistent, quality experience at all of our plunge locations around the state,"" said Michele Henson, director of communications and publications for Special Olympics Illinois.","Polar Bear Plunges are held all across the United States to raise money for Special Olympics .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Renault F1 team have shown a united front with Ferrari with a threat to boycott the 2010 Championship unless proposed rule changes are dropped by the sport's governing body. Renault have now joined Ferrari in saying they will not race in 2010 unless proposed changes are dropped . The decision comes in the wake of plans by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to introduce optional cost-caps and technical restrictions for competing teams. Renault stated on their official Web site that the decision by the FIA to introduce two sets of technical regulations has led to the team ""reconsidering its entry in next year's World Championship."" Renault F1 Team Managing Director, Flavio Briatore said: ""We refuse to accept unilateral governance handed out by the FIA. If the decisions announced are not revised, we have no choice but to withdraw ... at the end of 2009."" Are Ferrari and Renault right to serve the FIA with an ultimatum? President of the team, Bernard Rey, added: ""We remain committed to the sport, however, we cannot be involved in a championship operating with different sets of rules."" The controversy centers on plans for an optional cost-capping policy to operate next season which the FIA argued, in an April press release, would allow technical innovation to flourish without promoting a ""spending race."" It would mean that teams operating within a budget cap of $60 million would be free of technical restrictions, while those over this amount would not.  The FIA believed this would attract new teams to join the sport and stated in April  ""interest has been extraordinarily high from both existing teams and potential new entrants"" to the idea. However, Ferrari and Renault fear this will create a two-tier competition with cars in the same race competing under different rules. Renault's announcement comes after Ferrari - the only constructor to have taken part in every season since 1950 - confirmed they would not be entering a team for the 2010 world championships, for the same reasons on May 12. ""Ferrari confirms its opposition to the new technical regulations adopted by the FIA and does not intend entering its cars in the 2010 F1 Championship,"" the team said in a statement on its official Web site. The spotlight now turns to a crunch meeting between the teams and the FIA in London on Friday which will aim to resolve the growing crisis in Formula 1. The furore comes despite F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone telling the Times newspaper that he did not envisage the Italian team carrying through its threat earlier in the week.

""They don't want to leave Formula 1 and we don't want to lose them, so we'll get to grips with it.""","Renault unite with Ferrari with a threat to boycott the 2010 Championship .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombia will freeze prices for gasoline and other petrofuels through March, the government has announced. Hernan Martinez Torres, in a photo from September, says gas prices will be frozen in Colombia through March. The freeze takes effect Thursday and sets prices at December levels, the minister of mines and energy said Monday. The measure will be funded through a $170 million Fund for the Stabilization of Prices for Combustibles, which goes into effect January 1, a release on the Colombian president's Web site says. ""All this is being done to give consumers a clear signal of stability,"" Minister of Mines and Energy Hernan Martinez Torres is quoted as saying in El Pais newspaper. Gas prices also will not decrease, although there has been a significant drop in crude oil prices in the past few months, Martinez said. The price freeze pertains to gasoline, biogasoline (oxygenated gasoline), a product called ACPM (combustible oil for motors), and the mix of ACPM and biodiesel. For the time being, El Pais said, only propane will see a decrease in price, with the price going down 25 percent. It's the second price drop for propane, which decreased 10 percent in November.","Price freeze on gas, other fuels takes effect Thursday, runs through March .

"CNN -- When Apple launched its App Store last summer, few imagined it would reach today's numbers so quickly, if ever. Auto-apps could become the next way to customize your ride. The store now hosts over 85,000 titles and has passed 2 billion downloads. Even Apple is surprised. Now the concept of the app store has spread like a virus among competitors. It's also reached seemingly unrelated industries, like automobiles and TV set-top boxes. The App Store taps the creative energy of entrepreneurial developers. Whether they're big or small, they can make money through it, even though the challenges for them can be considerable. For consumers, the App Store offers third-party applications (free or charged ) that can be downloaded or synched onto an iPhone or iPod Touch. Apple takes 30 percent of a paid app's revenue and charges developers an annual fee to use the iPhone software development kit and upload apps to the store. But the rest goes to developers, some of whom have profited handsomely from their creations. Many companies now offer something similar to the App Store, if not in whole then in part. Even if none has yet come close to Apple's numbers -- or, arguably, its design achievements -- the spread of the app store idea is undeniable. ""It seems like every company remotely related to technology is embracing the app store craze,"" notes IT expert Tony Bradley in a blog post for PC World. Handset makers now offering software stores include Palm, Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion. On the platform side, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows Mobile -- competitors to the iPhone OS -- each have an app store now. Nintendo and Sony, the traditional powers in gaming gadgets, have also launched app stores, for their DSi and PSP handhelds, respectively. Apple is now their competitor thanks to all the iPhone games. The chipmaker Intel announced last month that it's setting up multiple app stores through partners like Acer and Asus to encourage independent developers to create apps for netbooks and handhelds based on its processors. For Twitter, a startup called Oneforty is trying to position itself as the unofficial ""app store"" for tie-in services. Cellular operators, wary of becoming ""dumb pipes,"" aren't sitting idly by. Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, and others getting in on the action with their own app stores. Not every company is a natural fit for creating app stores, so another market is forming for firms that help set them up. A firm called GetJar has helped Sony Ericsson and the cellular carriers Optimus (in Portugal) and 3 (in the UK) with app stores. Amdocs and Comverse, which already provide various services to carriers, have added ""app store provider"" to their offerings. Other firms are helping developers deal with the sudden rash of app stores. A California startup called GoldSpot Media recently launched miApp, designed to let developers ""design once, deploy in any app store."" Of course they weren't thinking about app stores outside the mobile space when they wrote that tagline. From hand-held to real-world . Few anticipated the app store meme spreading to cars, for instance, but Atlanta-based Hughes Telematics says it's helping automakers prepare app stores for drivers. For safety, some of these apps would use an audio-only interface for drivers, or be usable only by passengers or when parked, notes Kevin Link, a vice president with the company: ""Automotive applications must consider driver distraction, network security, and reliability within the vehicle."" But the possibilities are tantalizing and include taking pictures of a thief in action, playing catch-up audio clips of TV shows, deciphering that obscure Check Engine light, and remotely starting the engine or resetting the car alarm. Such apps could be accessed through home computers or smart phones, as well as from within the vehicle itself. Hughes Telematics can't reveal too many specifics about upcoming app stores because their rollouts depend on the schedules of the carmakers. And many details have yet to be worked out, notes Link, such as how revenues will be split with the developers. An app store of sorts will also be offered later this year by Roku, which sells a TV set-top box that connects to your broadband connection and brings online content to your living room. The box already lets customers order Netflix movies. With the upcoming app store, online content normally reserved for computers will be easily accessed over the TV. Possibilities include video and audio podcasts and photo-sharing destinations. As with the App Store, the idea is to let any developer (most likely a content owner in this case) offer their product through the platform. ""What an open platform does is create an opportunity for any content owner or content aggregator that has access to content, to make that content available for viewing on the TV,"" notes company spokesperson Brian Jaquet. Between six and 12 new apps, or channels, will be offered by the end of this year, he adds, and more will follow. Of course exactly what will follow is unclear because -- as with the other App Store-like offerings -- the only real limit is the imaginations of developers. Stay tuned.","Apple's 'Apps Store' has become hugely successful and mimicked by others .
Away from hand-held gadgets, apps being developed for cars and TV set-top boxes .
Such apps could be accessed through home computers or smart phones ."
"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Roger Federer faces a potential quarterfinal clash with Nikolay Davydenko after his recent nemesis was drawn in the same quarter of the field for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday. The Russian has beaten Swiss star Federer in his past two meetings as he has risen to sixth in the rankings, winning the 2009 season-ending ATP World Tour Finals. Last year's losing finalist Federer faces Davydenko's unseeded compatriot Igor Andreev in the first round, and could play former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia in the third. To get to Federer, Davydenko -- who starts against a qualifier -- may have to face last year's semifinalist Fernando Verdasco, or the Spanish ninth seed's compatriots Juan Carlos Ferrero and Carlos Moya, who are both former top-ranked players. Third seed Novak Djokovic is also in Federer's half of the draw, along with No. 8 Robin Soderling. The Serbian could face Soderling, last year's French Open finalist, in the quarterfinals before a potential semifinal with Federer. World No. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal heads the other half of the draw, where he could face Andy Murray in the quarterfinals. Murray has paid the price for deciding against defending his Qatar Open title earlier this month, with the Britain dropping outside the top four in the rankings. If he were to get past Nadal, Murray could possibly face a semifinal against U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, who is fourth seed and expected to play despite pulling out of the Kooyong Classic with a wrist problem. Del Potro could play American seventh seed Andy Roddick in the last eight. Verdasco will play Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who is seeded 10th for the season's first Grand Slam tournament in Melbourne, in Saturday's final in the exhibition event. Meanwhile, 2006 Australian Open runner-up Marcus Baghdatis will play Richard Gasquet in the final of the Sydney International event on Saturday. Cypriot Baghdatis is aiming for his second title in three tournaments, having won the Stockholm Open at the end of last year. Frenchman Gasquet is seeking his first ATP Tour title since September 2007, having served a ban for a positive cocaine test last year which was later reduced due to mitigating circumstances.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she took on the ""complicated and difficult"" task of trying to restart talks on Israeli-Palestinian peace during her talks with Egypt's leaders. Egypt is ""an essential partner"" in that effort, she said. ""President Obama, special envoy [George] Mitchell -- who is here with me today -- and I are all deeply and personally committed to achieving a two-state solution and comprehensive peace between Israelis, Palestinians and all of their Arab neighbors,"" Clinton said at a joint news conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Ali Aboul Gheit. She spoke on the final stop on her weeklong trip that stretched from Pakistan to the Middle East. Clinton met with Aboul Gheit and other Egyptian leaders before consulting Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Clinton angered Palestinian leaders during her stop Saturday in Jerusalem when she praised Israel for what she called ""unprecedented"" steps to limit -- but not fully halt -- the construction of Jewish settlements. Egyptian leaders told Clinton her statement was perceived as ""a sort of backtracking"" and ""listened with great interest"" as she insisted the U.S. opposition to settlements has not changed, Aboul Gheit said. ""We talked about this very clearly and very candidly,"" he said, noting that Egypt feels that Israel ""is hindering the process"" by continuing its settlement activities. Clinton again clarified the U.S. position at Wednesday's news conference in Cairo: ""Our policy on settlements has not changed. I want to say that again: Our policy on settlement activity has not changed,"" she said. ""We do not accept the legitimacy of settlement activity. And we have a very firm belief that ending all activity -- current and future -- would be preferable, and that is what we have put forth, and that is what we have continued to support."" But Palestinian frustration over Clinton's statement in Jerusalem and the stalled peace process was still on display Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Saeb Erakat, chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, said that if Israeli settlement construction did not end, it may be ""the moment of truth"" for the Palestinian leadership. Erakat raised the possibility that ""the two-state solution is no longer an option and maybe the Palestinian people should refocus their attention to the one-state solution where Muslims, Christians and Jews can live as equal."" Israel is opposed to any notion of a ""one-state solution,"" seeing it as a fundamental threat to the Jewish nature of the state. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been reluctant to embrace the idea of a two-state solution, something the United States and others see as the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton returns to Washington later Wednesday. She said she felt ""very satisfied by what we accomplished on this trip"" despite the complex issues at hand. ""Every issue that we touched on during this trip is complicated and difficult; each requires patience, perseverance and determination to see them through,"" Clinton said. ""If these were easy questions with simple answers, I would not have made this trip."" She said that a key part of getting the peace process back on track is improving the image of the United States in the region. ""It is important to recognize that after a period of time in which the United States' position was rejected or was certainly questioned, what we are doing is very carefully and consistently rebuilding those bonds, creating those partnerships, finding common ground so we and our international partners will be able to make progress,"" she said. When asked for a timeline of the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks, Clinton would only say, ""We are working hard to see that happen. I'm not going to make predictions.""","Hillary Clinton: Egypt ""essential partner"" in helping restart Mideast talks .

"(OPRAH.com) -- People across the country are counting their pennies more closely than ever and asking themselves some tough questions about what they can really afford. Suze Orman is here to approve or deny what your finances can handle -- and this time around, she's settling a few family feuds. Money expert Suze Orman answers the question that keeps people up at night: Can I afford this? Many women have husbands with expensive hobbies, and Michaela is one of them. Michaela has her own Mary Kay business and just started her own cake decorating business. Her husband Chris works in sales and is the ultimate Washington Redskins fan. ""When I met him, I knew he was a Redskins fan. I just really had no clue he was a Redskins fanatic,"" she says. Michaela estimates her husband has spent about $25,000 on his ""man cave""--including a $2,200 television, a $900 surround-sound system, custom-framed photos worth about $300 and a poker table worth $500 to $1,000. Chris spares no expense to get Redskins gear for their three kids, Michaela says -- including jerseys and a Power Wheels Escalade in the Redskins' burgundy color. ""I happen to know my husband's e-mail password, and there are 320 e-mails of tracking purchases,"" she says. ""I would say that [delivery services are] at our house almost every day."" Oprah.com: Battle your urge to splurge . Michaela says Chris didn't grow up with much and now wants to enjoy some of his success. But Chris and Michaela aren't debt-free. Together, they owe $130,000 in student loans. ""It often makes me wonder if we will ever get them paid off. If we'll ever get to the point where we can start thinking about our kids' college and the future so they don't have the loans that we have,"" she says.  Watch saving money in tough times Â» . So Michaela has a question for Orman: ""With all of our student loans and his fabulous hobby, can we afford his hobby or should we be putting the money somewhere else?"" Chris estimates that he spends about $7,000 a year on his hobby. Can he keep it up? Orman runs the numbers. Chris and Michaela's monthly income is $9,000, and their monthly expenses are $7,700. Even with $1,300 leftover every month, they still face their large student debts and only have $5,000 in an emergency fund. ""In this economy, what I'd like to see is that people have at least an eight-month emergency fund, which would be $40,000 because we have three children here,"" Orman says. Orman denies Chris -- but with love. ""We only have $5,000 of an emergency fund,"" she says. Chris and Michaela have life insurance, but Orman says it's simply not enough. Chris is insured for $350,000, and Michaela is insured for $200,000. The couple still owes $290,000 on their mortgage, which is $2,200 each month. If Chris dies, his life insurance policy will only cover the mortgage --and still leaves the Michaela with $4,000 a month in expenses. ""What is the rule of thumb? You plan for the worst and you hope for the best,"" Orman says. ""But [Chris is] in sales. Anybody in sales, anything can happen at any time. So I love that you love football ... But you cannot afford it, sir."" Chris takes everything in stride. He says he's already started to look into better life insurance policies and wants to start college savings funds for his kids. ""My friend, he gets it!"" Orman says. Oprah.com: How to save for college . Ken and Deb are a couple facing a heart-wrenching life decision in the middle of a poor economy -- divorce. Married for 12 years, the couple has a 9-year-old son and twin 7-year-old girls, one with Down's Syndrome. ""Having the three children, it's been taxing on us. It just seems like we never get a chance to be alone and be together and just talk things out,"" Ken says. ""We're just not on the same page."" Deb says she doesn't put Ken -- or herself -- first. ""My children are first and foremost in our life, and I don't think that's a good way to build a marriage or a life either,"" she says. ""You kind of cast the other person aside."" Ken and Deb signed separation papers in April 2008 but still live together in the house they purchased 10 years ago. ""Ken and I have been living in separate rooms since last November. He lives down the hall in what used to be our home office, and it's very difficult living under the same roof,"" Deb says. ""Unfortunately, we cannot afford to financially divorce and move on with our lives."" In April 2009, Ken and Deb will be officially divorced. To complicate matters, Ken recently found out that he will be losing his job. ""I think if Ken and I separated, we'd both be more relaxed and we'd be happier people,"" Deb says. ""Obviously, we cannot afford to maintain separate households."" Deb has come to Orman for help with her question -- can she afford to get divorced? Before Ken lost his job, the couple made a combined $4,500 a month. With only Deb's income, the household total will decrease to $1,645. Monthly expenses that will not decrease total about $4,300 each month. The couple also has $10,000 in credit card debt. Despite their precarious financial situation, Orman approves Deb for a divorce. ""In this particular situation, if they were to sell the house, there is enough equity in the house to pay off their mortgages for them to have $10,000 extra to pay off the credit card debt and for them each to have $5,000 to start over in renting an apartment,"" Orman says. Orman says Deb could rent an apartment for about $800 a month. ""And on everything else that I figured for her, she could live in that apartment with her children and make it for $1,645 a month, also assuming that one day Ken will have to pay child support when he does get a job,"" Orman says. Still, Orman says the real question here isn't about the money. ""Can she afford not to, emotionally speaking?"" Orman says. Because Deb says she never puts herself first, Orman wants to know how much longer Deb would stay in a marriage she says is already over. ""How much longer are you going to stay in a situation that you know is absolutely over because you think you don't have the money to leave?"" Orman says. ""You lose your soul for money. You lose your children in terms of not understanding what's happening for money. Is money worth that?"" But Deb's not alone. Orman says the No.1 deficit in this country is women not taking care of themselves. ""Women give of themselves. They never give to themselves. And that we have to change,"" Orman says. Deb says she's willing to try Orman's recommendations. ""I think we need to be separate to find out what we both need,"" she says. Oprah.com: Can one woman afford her dream wedding?

"(CNN) -- At a time when partisan politics are bitter, midterm election races are tight and almost every legislative effort is stalled, who would you expect to take the boldest step in years to address the deadliest war in the world, in the heart of Central Africa? Congress, of course. Quietly, over the past four presidential administrations, a powerful and deep bipartisan consensus has developed in Congress in support of a stronger U.S. policy toward Africa. The latest manifestation of this cooperation is a small but potent provision addressing Congo's ""conflict minerals,"" folded into the recently passed Wall Street reform bill. The trade in four conflict minerals -- tin, tantalum, tungsten (the 3Ts), as well as gold -- fuels the war in eastern Congo today. It's been the deadliest war in the world since World War II. We regularly travel to eastern Congo, and on our last trip, we traced the minerals from the mines. At the mines, we saw militiamen armed with AK-47 machine guns standing over miners and forcing them to work and pay bribes, including child miners as young as 11. We then crossed through army and rebel checkpoints, where smugglers paid off the commanders in U.S. dollars, and then witnessed how these same minerals were packed into barrels with Congolese flags on them and loaded onto planes and flown out of the country. We've seen how armed groups on all sides of the conflict are reaping hundreds of millions of dollars per year by controlling mines and trading routes, selling minerals to international traders and smelters, which in turn sell them to electronics and jewelry companies. By requiring that publicly listed manufacturers who use these minerals conduct independent audits of their supply chains, this legislation will help curb the conflict minerals trade. Courageous members of Congress from both parties fought hard together with a coalition of faith-based organizations, women's rights advocates and student groups for the past two years to enact this law, standing up for what is right and bravely battling against special-interest lobbyists. But some companies would have you believe otherwise and are using negative tactics to stall reform. Some critics in the corporate world have accused those campaigning for an end to the conflict minerals trade of advocating for a boycott of electronics companies. Some minerals trading companies have also argued that Congress and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of Congo, creating an embargo and hurting miners. These statements significantly distort what human rights advocates in Congo and the U.S. are pressing for. Let's first be clear: The statements originate with many of the same companies that have been knowingly purchasing conflict minerals for the past decade, according to the United Nations, and did nothing for years to avoid them. The bill and our campaign aim to develop a peaceful, legal minerals trade in Congo that will be the real benefit to war-torn communities on the ground. We oppose a boycott and, on the contrary, are asking consumers to urge their own cell phone, laptop and jewelry companies to ensure their products are conflict-free. Companies now have an opportunity to achieve this goal and help Congolese communities through three key steps: . -- Tracing: Determining the precise sources of their minerals. -- Auditing: Independently verifying these sources and trading routes. -- Certifying: Working with the Congolese, Rwandan, U.S. and other governments to develop a certification process that improves upon systems already created for other exports such as blood diamonds. These steps are complex, but they are achievable. The reality is that the bill will accelerate this supply chain reform, and Intel and Motorola are already starting a forward-looking audit process to purchase tantalum from legitimate mines, including those in Congo. Companies have at least 18 months from now to report to Congress on their audits, and during that time they will have ample opportunity to trace, audit and certify their supply chains. Some companies may choose to temporarily stop buying minerals from Congo while they reform their supply chains. In order to cushion the blow for those mining communities affected by such a decision, a miners' livelihood fund should be created to offer them real opportunities and help the Congolese economy through small business, microfinance and agriculture. Electronics, jewelry and minerals companies should partner with donors to set up this program as soon as possible. Congress has taken the first step, but we still have a long way to go in ending the conflict minerals trade and the war in Congo. Now the Obama administration must come through and partner with the Congolese government to help create a process for conflict minerals that builds on the lessons of the process that excluded blood diamonds from the marketplace, as well as addressing wider issues of army and governance reform. And electronics and jewelry companies should support these processes with a fraction of the profits they've earned from these conflict minerals over the past dozen years. Consumers, companies and governments can all play a part in ending this deadly trade and cutting off the fuel for the deadliest war in the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sasha Lezhnev and John Prendergast.","Congo's ""conflict minerals"" used in cell phones, other products, co-authors say .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A powerful bomb exploded on a passenger bus Tuesday afternoon in Manila's financial district, killing four people and injuring 15 others, police said. ""It's a huge explosion; it's so huge that it created a hole at the side of bus where it is presumed that the bomb was placed,""  said Makati Police Chief Froilan Bonifacio. Bonifacio said the explosion occurred around 2 p.m. The bus, owned by Newman Bus Lines, was approaching a Metro Rail Transit station on Buendia Avenue in Makati City, Manila's financial district, when it blew up. The area has been placed on high alert, according to Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay Jr., who arrived on the scene a short time after the blast. He said most of the victims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. ""We are still trying to determine what kind of bomb was used,"" Bonifacio said. An initial investigation showed the explosive device could have been placed under a seat on the bus, he said.

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na made history on Thursday by becoming the first Asian tennis player to reach the singles final of a grand slam tournament in the Open era, ending the Australian hopes of world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki. The 28-year-old, a beaten semifinalist in Melbourne last year, battled back to win 3-6 7-5 6-3 in two hours and 35 minutes as she saved a match-point in the second set. Wozniacki, seeking her first grand slam title, led 5-4 but Li responded with a superb forehand down the line to escape and went on to set up a clash with former No. 1 Kim Clijsters. The Belgian progressed to the Australian Open final for the second time with a 6-3 6-3 win over Vera Zvonareva that will lift her above the Russian to second in the world rankings. Tennis will miss the elegance of Henin . Last year Li and compatriot Zheng Jie both made the semifinals in an unprecedented achievement by Chinese players, and now she is looking to savor Saturday's experience against three-time U.S. Open champion Clijsters. No male or female player from the Asia region has reached the final of a grand slam event since the fully professional era began in 1968. ""This is good for me, for my team and good for Chinese tennis,"" the ninth seed told the WTA Tour website after beating a top-ranked player for the second time in her career, following 2008's victory over Serena Williams in Stuttgart. ""It's a good experience for my whole life, because many players play a long time but never come to the final of a grand slam."" Elbow injury forces Henin to quit tennis . The 20-year-old Wozniacki, who won the 2010 season-ending championship, is hoping to bounce back from her disappointment. ""I had a match-point and I didn't take it. Sometimes in tennis it's one ball that can change everything,"" said the Dane, runner-up at the 2009 U.S. Open. ""It's quite difficult to get through this one. I just need to get back on the practice court and keep working hard. Hopefully I'll get many more chances."" Clijsters is seeking her second successive grand slam title, but her first in Melbourne after losing the 2004 final. The 27-year-old had lost three of her previous four meetings with Zvonareva, but this time powered to victory in an hour and 13 minutes. ""I'm happy I was able to raise my level,"" Clijsters said. ""It's nice to be in the situation of last two standing and trying to finish on top. This is the last match -- give everything you have."" The 26-year-old Zvonareva was disappointed to fall short, having made the finals of the previous two grand slams at the U.S. Open -- where she also lost to Clijsters -- and Wimbledon. ""I just have to think about what I can do next time if I meet a player like Kim, who's playing her game perfectly. What can I do to hurt them? What can I improve in my game to come up with something better next time?""","Li Na goes one better than last year by reaching the final of the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- An electrical fire on board a Boeing Dreamliner caused the plane to lose primary electrical power during a test  flight Tuesday, the company said. The crew relied upon backup systems to land the  aircraft. ""The pilots executed a safe  landing and at all times had positive control of the airplane and all of the  information necessary to perform that safe landing,"" Boeing spokeswoman  Lori Gunter said Wednesday. Boeing is analyzing flight data  from the plane, a process it says will take several days, to determine the  exact cause of the fire. The company's initial inspection of the aircraft indicated damage to a  power control panel in the rear of the  aircraft. Boeing employees were conducting a test of a system designed to prevent fires  when smoke began filling the back of the cabin of the next-generation 787  Dreamliner, according to the company. The crew was testing a ""nitrogen generation system,"" which separates nitrogen from ambient air and pumps it into  fuel tanks as jet fuel is burned during a flight, Boeing said. The system is designed to prevent oxygen from filling the empty space and potentially igniting the fuel. There is no indication,  however, that Tuesday's fire was caused by the nitrogen generation  system, according to Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx. Boeing is grounding its entire fleet of test Dreamliners pending results of  its analysis of  hundreds of different data measurements to determine the cause  of the fire. The Dreamliner departed from Yuma, Arizona.  After about six hours of flight, smoke entered the cabin as the plane was on approach to Laredo,  Texas. ""It's something that needs to be taken very seriously,"" said Proulx. ""We need  to know what happened before we can determine the likelihood of its repeatability."" The 42 people aboard evacuated  using the plane's emergency slides, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Lynn Lunsford  said.  One person was injured during the  evacuation. ""We are continuing to gather data regarding this event,"" Gunter said in a statement. ""It's too early to tell what may have gone  wrong."" The plane is the second of six test Dreamliners, having undergone 179 flights and 558 hours of flight, according to Boeing  data posted on its website. The company does not intend to sell the test  plane to any airline customers. Boeing says it still intends to deliver the first 787-08 Dreamliner to ANA  Airlines in the middle of the first quarter of next year. ANA has 55 Dreamliners on order, which Boeing plans to deliver over  the course of several years. The Dreamliner is Boeing's new passenger jet, touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with  composite materials. It made its maiden flight in December 2009 after two years of delays, but the  head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division told CNN in July that the Dreamliner could still make its debut in early 2011. The company has nearly 900 orders for the jet around the world. Aviation experts say Boeing's testing problems are not indicative of the Dreamliner's ultimate safety. ""If I were a prospective passenger in a 787 I wouldn't be concerned,"" said  Snorri Gudmundsson, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""All these bugs  will be weeded out."" ""Boeing is quite thorough, not just because of requirements from the FAA but  because of Boeing's position in the industry,"" added Todd Curtis, a former Boeing electrical engineer. CNN's Frances Causey and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","NEW: An electrical fire cause the plane to lose power, Boeing says .

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Obama is set to take stock of the nation during his State of the Union address Tuesday, a civil engineers group gives the U.S. transportation system low grades. For example, the nation's bridges. Most of us don't think much about bridges until one we need is closed or is damaged or collapses, as the I-35W one did in Minneapolis in 2007, killing 13 people. Yet engineers all over the country who really know about such things say we ought to be thinking about bridges a lot more. And here is something we should consider: One in four of our bridges is either in need of repair or obsolete in terms of handling modern traffic and loads. That startling fact comes from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which every few years consults with dozens of the nation's experts on all sorts of infrastructure matters. The society gives U.S. bridges a grade of C. And bridges aren't the only problem in what we could call the State of the Union's Infrastructure. Roads, airports, water supplies, railways, dams, schools and on and on it goes; all are, according to the engineers' latest report in 2009, in pretty dire shape. The amount of air travel in the U.S. increased by 7% last year, but an overhaul of the air travel infrastructure is long overdue, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The group gave the nation's aviation system a grade of D.  Compared with trucks, railways are much more efficient for moving goods: using about 20% less energy per mile if used properly. But comparatively little has been invested in expanding U.S. railroad capacity. Rail gets a C minus.   What is the state of your community? Tell us . Consider this: Although a steady drinking water supply is crucial to even the most basic success, water systems nationwide are so old and decrepit that the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates 7 billion gallons of drinking water are being lost through leaky pipes every day. How can America save crumbling water delivery systems? Inland shipping along canals and rivers keeps millions of American homes warm with coal and families fed with grains such as wheat and corn. But locks on canals and rivers, which were made to last only 50 years, are now on average 60 years old. Navigable waterways get a D minus from the civil engineers.   See details of the ASCE report card . Public transit use grew 25 percent in the past 10 years, and yet fully half of all Americans have no access to commuter buses or trains; many more have sketchy access at best.  You get the picture. However, it may be a little harder to see the multiplying effect. Experts at the American Society of Civil Engineers point out that for each year that these infrastructure problems are not addressed, they grow exponentially worse. It's kind of like a leak in the roof. It may be painful to pay for new shingles when the leak is small, but if you wait until it expands and soaks the walls and floors below, the damage and cost will be much, much harder to bear. In recent years, many politicians have started talking much more seriously about infrastructure problems, but when faced with a stumbling economy, they are finding it harder than ever before to lean into big-ticket repairs.   After all, until the day comes that a bridge falls down, it often looks just fine. The problem is, no one really knows which day that will be.","Society of civil engineers gives U.S. low grades for transportation infrastructure .

"(CNN) -- Eight people who died in a fire in an abandoned building in New Orleans, Louisiana, overnight are believed to have been in their late teens or early 20s, the city fire department said Tuesday. The victims, who were in a small warehouse in the Upper Ninth Ward, are believed to have been homeless and were burning a fire to stay warm, officials said. Two squatters tried to wake the others but had to eventually flee through a window in the tin building, authorities said. A fire department dispatcher said the call came in shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday. ""The area is known to be frequented by transients,"" said fire department spokesman Capt. Edwin Holmes Jr. Those inside apparently were burning trash in a barrel, Holmes said. An investigator indicated the bottom of the barrel may have burned through, Holmes said. Authorities also found the remains of two dogs. Chief Charles Parent told CNN affiliate WDSU that the victims may have sough warmth inside the building as temperatures dipped below freezing in the area. A freeze warning was in effect for the region early Tuesday, WDSU reported. Holmes said that numerous phone calls Tuesday indicated that some of the victims may have been from out of town. The building is less than a mile from the French Quarter and was likely abandoned before Hurricane Katrina. Many of the victims may have known each other by nicknames, Holmes said. The area is known for panhandling, he said. Authorities were in the process of identifying the badly burned victims, who may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning or smoke inhalation, Holmes said.","NEW: Victims were in their late teens or early 20s .

"(CNN) -- Japan secured their place in the final of the Asian Cup after a dramatic penalty shoot out victory over South Korea. Coach Alberto Zaccheroni's side triumphed 3-0 on penalties after the game was level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and 2-2 after extra time. Japan will now face Australia in Saturday's final, after the Socceroos demolished Uzbekistan 6-0 in the other semifinal. South Korea started the match brightly and took the lead on 23 minutes after Japan defender Yasuyuki Konno brought down Manchester United star Park Ji-sung in the penalty area. Ki Sung-yong converted from the spot. CNN blog: Can an Asian team ever win the World Cup? Japan have been no strangers to going behind in this tournament, and they duly struck back nine minutes before the break. Yuto Nagamoto latched onto Keisuke Honda's through ball and squared for Ryoichi Maeda to level the tie up at 1-1. South Korea enjoyed the best of the second half and went close when Koo Ja-cheol  hit the side-netting with a low shot before Lee Yong-rae's free kick flashed narrowly wide of the target. As the game moved into extra time Japan upped the tempo and were rewarded when Shinji Okazaki was felled in the area by Hwang Jae-won. The striker's penalty was saved by Jung Sung-Ryong but substitute Hajime Hosogai made no mistake from the rebound. Though South Korea laid siege to Japan's goal in the closing stages they couldn't fashion an opportunity to level. But right on the full time whistle Hwang Jae-won slammed home a loose ball after a scramble in the area. South Korea's joy was short lived though, as they missed all three of their penalties -- Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima making two fine saves -- which left Yasuyuki Konno to convert the winning penalty and spark wild scenes of celebration. The other semifinal was a hugely one-sided affair as Australia thrashed Uzbekistan 6-0. It took just five minutes for Australia to break the deadlock as Harry Kewell fired a low shot into the bottom corner. Sasa Ognenovski made sure Australia went in with a 2-0 cushion at half time as he fired home a loose ball after Tim Cahill had nodded down a David Carney center. Carney added the third on 65 minutes when he tucked the ball under Uzbek goalkeeper Temur Juraev after Matt McKay's precise pass. Moments later Ulughbek Bakaev was dismissed after picking up his second yellow card. It was 4-0 less than ten minutes later as Australia sprang the offside trap and substitute Robbie Kruse squared for Brett Emerton to tap into an empty net. Carl Valeri made it five eight minutes from time as he turned home McKay's cross and Uzbekistan's misery was complete when Kruse's shot squirmed past Juraev.","Japan beat South Korea on penalties to book their place in the Asian Cup final .

"Washington (CNN) -- With its well-killing effort reported to be going ""extremely well,"" BP plans to start pouring concrete into the crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday. The U.S. official overseeing the response to the spill, retired Adm. Thad Allen, has given BP a green light to pour cement on top of the 2,300 barrels of heavy drilling mud already sent down the well. The mud drove oil back into the reservoir in an operation known as a ""static kill."" But Allen said BP should follow that with a second well-killing procedure that has been in the works as sort of an insurance policy -- pouring additional mud and cement through a relief well that's expected to be ready in mid-August. ""Based on the successful completion of the static kill procedure and a positive evaluation of the test results, I have authorized BP to cement its damaged well,"" Allen said Wednesday in a statement. ""I made it clear that implementation of this procedure shall in no way delay the completion of the relief well."" Earlier Wednesday, Senior Vice President Kent Wells reported that the initial step in the static kill had gone ""extremely well."" The company began pumping the mud Tuesday afternoon, and the operation continued for some eight hours. BP pumped mud into the well from a ship on the surface mostly at the rate of five barrels a minute. That eventually increased to 10 and then 15 barrels a minute near the end of the operation, according to Wells. ""Everything proceeded exactly as we expected it to,"" he said. The move essentially sealed the well, which had poured oil into the Gulf for nearly three months until a tight-fitting cap was placed on it in mid-July. Wednesday marked the 107th day since the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history began with the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon that sank the rig and killed 11 workers. The government estimates that nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil spilled into the Gulf. But Wells noted that it has been 20 days since the well was fitted with a tightly-fitting cap, which stopped the oil from flowing and made it possible to permanently seal the well through the operations now under way. ""It's getting very difficult to find any oil on the surface, but I want to emphasize that BP remains committed to getting this well permanently shut and cleaning up any pollution and restoring the Gulf Coast,"" Wells said. ""That was our commitment from the beginning, and we're just as committed to that today."" While it may be difficult to find much oil on the surface for skimming ships to collect, local officials are quick to point out that coastal areas are still being affected. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries issued a report Wednesday indicating that oil sheen and patches of oil are still being spotted in marshes and various coastal areas in St. Bernard, Paquemines and Jefferson parishes. And in another development Wednesday, Louisiana wildlife officials and the state's Special Investigations Unit said two men had been arrested and accused of falsifying documents to file claims with BP. Authorities said An Ly, 36, the owner of Ly Ly Seafood, and Samith Huynh, 31, falsified documents from January through April, reporting the sale of 6,347 pounds of crabs for $9,548.91 during that period -- in the months before the Deepwater Horizon explosion. According to the arrest warrant, Huynh acknowledged receiving $5,000 checks from BP America in May and June. But the warrant said that when confronted by authorities, both men admitted they did not sell or purchase any crabs in the months  leading up to the explosion, after it was pointed out that Huynh didn't have a commercial fishing license during that time -- and only obtained one in May. The men, from the town of New Iberia, Louisiana, southwest of Baton Rouge, were booked Tuesday in the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. If convicted, they could face fines up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail. BP has promised to compensate people impacted by the spill, and In a meeting with President Barack Obama in June, BP executives agreed to set up a $20 billion dollar fund for that purpose. Meanwhile, Carol Browner, director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, talked about the well-killing efforts on CNN's Situation Room. She told Wolf Blitzer, ""It's not mission accomplished, but obviously, it's an important day."" ""We know the static kill worked, and we know we're not going to have more oil leaking into the Gulf,"" she said. But she noted the relief well operation lies ahead, and said, ""We also have the long-term restoration. So we're just beginning one phase as we end one phase."" Looking ahead to that next phase, coastal parish leaders and state officials in Louisiana submitted a transition plan to the Coast Guard on long-range cleanup efforts. The plan was developed after a meeting last week with Gov. Bobby Jindal, coastal parish presidents, Coast Guard officials and BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. The plan notes that federal, state and local authorities all must agree that shorelines are clean, before the effort will stop. On that cleanup front, a government report released Wednesday indicated that 74 percent of the oil that leaked from the well over nearly three months has been collected, has dispersed or has evaporated. Several agencies were involved in the study including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of the Interior. Of the total amount of oil that spilled in the Gulf of Mexico -- the most recent estimate is 205.8 million gallons -- just 26 percent remains in the water, either on or just below the surface as a light sheen and weathered tar balls. Of the remaining 26 percent, ""much of that is in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore,"" said Jane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator. The tar balls are either washing ashore, being collected from the coastlines, or buried in sand and sediment and are in the process of being degraded, the report said. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: BP given green light to pour cement down well as part of ""static kill""

"(CNN) -- A Utah military facility that tests chemical and biological weapons was opened Thursday after a nearly 12-hour lockdown that officials said was prompted by a missing vial of ""nerve agent."" ""On January 26, during a routine inventory of sensitive material in the chemical laboratory, Dugway officials discovered a discrepancy between the records and the agent on hand,"" said a statement issued by the U.S. Army's Dugway Proving Ground. ""As a precaution, the commander immediately locked down the installation and began efforts to identify the cause of the discrepancy."" The facility was put on lockdown about 7:25 p.m. ET on Wednesday, spokeswoman Paula Thomas said. Authorities said only that the move was ""to resolve a serious concern within the Test Area."" The discrepancy was found to be less than a milliliter, or less than one-fourth of a teaspoon, of VX ""nerve agent,"" the statement said. A vial containing 1 ml was located about 3 a.m. Thursday (5 a.m. ET), the statement said. As of about 6:15 a.m., authorities said personnel had been allowed inside and would be allowed to go home shortly. ""All personnel are uninjured and safe,"" the facility said in a news release. ""The public is safe as well."" VX is an amber-colored, odorless and tasteless oily liquid that does not evaporate easily unless temperatures are high, officials said. ""It evaporates very slowly, almost like motor oil."" People can be exposed to the agent through skin contact -- the most toxic way -- or through eye contact or inhalation, the statement said. VX affects the body's ability to carry messages through the nerves. About 1,500 employees and contractors are stationed at the proving ground, which covers 798,214 acres and is located in the Great Salt Lake Desert, around 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.

"Washington (CNN) -- Diplomatic cables expected to be released soon by WikiLeaks could contain highly sensitive information that reveals U.S. negotiating positions, secret intelligence and other confidential matters, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia told CNN. The expected online disclosure has to be taken seriously, said James F. Collins, who served as ambassador to Moscow from 1997 to 2001 and is currently director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Leaking information of this kind will be detrimental to building the trust among officials necessary to conduct effective and productive diplomacy. It will impede doing things in a normal, civilized way,"" Collins said. ""I would think the information they will leak is likely to contain analysis, records of discussions or reporting on confidential conversations between officials or official policy recommendations or suggestions about policy or diplomatic actions,"" he added. The threat by WikiLeaks, the online whistle-blower website, to publish the information has prompted the State Department to undertake a massive review of diplomatic documents. A source tells CNN that every diplomatic mission document from 2006 to 2009 is under review. The United States has started to alert nations around the world about the possible leaks. In preparation for the WikiLeaks dump, the British government warning United Kingdom news organizations about the publication of any material which could endanger national security. The Ministry of Defence on Friday issued a so called ""D-Notice."" In the rarely used notice, the MOD told the media that before they publish potentially sensitive stories of a national security nature, they should seek the advice of a senior military official to avoid breaking the order. A senior Israeli government official said the American government contacted the Israeli government a few days ago to inform them about the possibility of internal U.S. communications about Israel being publicly released. The official would only speak on condition he not be identified. He did not know the full scope of what topics the documents may cover, the official said, but noted that Israel was told by the Americans that the leak was part of a much larger document dump by WikiLeaks, most of which had nothing to do with Israel. The Israeli government official added that the American government said it did not want Israeli officials hearing about the leak for the first time in the media. Israel was satisfied with the way the United States was handling the problem and there was little expectation in Israel that this would create a major rift in relations, the official said. A spokesman for the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tobias Nilsson, told CNN his government also had been alerted by U.S. authorities. ""We have been in contact with the U.S. Embassy here in Stockholm and they have informed us about a possible release of documents by WikiLeaks,"" Nilsson said. ""I am, however, not going to speculate on why they contacted us or the reason for them alerting us about this. All I can say is that they have told us this might happen."" Norway also has been contacted, said Bjorn S. Jahnsen, spokesman at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""They have only told us that WikiLeaks might release new documents,"" Jahnsen said. ""They haven't said anything specific about the contents, they only alerted us that the release might happen."" The United States did not discuss whether the leaks might affect relations between the two nations, Jahnsen said. The information blitz from WikiLeaks would offer a glimpse into the worldwide communications of the State Department and its 297 embassies, consulates and missions through what commonly are referred to as ""cables."" Collins says cables are the telegrams used for official instructions, reports and communications from the Department of State in Washington to its international posts as well as from those posts back to the United States. Much informal communication today is by email and other kinds of modern communications, he says, ""but official instructions to the ambassador tend to come through telegrams, which an ambassador can assume have been properly coordinated in Washington."" Telegrams, when they go out of the Department of State, are shown as signed by the secretary of state and when they come in from any embassy or consulate in the field are shown as signed by the ambassador or a principal officer. ""Obviously,"" however, Collins notes, ""these individuals cannot and do not write and sign all of the telegrams."" Embassies send Washington ""reporting"" telegrams, which can include analysis by embassy officers of developments of importance to U.S. policy in their country or they may report meetings that the ambassador or other embassy officials had with officials in their host country. They also can contain substantive policy recommendations and observations. In addition, there are housekeeping and operational messages that are dedicated to the daily operations and needs of diplomatic offices and personnel. Telegrams are an essential means for keeping U.S. diplomats informed about policy and views in Washington and to alert them to important developments. The State Department sends ""world-wide"" telegrams to its missions around the world, ""regional"" telegrams to a select number of posts and telegrams to individual posts. ""They can be informational,"" Collins says, ""telling the ambassador and his or her staff about a policy initiative, for example: they can send texts of speeches, convey in-house information the Department of State wants embassies to be aware of or provide the reasoning behind policy, what Washington wants clearly understood."" Another kind of telegram contains official instructions. ""It says to an ambassador, 'Go take this action,' "" Collins said, ""instructing the ambassador or his staff, for example, to 'see so and so and seek his support for an American position on Afghanistan.' As an ambassador you would take that instruction, for example and, using it, seek out the appropriate person in the foreign ministry and make the case Washington has asked to be conveyed."" ""The most sensitive kinds of telegrams are instructions such as those to negotiators. These instructions were routinely sent to our negotiators on the START treaty or to those carrying on negotiations with allies about next steps in Afghanistan."" Collins says his major concern about leaking telegraphs and other official communication is that ""you cannot conduct business between governments effectively on CNN or in the news media. People with whom you talk on a confidential basis, where you're talking as government-to-government, or representative-of-government-to-representative-of-government and discussing something, implicitly assume that the confidentiality of the discussion will be preserved. Sure, everyone understands that you're going to report back to your own government what you said and what you heard, but they don't expect to see the exchange in the newspapers. ""Similarly, analysis that mentions names or says, 'No matter what everyone else is saying, we think the place is going to fall apart next week' is very sensitive,"" Collins says. ""It's not that you're trying to cover up somebody's mistakes. It's that you cannot expect people to provide their superiors candid advice and analysis if they expect to see their views politicized and made public. ""If WikiLeaks is putting out a whole raft of embassy reporting from Moscow or State Department instructions on Russia policy this is not good news,"" Collins told CNN, ""because these cables almost certainly will say things that will complicate relations between and among people involved, create resentments about publication of private information, and decrease the fragile confidence that has been building between the two governments. It could also reveal strategies or intentions to the detriment of our diplomatic strategy and tactics on a number of issues. And it can simply make life very difficult for embassy officers and other officials working to conduct our relations with Russia, depending on how all of this is released."" In Baghdad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq told a group of journalists Friday that diplomats ""are worried about additional documents coming out."" Ambassador James Jeffrey said, ""WikiLeaks are an absolutely awful impediment to my business, which is to be able to have discussions in confidence with people. I do not understand the motivation for releasing these documents, they will not help, they will simply hurt our ability to do our work here.""","NEW: British government warns media against endangering national security .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- It's the week before finals at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and all over campus, students are hunched over books and laptops under the shelter of immense palm trees and sprawled out on the cement benches lining the campus' long, grassy mall, the anticipation palpable. Elsewhere, in the Cesar Chavez Building, graduate student Francisco Baires sits in a windowless office that could have been a closet in a previous life, immersed in a different kind of work: He is sending a statement condemning Arizona's new anti-illegal immigration law to the media and other opponents of Senate Bill 1070. ""As students, we have a responsibility to fight this law through action and to raise our voices so those in power hear us,"" he said. ""The time has come for us to stop talking about it and be about it."" Baires is one of many student activists in Arizona and across the country leading the charge to kill SB 1070 before it takes effect this summer. The law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. Tea Partiers to illegal immigrants: 'Sign guestbook' The letter, which Baires and his cohorts are circulating as a petition, sums up the sentiments of many students. The 12 students of various ethnicities who spoke with CNN said they did not support the bill, citing concerns that the law would promote racial profiling and foster an environment of fear and paranoia among Hispanics, whether they are in the country legally or not. ""We believe that it is a law based in fear and racism. The law targets not only immigrants, but all Latinos (even those who are U.S. citizens) as well as any U.S. citizen who may associate with members of either group,"" the letter states. ""We want to halt the prejudicial momentum of Arizona's legislators and keep the campus of the University of Arizona a free, safe place for persons of all races, backgrounds and ethnicities."" The students' views are also a microcosm of the broader opposition nationwide to the bill, which Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Friday, citing concerns over crime and the failure of the federal government to regulate immigration. Dozens of protests have been staged nationwide, including in Tucson, where hundreds gathered outside the state capitol as the bill was being signed. What will Arizona immigration law do? ""It was incredible to see that the vast majority of those assembled were young people, some as young as high school,"" professor Roberto Rodriguez said. ""To many of them, who may have parents who are illegal or have relatives that live in Mexico, this is more than just a law; this is personal. This is a threat to their families. This could tear them apart."" Students have been at the forefront of the major social movements of the past century, but the advent of social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter allows them to organize at a faster and more efficient rate. ""The Internet really helps us reach a wide audience with the most up-to-date information,"" said student coordinator Jessica Mejia, one of many who helped organize the protest at the capitol. ""Now that the bill has passed, this is just the beginning."" iReport: Share your thoughts on immigration policy . Some critics of the bill are threatening legal action; others are pledging to boycott travel and business in Arizona unless they overturn the legislation. At the University of Arizona this week, resistance took the form of Immigration Awareness Week, a series of programs and information sessions organized by Mejia and others that included meetings on how the law works and an open forum for students to share their struggles with immigration. ""In my community, everyone has a sense of persecution. We're living in a constant state of fear,"" said Hector Gonzalez, 21, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen whose family lives in Phoenix. ""The law is instilling fear and limiting people from going out and doing chores, which will eventually have a direct economic impact on the community, too."" Even students who support immigration reform called the law ill-conceived. ""I can see how something needs to be done about illegal immigration, but this is taking it too far,"" said Nick Lunn, a 21-year-old film major. ""They say there won't be racial profiling, but I don't see how you can look past it."" Supporters of the bill point to language stating that officers cannot stop someone solely based on race, ethnicity and country of origin. Read the full text of Senate Bill 1070 (PDF) But student body representative Tyler Quillin said the word ""solely"" leaves the door open for race to be among the reasons that influences an officer's decision to detain someone. ""I see a definite separation, a disjoint between Latinos and law enforcement,"" Quillin said. ""Like they said on 'Saturday Night Live,' there's nothing more Nazi than 'Can I see your papers?' "" People also worry that the law will further marginalize undocumented immigrants by discouraging them from reporting crimes, accidents or injuries. ""It really worries me that this will increase public health issues and make them worse for women and children who might too scared of being deported to go to the hospital or to police if something happens to them,"" said Grecia Ramirez, a public health major. ""It really scares me to think about the long-term implications of this bill."" Ramirez and other students said they planned to continue attending protests such as the one Baires and his collaborators are setting up Wednesday, when they plan to present their petition to the school's president to sign. ""We want him to publicly state his support for our position in a show of solidarity,"" he said. ""We need to come together to fight this. There's strength in numbers.""","University of Arizona students crafting petition against Senate Bill 1070 .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- The clicking of dozens of news cameras drowned out the sobs of the 13-year-old girl, but her face explained what was happening in the departure hall of Japan's Narita International Airport. Arlan and Sarah Calderon hug their daughter Noriko farewell. Noriko Calderon, wearing her school uniform, was being forced to make one of the most wrenching choices of her young life: To stay in the country of her birth rather than join her parents being deported to the Philippines. The scene was the emotional climax to a story a decade and a half in the making -- one that has tugged at heartstrings in Japan, but ultimately failed to sway to an unyielding bureaucracy that activists say violates human rights. Sound off: Do you think Japanese authorities are doing the right thing? Filipinos Arlan and Sarah Calderon illegally entered Japan in the early 1990s on fake passports. They married and had a daughter, Noriko. Arlan found a stable job working for a construction company. Noriko grew up Japanese, attending school and never learning her parents' native language. Noriko, like many Tokyo girls her age, loves hip-hop and hopes to be a dancer or a teacher at a dance school someday. But her future in the only country she's ever known went into limbo when Japanese immigration authorities arrested her mother in 2006. Her parents decided to fight Japan's notoriously rigid immigration laws and for three years under a harsh media spotlight, they argued their case all the way to the country's High Court, saying Arlan is gainfully employed and their daughter only speaks Japanese. The family lost their case in the High Court, and Japan ordered Arlan and Sarah Calderon be deported back to the Philippines.  Watch CNN interview with family Â» . Activists claim Japan's notoriously rigid immigration laws violate human rights. An estimated 500 families are in the same situation according to lawyers, who accuse Japan of not respecting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Japan's Immigration Bureau in a statement to CNN said the couple's illegal presence in the country as an ""extremely malicious"" violation that ""shakes the foundation of Japan's immigration control."" But when it came to 13 year old Noriko, the government gave the girl a choice: Her country or her parents. ""Japan is my homeland,"" says Noriko, when asked why she is choosing to stay behind. She will move in with an aunt, allowed to stay in Japan under a visa that the government will reassess yearly. Her life, say her parents, will be better in Japan. She'll have schooling and the dreams a big city like Tokyo can offer her, versus the impoverished farm community her parents will move back to in the Philippines. But as the Calderons packed up their small apartment in the days leading up to the deportation, the reality of what would soon happen to the family became more and more harsh. ""Until I'm an adult, I need my parents,"" Noriko said, her pink cheeks stained with tears. ""We won't be there when she needs us the most,"" said Arlan Calderon. ""She has to protect herself on her own. I'm so sorry about that."" Shogo Watanabe, the Calderons' attorney, collected more than 20,000 signatures in Japan to try and keep the family together in the country. ""Children should be protected when their parents are punished. It's the child's right. But there's no consideration for that at all. I do not think the government is being flexible,"" said Watanabe. Under Japanese immigration laws, the Calderons won't be allowed back into Japan for five years. They've asked for a special waiver to visit their daughter after a year, but it hasn't been granted yet. So their last, public hug could be the last time they see their daughter until she's 18.","Noriko Calderon born and raised in Japan by Filipino parents .

"(CNN) -- Irish low-cost airline Ryanair posted a â¬169 million ($240 million) loss in the last year after being hit with higher fuel costs and a writedown in its investment in rival carrier Aer Lingus. Ryanair has forecast a rise in passenger numbers this year. Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary said though that he hoped to see a recovery this year, forecasting profits to ""at least double"" thanks to anticipated lower fuel costs. The loss compares with a profit of â¬390 million the previous year. The company said that with the writedown on the Aer Lingus stake stripped out, its figures showed a more ""robust"" net profit of â¬105 million. The number of passengers travelling on Ryanair planes increased by 15 percent in 2008/09 to 58 million and the airline said it hoped to increase that number to 67 million this year by cutting average fares by upt to 20 percent. Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the Aer Lingus stake was ""an albatross around the company's neck."" He told the Press Association: ""There are, however, also a number of positives, not least of which is the determination of Ryanair to continue to make life uncomfortable for its competitors. ""Growth in passenger numbers and a focus on costs were proof that the company has a close eye on strategic wins, while further reductions in fares could well tempt travellers who are currently deserting other legacy carriers.""","Irish low-cost airline Ryanair posts â¬169 million ($240 million) loss in last year .

"New York (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has started talks with representatives of the Taliban, a move that analyst Fareed Zakaria says could bring an end to the nine-year-long war. Karzai convened a meeting Thursday with the Afghan Peace Council, which was formed to help negotiate with the Taliban. Referring to the militants, Karzai said, ""I call on them once again to use this opportunity and say 'yes' to this endeavor. I want them to come and bring peace to this land."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Thursday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Hamid Karzai has launched a council to help negotiate with the Taliban? What's the significance of that step? Fareed Zakaria: I think it's about time. If you look at any good study of civil wars, what you find is that most of them end in a negotiated settlement. Maybe because Americans have the memory of our civil war in which the North crushes the South, we somehow think that that's how civil wars end. But that's actually is very unusual. Watch an excerpt from Larry King's interview with Hamid Karzai . What normally happens is some kind of settlement that is negotiated in which the losers are reintegrated into the political order. Civil wars are unlike normal wars, because the winners and losers are going to have to live with one another. CNN: How does that apply to Afghanistan? Zakaria: The Taliban, which is mounting this insurgency, is not a foreign element within the body politic. The Taliban is basically the political representative of the conservative elements of the Pashtun community. The Pashtuns are 50 percent of Afghanistan. ... It is a political force in Afghanistan. Coming to terms with it politically and seeing if there's some way it can be reintegrated into the political order makes sense. You're not going to kill every member of the Taliban. They're not going to be exiled to a foreign land. They're going to be there at the end of the day so it's better to to have them in the tent. CNN: The U.S. military view seems to be that the talks haven't yielded progress so far, and a senior defense official told CNN, ""We don't think the Taliban believe that they're losing to the degree that they'd come to terms in large numbers."" Are the talks premature because the effects of the U.S. military buildup haven't been felt yet? Zakaria: First the very fact that the Taliban are coming to the table in a way they had not been willing to before suggests that they are feeling some pressure. But I also think you can't get too hung up with this idea that you have to negotiate from a position of strength. Ideally we would have them totally prostrate on the floor and that would be the time to negotiate. But the reality is that this is a very mixed military campaign. I don't know if it's going to be dramatically better one year from now or three years from now. See more opinion articles . This is a little like somebody who owns a stock, who says, it's at six now, I need to sell it, but I'm going to wait till it goes to eight. Well maybe it will go to eight, maybe it will go to four. You might as well start talking at this point. First of all you learn a lot in the process of negotiations. And secondly, the military campaign could move in many different directions. If the surge starts succeeding even more, that will be reflected in our negotiating posture. CNN: Is there an idea yet of what a negotiated settlement might involve? Zakaria: It seems as though the Taliban demands are that they want all foreign troops out. They don't want to accept the Afghan constitution and they don't want to lay down their arms. Now those are obviously their opening demands. Foreign troops aren't going to be out, but one could point out that President Obama has said there is going to be a reduction of foreign forces next year. On the Afghan constitution, there is a compromise there where there could be a few amendments to the constitution. But on laying down their arms, that it seems to me you can't really compromise, they would have to lay down their arms. Could some elements be integrated into the militia, or the Afghan national army? Perhaps -- that's what happened in Iraq. CNN: Isn't there also a clashing conception of society, with the Taliban being a closed society that doesn't recognize an elevated role for women as opposed to a potentially democratic kind of society that's envisioned by the Afghan constitution? Zakaria: Yes, it is the kind of society envisioned by the Afghan constitution. But Afghanistan is a fairly conservative society. While the extreme elements of the Taliban have draconian visions which are obviously not supported by the Afghans -- the polls bear this out -- it's also true that on issues of women's rights and some of the more progressive elements of the Afghan constitution, the Karzai government is in a minority and those rights are not popularly supported. There are clashing visions, but there is probably a reality of Afghanistan which is a lot more progressive and open than the Taliban believe but is still a society that is somewhat conservative, and often tribal, and with very traditional views on something like women's rights. The key is creating a situation where these rights are guaranteed but not fetishizing it. For example, one of the things the Afghan constitution has is a requirement for 25 percent representation of women in parliament. We don't have such a requirement either in the U.S. Constitution or in the amendments. Many European countries don't. Is it conceivable that something like that could be compromised? Perhaps, and that's the kind of thing where we'd have to be creative in coming up with a solution that moderates and some elements of the Taliban could live with. CNN: Is this an honorable exit for the United States? Zakaria: I think so, and it's not really an exit, it's a reduction in our forces and in our role. And I think it would be appropriate. We've been there for nine years. It's not the only battleground, the only place where al Qaeda operates. There are many more members of al Qaeda in Pakistan than in Afghanistan. You're trying to create a political settlement, and a self-sustaining political framework in Afghanistan that can survive the departure of American troops. And finally you're leaving enough troops in there where you could still prosecute a fairly vigorous counterterrorism operation against those elements of the Taliban or al Qaeda that continue to plot and plan to do violence to civilians, foreigners, westerners. And I do think, if we could get this kind of a settlement, it would be an honorable way for the United States to begin reducing its exposure in Afghanistan.","Afghan president Karzai is talking to Taliban representatives .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's new coalition government has embarked on a budget-deficit cutting strategy that is bold, brave and potentially very risky, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. It could turn out to be a model for the United States to follow -- or a prime example of what not to do in the wake of a severe recession. After forming a government in the wake of the May election, the ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats announced plans last month to cut spending and raise taxes in an effort to reduce the budget deficit. Zakaria, the author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday from London. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: The new coalition government in Britain has announced major steps to cut the budget deficit. What has the impact been? Fareed Zakaria: In general, I'd say the government is benefiting from having announced these cuts. There's a sense that they're being bold, they're being brave, they're taking on a big challenge. It particularly helps them that you have this coalition government, so the fact that the Liberal Democrats, who are really quite a left-wing party, are supporting the budget has given Conservatives more cover. ... It's important to remember that it's not just budget cuts, it's also tax raises. You have to give them credit for being serious about this. It is not pure ideology as with the right in the United States. They understand that if you're going to do something serious about the budget deficit, you've got to do both spending cuts and tax increases .There's simply no way for the math to work without doing that. Now, on the political side though, these changes have not come into effect yet. So there are two big questions, what happens economically when these budget cuts start going into effect and what happens politically -- how popular does the government remain at that point? But the biggest question is what happens economically. CNN: Is it too soon to take these steps as the world is coming out of a big recession, and government spending is seen as a way to speed the recovery from a recession? Zakaria: The crucial question here is about timing, and very few people would disagree that Britain had to get its public finances in order. There's a universal sense that the last Labour government spent too much money and borrowed too much money. But in the midst of a very weak economic recovery, does it make sense to slash spending, raise taxes, all of which will have the effect of putting some people out of work and reducing people's spending power. Here's the debate -- one side says that will reassure markets, that will bring interest rates on things like mortgages even lower, and that will give businesses confidence to invest, and the other side says once you inflict that much pain on the economy, people are going to spend less as people lose jobs or are taxed more heavily, which will cause an even more severe downturn. CNN: What does this mean for the rest of the world? Zakaria: Britain is the guinea pig here. We're all going to watch the outcome very closely because President Obama has taken a position in this debate. He told the G-20 countries, which includes Britain of course, that it is too soon to start withdrawing the stimulus measures. Britain is going further than withdrawing the stimulus measures, it's actually cutting spending. The big debate is over what will restore business confidence and what will make businesses start spending again. Because everyone agrees that government spending is only a bridge to business spending. At some point business has to start spending again. I'm pretty persuaded that the timing on this is bad. I think it would have made more sense to wait at least six months, if not nine to 12 months before beginning these measures. CNN: If you're going to have to do it eventually, why wait? Zakaria: It's really quite brave of the Conservatives to take on the fiscal problem but there is definitely a danger that they are doing it too soon and will put the economy into a lower growth mode. This is something that you have to remember for the United States as well. If you have lower growth, you also have a worse deficit because the biggest contributor to deficits is a decline in tax revenue. So the slower the economy grows, the fewer people who are employed, the lower the taxes going to the government treasury, the bigger and bigger the deficit becomes. So, in a strange sense, even to help the deficit in the short term, you need a little bit of government spending to get the economy going, to get people spending, to get them paying taxes. CNN: Does David Cameron's victory in the U.K. election tell us something about the future of conservatives in America? Zakaria: Outside Britain, people are struck by David Cameron, the fact that he's become prime minister, that he's fairly popular and he seems to be taking big, bold measures. But here people are still struck by how limited was the Tory victory, if you could call it a victory. After 13 years of Labour rule, when it would be only natural for the Conservatives to be given power for just cyclical reasons, after a very unpopular Labour prime minister and the worst economic crisis since the great depression, the conservatives still were not able to muster a majority and had to go into a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. CNN: Why couldn't the Conservatives put together a majority in the election? Zakaria: What thoughtful observers say was that the Conservatives still made no inroads in Scotland, did not make many inroads with working women -- which is a growing part of the population -- and they did not make many inroads with nonwhite minorities, people from India, and Pakistan and the Caribbean. As somebody put it to me, the Conservative brand is still a tarnished brand. To me, that was a very interesting lesson for the right in America. You can have the small government argument David Cameron was making. It did have a lot of appeal -- but to England, not Scotland and not to the nonwhites in England either. It made me wonder about the Republican Party in the United States, which of course has broader appeal, but still faces some of these same challenges. The midterm election looks like it's going to go very well for the Republicans because there is a lot of anti-incumbency sentiment and some anger at the Democratic Party. But to seal the deal, Republicans need to close the gap with nonwhites and working women, and there, the Republican Party, like the Conservatives, still faces some challenges. CNN: What other lessons are there for conservatives in the United States? Zakaria: The Republicans should really watch the British Conservatives. What David Cameron is trying to do is to modernize the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party was seen in Britain as too right wing, too extreme and too intolerant in many ways and what he's been trying to do is to broaden its appeal. David Cameron is more green, more environmentally active, than Gordon Brown. He's come out very strongly in favor of gay rights, he's come out in favor of the National Health Service. All of this is a signal that he's not a Conservative who's going to completely destroy England's welfare state. In a sense, working with the Liberal Democrats has been a godsend for David Cameron. The fact that he's in coalition with them means that when the far right of his party asks him to do something, he can say, I'm sorry guys, I just can't do it because we're in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and to keep the coalition together I have to moderate my stance. Now there's an interesting debate in Britain about whether he's modernizing the Conservative Party because he is himself a great moderate or because he just wants to win and he knows the center is where the electability is. In a sense it doesn't matter for Republicans watching it. You still need to be attractive to the center, to the younger generation, to working women and to ethnic minorities. Of course it will all depend on how this economic experiment goes. If these cuts put Britain in a double-dip, you'll see great strains on the coalition itself, and the Liberal Democrats will find it difficult to stay in this coalition. Then this whole thing spins out of control.","Britain's aggressive plan to cut its deficit is a bold but risky move, says Fareed Zakaria .

"(CNN) -- Classes resumed last Thursday at the University of Kansas at Lawrence, and by Monday 47 students had swine flu, a college official said. The CDC recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own. Although that's less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the 27,000-member student body, and no one has died or been hospitalized, the school has moved into action. ""The sanitizer's out,"" said Todd Cohen, director of university relations. The university sent e-mails to faculty members asking them to create contingency plans so that sick students are not required to go to class, and to commuter students and their parents warning them that the students may have to be isolated if they fall ill. That same message has gone to students in dormitories. Arrangements are being made to isolate anyone who's sick in their rooms by moving out their roommates and dropping off meals, Cohen said. None of the school's cases of swine flu -- also called H1N1 -- has proven fatal or resulted in a hospitalization, he said, and none of the reported cases has been confirmed. Public health officials are simply assuming that anyone with flu symptoms has swine flu, because it's the only form of the virus in circulation, he said. The school's health center can do little for those who show up for help. ""They're basically told to go home and rest and get better,"" Cohen said. Vaccines are unlikely to help much this year. Supplies are not expected until late October, and require some five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective. ""By then, it's December and the semester is almost over,"" he said. So public health officials are focusing on more basic medical efforts. Students already overloaded with information at the start of the semester are being urged to sneeze into their sleeves, wash their hands frequently and stay home if they get sick, Cohen said. ""It really comes down to them taking personal action,"" he said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own. Firm figures on just how many people have the illness are tough to come by. Doctors are not required to report it to state or federal health officials, said Maggie Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. ""We've stopped accepting tests from county health departments,"" she said. Instead, the department is focusing on a surveillance system that will test only those sites deemed representative. Otherwise, Thompson said, the state's laboratories would become overwhelmed. ""There are just too many numbers."" The state stopped counting laboratory-confirmed cases at 324: ""But that is just a fraction of what we think is going on,"" she said. ""There could be as many as 10,000 cases in Kansas already."" KU students are not the only ones catching swine flu, Thompson said: ""If you called any university of this size around the country it's probably going to be about the same."" At Auburn University in Alabama, 10 cases have been reported among the 24,000 students who started classes last Monday, a spokeswoman said. ""So far, everybody seems to be recovering,"" said Deedie Dowdle. The school's emergency management team was meeting this week to decide how to handle larger-scale absences, she said. ""I'm getting lots of reports of outbreaks in the Southeast Conference,"" said Dr. James Turner, president of the American College Health Association. ""I'm anticipating several thousand cases among college students this fall."" Among the preparations are plans for mass vaccinations, he said. But with school just beginning, much remains unknown, he said. ""We are just kind of hunkering down right now waiting to see where this goes."" Turner is also executive director for student health at the University of Virginia, where classes are slated to begin Tuesday. ""We're kind of bracing for what the week brings,"" he said. Turner said 63 students came down with swine flu during the summer session, and ""they all did fine."" Last week, the CDC released tips for school administrators to follow. ""We're hoping we're on track to be ahead of this virus, to get the college-age population vaccinated once it becomes available in mid-October, and to keep students as safe and secure as possible,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters in a conference call. Some U.S. colleges began reporting cases last April, after students returned from spring break. The University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, which reported one case of H1N1 last spring, is taking extra precautions ahead of the fall semester. ""We are attacking the disease, from each person taking the responsibility for good hygiene and healthy habits,"" said Ann Kleva, the university's director of health services. The University of California has been stocking up on supplies for each of its 10 campuses over the past several months, university system officials said. Since mid-April, when swine flu was discovered, the CDC has tallied 522 deaths in the nation. ""We do know that H1N1 flu is circulating in the country right now,"" said Lisa Barrios, of the agency's division of adolescent and school health. ""For the most part, it's sporadic and regional."" But she said the agency is not advising any schools to close. ""What we're doing is keeping a very close eye on what's happening with the flu during the fall and the winter,"" she said. The swine flu virus has captured the attention of public health experts because they worry it could mutate into a far more lethal form. ""If that does happen, then we may recommend that schools close, but right now we are not doing that,"" Barrios said. ""It's important to balance the risks with the benefits of keeping kids in schools."" CNN's Emily Sherman, Leslie Wade, Miriam Falco and Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this article.","Five days into new year, U. of Kansas at Lawrence has 47 cases of swine flu .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways posted the airline's worst annual loss since its privatization in 1987 as its chief executive declared there were ""absolutely no signs of recovery"" in the industry. BA CEO Willie Walsh says he's never seen conditions in the airline industry so bleak. The airline slumped from profit to loss in the last financial year. During the year ended March 31, its operating loss swelled to Â£220 million ($348 million) from a restated profit of Â£878 million ($1.4 billion) in 2008. ""I'm 30 years in this business and I've never seen anything like this. This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced,"" BA chief executive Willie Walsh told CNN's Richard Quest. Follow Quest on Twitter . Demand for the airline's passenger seats and cargo holds fell during the last financial year, while its fuel bill rocketed to almost Â£3 billion ($4.7 billion). Walsh said British Airways' woes were inextricably linked to the downturn in the global economy and that there had been no sign of any ""green shoots"" of recovery.  Watch Richard Quest's interview with Willie Walsh Â» . ""None whatsoever, and that's across the board,"" he said. ""In all of the markets we're operating in we see no evidence of recovery at this stage. I think there's some evidence of it bottoming out in some markets but absolutely no signs of recovery at this point."" Like its premium-class competitors, British Airways is losing customers to cheaper rivals. BA's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average. Total traffic fell 3.4 percent and while BA carried 33.1 million passengers in last year, a drop of 4.3 percent on the previous year. The dip in demand for British Airways flights has forced a switch in strategy at the premium airline from yields to volume. From the end of last year, it's been tempting passengers with lower fares, sacrificing profit per seat for ""bums on seats."" ""We're now saying it's getting that balance between yield and volume so it's more a focus on volume than it has been,"" Walsh said. He said the airline would target market share, ""where we believe that it is sustainable in the long term and will be profitable."" It plans to reduce capacity by four percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft. Walsh said the tough trading conditions hadn't killed off its plans for a merger with Spanish airline Iberia. He said the main barrier to the deal was corporate governance. ""It's getting the corporate governance for the combined single entity right -- that's a critical issue as far as I'm concerned."" ""Iberia do have some concerns about our pension deficit. We are very happy to listen to those concerns and I'm also very confident that we can address that,"" Walsh said.

"(CNN) -- The people who died Thursday at a spiritual resort in Arizona had spent time in a ""sweatbox"" similar to what Native Americans and other cultures have used for prayer and purification rituals throughout history. Two people died and were 19 injured after spending up to two hours inside this ""sweatbox"" at an Arizona resort. And those who use them say they can be dangerous if care is not taken. From Scandinavia to South America to Africa, people have come together in the sauna-like structures -- typically heated by pouring water on hot lava rocks -- for a variety of reasons, said Joseph Bruchac, writer and author of The Native American Sweat Lodge. He's part Abenaki, a tribe concentrated in the northeast United Staes, and part European. ""Each tribal nation has its own traditions, so one group might do it differently from another so you cannot generalize too much,"" said Bruchac, who runs an outdoor education center in Greenfield Center, New York. In North America, most Native American tribes use the term ""sweat lodge"" to refer to a dome-shaped structure where the intimate ritual of the sweat takes place, said Bruchac, who has his own sweat lodge on his property in the foothills of the Adirondacks. ""Sweat lodges are typically used for a ritual preparation, like before a hunt, or nowadays, people might do it before a wedding or dance or some kind of community event as a way of putting yourself in balance,"" he said. Bruchac noted that incidents like the one in Arizona tend to raise discussion in Native American communities over whether non-Natives should be allowed to adapt traditional ceremonies. ""It's a very meaningful ceremony. I can understand why people find it attractive,"" Bruchac said. ""But I consider it sacrilegious and foolish to do someone else's rituals without proper guidance or practice, especially in sweat lodges where you're raising people's body temperatures. With that many people, oxygen is going to be depleted, and if you have heart problems or breathing problems, you could faint or die."" No information about the sweatbox at the Angel Valley Resort near Sedona could be found on the Web site Saturday. The two people who died and the 19 others who fell ill there were attending a program by self-help expert James Arthur Ray, authorities said Saturday. Authorities said between 50 and 60 people were in the structure for nearly two hours -- far exceeding the number who ordinarily would participate in a traditional sweat, according to Bruchac. In a typical ritual, the leader of the sweat gathers four to 12 friends, family members or guests inside the structure, usually made of willow and covered with blankets or canvas, he said. ""The person running the sweat has to be very aware of the people in the lodge because he takes control of them mentally, physically and spiritually,"" said Bruchac. ""The leader is responsible for them, so he has to be aware of their physical conditions and their motivations, their reasons for being there."" After everyone is inside, a firekeeper heats stones, usually lava rocks, and brings them into the lodge, placing them in a hole in the ground and carefully pouring water over the stones to release steam. The technique of releasing the heat is done with great care so that no one is injured by the steam, which can burn skin or lungs if someone inhales it, said Father Raymond Bucko, Director of Native Studies at Creighton University. ""Nobody will make it so hot that no one can stand it,"" said Bucko. ""Religious leaders are very careful about people's health in the sweat. If they're not healthy, people can sit outside the sweat and pray and others can go in for them."" A ritual of speaking or prayer may follow, depending on the group's intention for gathering. ""People talk and often there's lot of humor, but at any time if it's too hot, some one can say so and they will immediately open the door and people are encouraged to go out,"" he said. The Jesuit priest and cultural anthropologist participated in sweats with the Crow and Lakota people for nearly 30 years, until he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago. ""It's not about toughing it out or proving anything. It really is a beautiful experience of people coming together, of intense prayerfulness.""","Sweat lodges are used in prayer and purification rituals across globe .

The U.S. delegation was met by an honor guard at the Great Hall of the People, and Obama shook hands with Hu and other top Chinese officials before the two leaders went behind closed doors. It is their fifth meeting in the past year, and they made no public statements beforehand but are to issue a joint statement after their talks. The United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year, while China is a major purchaser of the U.S. Treasury bonds that finance America's budget deficit. Facing a global economic recession, Washington and Beijing are in ""a mutual hostage situation,"" former Bush administration China analyst Victor Cha said. ""China needs to purchase these Treasuries in order to maintain a strong dollar. Otherwise, the value of their foreign currency holdings goes down dramatically,"" Cha told CNN. ""We need China in order to finance a lot of the deficit spending we're doing now. It's very much intertwined in a way that two countries in the history of international relations have not been intertwined."" China is also an important player in the diplomatic showdowns over nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and holds one of five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. China is North Korea's closest ally and has played a key role in the six-party talks aimed at convincing Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday found 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the United States, with two-thirds considering it a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies. The survey also found 51 percent of the U.S. public consider China a military threat, with 47 percent disagreeing. That 4-point margin is within the poll's 4.5 percent sampling error. But Obama told students at a town hall-style meeting in Shanghai that the two nations don't have to be at odds with each other. ""Our relationship has not been without disagreement and difficulty, but the notion that we must be adversaries is not predestined,"" Obama said. But he said there are certain core principles that all people must share -- including equal rights for everyone, a government that reflects the will of the people, open commerce, free access to information, and the rule of law. ""We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation, but we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation,"" he told the gathering. The issue of human rights has often been a sticking point between Beijing and Washington. China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities, keeps tight reins on the media and censors the Internet. Obama told the students that he is against censorship and is a believer in the free flow of information, calling it a ""source of strength"" in a democracy, despite the sting that sometimes comes with it. He told the students he welcomes a strong China, saying there are very few global challenges -- specifically referring to climate change -- that can't be solved if the United States and China work together. The town hall meeting was shown locally on Shanghai's Phoenix TV, but it was not broadcast nationally on any of China's state-run networks. The Xinhua news agency posted a translated running transcript of the event on its Web site. The United States also streamed the forum live on WhiteHouse.gov. Chinese censors did not block the event to those with Internet access. The final stop of Obama's trek is Seoul, where he will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and deliver a speech to U.S. troops at Osan Air Base. Obama is on an eight-day journey that is taking him to Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea. He'll return to the United States on Friday. The president left for China from Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum. He met on the sidelines with world leaders, including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.","NEW: Obama to hold formal talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing .

"(CNN) -- If there's a blessing in the current swine flu epidemic, it's how benign the illness seems to be outside the central disease cluster in Mexico. But history offers a dark warning to anyone ready to write off the 2009 H1N1 virus. The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 sickened an estimated third of the world's population. In each of the four major pandemics since 1889, a spring wave of relatively mild illness was followed by a second wave, a few months later, of a much more virulent disease. This was true in 1889, 1957, 1968 and in the catastrophic flu outbreak of 1918, which sickened an estimated third of the world's population and killed, conservatively, 50 million people. Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at George Washington University, who has studied the course of prior pandemics in both the United States and her native Denmark, says, ""The good news from past pandemics, in several experiences, is that the majority of deaths have happened not in the first wave, but later."" Based on this, Simonsen suggests there may be time to develop an effective vaccine before a second, more virulent strain, begins to circulate. As swine flu -- also known as the 2009 version of the H1N1 flu strain -- spreads, Simonsen and other health experts are diving into the history books for clues about how the outbreak might unfold -- and, more importantly, how it might be contained. In fact, the official Pandemic Influenza Operation Plan, or O-Plan, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based in large part on a history lesson -- research organized by pediatrician and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan. Markel was tapped by the CDC to study what worked and what didn't during the 1918 flu disaster. Markel and colleagues examined 43 cities and found that so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions -- steps such as isolating patients and school closings -- were remarkably successful in tamping down the outbreak. ""They don't make the population immune, but they buy you time, either by preventing influenza from getting into the community or slowing down the spread,"" Markel said.  Explainer: Flu facts Â» . Markel describes a dramatic example in the mining town of Gunnison, Colorado. In 1918, town leaders built a veritable barricade, closing down the railroad station and blocking all roads into town. Four thousand townspeople lived on stockpiled supplies and food from hunting or fishing. For 3Â½ months, while influenza raged in nearly every city in America, Gunnison saw not a single case of flu -- not until the spring, when roads were reopened and a handful of residents fell sick.  Visit LIFE.com for photographs of the lethal flu pandemic of 1918 . Nonpharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, also proved effective in big cities such as New York, according to Markel. In fact, the sooner cities moved to limit public gatherings or isolate patients, the less severe their experience tended to be -- as much as an eight- or ninefold difference in case and death rates, he says. Based on this guidance, the CDC preparedness plan devotes dozens of pages to potential NPIs, from voluntary isolation to reorganizing company work schedules to reduce the density of people sitting next to each other in the office or while riding trains and buses. If it seems odd to base medical strategy on 90-year-old newspapers, the approach is increasingly popular. ""There's a big case for looking at history,"" says Simonsen. ""We call it archaeo-epidemiology. You go to libraries and places like that, dig around, collaborate with people like John Barry and try to quantify what really worked.""  Map: where the flu is today Â» . Barry is the author of ""The Great Influenza,"" perhaps the signature history of the devastating 1918 pandemic. He says the historical record shows that isolating patients worked to slow the spread of flu in 1918, but that attempted quarantines -- preventing movement in and out of cities -- was ""worthless."" While Barry supports the CDC's general containment strategy, in the past he has publicly criticized Markel's work. After Markel's findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Barry wrote a letter in response, saying it wasn't swift action but rather an earlier wave of mild flu, acting like a vaccination, that was probably responsible for New York's relatively low caseload. In the letter, he noted, ""New York City Health Commissioner Royal Copeland did tell reporters ... that he would isolate and quarantine cases,"" but based on his own articles in the New York Medical Journal, he ""apparently never imposed those measures."" In response, Markel and CDC officials pointed to a decision by the New York Board of Health making influenza a reportable disease, and a 1918 JAMA article describing strict quarantine efforts in New York. Barry says both those sources rely on Copeland's assertions, which he considers unreliable. It looks superficially like an academic feud, but in this field, different conclusions can suggest radically different approaches to quashing a pandemic. Nowhere is this more true than in research that builds computer models to predict the spread of outbreaks, based on previous ones. Markel, along with most analysts, says that in prior pandemics, the so-called R-naught number -- the number of new infections caused by each infected person -- has been approximately 2.0. The current U.S. pandemic control strategy is based on computer simulations that assume a flu virus with an R-naught between 1.6 and 2.4. Last year, however, Simonsen and Viggo Andreasen concluded that the true R-naught of the 1918 flu virus was probably somewhere between 3 and 4. Since an epidemic grows exponentially -- each person sickens three others, each of whom infects three more, and so on -- this is a tremendous difference. ""It says it's going to be harder than we thought"" to control a pandemic, Simonsen says. Barry agrees. ""I do think that some of these things, like isolating [sick people], will take off some of the edge. We hope they'll do more than that. But to think they'll stop a pandemic, that is just not going to happen."" Simonsen says control measures such as the steps taken by Mexico in recent days -- closing schools and restaurants, for example -- are still worth the effort. ""It doesn't mean we should give up, because we don't know the R-naught [for swine flu]. We don't know how easily this spreads."" But she adds, NPIs are at best a way to buy time. ""We just badly need a vaccine. That's the most important thing."" To date, the CDC has emphasized personal protective steps such as washing hands and using hand gels, as opposed to tightening border controls or issuing formal directives to close schools or limit public gatherings. Such steps have been left to state and local officials, who have responded in a variety of ways. One reason for the delay in stronger guidelines is that swine flu caught planners off guard; they had anticipated being able to recognize a pandemic overseas, weeks or at least days before it hit the United States. At the same time, CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser said Thursday that it's important to let officials tailor their response to local conditions. ""They can take the recommendations we're providing and apply them locally. [By doing that] we hope to learn and see what are the most effective control strategies."" Markel agrees that the best response depends on the particular situation. ""History is not predictive science. And the powers of public health officials [in 1918] were much greater. Another difference is that people's trust of doctors and government in 1918 was probably remarkably different.... But what I have found, studying epidemics, is that good planning and good relationships between local state and federal authorities, goes a long way.""","CDC's national pandemic strategy rooted in lessons of past epidemics .

"Washington (CNN)  -- 2010 has opened on an unsettling note for Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Connecticut's Chris Dodd and North Dakota's Byron Dorgan -- two longtime power players in the chamber -- have announced their intention to step down at the end of the year. If history is any guide, the party now faces an uphill struggle to maintain its 60-seat supermajority. Failure to do so could have serious ramifications for President Obama as he tries to look past the health care debate and tackle global warming, ballooning budget deficits and a range of other politically contentious issues. The fight over health care reform has clearly demonstrated that 60 votes is now the minimum threshold for passing major legislation through the Senate. Anything less leaves the majority party at the mercy of a minority increasingly willing to employ the filibuster to grind the legislative gears of the Senate to a halt. Democrats currently have exactly 60 members in their caucus; Republicans have 40. The GOP knows that presidents typically lose House and Senate seats during midterm elections, and is banking on that fact to block much of Obama's agenda. ""Midterm elections are usually low-turnout affairs,"" noted CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""Conservative Republicans, however, have been energized by their strong opposition to Obama's agenda. They're likely to vote this November. Many liberals, on the other hand, don't feel Obama has pushed strong enough on their issues. It's unclear at the moment if they'll be as likely to show at the polls."" This year, Democrats must defend 19 seats, including an opening that occurred when veteran Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy died. A special election for Kennedy's seat -- widely expected to be won by the Democrats -- will take place January 19. Republicans are defending 18 seats. The GOP, according to many analysts, is now placing a high priority on picking up Democratic seats in Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The Illinois and Delaware seats were once held by Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, respectively. Obama's replacement, Sen. Roland Burris, was immediately tainted after being tapped to fill Obama's vacancy by Rod Blagojevich, the state's scandal-plagued former governor. Burris is not seeking election in his own right. Biden's replacement, Sen. Ted Kaufman, is likely to step aside in favor of the vice president's son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, analysts believe. Delaware's longtime GOP congressman, Mike Castle, is being touted as the likely Republican nominee. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is struggling to manage Obama's more progressive agenda while also seeking a fifth term from his traditionally conservative state. Republicans, however, are having a tough time unifying behind an opponent. At the same time, five-term Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter remains a high-profile target for conservatives enraged by his decision to switch from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party last year. Before he can get to the general election, Specter will face a tough primary challenge from Rep. Joe Sestak, a former admiral. Also in the GOP's crosshairs is two-term Arkansas Democrat Blanche Lincoln, who recently cast a tough political vote in favor of Reid's health care bill. Dodd's decision to retire, however, is widely believed to be beneficial to Democratic chances in largely liberal Connecticut. The state's popular Democratic attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, declared his candidacy a few hours after Dodd announced he was stepping down. Democratic leaders, for their part, are placing a high priority on picking up GOP seats in Kentucky, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Ohio. Republicans have been stung by incumbents' decisions to retire in all four states. Louisiana, a more conservative state, has attracted the interest of Democratic strategists. First-term GOP Sen. David Vitter has been tarred by his 2007 admission that he had a relationship with a prostitute. This year's race in Florida has also become an increasingly high-profile contest, largely due to Republican infighting. GOP Sen. George LeMieux, who was appointed to the Senate after former Sen. Mel Martinez unexpectedly stepped down last year, is not seeking a full term. The state's GOP governor, Charlie Crist, was widely expected to take the seat, but is now facing an unexpectedly strong conservative primary challenge from former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio. Republicans are still, however, favored to hold the seat. CNN's Mark Preston and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Democrats need 60-seat supermajority in Senate to get major bills passed .

"LONDON, England -- Two kisses on the cheek or three? The age-old dilemma may become moot as worries of infectious disease hang in the air. A couple kisses at a swine flu virus prevention and detection medical mobile unit in Mexico City. Common forms of greeting, such as handshakes and kisses on the cheek, are coming under scrutiny as the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, steadily spreads around the world. In Mexico, which has had the largest outbreak of the virus, the Ministry of Health is advising people to avoid shaking hands and kissing people as a greeting. Some couples are donning surgical masks when they kiss to avoid contagion. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent who has been covering the epidemic from Mexico, is advocating the ""el-bump,"" or bumping of elbows, as a greeting. ""It's not as cool as the fist bump, but safer,"" he wrote on micro-blog site Twitter. Follow Dr. Gupta's 'tweets' Dr. Richard Dawood, medical director of the Fleet Street Travel Clinic in London, refers to the shift in etiquette as ""social distancing."" ""People don't want to get too close. There is going to be a move towards less handshaking, less greeting people with a kiss. There may well end up being fewer meetings,"" he told CNN. The World Health Organization is advising people to practice preventive measures like avoiding close contact with people who appear unwell and those who are coughing and have a fever. The global health agency is also directing people who live in areas where flu cases have surfaced to follow additional precautions set out by their national and local health authorities. Even countries where the virus hasn't been confirmed are taking precautionary measures. At a news conference earlier this week, Lebanon's health minister recommended that people stop using the conventional greeting of three kisses to the cheek.  See where cases have been confirmed Â» . ""We're heading toward a world where everyone is going to be suddenly much more conscious of those who are coughing and sneezing,"" Dawood said. People will have to be much more conscious of hygiene and stay out of close proximity with others when they aren't feeling well, he said. Are you changing your etiquette because of the swine flu epidemic? Tell us in the SoundOff below . The H1N1 virus is a hybrid of swine, avian and human flu strains. It is a respiratory disease that is contagious, and believed to be spread through coughing, sneezing and close contact.  Learn more about the virus Â» .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  --   Actor and political activist Ron Silver, who played a recurring role in TV's presidential drama ""The West Wing,"" and who also let his political views play out in real life, died Sunday after a two-year battle with esophageal cancer, according to a colleague. Ron Silver is seen in this 2006 photograph. He had a recurring role in TV's ""The West Wing."" Robin L. Bronk, executive director of The Creative Coalition, said Silver, a New York native, died in his sleep with his family around him. ""Nothing could hold Ron back, not even a debilitating illness. His contributions as an artist and activist will never be forgotten,"" said Bronk, who runs an organization founded in 1989 by Silver, actor Christopher Reeve and other prominent figures in the arts as a political advocacy organization for the entertainment industry. Silver's politics moved from working for the Democratic Party and its candidates for most of his life to becoming a supporter of many Republican candidates and causes, with the shift occurring after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was quoted as saying the terrorist attacks and the Democratic Party's policies regarding terrorism had persuaded him to become a political independent. He backed then-President George W. Bush for a second term in 2004, and he spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. One of Silver's final television appearances was on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last October, when he was part of panel discussing Sen. John McCain's campaign against then-candidate Barack Obama. Asked by King about rifts within the Republican Party as the election neared and the country's financial crisis worsened, Silver said, ""The Republican Party, if they are out of power for a while, needs to regroup and rethink who they are as a party. This deregulation, this whole Reagan Revolution, did not seem to work in this crisis.""

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum was forced to retire from the fourth game of the NBA finals with an ongoing knee problem, as his team went down 96-89 to the Boston Celtics. Bynum had fluid drained from his knee just days before the first game of the best-of-seven series last week, but until now the injury has not hampered his performance. However, the 22-year-old spent almost half of Thursday night's game in Boston on the bench, only managing 12 minutes of action in the second half as L.A.'s East Coast rivals leveled the finals at 2-2. ""Obviously we miss Andrew when he's not out there,"" the Lakers' Spanish center Pau Gasol told his team's official Web site. ""He's been so effective blocking shots and rebounding. Those two things alone are a big plus for us."" Trailing two points going into the last quarter, the Celtics came from behind to win the game to prevent the defending champions from pulling ahead in the series. Paul Pierce was Boston's top scorer, finishing with 19 points. But veteran Celtics players Glen Davis and Nate Robinson were instrumental in their team sealing the win. Coming off the bench Davis scored nine of his 18 points in the final quarter and Robinson all of his 12. ""I just felt like a beast. I just felt like I couldn't be denied,"" Davis told the official NBA Web site. ""It was all will and determination. This is where you grab the moment. All you can do is play in the moment."" Lakers coach Phil Jackson believes that his team were outplayed by the New Englanders, especially in the closing stages of the game. ""They really stepped on it in the fourth quarter,"" said Phil Jackson. ""We seemed to not be able to stop the momentum of their game. And Jackson has hinted at a change of tactics in the next game in order to make the most of guard Kobe Bryant, who scored 33 points but was not effective in the fourth quarter. ""He was tired,"" Jackson said. ""Physically he had to work too hard in the course of the game, and he couldn't finish it out like he wanted to. We'll have to do something different the next game to get him off the floor and keep him ready for that fourth quarter."" The Lakers are now hoping they can bounce back in game five, hopefully with the help of a fully fit Bynum, and not allow the Celtics to take a series lead. ""I think we have enough in our arsenal to produce,"" said Gasol. ""We know what to do, we know how to get it done. Game five will take place in Boston on Sunday, before the series moves back to L.A. for the sixth, and if required, seventh game.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two state supreme court justices from neighboring states find themselves in disagreement these days -- not over a legal issue, but over how they should have gotten their jobs. The two justices, Ohio Chief Justice Thomas Moyer and Pennsylvania Justice Seamus McCaffery, were both elected in statewide votes. Moyer said having to raise funds can erode public confidence in the courts. ""Going out asking for money creates a real strain in my judicial work, and I can't promise or predict to voters how I would decide a particular issue,"" Moyer said. ""It conflicts with the idea that judges are and should be impartial and not be influenced by anything, especially money."" But as Pennsylvania's newest elected high court member, McCaffery said it was a treat visiting all of his state's 67 counties on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. ""That's the beauty of having electoral process where we need to be responsive to the community,"" said the Philadelphia former cop-turned-judge. ""And I think it's important that judges should be out there. It's just as important as other elected officials."" The experiences of both men are now at the forefront of a growing national debate over selecting judges. Twenty-one states have some sort of contested system for top judges. The other 29 states, along with the District of Columbia and the federal government, appoint their judges, often under a merit-based selection system in which the governor gets the final say. Some, including retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, are pushing for reform, saying election-based systems could raise doubts about a judge's impartiality. ""Studies show that roughly 70 percent of the public believe judges are influenced by campaign contributions, and more than one quarter of judges agree,"" O'Connor said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""This is alarming because the legitimacy of the judiciary rests entirely on its promise to be fair and impartial. A judge's sole constituency should be the law. If the public loses faith in that impartiality, then there is no reason to prefer the judge's interpretation of the law to the opinions of the real politicians representing the electorate."" O'Connor is lending her reputation, her energy and her name to a new project, the O'Connor Judicial Selection Initiative. The initiative assists state-level efforts to name judges by merit-based selection systems, not elections. ""This initiative is a matter of great importance to our country,"" O'Connor said. ""The amount of money poured into judicial campaigns has skyrocketed, intensifying the need to re-examine how we choose judges in America. I believe it is our moral duty and obligation to restore the public's confidence in our judicial system."" The O'Connor Judicial Selection Initiative was created by the Denver, Colorado-based Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System. The group's founder and director, Rebecca Kourlis, said O'Connor has long been a passionate defender of judicial independence. ""Justice O'Connor adds practical experience with a system [in her home state of Arizona] that works, and she adds a perception of balance and moderation [in] that she has never been associated in the minds of the public with extremes on either side of the political ledger,"" said Kourlis, a retired justice from Colorado's Supreme Court. Kourlis said she senses increased momentum for change on the national level, partly because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that arose from a judicial scandal in West Virginia. In the so-called Caperton Caper, the U.S. Supreme Court found that West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Justice Brent Benjamin acted improperly when he refused to remove himself from a 2006 civil appeal. The court ruled that there was a perceived conflict of interest in the 2006 case because Benjamin had previously received financial support from the CEO of the key defendant. ""What the [U.S. Supreme Court] made clear in 'Caperton' was that judges are different, that campaign donations need to be thought of in a different way when those donations are going to fund a judicial campaign,"" Kourlis said. ""It put on the front burner those questions of propriety with respect to campaign donations to judges and how that impacts people's perception of impartiality on the bench."" Nevada has scheduled a ballot initiative that could make it the first state in 15 years to switch from a voter-based selection of judges to a merit-based selection. Ohio, too, has begun rethinking its voter-based system. Moyer, who has been through four elections on the state high court, said he notices voters growing more skeptical of judges. That perception, he said, is fueled in part by negative ads from political and business interests with a stake in elections. ""The only way to eliminate the public distrust is to eliminate money from the process,"" Moyer said. Moyer is heading an effort that would give the governor and an independent review panel the power to select state judges. Voters could then decide a few years later whether to retain those justices. Many states that choose judges by merit also have accountability systems that include independent performance evaluations and retention votes. Supporters call that a transparent, unbiased tool for the public to essentially ""judge the judge"" on their record. McCaffery knows his personality and personal story helped get him elected. An Irish immigrant, he used his law enforcement background to get a spot as a Philadelphia trial judge, famously dealing with unruly football fans at the small ""Eagles Court"" underneath Veterans Stadium. The bald, burly judge with an easy grin was elected in 2007 and says he enjoys his work. ""I'm electable, not appointable,"" he said during the run for his seat. ""If I'm elevated, I am responsible to the citizens -- not the governor, not the folks who talk about merit selection."" McCaffery calls the merit-based system ""elitist."" The 19 states that held state supreme court elections in 2007 spent a combined $34.4 million, shattering previous campaign spending records. In 2008, nearly $20 million was spent on TV advertising for the 15 states that held contested elections for 26 supreme court seats. The political and financial stakes have become enormous, from ideological groups sparring over abortion rights and gay marriage to business groups dueling with trial lawyers over multibillion-dollar punitive damage awards. Reform advocates say judicial independence comes only with public confidence in the system. ""People don't like the notion of cash in the courtroom -- any whiff of any expectation that judges can be bought is just not acceptable in our country,"" Kourlis said. ""People understand how important it is to have an impartial judge. From your own personal perspective, walking into a courthouse, you don't want to be asking whether that adverse party donated to that judge's campaign.""","Former Supreme Court justice wants to reform the way judges are chosen .

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from CNN Contributor Bob Greene's new book, ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" a memoir of his time working at an Ohio newspaper in the 1960s. The localness of what we did down at the paper defined everything. Even as a kid brand-new to the staff and brand-new to the newspaper business, hired to work during summer vacations, I could tell that. Bob Greene recalls a 1967 lesson in manners from Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes. It was a localness not confined to the geographic scope of our news coverage -- it went without saying that the Columbus, Ohio, Citizen-Journal wasn't about to send its reporters to Africa or France (or even to Kentucky or Indiana). The men and women in the city room arrived at work each day knowing that they weren't going to be assigned to anyplace from where they couldn't drive back to the office by deadline. The localness extended beyond that, though, and infused the very feel of the place. One night in the summer of 1967 the phone on the sports desk rang and I picked it up with the customary: ""Sports!"" The person on the other end said: . ""Now, that's no way to answer a telephone, is it?"" ""Who's calling?"" I said. ""To whom am I speaking?"" the caller said. ""This is Bob Greene,"" I said. ""Now, I've seen your name in the paper,"" the caller said. ""It's Bob Greene Jr., isn't it?"" I had been permitted to write a few sports stories that summer; I used the ""Jr."" at the end of the byline. ""Yes,"" I said. I thought I recognized the voice from somewhere. ""Now, I believe I know your mother and father,"" the caller said. ""Are your parents Robert and Phyllis Greene, from Bexley?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""I know they didn't raise you to answer a phone that way,"" the caller said. ""When you answer a business telephone, the proper way to do it is to tell the caller your name first."" ""All right, sir,"" I said. ""I know your parents are fine people, and I'm sure they taught you good manners,"" the caller said. ""You don't want to disappoint them by giving a bad impression of yourself on the telephone, do you?"" ""No, sir,"" I said. ""Good,"" the caller said. ""Now, this is Woody Hayes. I was calling to speak with Tom Pastorius. Is Tom there, please?"" And, my hands shaking, I connected him with Pastorius, one of the paper's sportswriters. I knew it really was the head coach of the Ohio State University football team because of that phrase early in his lecture to me -- ""To whom am I speaking?"" His grammar was always scrupulous -- no ""Who am I speaking to?"" from Woody Hayes. The localness was all around us. Woody had met my mother and father on a few occasions, he remembered them, and he was setting their son straight. He may have been the most nationally famous person in the community, but he was first and foremost a member of that community -- during all his years as head football coach at Ohio State, Woody kept his home telephone number listed in the Columbus phone book: W.W. Hayes, on Cardiff Road. That made for a lot of late-night crank calls from a lot of insulting or drunken people, but he thought that if he was going to represent the community, then he should be as available as any other man or woman in town. Once, years later, I heard a story -- I'm almost certain that it was Citizen-Journal sportswriter Kaye Kessler who told it. It seemed that very early in Jack Nicklaus's golf career, Nicklaus's father, Charlie, a Columbus pharmacist, was following his son on tour, and Woody Hayes offered to travel with Charlie Nicklaus to keep him company and provide moral support. Apparently at one tournament someone in the gallery kept referring to Nicklaus as ""fat Jack"" -- Nicklaus was a little hefty in those younger days. And, the way I remember the story, either Woody Hayes had to physically restrain Charlie Nicklaus from going after the fan, or Charlie Nicklaus had to restrain Woody. (I have a feeling I know which one was which.) It was all part of the localness. Woody Hayes and Charlie Nicklaus were two Columbus residents on the road to cheer for a local golfer; the fact that the local golfer would become the greatest ever to play the game was incidental. And we -- in the eyes of our readers, and in our own eyes, too -- were, proudly, the local paper. That was all, and everything, we aspired to be. Just like the proud local papers in a thousand other American towns. ""I know they didn't raise you to answer a phone that way,"" Woody said. He thought, by saying it, he was doing me a favor. He was. Excerpted by permission from ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" published this week by St. Martin's Press.","Bob Greene's new memoir is titled ""Late Edition: A Love Story""

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says fathers across America are failing their children by shirking their responsibilities. (CNN) -- ""I'll kill all y'all."" Imagine looking at the man whose DNA you carry standing in your home, telling you those chilling words, as he wields a shotgun. The frightening image is a scary thought. But according to former Major League Baseball star Darryl Strawberry, it was an actual scene, one that begins his book, ""Straw: Finding My Way."" I vividly remember the towering home runs hit by the former star, who played for four big league teams, including the New York Mets and Yankees -- and of course, the many times he was in the news for failing drug tests, beating wives, getting cancer twice, going to prison. He was a man fighting enormous demons. Yet as I read the book, there is one consistent theme that runs throughout and that sheds a spotlight on a figure that continues to plague neighborhoods all across the country: the missing-in-action father. Strawberry makes a point repeatedly in ""Straw"" that he does not blame his dad for the trials and tribulations in his life; he says all decisions he made willingly. But he does speak to the issue of having a father who, by Strawberry's account, while technically in the house, was a raging drunk who spent his paycheck doing what he wanted, showing no love and affection towards his children, viciously beating Strawberry and his brother, all while telling them that they would be nothing in life.  Watch Darryl Strawberry talk to Roland Martin about his father Â» . ""I grew up in an inner city, South Central Los Angeles. When you grow up in the inner cities, most young men don't have a father figure around. Most mothers are raising the kids,"" he told me in an interview. He later said, ""I loved playing baseball; I loved playing basketball; excelling and achieving my goals was my own personal goals, but inside, I just never loved myself. I can remember the times when I excelled in baseball and I [would] do extremely well and the cheers and the glitter and everything that came along with it, but you know what, Roland? When I went home at night, here was I again, me myself, [asking] 'Who am I?' "" The cynical in our world undoubtedly will say, ""Who cares about a drugged-out, washed-up ballplayer?"" But the mental damage that Strawberry says wreaked havoc on him as a child cannot be discounted, and it's something that millions of young children, especially boys, are growing up with every day. This isn't a tale of the stereotypical black athlete who grows up with the black father not in the home, leading to the cycle of violence and lack of family unity we see all around the country. Strawberry's dad was there. But, according to the former ballplayer, he was a horrible father. And right now, there are also young white boys in suburban and rural America who have dads in the home, physically, yet they have mentally and emotionally checked out. And the same for Hispanics and Asians. It has gotten to the point that a mother is considered essential in a family, but a father is optional, expendable, and increasingly irrelevant. I remember watching an OnStar commercial. And as the company touted the features, it showed a father driving his child around, and when the kid starts to cry, the dad freaks out and has to quickly call the mom to calm the baby down. I'm watching that and saying, ""Man, it's your child, too! So calm it!"" Then there is the commercial -- I don't even remember what they were pitching -- of two or three kids in the kitchen making a mess after spilling the cereal. The hapless and hopeless dad looks at them and says, ""Where is your mom?"" Every time that commercial comes on I scream at the TV, ""Where is your mom? Where are your parenting skills, you ingrate!"" See, I take seriously the importance of fathers -- men -- in the lives of children. My wife and I don't have children of our own, but we are raising four of my nieces because they were struggling at home. They need to see a husband and a wife caring for them, but also instilling the right values in their lives. I am convinced that our city streets have turned into killing fields because dads have abdicated their responsibility in the raising of their children. Yes, mom is vital. But there is something different about dad speaking, lecturing, cajoling, disciplining, embracing, loving and caring. Our schools are filled with children losing their minds, and teachers unable to control them. When that happens, it's typically mom, grandma or an aunt coming to the school to deal with the problem. Ask a teacher or principal today and they will say they rarely see dads. My mom has gotten ticked at times because I often talk more about my father than her on TV or radio. It's not that I don't love or appreciate her. But I do it because it is rare to hear men, especially black men, speaking affirmatively about their fathers. I know what it means to have a dad raising and caring for you, and not seeing his child in a drive-by style, or just sending a check. Dads must be present and accounted for, playing a vital role in their children's life. That's why I appreciated it when President Obama spoke about the issue of fatherhood on the campaign trail. We all know the story of his father leaving when he was 2 years old. And yes, he was able to be successful. But for every Obama, there are numerous boys who aren't able to hold it together. I've called on pastors nationwide to stop the stream of momma, grandmother, aunts and female cousins coming to the altar for baby dedications with no man in sight. That pastor should say, ""Until I personally meet with the father, I will not dedicate this child."" Somebody has to hold that man accountable for his actions. It's time that men hold their ""boys"" accountable. Actor Hill Harper had a friend who once said that he hadn't seen his child in some time, but he found time to play basketball with Harper. Hill said, ""Unless you call your child now, we can't play ball."" See, Hill had to force him to accept his responsibilities. The failure of manhood in America -- fatherhood -- has reached epidemic proportions. And unless our religious and cultural institutions say enough is enough, we are going to see another generation of children growing up with dad absent and unaccounted for. It's time for men to man up, so children can grow up with an equal amount of love and affection from both parents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Darryl Strawberry's book says his father failed his family .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An investigation was under way aboard a cruise ship in Barcelona's port on Friday after 26-foot waves crashed into a cruise ship and killed two people off northeast Spain, officials said. ""We are extending all cooperation to all relevant authorities. The captain has been cooperating and is aboard the ship,"" said Michael Maratheftis, spokesman for the Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines. Its vessel the Louis Majesty suffered the casualties and damage on Wednesday. Two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed and 14 other people were injured. Maltese government officials arrived in Spain on Thursday to lead the investigation, because the Greece-based vessel flies a Maltese flag, a Spanish government spokeswoman said. ""It's a weather investigation,"" Maratheftis said, adding that the crew's actions after the three ""abnormal"" waves struck the ship were crucial in preventing further casualties or damage. The waves smashed five windows on deck five in public areas -- on the forward part, or bow, of the 14-deck ship. Two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed, Maratheftis said. Were you on the ship? Share your story with iReport . ""It was a shock. It was unexpected,"" Vito Sgobba, the cruise ship's hotel manager, told CNN in a phone interview from Barcelona. The first wave, Sgobba said, pushed down the ship's bow, and the second wave soon after struck the front of deck five. Sgobba was on an upper deck and quickly rushed to the scene with other crew members, who evacuated the injured to the ship's hospital. Several doctors and nurses traveling aboard as passengers also helped, he said. The two deceased apparently died at the scene, and did not make it to the ship's hospital, Sgobba said. The victims were a German man, 69, from North Rhine Westphalia, and an Italian man, 52, who was traveling with his family, their respective governments told CNN. Fourteen others were treated aboard the ship for light injuries, but were hospitalized as a precaution when the ship returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night, Maratheftis said. By Friday, only two of the injured remained hospitalized, and they were to be released over the weekend, Maratheftis said. The ship's owners on Thursday repatriated most of the 1,350 passengers from 27 nations -- including Americans, Dutch, Germans and Italians -- aboard flights from Barcelona. Only 200 passengers remained in Barcelona early Friday, for their convenience, Maratheftis said. Dutch passenger Tom Berg told CNN that he had been in the hardest-hit area of the ship just five minutes before the waves struck. ""All people crying from that side, because there was a lot of water. We felt the wind going through the boat. After a few minutes, the cry ... calling for a doctor and we realize it was more serious than we expected,"" Berg said at the Barcelona airport, while awaiting a flight. Another Dutch passenger, Elly Maat, said she was on deck six, one level above the worst damage. The second wave broke the ship's windows, and some passengers donned life vests, she said. ""A lot of people were very angry and children were crying,"" Maat said at the airport. The 580 crew members remain with the ship, which is under repair. The next scheduled cruise has been canceled, but plans are for the ship to sail from Barcelona to Genoa on March 10, and to resume its normal cruise operations from there on March 12, Maratheftis said. CNN's Al Goodman, Stephanie Halasz, Ben Brumfield and Chad Myers contributed to this report.","Cruise ship was hit by three ""abnormal"" waves, each about 26 feet (8 meters) high .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If climate change were a small house fire, current policy in the European Union and the United Kingdom would ensure that it would destroy not just the house but the entire suburb. Author of ""Carbon Scenarios"" compares global warming to a house fire that the world is currently failing to contain. That's the grim analogy offered by Paul Domjan, author of a new report, ""Carbon Scenarios: Blue sky thinking for a green future"", by the Stockholm Network, a London-based pan-European think tank. The report explores three scenarios on climate change, none of which leads to what's defined by the EU and UK as a 'successful outcome'; a greater than 90 percent chance of temperatures rising by no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""We have failed,"" Domjan says, adding, ""We will not prevent two degrees of warming."" Continuing the house fire analogy he says, ""The less than two degree scenario is a fire you can put out. With less than three degrees it spreads to other rooms but you can still put it out."" He says global policy of the past ten years looks more like the third -- and worst -- scenario explored by the Carbon Scenarios report -- the one dubbed ""Agree and Ignore.""  In that case, ""your house is unrecognizably destroyed. The positive feedback cycle isn't contained. Your house catches fire, your neighbor's catches fire..."" And so on. Domjan blames the failure of the current climate change policy on the constant stream of compromises by world leaders designed to keep the Kyoto agreement intact. ""This dynamic of making lots of small compromises in order to keep the agreement in place has led to a situation where the agreement has lost a lot of its teeth."" He points to Canada as an example, a signatory to the Kyoto agreement which has ""done nothing"" to implement it. ""During the time it's been a signatory it's been developing massive coal sands projects which are the most polluting way of producing gas and oil in the world,"" he says. ""There's a great international censure against the U.S. for not ratifying Kyoto but nothing has been said about Canada."" ""The coal sands are using so much natural gas and electricity they could have an entire nuclear facility just for themselves."" The three alternative futures explored in the Carbon Scenarios report include ""Kyoto Plus,"" ""Agree and Ignore"" and ""Step Change."" ""Kyoto Plus"" envisages a gradual transition to a global cap on carbon emissions by 2012. Domjan calls it a ""largely successful scenario"" where there's a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising more than 3.31 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. ""That's not a disaster. It's still a world that's recognizable,"" he says. The second scenario -- ""Agree and Ignore"" -- predicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions will ""stall and backslide"" leading to ""competitive regionalism."" There would be a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising no more than 4.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. From that point, temperatures would continue to rise into the next century. The third scenario -- ""Step Change"" -- imagines a radical shift in global policy direction. World leaders would introduce a system of global carbon caps, giving them greater than 90 percent chance of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 2.85 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Of the three scenarios, ""Step Change"" is the one Domjan personally prefers but the one he concedes is unlikely to happen. ""Our proposal [for a global upstream cap] is similar to but not identical to the proposal from the Kyoto 2 project,"" he says. ""It's a line of thinking that's been around for a while that will provide a healthy alternative to emissions trading."" Under the scheme, the United Nations would impose an annual cap on the amount of carbon that could be produced from fossil fuels. Natural resource companies would have to apply and pay for permits to produce carbon. Compliance would be determined at key points, for example, coal washing stations. ""The problem is how do you get the political impetus to have a big international change like that and for people to accept that this is genuinely going to be dealt with at an international level,"" Domjan asks. The ""Step Change"" scenario supposes that the impetus comes through a threat to U.S. and Chinese economic security. Under the scenario, climate change threatens Sino-U.S.. trade relations so the two combine to lead and enforce global change. ""Our current approach to climate change is moving at the pace of the slowest country,"" Domjan says, adding, ""Here they say we're going to move as quickly as possible and then force others to catch up."" Under that scenario, the need to purchase carbon production permits would push record oil prices even higher as energy companies pass on the cost to consumers. Domjan is confident the global economy could cope -- it's adapted to higher energy prices so far and is likely to prove equally resilient in the future. And the extra cost of fuel, rather going to producers, would be held in a fund controlled by the United Nations. It would be used to help developing nations to use fewer fossil fuels, to support new research and development, to compensate oil producers for the carbon they're not producing, and to establish an emergency fund to deal with the consequences of climate change. Domjan acknowledges that world leaders are unlikely to use the report as the basis for a new global policy, but he hopes they at least take away two key points: ""Whenever possible regulate at the point where there are fewest participants [and] we need to make sure there's a clear price signal so the market can distribute energy efficiently.""","Carbon Scenarios report says EU, UK global warming targets ""unrealistic""

"Editor's note: Sarah Hughes won the gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is a graduate of Yale University. Medalist Sarah Hughes says the Games are about excellence and unity. (CNN) -- What are the first thoughts that pop into your mind when you hear the word Olympics? Probably something synonymous with excellence, greatness, excitement, achievement. Maybe it's the striking image of Nadia Comaneci scoring a perfect 10 etched in your mind, or the experience of following Michael Phelps' quest to win a record-breaking eight gold medals last summer in Beijing, China. Or is it the thrill of watching the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal in Lake Placid, stacked up against unimaginable odds, that occupies that space? I could go on and on, but whatever image the Olympics has for you is probably accompanied by a feeling of pride, happiness, joyfulness, maybe even a childlike glee. Sometimes it's the simple way you can sum up your response to the question -- and perhaps that's the point of asking the question -- but it would be foolish to ignore other aspects of the Games that contribute to making the event happen. Although the presence of public officials at host-city bids shows the International Olympic Committee that they are behind the bid and will be supportive, such appearances are not required. On Friday, President Obama, a Chicago, Illinois, resident for many years, will arrive in Copenhagen, Denmark (his wife is already there), to support and try to persuade the IOC voters in favor of the 2016 Chicago bid. Obama's visit to Copenhagen will make him the first U.S. president to attend an Olympic host-city vote. His visit will not be the first by a president (or prime minister) whose country went on to win a bid for the Games. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife were in Singapore lobbying IOC members for the 2012 Summer Games host-city vote when London was awarded the event. Two years later, Russian President Vladimir Putin went to the host-city vote in Guatemala when Sochi, a relatively unknown city, won the right to host the 2014 Winter Games. The other 2016 contenders vying for votes from the 100-plus eligible members of the IOC are Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Tokyo, Japan. Michelle Obama, a lifelong Chicagoan enthusiastically championing the U.S. bid, is displaying her ""Olympic spirit."" On Monday, the eve of her visit to Copenhagen, she spoke of being ready to woo each voter individually if need be: ""Gloves are off. I'm talking to everybody. That's what my schedule looks like."" Sounding like an Olympic competitor already herself, she added that she didn't ""think there's one person left off."" It is easy to come to the conclusion that I might be biased, having won a gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, but I was an American and a fan long before those Games, and I will be one long after. The memories, unity and patriotism from the Salt Lake Games wasn't about any one particular thing but about all those little ""things"" coming together: the result of what the participants -- the fans, volunteers, competitors, coaches, moms, dads, sisters, brothers, cities and nations -- created by sharing the best we have to offer with one another. That's what the Olympics are about. They are about greatness, they are about excellence, but above all, the Games are about unity. In a September 10 letter to IOC members, Obama wrote about how he ""sees the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games as an extraordinary opportunity for America to renew our bonds of friendship and welcome the world to our shores with open arms."" And on Friday, when Obama arrives in Copenhagen, he will be joined by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and King Juan Carlos of Spain. Let the Games begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Hughes.","Sarah Hughes: Obama is among other world leaders who have sought Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Two-time English FA Cup holders Chelsea needed a late goal from substitute Salomon Kalou to stay in the competition Saturday as the Ivorian's 75th-minute goal rescued a 1-1 draw at Everton in their fourth round clash. France striker Louis Saha gave Everton the lead in the second half of the contest -- which was a repeat of the 2009 final -- with a close-range header from Leighton Baines' corner. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti reacted by replacing winger Florent Malouda with Kalou after 70 minutes and his decision paid dividends. The 25-year-old Kalou finished off a swift counter-attack when he drilled a low shot past Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard from just inside the penalty area to earn a replay for the visitors. ""We had a good attitude and spirit and were able to score and take a draw,"" former AC Milan boss Ancelotti told the club's official website. ""It was not an easy game because Everton put strong pressure all the time on the pitch, used a lot of long balls, they were very dangerous on set-pieces and scored on one. It was a difficult game."" Premier League leaders Manchester United survived a scare at third division Southampton before they scored a 2-1 win. Alex Ferguson's team fell behind to Richard Chaplow's firmly hit strike moments before half time as the Saints took a well-deserved lead. But United responded after the break when Michael Owen headed Gabriel Obertan's drilled cross into the net to restore parity. The comeback was complete with 76 minutes gone after Javier Hernandez latched on to substitute Ryan Giggs' through ball and calmly converted the chance with a side-footed finish. It was the Mexican's ninth goal of the season and it ensured the Red Devils reached the last 16 of this competition for the eighth time in nine years. Veteran French midfielder Robert Pires scored his first goal for Aston Villa as Gerard Houllier's side earned a 3-1 victory over Blackburn Rovers to reach the fifth round. Pires, 37, found the net with a neat half-volley to restore Villa's lead after Croatia striker Nikola Kalinic had canceled out Ciaran Clark's opener. England under-21 striker Nathan Delfouneso wrapped up the game for the home team with a header just before half time. Non-league outfit Crawley Town caused one of the day's biggest shocks as they earned a 1-0 success away to fourth division Torquay United. Matthew Tubbs' goal after 39 minutes was enough to secure a place in the last 16 for the final non-league club left in the competition. In an all-Premier League tie, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic will have to play again after the two north-west rivals could only manage a 0-0 draw.","NEW:  Manchester United come from behind to beat Southampton 2-1 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- While automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn, one automaker announced Thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the United States, potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen. Tesla unveils its Model S sedan, with a base price of $57,400. The manufacturing plant will be in California. Tesla Motors, maker of a high-end electric sports car, says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California. Thursday's announcement was made in Hawthorne, California, where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $49,900, after a federal tax credit of $7,500. That's less than half the price of its first model, the Roadster. Started in 2003 and bankrolled by PayPal millionaire Elon Musk, Tesla has attracted investments from the Silicon Valley elite, among them Google founder Larry Page. It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne. That aerospace company, more commonly known as SpaceX, was founded by Musk in 2002. SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year. That contract, worth $1.6 billion, was won over such industry mainstays as Boeing and Lockheed. The promise of a high-performance, all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup's first model, the Tesla Roadster, a car with the look, speed and price tag -- a steep $109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end, high-performance vehicles. Recently though, the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011. They've also had to lay off more than 80 workers, which is about 25 percent of the company's staff. Nonetheless, Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year. That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly. The company faces many challenges, the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid.","Tesla says manufacturing plant will be in California; hundreds of jobs possible .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Frank DiPascali, formerly the finance chief at Bernard Madoff's investment advisory business, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering. Frank DiPascali, center in this courtroom sketch, said he knew for about 20 years he was engaged in wrongdoing. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 125 years. With his guilty plea, DiPascali waived his right to a trial. As Tuesday's hearing commenced, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan explained that for him to accept DiPascali's guilty plea, DiPascali would have to sufficiently convince him that he was, in fact, guilty. That set the stage for a dramatic statement from DiPascali about his history at Madoff's firm, his personal relationship with Madoff, and the mechanics of a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme for which Madoff was convicted in June. While DiPascali's guilty plea and the judge's acceptance of it were expected, both the defense and the prosecution were surprised by the judge's decision to reject DiPascali's bail agreement -- and to have him escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs. The defense and even the prosecution pleaded with the judge not to order DiPascali into custody. Prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding DiPascali would impede the ""efficiency"" of their Madoff investigation. Marc Mukasey, the lead defense attorney, stood multiple times to dispute the decision, variously suggesting to the judge that DiPascali instead be put under house detention, that he wear an electronic monitoring device, and that the decision on his bail agreement be postponed for 48 to 72 hours. He added that DiPascali's family was ""completely unprepared"" for this outcome. While Sullivan patiently heard out Mukasey's many counterproposals, he refused to back down from his decision, asserting that DiPascali was too serious a flight risk given the ""astronomical"" maximum sentence he may receive. The judge also said that he could not ""overlook the conduct [DiPascali] admitted to"" despite DiPascali's avowed determination to do the right thing henceforth. Though DiPascali remained outwardly calm for much of Tuesday's proceedings, the judge's decision not to grant him bail appeared to stun him. He seemed in a daze as it became clear he would leave the courtroom in handcuffs, cupping his head in his hands and rubbing his temples. Earlier in his testimony, DiPascali recounted how he joined Madoff's company as a newly minted high-school grad in 1975. He held numerous jobs during his 33-year tenure -- options trader and research analyst among them -- but above all he was a ""guy who did whatever he was told to do around the office."" Working side by side with Madoff for decades, DiPascali developed a tight bond with his employer. ""Bernie was a mentor to me and more,"" he said, adding that he was ""loyal to a terrible, terrible fault."" His sense of loyalty led him to falsify documents for his boss for years on end, he said. Using a financial program, he looked up historical prices of stocks and then drafted customer statements showing bogus stock transactions. He calculated theoretical commissions that the business should have received from the trades that it did not actually make, and then wired money from account to account to make those commissions appear, he said. And as a principal point of contact for investors in Madoff's investment advisory business, DiPascali said, he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed, knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious. He said he had been aware that what he was doing was wrong since the ""late '80s, early '90s."" ""I don't know how I went from an 18-year-old kid who happened to have a job [to] standing in front of you today,"" he said. DiPascali repeatedly stated that he perpetrated the massive fraud in collusion ""with others,"" though he specified neither who those other were nor how many they numbered. DiPascali said he rationalized to himself that Madoff's victims would have a soft landing if the Ponzi scheme ever came crumbling down. He said he thought Madoff had assets he could liquefy in a worst-case scenario. ""I know my apology means nothing,"" DiPascali said. His voice quavered as he expressed remorse for his part in swindling charities that had invested with Madoff. Miriam Siegman, a Madoff victim who said she lost 40 years' worth of personal savings in the scheme and was now on the brink of homelessness, asked the judge to reject DiPascali's guilty plea. She insisted that the ""full truth"" would come out only if DiPascali stood trial. Both legal teams said they expected sentencing to happen in May. Each side will have the opportunity to submit documents and testimonies in support of or against DiPascali before Sullivan hands down the sentence. DiPascali is the second person involved in the Madoff scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud. In June, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for masterminding the scheme. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors.","NEW: Judge denies bail for Frank DiPascali, despite deal he had with prosecutors .

"(CNN) -- He's thrown himself off more buildings than he can remember and broken more bones than an actor has any right to and still be alive and working today, but at 54 years old, Jackie Chan's days of taking spectacular tumbles may be coming to an end. Jackie Chan: From chop socky superstar to Olympics ambassador. ""You gotta change,"" he told Anjali Rao for Talk Asia. ""I want to be an actor, not an action star; I want to be an actor who can fight."" The body, battered as it has been by thousands of stunts, may still be willing, but a will to be taken more seriously as an actor means that at the very least, his next project is a self-directed drama rather than an action flick. Despite his best efforts, it's probably too late for Jackie Chan to be seen by most film-goers as anything other than a comedic action star. The fact that he can now direct his own productions, however, indicates just how far he's come in a career in film that has spanned four decades. The movie hero has been at the heart of Hong Kong's chop socky film industry for over 30 years, fostering a knock-about on-screen image that has seen him appear in almost 100 films and pioneer the comic kung-fu genre. As a boy he studied theatre and acrobatics at the China Drama Academy in Hong Kong. He describes the hardship of life under his master at the academy - where learning was based on strict physical discipline - as more like the army than a school. After nearly a decade spent learning the physical hardships that a career in the Hong Kong film industry had in-store, his first foray into film was as a stuntman on Bruce Lee films. It was only when he developed his humorous on-screen persona in ""Drunken Master"" in 1978 that he found greater success as a leading actor, and one more than capable or doing his own stunts. After several attempts to translate his success in Hong Kong cinema to wider audiences in the U.S. and Europe, it was only after he made 'Rumble in the Bronx"" that Hollywood took notice. His big-budget Hollywood films include the ""Rush Hour"" series and ""Shanghai Noon,"" where he starred alongside Owen Wilson. His next cinematic venture to hit the screens is alongside Jet Li in ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" before he takes a lead role as an ambassador for the Beijing Olympics leading up to this year's Games and as one of the torch bearers when the Olympic Torch arrives in Hong Kong in May. As well as being as firm supporter of the Olympic Games in China, he has combined his dubious penchant for singing ballads (he has released over 20 albums) with this role, releasing an official song to mark the impending event last summer. There is also a more serious side to Chan away from the screen. As well as funding a number of charitable projects he has also become a UNICEF Good Will Ambassador, leading Forbes magazine to him as one of the 'Top 10 Generous Celebs.'

"(CNN) -- Fidel Castro will continue to have a hand in shaping Cuba's future, but his brother and successor will remain in firm control of the government, Castro's daughter said Monday. Alina Fernandez, daughter of Fidel Castro, has long opposed her father's regime. ""He is still behind the scenes, but RaÃºl is making the decisions,"" Alina Fernandez told CNN. ""No doubt about it."" Fidel Castro's nearly five decades of rule ended Sunday when Cuba's National Assembly chose his younger brother to be the Communist nation's new president. RaÃºl Castro, 76, assumed temporary control of Cuba more than a year ago after his brother suffered health problems. The lawmakers' selection, which had been widely expected, came five days after Fidel Castro, 81, announced his resignation in a letter published in Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma. In his address to the National Assembly, RaÃºl Castro proposed that ""we consult Fidel"" on important decisions, which the 614 members of the legislative body unanimously passed.

RaÃºl Castro was leader of the Cuban army for almost 50 years. As Cuba's acting president, he has kept a low profile. About six months ago, he began what he called a national debate on the problems of the country, acknowledging high unemployment and other economic concerns.

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel ""The Eleventh Victim.""  published by Hyperion. Nancy anchors ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET. HLN's Nancy Grace makes her fiction debut with ""The Eleventh Victim."" A little something. What was it? Something...some detail was wrong.  . He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that. There was something missing. It was biting at him. He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect. He looked at her lying there in the moonlight. Her dead body was absolutely stunning. Before, when she had been alive, sitting in the passenger seat of his car, talking and talking about her life and herself and her journey from Anniston, Alabama, to Atlanta to break into acting, he thought his head would blow up like a bomb. She just wouldn't shut up. What did she think it was...a date? She was a hooker. He spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the MARTA subway station downtown. She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride. Once inside, driving, he kept looking away from the road, stealing glances at her neck. Something about it drew him. Maybe the shape, the curve -- or maybe it was the soft hollow spot at the bottom. It was the only thing about her he could stomach. Watch Nancy talk about her new novel Â» . He lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he wouldn't have to hear it. Her teeth and lips revolted him. The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth. Looking over at her as she talked, Cruise thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Back to the task at hand. What was it? It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact. Every detail mattered. Like a delicate soufflÃ© or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail. There, in the dark of the clearing, it hit him. Turning, he walked to his car and reached through the open window into the glove compartment and got it. The baker's twine. It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France. He had posed her on her back. The four bright-red puncture marks torn into her mid-back didn't bother him at all. In fact, the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him. Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again. He needed the perfect spot. He couldn't rush this or he wouldn't sleep all night. The wrist? Like a bracelet? No. She was wearing a tacky, gold-tone watch. That would ruin the whole thing for him. And he couldn't bring himself to actually touch the timepiece she wore there on her right wrist. It looked cheap; he was sure the gold-tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band. The neck? No. It was much too close to the lip gloss. The gloss had a faint, fruity odor, foul as gasoline fumes to Cruise, and that alone made him want to retch. It would totally destroy the twine's effect. Sometime during their ""date,"" fresh, damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose. He left it there. That was a beautiful and poetic touch of nature, but the lip gloss...disgusting. As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night. And as he relived that moment, it came to him in an epiphany. He decided...the left ring finger. Perfect. He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand. The wrist was still limp. He tied a single, perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in...before the body went stiff and cold and hard. He placed the hand back gently across her stomach. Backing away a few feet to take in the whole picture, finally, he could relax. Every detail was exquisite. Finally, he could get some sleep. The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous. Almost like a wedding band. From THE ELEVENTH VICTIM by Nancy Grace. Copyright Â© 2009 Toto Holdings, LLC.

"London, England (CNN) -- Oxford Circus is one of the busiest junctions in the heart of London. Until recently, it was also the most congested. Every hour, almost 40,000 people were herded around the crossroads in slow, cramped, and sometimes dangerous conditions. It is also the busiest pedestrian crossing in Europe, according to Westminster City Council. Getting from one side of the road to the other, a distance of a few meters, could take an unreasonably long time and many Londoners thought there was little that could ever be done about it. That is until Westminster City Council, inspired by Tokyo's famous Shibuya crossing, decided that a similar crossing could solve their Oxford Circus congestion, and make the lives of tens of thousands of pedestrians just a little more pleasant. The redesigned crossing has increased the amount of pavement space by 312 square meters, up 69 percent from its previous capacity. Martin Low, director of transportation for Westminster City Council told CNN: ""It has really been a phenomenal change from pedestrian hell to pedestrian heaven and what it has done is actually make retailers worldwide want to think about coming to the West End. ""We created more space, increased the amount of pedestrian space by about 70 percent, we have removed all of the pedestrian guard railing, we have created a much better environment for pedestrians."" Jacqui Ames, a secretary on a day trip to London from Bexhill, East Sussex, agrees: ""It is much better, there isn't so much congestion and I got across the road without getting pushed and shoved."" Steven, a security guard in one of the retail stores on Oxford Circus said: ""It works really well, I use it every day and it is it quicker and safer than it was before. There's a junction down the road that I think is really dangerous and should be changed as well."" Westminster City Council believes the $7.6 million investment is worth it, saying the diagonal crossing not only reduces pedestrian travel time but also safety and that it has transformed what was once a haven for pickpockets into a much safer environment because pedestrians now have more personal space. The crossing was jointly funded by The Crown Estate, which owns Regent Street, and Transport for London. Could it work in other congested cities? ""I can see it working in an awful lot of other places, yes. I think across the world people are now starting to think more about the pedestrians. And let us face it, all of us, for some part of our journey, are a pedestrian,"" says Low.","Almost 40,000 people use Oxford Circus crossing every hour says Westminster City Council .

"(CNN) -- An internationally renowned paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones from federal land, his attorneys said in a court filing. Paleontologist Nate Murphy is expected to plead guilty to stealing fossils from federal land. Nate Murphy, whose famous finds include Leonardo, one of the best-preserved dinosaurs in the world, will make that plea in federal court in Billings, Montana. Earlier this month, Murphy pleaded guilty to state charges of stealing a fossil from private land in order to sell it. An expert cited in that case said Murphy's find was worth between $150,000 and $400,000. The self-taught dinosaur expert, who is director of vertebrate paleontology at the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, could face jail time. Murphy and his attorney did not immediately respond to phone messages Friday from CNN. Jessica Fehr, lead prosecutor in the case, said the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment until after the plea is entered. In court papers, federal prosecutors say Murphy knowingly took fossils from federal property between about August 2006 and August 2007. The ""paleontological resources"" were said to be worth at least $1,000. In the state case, Murphy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of theft. As part of the plea, the state recommended Murphy's sentence be deferred for five years. Douglas Erwin, president of The Paleontological Society and curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said ""theft of fossils from pubic lands has long been a problem."" In a written statement sent to CNN on Friday, he said such thefts ""can often result in the loss of important scientific information and the disappearance of specimens that belong to the public. ""At the same time, however, fossil collecting, particularly of common invertebrate fossils, has been a pastime enjoyed by many for decades, and is an important way of connecting people with their natural heritage."" An omnibus public lands bill, which the U.S. Senate passed Thursday, includes penalties for fossil theft from public land.","Attorney says well-known paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones .

"(Budget Travel) -- I've never been a fan of the cold. As a kid, my favorite part of skiing was the hot chocolate, and I relished blizzards for the snow days, not the snowball fights. So when I booked a trip to the Icehotel in northern Sweden, my family and friends were amused -- and a bit concerned, especially when I got sick days before my flight. ""You can't go to the Arctic with a cold!"" my mother admonished. The hotel in northern Sweden opens every year in early December and closes at the end of April. But I had good reason for wanting to sleep in a glorified freezer: As an environmental reporter, I was curious to see a place where people have turned snow and ice into a moneymaker, one that's spawned copycats in frigid spots from Canada to Romania. Conceived by Yngve Bergqvist, a river-rafting guide who wanted to lure visitors to the Arctic north during the winter, the Icehotel started out in 1990 as nothing more than a crude igloo. Now, it's a fanciful ice castle that's rebuilt every November with an unparalleled level of artistry -- which explains why each winter 16,000 guests pay hundreds of dollars a night to sleep on a slab of ice and thousands more make the trek just to tour the rooms for the day. The 30 most elaborate suites are the handiwork of a team of artists -- sculptors, painters, architects, even comic book illustrators -- many of whom have never worked with ice before. Wielding chain saws and chisels, they spend weeks crafting frozen furniture while electricians install lights to provide an ethereal glow. Surreal? Exceedingly. This winter, German furniture maker Jens Paulus and American industrial designer Joshua Space created a space-station room straight out of ""Star Trek,"" with giant carvings of the sun and moon on opposing walls and twinkling lights in the ceiling. British decorator Ben Rousseau and graffiti artist Insa devised the Getting Cold Feet suite, with oversize high-heeled ice shoes beside the bed. Twenty-nine unadorned snow caves offer a somewhat less pricey and more purist experience. Since no hotel would be complete without a bar, the artists also sculpt a chic space where guests can warm their innards with an Icebar JukkasjÃ¤rvi, a mix of vodka, blueberry liqueur, blue curaÃ§ao syrup and elderflower juice, sipped from a cube-shaped ice glass. Then there's the chapel, where designs etched into the ice walls resemble stained glass. About 150 couples tie the knot here each year, some brides bundled in snowsuits, others dressed in white wedding gowns, their teeth chattering as they recite their vows. When I arrive in Sweden, I'm surprised to find that the guests actually spend a lot of time in a pair of heated chalets that look like life-size gingerbread houses. The shower and bathroom are located in the one nearest the hotel -- because, really, who wants to sit on a frozen throne? And the other contains the restaurant, where chef Richard NÃ¤slin dreams up such intriguing dishes as arctic char ice cream, which has a slightly salty, smoky flavor and is much more delicious than it sounds. Budget Travel Dream Trip: Scale a volcano in Ecuador . After my dinner, wrapped in several layers of fleece and down, I waddle out to a tepee for a folk concert by native Laplander Yana Mangi. At the end of each song, the crowd responds with a uniquely Arctic ovation: muffled mitten clapping. My suite has a nautical theme, with walls curved into a frozen wave and an oval bed of bluish ice set beneath a clam-shaped headboard. Topped with a mattress and a reindeer skin, the setup looks snug. Almost. The temperature is a brisk 23 degrees Fahrenheit, and I'm still petrified I'll lose a finger to hypothermia, even in my head-to-toe winter wardrobe. I climb under the furry blanket, making sure not an inch of skin is exposed. Then I gaze through the slits in my microfleece face mask and marvel at the stillness. My breath comes in shallow white puffs. Soon, I'm fast asleep. The next thing I know, a hotel attendant is standing beside me with a cup of steaming lingonberry juice -- my wake-up call. Amazingly, I slept through the night, giving new meaning to the expression ""out cold."" I wiggle my fingers and toes -- they're tingly, but all there. Then I do what any sane person would: sprint to the chalet to thaw out in the shower and sauna. Most guests stay only one night, but I opt for a second. It's not to prove my mettle; I feel as if I've done that. Rather, I find my frosty alcove incredibly restful and therapeutic. Maybe the hotel should add an ice yoga studio next? IF YOU GO ... GETTING THERE A round-trip flight between New York and Stockholm on SAS costs about $700 in midwinter (flysas.com). From Stockholm, take a 16-hour train ride to Kiruna (from $44 round trip). The Icehotel is a $13 bus ride away. WHEN TO GO The hotel opens every year in early December and closes at the end of April. You have a chance of spotting the northern lights in December and January, but those are the coldest months -- temperatures can dip to 45 below. WHAT TO PACK Think wool and fleece layers; avoid cotton, which can trap moisture and make you colder. The hotel supplies boots and hats. For details, see icehotel.com/winter/adventure/dress. WHERE TO SPLURGE Don't miss the guided hotel tour ($37 per person). And how about an ice-sculpting lesson ($75 per person)? Or a six-hour snowmobile safari to see moose at their winter feeding grounds ($400 per person)? WHERE TO SAVE Tour the Icehotel by day, and then spend the night at Hotel Kebne in Kiruna (011-46/980-68-180, hotellkebne.com, from $100).

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- I'm traveling with a chunk of gold -- the World Cup Trophy -- from Zurich, Switzerland to Cairo, Egypt. CNN's Ben Wedeman checks the World Cup is not getting a better seat than him. When CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Kim Norgaard suggested I fly from Zurich to Cairo to cover the arrival of the World Cup trophy in Africa in the lead-up to the games in South Africa next summer, I thought he was joking. Kim, an unabashed football (soccer) fanatic, knows I'm, well, skeptical about a group of grown men paid hefty salaries to kick a little ball around a big field. But variety is the spice of journalism, you might say, and Kim is a friend with whom I needed to settle an old debt from Turkey, so I agreed to give it a try. Football isn't a subject I know much about, so I realized I would have to cram. As it turned out I didn't have much time to prepare because someone broke into our house in Cairo the day before I was scheduled to depart. Rather than study World Cup football, I had to deal with the police, change locks, etc. Whoever it was didn't steal much, but here's an odd aside: the thief left behind his (or hers?) battered black running shoes, making off with my 15-year old son Christopher's brand-new trainers. Preparing, perhaps, for a career in football?  Watch CNN's journey with the World Cup. Â» . Flying from Cairo to Zurich, where FIFA or the International Federation of Football Associations is headquartered, I finally found time to learn a few things about the object that would be my travel companion from Switzerland back to Egypt. The trophy is made of more than five kilograms of 18 carat gold, with two bands of malachite running around the bottom. Probably for good reason mere mortals such as myself and Beirut cameraman Christian Streib, who is with me on this trip, aren't allowed to touch the trophy. According to FIFA regulations, only heads of state and members of teams that won the World Cup have that privilege. The trophy's guard can handle it, but must wear special white gloves. The trophy is worth a fortune -- for its symbolic value as well as its gold -- and is protected around the clock. But the trophy on tour in Africa is not the first -- it's a replacement created after Brazil were allowed to keep the original when they won the tournament for a third time. And it's that one currently in circulation, and presumably in the back of the plane we're flying to Cairo in, packed away in a simple aluminum case. While on tour the trophy is under constant guard, though as we passed through security at Zurich Airport to board the charter flight to Cairo I saw it go through the x-ray machine -- a big black mass of metal on the screen. The airport security personnel asked the guard to open the box, and that was the closest Christian or I came to it. We resisted the urge to get our grubby hands all over it, however. The chances are slim that either of us will ever be on a winning World Cup team, and slimmer still that either of us will become head of state. I'd share more information about how the trophy is transported, but the tour organizers are worried that too much detail might endanger the cup and those guarding it, especially in some African countries where crime is rife. According to the plan, after Cairo the trophy will be flown to almost every African capital before ending up in South Africa. The Coca Cola Company is covering the cost of the trip. There is one African capital it probably won't be going to, however, and that's Mogadishu, in Somalia. The city has been a battlefield on and off for the last 20 years, the airport often bombarded by mortars and artillery. FIFA and Coca Cola have yet to officially turn down the request by the interim Somali government to bring the trophy to Mogadishu. If peace suddenly breaks out, they might actually do it. Here is a personal World Cup footnote. Thanks to Italy's defeat in the 1990 semifinals of the World Cup in Italy, the birth of my daughter Amira was uneventful. My wife Yasmine and I were in Rome that summer when Italy and Argentina had a semifinal match. Yasmine, a native of Rome, was nine-months pregnant and then some, and went into labor shortly after the game ended, thankfully, with Italy's defeat. If Italy had won there would have been celebratory chaos in the streets until sunrise, and my wife would have ended up delivering in the back seat of the car. As it was, the streets were empty. Italy was in mourning. And I was relieved.","World Cup trophy starts publicity trip ahead of 2010 tournament .

"(CNN) -- A large oil drilling platform is on its way to the Chilean mine where 33 trapped miners are awaiting rescue and is expected to arrive later Thursday or Friday, an engineer overseeing the drilling said. According to Andre Sougarret, the 42-truck convoy carrying the drill was in the area of Antofagasta, Chile, approximately 500 kilometers (311 miles) north of the San Jose mine. Other pieces of equipment will arrive from Puntarenas, Chile, and Bolivia, he said. The oil platform will be part of Plan C, the third operation to drill to reach the miners. Chilean mining officials have said they believe that drill will dig faster than the other drills currently at work. But they cautioned that the miners, trapped since August 5, still may not be rescued until December. Progress on the other two rescue operations was mixed, Sougarret said. The drill being used in Plan A -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters (187 yards) Thursday, 40 more meters (about 44 yards) since an update given by officials Wednesday. The Plan B drill, usually used to drill water bore holes, hit a snag at 268 meters (293 yards), Sougarret said, when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine's operations. The men have been trapped for 35 days now, 2,300 feet under the earth. When rescuers first found them, the miners told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter. Officials were weighing how to best proceed after the problem with the Plan B drill but said the drill bit would have to be retrieved and replaced. ""It was totally destroyed,"" Sougarret explained. The Plan B device, which had been drilling for less time than Plan A's drill and had already surpassed its distance, also had a problem Wednesday with a cable malfunction. The drill is widening a hole already drilled into the mine. Sougarret said that once it begins drilling again, it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days. Then a larger drill could be used until the hole is wide enough so that the miners can be hoisted out, one at a time, in a small cage. At Camp Hope, the tent camp set up by miners' families holding vigil, residents eagerly scanned the rocky horizon for any sign of the caravan bearing the Plan C drill. ""I wish it were here already,"" said Milton Alvalos, whose nephew is one of those trapped. As residents waited for the arrival of the newest weapon in the arsenal being used to rescue the miners, workers walked the route the convoy will take to make sure the heavy trucks will clear the winding road into camp. ""Just the logistics part is the tough part, getting the people and equipment to where you need it. We've got to figure out the route [and the] power lines,"" said Shaun Robstad, who was coordinating the equipment's arrival for Precision Drilling, a Canadian oil drilling company. ""We do this all the over the world,"" Robstad said, but always for oil, never before for trapped humans. ""This is a first.""","It's expected to arrive Thursday or Friday, an engineer overseeing the drilling said .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush's budget chief blamed the faltering economy and the bipartisan stimulus package for the record $482 billion deficit the White House predicted for the 2009 budget year. The White House blames a faltering economy and the stimulus package for the increased budget deficit. Jim Nussle, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the deficit would be about 3.3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the measure of the nation's total economy. The fiscal year begins October 1, 2008. The federal deficit is the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in from taxes and other revenue sources. The government must borrow money to make up the difference. While the deficit would be a record in absolute dollar terms, Nussle said it would be below the 2004 deficit, 3.6 percent of GDP, and the record deficit of 1983, 6 percent of GDP, when compared with the size of the overall U.S. economy. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the stimulus package was necessary, even if it increased the deficit. ""We do think the plan was the right one, and it will have an effect,"" she said. ""And the best way to help reduce the deficit is to make sure you are keeping a lock on spending, but also that you can also try to help to build the economy. So we hope this will help us pull out of the economic downturn over the next few months because of the stimulus package. ""I remember that back when we were discussing the stimulus package, both parties recognized that the deficit would increase, and that would be the price that we pay in order to help improve the economy,"" she said. Nussle said the $170 billion, bipartisan stimulus, which congressional Democrats and Bush agreed to earlier this year, was a major reason the deficit was expected to reach record levels next year. The deficit projection for 2009 would have been only 2.2 percent of the economy, or $272 billion, if the stimulus package is excluded, Nussle said.  Watch Nussle warn Congress not to increase spending Â» . ""The determination was made that getting the economy back on track was a higher priority than immediate deficit reduction,"" Nussle said. He said the OMB projects that the deficit would fall after the 2009 budget year, and he predicted that the government would have a surplus in budget year 2012, if the president's budget blueprint is followed. ""Near-term deficits are temporary and manageable if -- and only if -- we keep spending in check, the tax burden low and the economy growing,"" Nussle said, warning that congressional Democrats were planning to add billions of dollars in spending to the federal budget. President Bush inherited a budget surplus of $128 billion when he took office in 2001 but has since posted a budget deficit every year.  View a history of the government deficits and surpluses Â» . The Bush administration has spent heavily on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and faces a large budget shortfall in tax revenue in part because of Bush's tax cuts and a souring economy. A Democratic point man on the budget, Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, blasted the administration for its ""reckless fiscal policies,"" blaming the president's tax cuts for driving the government into deficit and saying Bush ""will be remembered as the most fiscally irresponsible president in our nation's history.""  Watch Conrad call the federal debt Bush's legacy Â» . Conrad, who chairs the Senate's budget committee, accused the president of ""squandering"" the surplus he inherited from President Bill Clinton and said the increased debt the government has taken on to cover the deficit has undermined the value of the dollar and hurt the overall economy. ""If they gave out Olympic medals for fiscal irresponsibility, President Bush would take the gold, silver and bronze,"" Conrad said. ""With his eight years in office, he will have had the five highest deficits ever recorded. And the highest of those deficits is now projected to come in 2009, as he leaves office."" But a senior administration official says the budgetary problems stem from what he called inadequate defense, intelligence and homeland security resources that were handed down from Clinton. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in March projected the deficit for the 2008 fiscal year, which ends September 30, would be $357 billion. It predicted the 2009 deficit to be $342 billion, if the president's proposals were adopted. Both assumptions, however, were made before the economic stimulus package was passed by Congress and signed by the president this spring. The CBO said it would release revised deficit estimates in September. The two major presidential candidates -- Democrat Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain -- used news that the United States' budget deficit will hit a record high as an opportunity to criticize each other's fiscal plans. CNN's Brianna Keiler and Scott Anderson contributed to this report.","NEW: Deficit in budget year 2009 expected to grow to $482 billion, budget chief says .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people converge on the small town of Marlinton, West Virginia, each fall for a feast whose main ingredients were unlucky enough to crawl, slither or lurk too close to a speeding car. Unusual food festivals include BugFest in Raleigh, North Carolina, where a young visitor tries a stir-fried scorpion. It's RoadKill Cook-Off time, where past years' crowds have sampled dishes like Pothole Possum Stew, Fricasseed Wabbit Gumbo and Smeared Hog with Groundhog Gravy. Welcome to the world of unusual -- dare we say weird? -- food festivals. Sure, you can find plenty of culinary celebrations dedicated to everything from rhubarb to seafood, but there are also options to satisfy your cravings for rattlesnake, fried pig intestines or garlic ice cream. The RoadKill Cook-Off is so popular that it fills all the motels and hotels in the county when it takes place on the last Saturday in September, said David Cain, who runs the event and samples all the dishes. ""There are some that are better than others, but I've never really had anything that I really didn't like,"" Cain said. ""But there was one year they cooked a rattlesnake in some kind of stew, and ... there was no way I could taste that one.""  See photos from these unusual food festivals Â» . The RoadKill Cook-Off began in 1991, when organizers thought it might boost attendance at the main event: the Pocahontas County Autumn Harvest Festival. Did it ever. About 10,000 people from all over the country came to last year's gathering, Cain said. All dishes featured in the festival must have animals commonly found dead on the side of the road -- such as deer, squirrels and snakes -- as their main ingredient. But the meat doesn't have to be actual roadkill. ""Judges will deduct points for every chipped tooth resulting from gravel not removed from the RoadKill,"" the official rules warn. ""All judges have been tested for cast-iron stomachs and have sworn under oath to have no vegetarian tendencies."" All about Spam . Thousands of miles away, in Honolulu, Hawaii, aficionados of canned luncheon meat gather in April for the annual Waikiki Spam Jam, described by organizers as ""a street festival that celebrates the people of Hawaii's love for Spam."" Some may call it mystery meat, but it's not advisable to do so in Hawaii, which has the highest per-capita consumption rate of Spam products in the United States. Almost 7 million cans worth of the pinkish product are eaten every year in the Aloha State, according to festival officials. The crowds at this year's Spam Jam sampled dishes such as Spam Fried Rice, Spam Burgers and Guava Mango BBQ Spam Sliders. ""I think people are amused by the whole idea because it is pretty different. Like, why would you celebrate Spam?"" said Barbara Campbell, one of the founders of the festival. ""It's just about having fun, and they love the different Spam items."" A restaurant that offered Spam Chili Nachos at the festival was so amazed by their popularity that it's thinking of adding the dish to its permanent menu, Campbell added. Fans who admire the yellow and blue design of Spam cans also have a chance to splurge on Spam-themed merchandise, including T-shirts, baby items and slippers. Celebrating the 'stinking rose' Some unusual food festivals can tickle the nose as well as the palate. Vampires may hate garlic, but the pungent cloves draw huge crowds of hungry mortals each July to the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, ""the garlic capital of the world."" If you're a fan, pack some breath mints and enjoy everything from traditional garlic-infused fare like scampi and stuffed mushrooms, to more exotic choices. Garlic ice cream, anyone? Those who have tried the frozen dessert describe it as an ""acquired taste."" ""I would say when you first taste it, it's like regular vanilla ice cream, and then give it about 10 seconds, and you feel the kick of garlic,"" said Peter Ciccarelli, director of media relations for the festival. ""It's not something that people would eat by a bowlful, nor would they put chocolate syrup on it."" Last year's festival drew more than 100,000 people who consumed more than 15,000 servings of garlic bread and 10,000 servings of garlic fries. Almost 3 tons of the ""stinking rose,"" as garlic is sometimes fondly called, were used to flavor the dishes. A meal with legs . The truly adventurous foodies may opt for BugFest and the leggy dishes served up by CafÃ© Insecta at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh each September. Popular choices include the Ant-Chilada, a cheese enchilada in which toasted freeze-dried ants are used as both the filling and topping, and Hush-Grubbies, in which wax worm grubs are coated with hush-puppy batter and deep fried. For dessert, visitors can try Chocolate-Chirp Cookies, which have crickets baked in. ""We basically use recipes that we would use for any other dish and substitute the protein,"" explained Matthew Busch, head chef at the museum's Acro CafÃ©, who creates the dishes at CafÃ© Insecta during BugFest. So, instead of doing a shrimp stir-fry, the museum might do a scorpion stir-fry. Busch, who said he tries anything he cooks, recommended the Hush-Grubbies, calling the bugs inside ""tasty"" and ""a little buttery."" Stir-fried scorpions, on the other hand, can be a little bitter, he cautioned. Watching the reactions of visitors who dig in to the bug-laden food is Busch's favorite part, and he described seeing an entire range of responses, from people who are gung-ho and want to try everything to those who are squeamish and have to be peer-pressured to take a bite. Some people's strategy is just to eat around the bugs, Busch said.","There are many options for people who seek food festivals with an unusual twist .

"One of the world's greatest fashion designers, Yohji Yamamoto has helped blaze a trail for Asia over the last three decades. Yohji Yamamoto brought masculine styles to the catwalk, rejecting traditional ideas of sexiness. He brought geometric minimalism to the catwalk in the late 1970's while other designers focused on flamboyance, and if his name and clothing has become a brand over the last 30 years, for the man himself, it is always ""creation first"". ""I had no intention of working in the mainstream and I've stated my objection against the main currents of fashion for the last 27 years,"" he told Anjali Rao. His firm standpoint on style, and his designs, has brought popularity with an international chain of clothing outlets and the courting of celebrities and companies -- he designed Elton John's wardrobe for his latest world tour and has collaborated with Adidas to produce the Y-3 street wear range. Talk Asia toured one of his ateliers and showrooms in Tokyo, before moving to Paris for Fashion Week, where Yamamoto opened the doors to a model-casting session for the first time. While successful, his design house is far removed from the mega-brands of some labels such as Dior or Gucci, and he has stuck to his ethos throughout. ""I have no intention to deal with a market first and put my creation into it. I create my clothes at will and that will change the market -- that's what I hope to see. ""Independent fashion houses are in an extreme minority. Most fashion makers have to sell accessories, there are only one or two or three that are successful just selling clothes. This is the era that clothes cannot sell."" Known for his distinctive black, minimalist style, he discussed how he perceives his own impact on fashion and his unique philosophy: ""Civilized humans must wear monochrome. There is a minimum etiquette of fashion that you must not upset other people's vision . It is wrong to think that standing out is a good thing."" ""I prefer to be behind the scenes -- that to me is a fashion designer."" And behind the scenes, Yamamoto practices karate to relax -- at black belt level, or course -- and recreating action through his designs. ""I'm very much interested in cutting, making forms, silhouettes, making motion; that's why I forget the color.""","Yohji Yamamoto is known for his distinctive black, minimalist style .

"Houston (CNN) -- In the days and weeks to come, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' recovery from a gunshot wound to the head will be a marathon, not a sprint, doctors say. Nearly three weeks after her brain injury, there are several acute medical issues to be concerned about, according to doctors not involved with her care. It could take months -- or longer -- for her to get back to where she was before the bullet ripped through her brain. One immediate worry is an infection in her brain, according to Dr. Greg Zorman, chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Healthcare System in southern Florida. ""With gunshot wounds to the head, an infection can still happen, even this late,"" Zorman said. The other concern is the buildup of fluid in the brain. Giffords had hydrocephalus after she was shot, a condition where an excess of cerebral-spinal fluid puts pressure on the brain. Surgeons in Arizona implanted a drain to get rid of the fluid, and on Monday, Dr. Dong Kim, Giffords' neurosurgeon in Houston, removed the drain, saying she no longer needed it. Zorman said doctors will be monitoring Giffords closely to make sure the excess fluid doesn't return. Giffords on Wednesday moved from the intensive care unit to the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) at Memorial Hermann in Houston, where she'll undergo physical, occupational and speech therapy to try to get her brain back to where it once was. Her doctors there are optimistic. ""It's only been a few weeks since this happened and she has been tolerating our aggressive therapy program,"" Dr. Gerard Francisco, chief medical officer at TIRR Memorial Herman, told CNN's ""American Morning."" That program began as soon as Giffords arrived in Houston after being transferred from Tucson, Arizona's University Medical Center, he said, and has been upgraded. Neurosurgeons on Giffords' team describe the brain fluid situation as ""stable,"" Francisco said, ""but we're going to monitor that."" ""Neural recovery is a hurry up and wait situation,"" Zorman said. ""Recovering from that injury just takes time."" One of the first things doctors will do is try to get Giffords back to a regular schedule, said Dr. Alan Novick, medical director of rehabilitation for Memorial Healthcare System. ""In the intensive care unit, patients get their days and nights mixed up."" Rehab doctors will give Giffords a series of tests to assess her physical and cognitive abilities, he said. For example, they might ask her to draw a clock. ""It sounds simple, but sometimes they'll put in the wrong numbers, or put all the numbers on the right hand side,"" he explained. ""That shows us which part of the brain is having issues."" Another area doctors will look at is called ""executive function,"" or the ability to incorporate many different thoughts all at the same time. ""In our everyday lives, there are snippets of info coming in all at once, and we integrate multiple things that are going on at the same time,"" said Dr. Ross Zafonte, chairman of the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. ""Obviously, she was really good at that, and hopefully she will be again,"" he said. With a brain injury, functioning may be impaired depending on what area of the brain was damaged, Francisco said. Doctors will watch Giffords' functioning closely and modify her therapy program ""to address individual impairments and deficits,"" he said. Still, Francisco said he continues to be surprised at the speed of Giffords' recovery. ""When I see her every day, there is something new,"" he said. That has been a challenge to her medical team, but provides them opportunities to challenge her as well, he said. Trying to become the person you once were can be very trying, doctors said. ""Emotionally, this kind of recovery can be very difficult,"" Zafonte said. ""Depression rates in this situation are well over 50%."" Some brain injuries affect not just a patient's emotional state, but their basic personality. ""They may have different behaviors,"" Novick said. ""Spouses and other family members have to relate to a person who was not necessarily the same person they knew before the injury."" All of this requires patience from the patients and their families. ""People like (Giffords) often have a rocky road,"" Zafonte said. ""But they often get to places that surprise us, and surprise them.""","NEW: Giffords' doctors say she is undergoing ""aggressive therapy""

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- After 31 years and two months at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, John Bundy is joining the ranks of the unemployed. He showed up for his last day at 7 a.m. Friday, turned in his employee badge and then left to go hunting. ""I'm very proud I was a part of this,"" he said. ""There were some challenging times, but I am glad I was part of this team."" He is one of more than 1,200 United Space Alliance employees whose were laid off October 1: coincidentally, the same day NASA began operating in 1958. Bundy, 50, started his career as a technician on the shuttle thermal protection system and then worked his way up to manager for Kennedy Space Center's orbital processing facility. Now, he's updating his rÃ©sumÃ© and taking welding classes at Brevard Community College in hopes of finding another job. ""I don't know how to put 31 years into a sentence,"" Bundy said. McGinnis and the others who walked out the door of the Kennedy Space Center on Friday are some of the nearly 9,000 NASA employees whose jobs will be cut as the shuttle program nears its end. Some of those jobs may be extended if President Obama signs the $19 billion budget for the space agency, passed by Congress this week, that authorizes an additional shuttle launch. Congress passes NASA budget . But the extension comes too late for Bundy and the other United Space Alliance employees. The ending came as no surprise: Six years ago, President George W. Bush announced that 2010 would be the last year for the shuttle program. Because many NASA workers like Bundy have specialized jobs, it will be hard to transition from the space agency to other employment. With the help of federal funding, Florida has set up a transitional program to help aerospace workers prepare for new employment. Read more coverage from CNN affiliate WKMG . Many of the NASA employees seeking employment help are ""like deer in the headlights,"" said Lisa Rice, president of Brevard Workforce, which runs the federally funded aerospace transitional program. ""First reaction: 'Where do I go? What do I do?' "" she said, describing NASA employees' responses after being laid off. Job loss, Rice explains, is kind of like a grieving process. With the help of the transitional program, aerospace employees are lead through the process of rÃ©sumÃ© writing, sharpening interviewing techniques and developing skills needed for new jobs. Many Kennedy Space Center workers, like Bundy, have not written a rÃ©sumÃ© for more than 30 years. Transitional instructors teach workers how to include decades of experience into a one- or two-page rÃ©sumÃ©. ""You need to have a plan B,"" said transitional program director Judy Blanchard. ""The shuttle is retiring, and the end is inevitable."" Boeing aerospace engineer Juan Vazquez took the warning to heart, having worked on shuttles for 23 years. This year, he opened two laundromats that he runs in his spare time.  To ensure that he would succeed as a small-business owner, Vazquez completed the transitional program's entrepreneur training class. ""I grew up on shuttle. I've been working on shuttle since I was 18 years old,"" Vazquez said. ""I pretty much live and breathe this stuff. I really enjoy what I do."" Other shuttle workers have had a hard time coming to terms with the idea that there is no definite replacement for shuttle, according to Rice. When Bush announced that the shuttle program would end in 2010, he said it would be replaced by the Constellation program to return man to the moon and beyond. Many shuttle workers held out hope that they could find new jobs in the Constellation program, which would have included two new rocket systems and a new crew module to transport astronauts into space. From the beginning, Constellation was plagued by underfunding. This year, Obama killed the program's future funding because of budget overruns and because it was behind schedule. That could affect more than 20,000 workers along Florida's space coast, according to Rice. ""We are looking at 9,000 aerospace workers who will be affected with another 14,000 indirectly affected in community,"" she said. For Bundy, walking away from Kennedy Space Center was not as hard as he thought, he said Friday morning. He praised United Space Alliance for going ""above and beyond to help their people adjust, from job placement to constant job fairs."" But it's more about just losing a job, he explained. ""I have a lot of friends, a lot of teammates,"" Bundy said.  ""I wish them all the best, and I'm going to miss them all.""","More than 1,200 NASA workers were laid off Friday because of the shuttle program's end .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Chilean officials said Thursday the first test of a rescue capsule designed to rescue 33 trapped miners was carried out successfully. ""We did a test with a capsule in a tube 12 meters long,"" said engineer Rene Aguilar. ""We were trying to see how the capsule functions in the tube -- the wheels, the springs -- and that works perfect."" Once one of the three drills working to reach the trapped miners breaks through, a rescue capsule will be lowered at least 600 meters (1,968 feet) to begin ferrying the men to the surface. Before the capsule goes down, though, officials said, metal casing or tubes would have to be lowered into the hole to provide a buffer between the capsule and rock. ""We will need to build a platform and bring heavy winches that can lift 400 tons,"" Aguilar said, ""You can imagine how big they are, we will need to position them. The casing could take take 48 hours to implement."" Interior Ministry adviser Cristian Barra said that by October 8, all the personnel and equipment rescuers need -- including two additional rescue capsules and a field hospital to immediately treat the miners -- will be on site. Officials said the tentative date they are setting for the rescue is the beginning of November but that they will be ready for a potential rescue as early as the end of next week. The Plan B drill continued to lead the efforts to free the men, reaching a depth of 333 meters (1,092 feet) on Thursday, the government's rescue coordinator Andre Sougarret said. The drill was taken offline for about six hours after it lost pressure while hammering at the tough Chilean rock, officials said. On Tuesday the Plan B drill passed the halfway point to the miners, spurring a celebration in Camp Hope, the makeshift tent village where many of the miners' family members anxiously wait. The Plan A drill -- a mining drill -- reached 148 meters (486 feet), but the hole it was drilling would still need to be widened to 70 centimeters (27.5 inches) to accommodate the rescue capsule. The Plan C drill -- an enormous oil drilling platform that dominates the rescue site -- had reached 156 meters (512 feet), Sougarret said. Sougarret said that officials were working with physicians and psychologists to determine the order in which miners would be pulled from the mine, but said no decision had been made. Meanwhile, the miners continued to aid with their own rescue by clearing rock that had fallen into the mine as a result of the drilling. The miners used front-loader machines that were not damaged in the collapse to clear the rubble. Officials said the miners were clearing about eight tons of rock every 12 hours to keep the mine shaft clear. Officials had no comment on a lawsuit filed Thursday by some of the miners' family members against the San Esteban Mining Co., which owns the mine, and the government for negligence. An attorney for 27 of the miners families filed the lawsuit, which seeks $12 million (U.S.) from the mine and government for harm inflicted on the men. Chilean government officials has criticized the mine for not having the right safety measures in place. Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era dismissed several officials in charge of mine safety after the cave-in. ""Everyone who is here recognizes and appreciates the work being done by the rescue workers,"" said lawyer Edgardo Reinoso. ""This has nothing to do with one government or another but we have to ask why are these miners at the bottom of a mine?"" The mining company did not return calls seeking comment. San Esteban is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and its assets are being sought by creditors. Government officials have also said the company will bear the cost of the army of rescue workers and drilling teams being flown in from around the world. At Camp Hope, several relatives said they had not participated in the action and the lawsuit was of of little interest to them. Said family member Maria Segovia: ""I just want to get my brother out.""

"(CNN) -- A researcher who warned of Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic damage sued Louisiana State University on Wednesday, accusing university officials of pushing him out of his job over his criticism of the Army Corps of Engineers. Ivor van Heerden led the investigation into the failure of the levee system surrounding New Orleans, which flooded when the levees failed during the 2005 storm. The inquiry put much of the blame for the disaster on the Corps, which his lawsuit called ""an important funding source"" for LSU. The suit accuses LSU of putting ""the bureaucratic interests of university officials above the health and safety of millions of people who live in the path of the hurricanes that threaten the Gulf Coast every year."" It argues that school officials ""engaged in illegal reprisal"" against van Heerden, the deputy director of LSU's Hurricane Center, because of his critical research and testimony about the levee system. Van Heerden was told in 2009 that his contract, which expires in May, would not be renewed. There was no immediate response from LSU officials to the complaint, which was filed in a state court in Baton Rouge on Wednesday. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, LSU Chancellor Michael Martin said the decision not to renew van Heerden's job was made before Martin joined the university administration, but he said he had reviewed the issue ""and am confident that the process was handled appropriately."" ""LSU cannot comment on confidential personnel matters or on pending litigation, but I can tell you that LSU wholeheartedly supports its faculty and values their research, teaching and scholarly publishing,"" Martin said. ""LSU also values its role as the state's flagship university, and, as such, will continue its work to help preserve Louisiana's coastline, mitigate hurricane damage and search for ways to protect the state's coastal populations."" Katrina killed more than 1,800 people when it struck near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line in August 2005. Most of the dead were in or around New Orleans, where more than three-quarters of the city flooded. Van Heerden has said the university barred him from testifying as an expert witness in a case against the Corps of Engineers. But he served as an adviser to the plaintiffs in that suit, which resulted in a finding of negligence against the agency in November.","NEW: Chancellor says ""process was handled appropriately""

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- For one trapped miner in a collapsed mine in Chile, ""Hope"" weighs only 7 pounds. Esperanza, which means hope in Spanish, is the name of Ariel Ticona's baby girl. She is also believed to be the first child born to any of the 33 miners during their nightmarish weeks buried underground. Esperanza was born Tuesday in a hospital about an hour's drive down a winding mountain road from the mine where her father is trapped. Ticona and his wife, Elizabeth Segovia, learned they were having a girl the day before the mine cave-in. They had planned to call her Carolina. The girl's birth was not just a celebration for Ticona, his father said. ""Immediately it gave all the miners there a lot of excitement,"" Hector Ticona said. ""They were all very happy about her birth and that she will be called Esperanza."" The day after the birth, Hector Ticona carried Chilean newspapers he was saving for his son with front-page photos of Elizabeth holding the new baby. The story of the baby's birth has been reported as far away as New Zealand, Germany and Singapore, and Esperanza has become a symbol that life continues for the miners despite their underground imprisonment. Photos released from their hospital room showed a tiny baby, her eyes shut tight and with no idea that she is already famous at birth. The decision to change her name arrived to Ticona in the mine's depths. That all the miners had survived the cave-in and then the 17 days it took rescuers to drill the holes that found them was already miraculous. But their continued physical and mental well-being was far from assured. Faced with the fact that he and his fellow workers were about to experience an isolating darkness that no one had ever endured before, Ticona put pen to paper. The letter he wrote reached his family through what the Chileans call ""palomas,"" metal tubes that carry food, supplies and messages to the trapped men. ""He said, 'What if we call her Hope?'"" Hector Ticona recalled. ""Hope for the camp backing us, hope for getting us out of here, hope to keep fighting for my daughter, hope to unite my family.' "" Ticona's wife agreed to the new name. For her, though, the experience would be a tug of war between worrying for her unborn child and for her trapped husband. ""I have been talking to her and telling her Daddy's OK,"" Segovia told CNN a few weeks before she gave birth. ""I can't cry because she would feel everything."" Before the mine collapse, Ticona promised Segovia he would be in the room when she gave birth. He had not been present for the births of their two sons, one time because he wanted to watch a beloved soccer team play and the other time because of ""squeamishness,"" Segovia said. Segovia decided to have the birth of their daughter videotaped. But videotaping a natural birth was against hospital policy. So, to get around the policy, she had a Caesarean section on camera. Family members say mother and daughter have been released from the hospital and are doing fine. Over a video conference system that is one of their links to the outside world, Ticona was shown the birth of his daughter, deep in the mine. ""We sent the video and Ariel was very happy,"" engineer Rene Aguilar said. ""It was a very beautiful moment for them."" Around Camp Hope, the encampment that runs up the entrance to the mine where many families have moved to wait out the miners' rescue, word of Esperanza's birth brought joy. As she sat in a light blue tent at Camp Hope, Nelly BurgueÃ±o said it is a joy she hopes to experience herself soon. Her son, trapped miner Victor Zamora, and his wife also are expecting a daughter. When the girl is born in six months' time, BurgueÃ±o said, the couple has decided to call her Paz Victoria, or Peace Victory. ""I am going to be a father,"" BurgueÃ±o said her son wrote her. ""I am happiest man in the world even though I am in the depths of the earth. I want to share this happiness with everyone in the world, with you, Mom, and my brothers."" BurgueÃ±o said her son has been ""reborn."" ""He wrote me,"" she said, ""that even in the deepest part of the earth there shines light.""

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's mining minister expressed optimism Thursday that the 33 miners trapped since early last month 2,300 feet (701 meters) below ground here will be rescued in early November and maybe sooner. ""Everything is going a little bit better than anticipated,"" Laurence Golborne told CNN about the three holes -- dubbed Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C -- being dug in an effort to open a passageway to safety for the men. ""On Plan A we didn't have to change the drill bit at 200 meters [656 feet] but instead we were able to drill and change it at 320 meters [1,050 feet],"" he said. ""Plan B today reached 500 meters [1,640 feet] and we're reaching 700 meters [2,296 feet] probably by this weekend. ""We have finished assembly of the Plan C drill and that will be ready to start operating over the next couple of days possibly this weekend."" He added, ""So, we're optimistic we will comply with our target date at the beginning of November and, if everything stays on path and we have no big problems, then it could be earlier."" Plan A and Plan B each require two holes to be drilled -- a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches (65-70 centimeters) in diameter. Golborne said the second pass would be slower progress than the first pass. ""It's like eating a donut,"" he said. ""What we are doing first is eating a little bit a around the hole in the middle of the donut and then we have to eat the rest of the donut and that is slower."" Drilling under Plan A will stop this weekend once the drill bit reaches 1,247 feet (380 meters), then the drill will receive scheduled maintenance before resuming early next week, engineer Rene Aguilar said. According to Golborne, the first stage of drilling on Plan B has reached a depth of 1,640 feet (500 meters) and will pierce the ceiling of the mine shaft where the men are trapped this weekend. The assembly of the drill to be used in Plan C has been completed, he said, adding that he hoped it would begin drilling this weekend. Plan A involves using a drill placed directly above the shelter where the miners are holed up. Engineers estimated last week that this plan would take between three and four months to complete the hole at 701 meters (2,300 feet). Under Plan B, a hole is being drilled at a roughly 80-degree angle into an area of the mine shaft that is used as a mechanical workshop. That distance, engineers estimate, is around 2,034 feet (620 meters). The drill used in Plan C would need to cut through some 1,969 feet (600 meters) of rock and earth, they said. Golborne said rescue workers were betting which plan would rescue the miners. ""Between our teams members we are betting one another a barbecue, but I won't tell you which one I'm betting on. But no matter which plan wins, I will be very happy if we can have them back as soon as possible."" Two bore holes -- each about 8 centimeters in diameter -- are currently being used to supply the miners. The first carries compressed air, water, communications and a constant supply of electricity to power lights that are intended to simulate daytime and nighttime. Supplies -- such as food, clothing and letters -- are sent down to the miners via metal cylinders known as ""carrier pigeons"" through the second bore hole. Golborne said the miners' pay was being distributed to their families from the mutual security system. ""And in the future, due to their heroism, they will probably be welcome to work anywhere,"" he said. The company has continued ""for now"" to pay the salaries of some 300 other mine employees who have not been working since the August 5 cave-in, he said. ""We have to see in the future but we, as the government, are prepared to give them the right support, and to help them in the process to defend their rights and to help them find jobs on the future,"" he said. Two prototypes of cages to be used to hoist the men to the surface will be reviewed Tuesday as will the design of the winch, Golborne said. He predicted the cage that is used will have a diameter of 55 centimeters (21.7 inches) to 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) and will be pulled upward at a rate of one meter per second, meaning each man could make the trip in 10 to 12 minutes. Previous estimates had suggested it could take 2-1/2 hours to hoist and then lower the cage,. Asked whether new laws were needed to enforce mining codes, Golborne said the laws were not to blame for the men's predicament: ""The problem was that the owners did not do what they were told to,"" he said. ""Not because it was too expensive or they were greedy, but just because they didn't care. ... we have got good regulations but maybe we need to improve auditing of those regulations."" Representatives of the owner, the San Esteban Mining Co., have said previously they will collaborate fully with Chilean authorities and the Chilean Congress in their inquiries about what went wrong at the mine.

"(CNN)  -- A day after the disheartening loss of its star-studded team in the men's hockey preliminaries, Canada got a warm boost when the pair of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir won ice dancing gold Monday night. Leading after two rounds, the duo scored a 110.42 in the free dance for a 221.57 total and the title. The gold was the fifth for Canada in these Winter Olympics. The pair, which has been skating together since 1997, edged the U.S. team of Meryl Davis and Charlie White (215.74). Russians Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin (207.64) were third. ""We're just so proud to be Canadian and to have won on home ice,"" Virtue said. Moir said he and his partner have a special connection to Davis and White, whom they train with. ""We knew they would be our biggest competition all year long."" The Americans said the fact they had won silver hadn't sunk in  yet and they were ecstatic about the way they skated. ""We had three great programs so we are very happy,"" White said. Team ski jumping . A giant leap from Gregor Schlierenzauer gave Austria a sensational gold medal in the men's team ski jumping competition in Whistler on Monday. The 20-year-old -- already a winner of two bronze medals in the individual jumping events -- nearly sat down on his landing and just managed to avoid touching the ground with his hand to ensure his jump of 146.5 meters remained valid. The giant leap made up for the fact that style points were lost due to the awkward landing -- and helped Austria claim a comfortable victory over Germany, who took the silver. The Austrian quartet of Schlierenzauer, Wolfgang Loitzl, Andreas Kofler and Thomas Morgenstern, collected an Olympic record points total of 1107.9. Germany's total of 1035.8 gave them the silver with Norway taking the bronze medal with a total of 1030.3 points. Cross-country skiing . Norway's Petter Northug produced a devastating late burst to make up for individual disappointment by claiming victory in the men's team sprint. Northug had been roundly criticized by Norwegian media for failing to find his form in the Games so far, but his class shone through as he overhauled Germany's Axel Teichman in the final race to the line. Along with compatriot Oeystein Pettersen, the Norwegians claimed gold in a time of 19 minutes and one second. Teichman and Tim Tscharnke won the silver for Germany with Russian pair Nikolay Morilov and Alexey Petukhov taking the bronze. There was a similar outcome to the women's team sprint, but this time it was the Germans who powered through late on, courtesy of Claudia Nystad. Nystad, who was partnered by Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle, overtook Sweden's Anna Haag at the death to steal the gold medal by just 0.6 seconds with Russia claiming the bronze. Ice hockey . Tournament favorites the United States are through to the women's final after crushing Sweden 9-1 in the first semifinal -- avenging their 2006 semifinal defeat at the hands of the same opponents. Monique Lamoureux scored a hat-trick as the United States reached their first Olympic final since 2002. The Canadian women overtook Finland 5-0, and will match up against the U.S. team in the gold medal contest on Friday.","Austria defeat Germany and Norway to secure gold in the men's team ski jumping .

"(CNN) -- Some Americans are giving homegrown food and specialty items as presents this holiday season and spending a fraction of what they'd pay in a store. Who doesn't like a tasty bargain? According to the National Gardening Association, about 41 million households participate in food gardening; 58 percent do it to grow better tasting food and 54 percent do it to save money on food bills. But Kenneth Wingard, a home furnishings designer, is among the 23 percent of growers who share their tasty treats with others. This year, he's giving away organic peach jam and preserves from his California ranch for the holidays. ""It's definitely a cost savings,"" Wingard said. ""It probably ends up costing us about $2 a jar and we are handing out 60 this year."" But he doesn't just do it for the cost, he enjoys the warm, fuzzy feeling it brings him. ""They are the kind of fuzzy peaches I remember growing up with in Georgia -- where you buy them off the side of the road and they make the whole car smell like summery goodness,"" Wingard said. ""The jam is the same way -- the color of the peaches stays vibrant and when it hits warm bread it smells like I'm back on the side of the road with peach juice dripping down my chin."" The 46-year-old peach grower and his partner, Mike Gotham, planted about 30 trees on their ranch in Boonville, California, three years ago and are just starting to get some fruit from them. So far, they make their jams and preserves from an older tree. ""Luckily, we have a mature peach tree that was planted by a forward-thinking former owner, which makes me more than a little nervous about what we're going to do with fruit from 30 trees one day,"" Wingard said, chuckling. Wingard said he makes his peach jam and preserves his grandmother's way. ""For canning, we parboil, peel and pit the peaches, then cook them down with some sugar and pectin and put them in jars in an enamel canner to sterilize,"" he said. The jam has a velvety smooth sweetness without a hint of tartness. ""We leave some big chunks of peaches in it, so you'll get those real bursts of peach flavor and not too much sugar,"" Wingard said. His father is his No. 1 recipient. ""He starts dropping hints around harvest time,"" Wingard said. The couple stopped giving store-bought holiday gifts a few years ago and enjoy giving ""noncommercial"" gifts. ""At this point in our lives, no one needs more 'stuff,' so we like giving consumables and creating something from scratch, with special meaning,"" said Wingard. Liz Porter of Hickory Flat, Georgia, had a similar inspiration to grow holiday gifts from her garden. ""I wanted to find ways to do something for our grown children without buying them gifts they may not really need,"" Porter said. She also grows food for friends and business associates. She's been making holiday gift baskets filled with homemade jams, jellies, pickles, relishes and breads for about 10 years. She also adds items like bay leaves, garlic and rosemary. Porter makes breakfast baskets, too. She grows her own field corn to grind for cornmeal and grits and will add fresh eggs from her chickens. She likes to add a bit of pizzazz to her gifts, so she'll use cheese boxes, copper pots or iron skillets as containers for her food. ""I think people always appreciate something that comes from the heart,"" Porter said. ""I can recall some experimental recipes that may not have tasted that good, like my whole-wheat fruit breads, but my gifts always bring a smile to my recipients."" Porter said she has always made homemade gifts to save money. ""In these times, saving dollars means a great deal,"" she said. ""And the one benefit that cannot be priced is the time one can spend with family, friends and community while gardening and harvesting.""","Some people will receive homegrown food gifts this holiday season .

"(CNN) -- Apple's Steve Jobs gave quite a monologue Monday, dressing down competing makers of smartphones, tablets and software. The brunt of that was aimed at Google, which makes the Android software that powers smartphones from a range of manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung Electronics and HTC. First, Jobs expressed skepticism about how Google reports its number of Android users. This is an issue Jobs has raised in prior speeches, yet he freely addressed the point of comparison, saying Apple has activated 75,000 more iOS devices over the last 30 days compared to Google's last reported Android activation number. Jobs, who made his comments in an unusual appearance on Apple's quarterly earnings call with investors, then took issue with the geeky argument of open versus closed, which refers to how transparent a system's source code is to developers. ""Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed,"" Jobs said. ""We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the differences between our two approaches."" He called Android ""fragmented."" He highlighted how Android handset makers install layers on top of Google's software, which can introduce unexpected problems. And Amazon, Verizon Wireless and Vodafone say they intend to create their own digital stores to sell applications to Android users, despite Google's own Marketplace. ""This is going to be a mess for both users and developers,"" Jobs said. ""We believe integrated will trump fragmented every time."" Later, Jobs criticized Google for not having a version of Android that plays nicely with tablets. The animated executive then turned his attention to tablet-device makers, which are ramping up production in advance of the holiday season. ""Almost all of them use 7-inch screens, as opposed to the iPad's 10-inch screen,"" Jobs said. ""This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps."" Jobs joked that people would need to sandpaper their fingers in order to use these gadgets comfortably. While a smaller tablet is obviously more portable, he says consumers won't want something that replaces a smartphone. ""Every tablet user is also a smartphone user,"" he proclaimed. His comments will perhaps put an end to speculation that Apple will make a 7-inch iPad. ""We think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum screen size required to make great tablet apps,"" he added. Additionally, Jobs said tablet makers will have a hard time matching Apple's prices. The most inexpensive iPad sells for $499. Competitors' tablets will be ""dead on arrival,"" Jobs said. He added: ""Sounds like lots of fun ahead."" Jobs began his comments Monday by relishing in Apple's successes with the iPhone 4, pointing to the 14.1 million smartphones the company sold during the recent three-month fiscal period. That tops Research in Motion's 12.1 million units sold, as Jobs was quick to note. ""We have now passed RIM, and I don't see them catching up to us in the foreseeable future,"" Jobs said. ""I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform, after iOS and Android."" RIM, the Canadian smartphone manufacturer, is popular with corporate IT departments for its tight security mechanisms and reliable keyboards for tapping out long emails. Despite the slow quarter for RIM, the BlackBerry maker still has the highest market share of smartphone users, according to independent data. The company is preparing to enter the tablet market with its PlayBook, an area dominated by Apple's iPad. ""RIM has a high mountain to climb,"" Jobs concluded. On Adobe Systems, which makes the Flash platform that powers most of the Web's video, Jobs dodged questions. He finally addressed the lack of Flash support on the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, saying: ""Flash hasn't presented any problem at all."" On Nokia, which sells the most cell phones worldwide, Jobs said: ""Nokia is the biggest, and we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do. But we don't aspire to be like them."" ""Nokia makes $50 handsets, and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50,"" Jobs said. ""We're not smart enough to figure that one out yet."" For the famed business leader to take part in the company's earnings call is strange enough, as he acknowledged after being introduced in the meeting Monday. (Apple broke a number of its sales records this quarter.) But his comments were even more unexpected. Oftentimes, his discussions would come back to Google, as they did again after a question about Nokia. ""Android is our biggest competitor,"" Jobs said. ""They outshipped us in the June quarter when we were transitioning to the iPhone 4."" ""Eventually it will turn into a zero-sum game or a lot closer to that,"" Jobs said of the smartphone market. ""Right now, iPhone and Android are winning that battle.""","Apple's Steve Jobs participated in the company's earnings call, which is unusual .
Jobs had choice words for competitors including Google, RIM, Nokia and Adobe .

"(WIRED)  -- Windows Phone 7, Microsoft's complete do-over of its mobile operating system, is off to a promising start with the Samsung Focus. Despite a few imperfections with usability and web browsing, the big M has polished a gem with this OS, and it truly shines through this iPhone lookalike's beautiful display. The Focus feels slick and smooth the first time you pick it up. It's a teensy bit longer, wider and thicker than the iPhone 4 (4.84 x 2.56 x 0.39 inches compared with the iPhone 4's 4.5 x 2.31 x 0.37 inches). And the Focus is lighter at 4.07 ounces, versus the iPhone 4's 4.8 ounces. Holding it in your hand, you can tell the Samsung phone's plastic parts are a bit cheaper than Apple's luxury glass-and-metal components. That's not to say the Focus isn't a sweet device, though: The vivid Super AMOLED display makes Windows Phone 7's colorful tile-based interface a visual treat. Selecting a tile brings you into a ""hub"" containing integrated experiences for different features. For example, the Marketplace hub displays the four different software stores where you can purchase media: third-party apps, games, music and Samsung Zone, a separate app store serving software made by Samsung. WIRED: General download of Windows Phone 7 interface . You can move tiles around on the home screen to suit your preferences just by holding your finger over them and dragging. The tile interface is plenty intuitive, so you probably won't need an instruction manual when you're setting up the phone. The People tile is pretty fun: It blends your contacts list with your Facebook account. When you dial a friend's number, his or her Facebook mug appears next to the call. Selecting a contact brings up the person's phone number, e-mail address and Facebook profile all in one screen. Pretty neat. The Mail hub is especially impressive. You select your service (Hotmail, Google Mail, Yahoo! and others), enter your login info and boom -- the inbox is a tile on your home screen. The e-mail app in general looks great: Facebook integration comes into play here, too, so when you load an e-mail it's accompanied with the sender's Facebook portrait as well. To me, this visual experience makes e-mail far less boring. For transferring music, photos and video you can sync media from your computer to the Focus with a USB cable. I tested syncing on a Mac. The official syncing program for Mac users isn't available yet, but I had a chance to try the beta version, and it was surprisingly smooth at syncing music from my iTunes library and photos and video from iPhoto. (Don't get your hopes up, though: This is a feature that Apple is most likely going to break with future iTunes updates, just like it did with the Palm Pre's iTunes sync feature.) As for snapping photos, there's a dedicated shutter button on the right side of the phone to load the camera app and to take a picture. In the Photo hub, you can also enable pictures to automatically sync to a free SkyDrive folder stored online in your Hotmail account, sparing you the need to manually upload them. Overall, this entire camera experience is a lot snappier than photo features on the iPhone and Android devices. However, the pictures shot with the Focus's 5-megapixel camera are only passable, and are a little blurry even in good lighting conditions. With all that said, there were a few minor gripes that drove me a bit crazy. To wake up the phone, you have to press the physical power button on the right side. It feels unnatural to have to grip the phone and push a button on the side whenever you want to quickly check an e-mail or send a text message. I wish you could power on the device just by pressing the main menu button, which is centered under the screen -- similar to how you can press the iPhone's Home button to turn it on. And then there's the mobile version of Internet Explorer. It's not as bad as Microsoft's desktop browser, but it's not much better. The mobile browser doesn't seem to load text properly on some websites, such as Reddit and Digg. Small text doesn't render smoothly, which is evident even when loading Wired.com. Also, photos on some websites appear over-sharpened, making rough pixels become visible. Long story short, two thumbs down for Internet Explorer. Oh, yeah -- and just like the iPhone, there's no support for Adobe Flash on Windows Phone 7 (yet), so Hulu junkies won't be thrilled. The phone seemed more reliable at holding a call than the iPhone 4, but it wasn't any better at pulling in a signal in areas where AT&T's coverage is weak (like San Francisco's Mission District). My testing was hardly scientific, though. Texting is surprisingly fast on the Focus. Hitting Send shoots out a text almost instantly. There's no progress bar or anything. Why can't the iPhone do that? Overall, the Samsung Focus is a solid all-around device, and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. Most of the listed problems will probably be fixed in software updates. And with Windows Phone 7, Microsoft has largely redeemed itself after putting that bloated carcass known as Windows Mobile to rest. Rest in peace -- and good riddance -- WinMo. WIRED Gorgeous tile-based UI laced with large, smooth text doesn't rip off the iPhone's app interface. Provides a rich dose of social savvy thanks to tight Facebook integration. Physical camera shutter button is a nice shortcut for shooting quick photos. TIRED Internet Explorer lives up to its super-lame reputation. Camera shots too blurry to be taken seriously.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi says he governs Italy out of a sense of duty and sacrifice, not because he enjoys the job. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at a press conference in Rome on Oct. 7, 2009 . The conservative, flamboyant Italian leader, 73, says he actually doesn't like governing at all. But he stays in the job because he is considered the ""only leader able to hold the center-right together."" Berlusconi says there's nothing simple about the prime minister's job. He said: ""I'm doing what I do with a sense of sacrifice. I don't really like it. Not at all."" He added: ""Very often there is a lot of dirty dealing, there is really the gutter press, worse than that, the shameless and sickly. It's a difficult life to be responsible for leading the government in a country like Italy."" In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Paula Newton, Berlusconi also discussed some of the controversial statements he has made, including calling U.S. President Barack Obama ""tanned."" He denied the comment was a gaffe. ""I have never made any gaffes, not even one. Every gaffe is invented by the newspapers."" He said he always thinks before he speaks. ""I tell stories and tell jokes,"" he said. ""I only tell jokes that can be heard by anyone. I'm always conscious of what we are talking about."" Berlusconi said his supposed gaffes, like the time he left German Chancellor Angela Merkel waiting by the side of the Rhine while he finished a call on his mobile, were ""invented by the papers.""  Watch more about his extraordinary year Â» . Berlusconi explained the incident to CNN, saying had been on the phone to Turkey's PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Afterwards Merkel -- who he described as ""happy"" -- asked him if the call had been successful. Another time, he startled Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a group photo at Buckingham Palace when he shouted over to the American president: ""Mr. Obama! It's Berlusconi."" This prompted the queen to raise a gloved hand and complain: ""Why does he have to shout?""  Look at photos of Italy's flamboyant leader Â» . Berlusconi told CNN ""the Queen defended me."" The billionaire media mogul-turned politician also blames the Italian media as the reason his second wife and mother of three of his five children, Veronica Lario, asked him for a divorce, saying Lario erred by believing what was in the Italian papers. Lario cited Berlusconi's presence at the birthday party of an 18-year-old Naples model, reported in the Italian press, as the reason for seeking a divorce earlier this year. ""There is absolutely nothing at all which is negative,"" Berlusconi told CNN about his appearance at the birthday party of Noemi Letizia in Naples. Berlusconi, Italy's longest-serving prime minister, said his friendship with the young woman and her family were ""relationships which have a right to privacy."" He said the newspapers had accused him of lying in statements he made to them about it. ""I will react and I will explain the situation,"" Berlusconi told CNN. ""I will have all the Italians with me and the accusations will be a boomerang against those who made it against me."" Lario also accused him of choosing starlets and showgirls as European parliament candidates and of consorting with young women. At the time Lario was interviewed by Dario Cresto-Dina, a reporter from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, who told CNN, ""In Veronica's words, 'This time he went beyond the limit with his latest public humiliation. I want to close this chapter on this marriage."" Allegations that Berlusconi went to parties with escorts were also widely reported. Giampaolo Tarantini, the businessman accused of hiring the escorts denied any wrongdoing and said he brought women to the parties to make a ""beautiful impression."" ""I have never paid money to those who accompanied me except for refunding their trip expenses,"" he said in a statement issued in June this year. ""I exclude that the premier could have been aware of these reimbursements and I want to ask forgiveness for having involuntarily damaged him."" The scandals have done little damage to Berlusconi's political standing in Italy. Polls have shown his popularity has dipped only slightly, mostly among women, since the scandals broke in the spring.  Watch more about Berlusconi's love for his people Â» . ""When I go around, it's embarrassing to see the affection showered upon me,"" Berlusconi told CNN. ""I know that people can change their opinions ... but I must say that I just note the fact that I am close to the heart of many Italians and they show this to me very often."" Berlusconi, who's also a songwriter, a real estate and insurance tycoon, and owner of Italian soccer team AC Milan, said he's always been ""liked by those who have worked with me. I'm liked and loved by all the people in politics."" Even his critics acknowledge his popularity among Italians. Giulio Anselmi, veteran Italian journalist and chairman of the Italian news agency ANSA, says Berlusconi's popularity is because he's a populist. He describes him as ""a man who pulls the most elementary strings of the public opinion; a public opinion, which in Italy in these times, prefers simple paths."" Berlusconi, who controls almost half of Italy's television stations, was elected in 2008 to his third term. The next Italian election, barring an early vote, is scheduled for 2013. His conservative coalition has control of both the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Berlusconi, a former cruise ship singer before turning his hand to media ownership, said he entered politics in 1994 to combat the growing power of the Left and ""communist ideology"" in the country. ""I couldn't imagine that the country where I had lived, where I had great success as the first Italian entrepreneur, that it would fall prey to these people,"" he said. Asked for the secret of his success, the wise-cracking entrepreneur replied: ""Everybody knows that I have a sense of friendship, I'm loyal, I always say what I think -- I don't have any hidden thoughts, I don't hide anything, I speak openly."" He also attributed his success to sheer hard work, his practice ""not to leave anything undone. To aim for 10 if you want to achieve eight."" Paula Newton contributed to this story.","Berlusconi says he doesn't like his job as Italian leader .

"CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and photojournalist Peter Morris traveled to southern Afghanistan with Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps. CNN's Barbara Starr is on assignment in Afghanistan, where she says Marines are living in very tough terrain. HELMAND PROVINCE, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Our travels in Afghanistan continue. I feel like the title of this posting should be ""why I had to get power-washed in Afghanistan"" or ""the body armor is only heavy until they start shooting at you."" OK, now I will explain. CNN photojournalist Peter Morris and I just wrapped up spending several days in southern Afghanistan with Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps, touring the combat zone. The Marines are living in some of the toughest terrain there is. It is remote and often raining. That means dust turns to mud, and you find yourself covered in it from head to toe. Stinky, cold, wet, oozy mucky mud. The good news is, everybody stinks, so you lose any sense of self-consciousness about it. But you do dream of getting power-washed. So, yes, after a few days a shower was, shall we say, more than essential. For the Marines, however, it is a seven-month tour of duty in mud in the winter and dust in the summer. It seems very grim, especially when compounded by the fact that the Marines are wearing heavy body armor all the time. Ask them if it's heavy to wear, the typical answer goes something like, ""It's only heavy to wear until the bad guys start shooting at you. Then it's OK."" The young Marines know exactly how tough the fight they are facing in the coming weeks and months will likely be. Several of them told me security had gotten considerably worse in recent days. Their bases were being repeatedly shelled by insurgents, several roadside bombs had gone off, and local Afghan police had died at the hands of suicide attacks. Senior commanders usually have a more cheery outlook, but here in southern Afghanistan, everyone is cautious. Almost everyone is a veteran of Iraq and learned the tough lesson there about not declaring victory too soon. Even Conway, who commanded U.S. forces in Fallujah, picks his words very carefully. He tells me he believes that everyone must be ready for a spike in U.S. casualties as the Marines begin to move into the region in greater numbers this spring. All of this was rattling around in my head when I saw the Marines riding around in what they call ""a 7-ton truck."" As the name suggests, it's huge and has some armor plating on the sides. But what it doesn't make clear is that the truck is open in the back and sides. The Marines insist it is a safe way to transport troops. For years now, the Army has used fully armored vehicles only in the combat zone. The Marines have a somewhat different view. They believe heavy armor isn't everything; sometimes being able to get around on the battlefield faster is better. But then again, when someone starts shooting at you, I think you want all the armor you can get. Next stop, Iraq. Yeah, there is still a war there, too.","With all the mud in southern Afghanistan, everyone stinks, Barbara Starr says .

"(CNN) -- When she was a public health administrator for the state of California, Kathryn Hall-Trujillo found that her greatest challenge was paying for babies who were born sick. ""The figure we were working with at that time was about $300,000 ... to stabilize a baby for the first 90 days,"" said Hall-Trujillo, who worked for the state from 1976-1991. At the same time, she said, it cost just $2,000 to ensure pregnant mothers received all the care they needed for a healthy pregnancy and proper delivery. The staggering disparity, along with troubling rates of infant mortality in America, compelled Hall-Trujillo, 62, to find a solution. ""It occurred to me that one of the things that we could do that would cost hardly anything was to make sure that moms who were at risk ... [were] really connected to care,"" she said. What Hall-Trujillo came up with was Birthing Project USA. Since 1988, the nonprofit organization has been battling high infant-mortality rates by pairing soon-to-be moms with volunteer ""sister friends"" who provide guidance and support through the pregnancy and first year of the baby's life. Of every 1,000 babies born in the United States, at least six (6.14) do not survive their first year of life, according to the CIA World Factbook. That gives the United States only the 45th best infant mortality rate in the world, trailing top-ranked Monaco (1.78 deaths per thousand births) and countries such as Japan (2.79) and the United Kingdom (4.78). And African-American babies, regardless of the mother's age, income or educational level, are more than twice as likely to die before the age of 1 than Caucasian babies, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is this at-risk group that the Birthing Project primarily targets. ""By the act of going back and saving what we consider to be our little sisters at risk, we have found out that we're also saving our own lives, because we need this kind of information and ... support, regardless of where we are on the socioeconomic ladder,"" Hall-Trujillo said. Hall-Trujillo started the project as an experiment while working for the state in 1988. She paired 10 young, pregnant African-American women who had little access to financial, educational and emotional support with more experienced black women who had further education and more stable income. The idea was to have the pairs work together to ensure positive birth outcomes. This became the founding ""sisterhood"" that has since been replicated thousands of times. Hall-Trujillo participated in the experiment as a ""sister friend"" herself. But just days after delivery, the baby of her ""little sister"" died from complications. ""I used the words infant mortality ... every day of my working career. But until I held DeAndre in my arms, I never realized that that meant counting dead babies,"" she said. ""[That] was...enough to really change my life."" The experience moved Hall-Trujillo to quit her job and work on the Birthing Project full time. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . Since its inception, the Birthing Project has welcomed more than 12,000 babies in 94 community chapters in the United States, Canada, Cuba, Honduras and Malawi. ""We've been doing this long enough now that you can hear a  child -- 20 years old -- say, 'I was born into the Birthing Project,' "" Hall-Trujillo said. ""That means more to me than anything that I may have given up, because in return I have received a whole community."" Hall-Trujillo and veteran chapter leaders train women who step up and create chapters in their own communities. Together, they identify local partner organizations that provide the support services needed for maternal and child health, such as parenting classes and transportation to doctor appointments. The volunteers then help connect their pregnant sisters to those resources. ""All of us want to see our babies born as healthy as possible to families who are prepared to care for them,"" Hall-Trujillo said. Laniqua Roussell, 36, and her ""little sister,"" Evan Batiste, 20, are part of the group's newest chapter in New Orleans, Louisiana. The two were paired together in April, at the end of Batiste's first trimester. Roussell has played a key role in Batiste's pregnancy. She not only helps make sure Batiste is eating right and attending her prenatal appointments, but she also helps Batiste budget her money and find access to affordable, stable housing. ""I wanted a big sister that [has] kids, [has] accomplished a lot in life already to teach me things I don't know,"" Batiste said. ""I could tell she cares about me. I could sense it. ... I needed that."" For Hall-Trujillo, seeing the difference the Birthing Project is making is ""magical."" ""We can do something to help save the world,"" she said. ""All these women prove me right.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- About 30 U.S. military personnel are training members of Pakistan's Frontier Corps on how to fight Taliban and al Qaeda militants in Pakistan's tribal regions, according to several U.S. military sources. A missile, perhaps from a U.S. drone, hit a Taliban school Thursday in Pakistan's North Waziristan province. The Pakistanis trained by the U.S. contingent -- which includes Army Special Forces troops -- will in turn become trainers for Frontier Corps troops on the front lines fighting the militants, the sources said. Pakistani Lt. Col. Attique Rehman confirmed the same details to CNN on Saturday. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said on Wednesday that U.S. military trainers have been in Pakistan and the mission ""has been stepped up, but it still remains very, very small."" ""But the hope is that the more trainers we train, the more effective they will be in training their forces and the more capable forces will then be able to take the fight to the militants in the tribal areas where they operate,"" Morrell said. The mission comes as the U.S. military and the Pakistanis confer about how to train, arm and equip some tribal militias in the fight against militants in the tribal areas. Members of the Frontier Corps are ethnic Pashtuns recruited from Pakistan's tribal region. They are on the front lines in the fight against militants along the Afghan border but they've long had a reputation of being poorly trained and underfunded. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","About 30 U.S. military personnel in Pakistan, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Thirty armed militants were killed on Thursday during a fight with troops in southern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers listen to a speach in Nadi Ali district, Helmand province, on February 5, 2009. The incident occurred in the Gereshk district of Helmand province, and the militants were killed by Afghan soldiers advised by coalition troops, the U.S. military said in a statement. Afghan soldiers had been conducting ""combat reconnaissance in an area of known militant presence,"" the statement said, when militants fired at the troops with small-arms and rocket-propelled grenades and a firefight eventually broke out. The troops made sure non-combatants were not in the area when they fired at the militants, the military statement said. One Afghan soldier received minor injuries in the incident. ""This engagement was yet another blow to the militants, who are quickly losing their ability to operate in Helmand province,"" a coalition official said in the statement. ""The Afghan National Army is working to rid Afghanistan of extremists who are only trying to destabilize the country and sabotage Afghan freedom."" Meanwhile, an Australian soldier has been killed by an improvised explosive device Thursday during operations in southern Afghanistan, Australia's Defense Ministry said. He is the second Australian to be killed in Afghanistan this week. Ten Australian troops have died in the Afghan conflict. Defense Force Chief Angus Houston said the ""soldier was trying to clear the route of an Australian patrol when the explosion happened."" He was trying to defuse the explosive when ""there was an explosion and he was killed,"" Houston said. Houston said the soldier was an expert in countering roadside bombs. ""He lost his life trying to make the environment safe for his mates. At this point in time we do not know what caused the explosion,"" said Houston, who did not say where in the south the incident occurred. On Monday, Australian Cpl. Mathew Hopkins was killed in a firefight in Afghanistan. He had been part of a joint patrol near Kakarak, north of Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province.","Militants killed during a fight with troops in Gereshk district of Helmand province .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki kept her hopes of a maiden grand slam title alive on Tuesday when she came from behind to defeat Francesca Schiavone in the Australian Open quarterfinals. Denmark's Wozniacki lost the first set in her last-eight tie with sixth seed Schiavone before she fought back to clinch a 3-6 6-3 6-3 success. Schiavone, from Italy, overcame Svetlana Kuznetsova in an energy-sapping four-hour match on Sunday, however, she still had enough in the tank to take the opening set and steal a break of serve at the start of the second. Wozniacki had never reached the semifinals at Melbourne Park, but she battled back to set up a last-four meeting with ninth seed Li Na. ""It was very difficult,"" Wozniacki told the WTA Tour's website. ""Francesca was playing well. I just thought, 'Take one ball at a time and don't give up.' ""That's what happens sometimes in tennis. You just need to stay focused. Today everything went in my favor afterwards and I'm happy to sit here as the winner."" World number one Wozniacki, who was beaten in the 2009 U.S. Open final by Kim Clijsters, ensured she will remain at the top of the rankings with her last-eight victory. ""I don't think about the rankings,"" she said. ""I just want to win every match I'm playing, then we'll see what happens. If I'm number one, it's fantastic, but I'm focusing on my matches."" Li booked her second-successive semifinal appearance in Melbourne with a 6-2 6-4 over Germany's Andrea Petkovic. China's Li has enjoyed a perfect start to the 2011 season with a run of 10 victories in a row. ""It was tough,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I only practiced with Andrea one time last year. So, at the beginning of the match, I was a little bit nervous. But I played well today."" Li, who lost to eventual winner Serena Williams in the 2010 tournament, is bidding to become China's first grand slam singles champion. Germany's Petkovic said after their clash she believes her conqueror will go on to claim the title. ""I think she played really well,"" the 30th seed said. ""I think she's going to win the tournament. ""It's just the feeling, how she is on the court, her confidence and the way she's playing.

"(CNN) -- The holidays have arguably come early for armchair disc jockeys, who can scratch along with exclusive musical mash-ups of songs by popular artists in remix simulator ""DJ Hero 2."" Supporting two turntables and a plastic microphone, additional freestyle tricks and an expanded single-player career mode, the sequel to last year's popular rhythm game also enjoys a healthy co-sign from rapper and actor Common. ""The game is exciting, brings good music to the forefront and captures the real DJ aesthetic,"" he says in a recent interview. ""I love that two players can go head-to-head, and the freestyle aspect is really cool. ... You have a microphone you can sing into and you can scratch at your own pace. When you play it, you feel just like you're at a party."" While no substitute for actual spinning Common says it's a reasonable starting point for beginners looking to immerse themselves in DJ culture. Even more important than letting players live the dance-floor dream, he says, is that games like this can help introduce modern fans to classic artists. ""People today might not be watching as much TV or listening to music,"" he told CNN. ""But even when people aren't buzzing about a hot new track, they're still playing these games and hearing our songs. As an artist, everything you do is a brick you have to build on. Getting a song in a video game is a major stepping stone,and way to get introduced to new audiences."" A fan of classic titles like ""Pitfall,"" ""Donkey Kong Jr."" and ""Ms. Pac-Man"" before giving the controller a temporary rest, Common also says that motion-sensing video games are making former arcade enthusiasts take notice again. These so-called ""active"" games are a great way to grab people's attention, says common, adding that he's not surprised they're such high-tech sensations. ""Music games are making a comeback this year,"" he says. ""These titles are constantly improving, the music gets more exciting and more people are being attracted to them."" Part of the appeal, he says, is that they fit right into nearly any social setting, especially parties, and are as fun to watch and listen to as actively play. High-profile releases like ""DJ Hero 2"" and recent karaoke outing ""Def Jam Rapstar,"" show hip-hop finally getting some respect from game makers. ""[The genre] would've been much bigger today if we'd had games like this early on."" He says he secretly yearns to do a ""DJ Hero 2"" track with Sade -- ""You'd have to speed her up or something"" -- and says he plays the game with producer No I.D. during studio downtime. Should new album ""The Believer,"" due Spring 2011, get pushed back, you'll know why. ""No, we don't plan on any delays,"" he says with a laugh.","Game supports two turntables; plastic microphone and more freestyle tricks .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The call came over the radio. ""Shots fired."" And then, even worse: ""Officer down."" Billy Rhoads, chief of the Fort Hood Fire Department, grabbed a radio and donned his flak jacket. He jumped into his SUV and tore down the road. A dozen or so blocks away, at the Soldier Readiness Center, a gunman had opened fire on soldiers. Rhoads stepped from his truck. His department's motto is ""Protecting those who protect us."" He hoped he was not too late for that. The scene was chaotic. Wounded and dead soldiers were everywhere. ""I was listening to people hollering for help, and I was trying to get in there to see what we had,"" Rhoads recalled three days after the November 5 attack. ""I assumed that we would have maybe several victims. I had no idea, I just could not fathom what we were going to encounter."" Amid all the army uniforms, one dark blue uniform stuck out. It was Fort Hood police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, who, officials say, shot the alleged gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, to end the rampage. She suffered three gunshot wounds. ""I broke and ran over to her,"" Rhoads said. ""I got over to her and began trying to talk to her."" Rhoads and Munley had worked closely in the past. He considers her a friend. Army medics had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet on her leg. He bent down to comfort her. She was extremely weak and unable to speak loudly. ""I just kept reminding her of her daughter and that she needed to stay with us for the baby's sake,"" he said. ""She's a very tough cookie."" Munley, 34, had served in the Army herself before becoming a police officer at Fort Hood. Her husband is a staff sergeant in the Army, and their daughter is 3 years old. Munley's neighbors have said she is so tough, she stopped burglars from entering her house last year. Said Rhoads of Munley: ""The old saying that dynamite comes in small packages is very true."" Emergency personnel were flooding the scene, and helicopters were en route to evacuate the injured. Rhoads, who began as a volunteer firefighter 26 years ago when he was just a teen, took over the scene as incident commander. But first, he paused for a quick prayer. ""I just asked the Lord to be with me, to give me the strength and the courage I need to do my job wisely and keep my people safe."" Even as the first responders worked on the dozens of wounded soldiers, they weren't certain whether there were other shooters on the post. ""The thought's always there on your mind that there could be another suspect in the area,"" Rhoads said. As for Hasan, the fire chief says that discussing the shooting suspect is too emotional. ""I saw the suspect from a distance, but I never got a look at him."" Rhoads' prayers remain with the soldiers he tries to keep safe. ""It's very emotional for everybody when we lose our soldiers. But when we lose them here at home like this, it takes it to a different level."" He says the department has arranged for counselors to be available for the firefighters as they process all they have endured. They've received phone and text messages from fire and police departments all across the country, offering support and prayer. But the main thing his firefighters have relied on, he says, is each other. ""Afterward, everyone started to console each other and talk to each other. It's a brotherhood.""","Fire chief came across officer, told her she ""needed to stay"" for her daughter .

"(CNN) -- Leading figures from Poland to the United States have been paying tribute to Marek Edelman, the anti-Nazi resistance fighter and Solidarity movement supporter who died Friday. Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in World War II. Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, ""the largest, symbolically most important Jewish uprising"" against the Nazis during World War II, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Polish President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk both issued statements mourning Edelman. Tusk called him an ""exceptional man,"" saying ""his bravery was a testament to the courage of the fighters of the Jewish Fighting Organization,"" as the largest Jewish resistance movement in the ghetto was known. The prime minister also praised him for standing up against the Polish Communist government's anti-Semitic campaign of 1968, and hailed him as an example for free, democratic Poland. The U.S. State Department saluted ""his life dedicated to the defense of human dignity and freedom. The United States stands with Poland as it mourns the loss of a great man."" Edelman is thought to have been the last surviving commander of the uprising, in which Jews fought Nazi efforts to send them to concentration camps. Armed with pistols, some rifles and automatic weapons, and hand-made grenades, the resistance fighters attacked the Germans and their allies when they tried to liquidate the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1943. The Nazis had planned to round up all the ghetto's Jews in three days, but in the end it took them more than a month -- longer than some countries held out against Hitler's armies. The Nazis reduced the ghetto to rubble in the process of flushing resistance fighters out of their bunkers. Edelman was in one of the last groups to hold out in the headquarters of the Jewish Fighting Organization at 18 Mila Street. In the final days of the uprising he was able to sneak out of the ghetto by way of the city's sewers, he wrote after the war. He went on to fight in the Warsaw Polish Uprising, a two-month battle against the Nazis in 1944, undertaken primarily by non-Jewish Poles. After the war, Edelman became a cardiologist. In the late 1940s, he published a short history of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in Polish, Yiddish, and English, called ""The Ghetto Fights."" In it, he described the creation of the ghetto by the Nazis. ""In November 1940, the Germans finally established the Warsaw Ghetto. The Jewish population still living outside the 'Seuchensperrgebiet' ('Quarantined Zone') was brought inside the special area. Poles living within the designated ghetto boundaries were ordered to move out,"" he wrote. ""Beginning with November 15, no Jew was allowed to leave the Jewish precincts. All houses vacated by Jews were immediately locked by the Germans and then, with all their contents, gratuitously given to Polish merchants and hucksters ... . The walls and barbed wire surrounding the ghetto grew higher every day until, on November 15, they completely cut off the Jews from the outside world."" Hunger and disease were rife in the ghetto, he wrote. ""People began to die of hunger in the streets. Every morning, about 4-5 a.m., funeral carts collected a dozen or more corpses on the streets that had been covered with a sheet of paper and weighted down with a few rocks. Some simply fell in the streets and remained there,"" Edelman remembered. Jews organized a local government and Socialist unions, but conditions became progressively worse in the ghetto, with the Nazis summarily executing people. Nazis then began deporting Jews to concentration camps -- sometimes with the help of Jewish collaborators in the ghetto -- Edelman wrote. By that time, many in the ghetto knew the Nazis were systematically murdering Jews in the camps, he recalled. He describes in detail the spring 1943 uprising, a street-by-street battle that ended with the ghetto in ruins. Edelman's history finishes simply, listing the handful of survivors of the hundreds who fought back. ""Those who had gone over to the 'Aryan side' continued the partisan fight in the woods. The majority perished eventually. The small group that was still alive at the time took an active part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as the 'ZOB Group.' At present the following of our comrades are still among the living: Chajka Betchatowska, B. Szpigel, Chana Krysztal, Masza Glejtman, and Marek Edelman."" During the early 1980s Edelman was active with Solidarity, the Polish trade union movement that opposed the Communist government. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner awarded him the Legion of Honor in 2008, on a visit to Poland marking the 65th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Edelman was born in 1921, according to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum. He was buried in Warsaw's Jewish cemetery on Friday, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported .","Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The body of a missing sailor was recovered in the wreckage of a South Korean ship that went down in the Yellow Sea in March, Yonhap news agency reported Saturday. The ship sank mysteriously in an incident that heightened tensions between North and South Korea. South Korea is investigating what caused the ship to sink and has not ruled out a theory that North Korea was involved, but Seoul has avoided directly blaming North Korea, which denied allegations it was responsible. South Korea's Yonhap reported Saturday that authorities have lifted the remaining half of the vessel, which could help aid the investigation. The 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan sank near the western sea border with North Korea on March 26. Forty of Cheonan's 104 crewmembers have now been confirmed dead, and six more are also believed dead, though they are still listed as missing.

"(CNN)  -- Tyson Gay sent out a world championship message to Usain Bolt as he eased to victory in the 200 meters at the London Grand Prix on Saturday in a super-fast 20 seconds dead. Tyson Gay powers off the bend on his way to 200m victory in the London Grand Prix. Gay shrugged off a minor groin injury coming into the meeting to make a rapid start and had the race wrapped up as he entered the straight. He left compatriot Wallace Spearman 20 meters adrift with Ireland's Paul Hession in third. In May, reigning double world champion Gay set the fastest time in the world this year when he ran the 200m in 19.58 seconds in New York, but Bolt responded with a 19.59 seconds clocking in difficult conditions in Lausanne. Bolt showed his superlative form by winning the 100 meters on the first day of the London Grand Prix in 9.91 seconds into a strong headwind and anchored Racers TC to an easy victory in the sprint relay which rounded off the action on the second day. The Kingston-based club which included fellow Jamaicans Yohan Blake and Mario Forysth, plus Antigua's Daniel Bailey, run the fourth-best time in history, 37.46 seconds, as Bolt strode out in typical style. Bolt and Gay are set for a massive showdown for global supremacy in the world championships next month but the American admitted his injury was still a concern. ""My groin has been tight on me, I'm trying to take a little Advil (painkillers) to run through the pain,"" he told reporters. ""I've got to be tough about it. I don't feel it when I run, it's after. ""I'm just taking it one day at a time, it's just frustrating. Any time a sprinter feels any type of nagging pain they get frustrated and the mind has to get strong again. ""I didn't get to warm up like I wanted to because of the situation but I don't think about limping once the gun is shot, I just run."" In other action on Saturday, Carmelita Jeter of the United States showed she will be a contender at the world championships with a 10.92 second clocking to win the women's 100m. Double Olympic champion Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia made a successful return to the track after injury to win the women's 5,000 in 14 minutes 33.65 seconds, the fastest in the world this year.","Tyson Gay powers to 200m victory in 20 seconds dead at London Grand Prix .

"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- Evelyn Rasco started crying early Saturday morning as soon as she saw the cars carrying her daughters turn the corner. Minutes later, her voice took on a tougher tone: ""I'll tell you one thing, y'all ain't going back to the state of Mississippi. I'll tell you that. Y'all ain't going there to get a drink of water."" Her daughters, Gladys and Jamie Scott, were released from a Mississippi prison Friday after 16 years behind bars. Gov. Haley Barbour suspended their armed robbery sentences on one condition -- that one sister donate a kidney to the other. Jamie Scott, 38, is gravely ill and needs a kidney transplant, said attorney Chokwe Lumumba. Barbour said last week it ""should be scheduled with urgency."" And Jamie Scott told CNN she feared at one point that she would die in prison. The sisters were convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison for their role in a 1993 ambush in Scott County, Mississippi. Authorities accused the sisters of leading two men to a group of three teenagers, who hit them with a shotgun and took their wallets. The robbers netted between $11 and $200, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. Both sisters have maintained their innocence. After their release Friday, they told reporters they planned to continue fighting. ""The governor granted us our first step and we are grateful for that,"" Jamie Scott said, her sister next to her, nodding in agreement. ""The fight is not over until our name is cleared."" Early Saturday morning, the sisters arrived at their mother's home in Pensacola, Florida. Gladys Scott, 36, walked arm-in-arm with her mother toward the door. ""We're home, Mama, we're home,"" she said. ""You don't know how many nights I prayed for this,"" Rasco replied. Gladys Scott's 22-year-old daughter, Olivia, placed her arm around her mother's shoulder and said she was looking forward to making up for lost time. ""We're going to get her an up-to-date cell phone. We're going to show her the beach... We're going to have fun, do what we couldn't do, do what the state of Mississippi took from us,"" she said. In Florida, the sisters will be under the supervision of the Florida Department of Corrections parole office, said Suzanne Singletary, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Lumumba said Friday that Gladys Scott had not yet been tested to determine whether her kidney could be used in a transplant. ""I'm praying to God I'm a match,"" she said. ""I want her to raise her grandkids with me."" Bumper stickers on cars parked in the Rasco's driveway Saturday said ""The Scott Sisters"" -- a lingering sign of the legal fight the family says it's determined to continue. Lumumba said the sisters would seek a pardon from the state of Mississippi. ""We're not going to lay down the guns. We're going to keep fighting in order to get them totally exonerated,"" he said.","A governor suspends their sentences, saying one must donate a kidney to the other .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A military offensive to rid Pakistan's northwest of al Qaeda and Taliban fighters has killed more than 1,000 militants since it began in full force earlier this month, the country's interior ministry said Sunday. A Pakistani girl displaced by the offensive against the Taliban rests at a camp Saturday north of Islamabad. Officials also said that only 2 percent of the North West Frontier Province remains under Taliban control as a result of the operation. Both claims were difficult to verify independently. The government did not say whether the operation resulted in civilian casualties, or how many people it displaced. The United Nations said Saturday that more than a million people have been displaced as a result of the two-week-old offensive. The U.S-led coalition and NATO -- based in Afghanistan -- have long said Pakistan is not being proactive enough in battling militants who are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. Pakistan has denied the claim. But the country's military launched an intense operation to rout out militants from the area after Taliban fighters took control of a district just 60 miles from the capital, Islamabad. The control of the Buner district brought the Taliban closer to the capital of the nuclear-armed country than it had been since it mounted its insurgency.

"New York (CNN) -- Exposure to debris at Ground Zero may be linked to heart problems in police officers, according to a new study announced Saturday. The study revealed that police officers who worked at the World Trade Center site in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks had unusually high occurrences of abnormal left and right ventricular functioning, leading doctors to consider the role Ground Zero played in their diminished heart function. The study, which started in January 2008 and ended in June, was funded by the Fraternal Order of Police of New York State. The study was not intended at first to focus on the effects of Ground Zero, but rather to test the strains of the job, said Dr. Lori Croft, the study's lead investigator. Many Ground Zero workers have been reported to suffer from lung ailments after exposure to dust and debris at the site, but this is the first study that offers evidence that work at Ground Zero may lead to cardiovascular problems, said Croft of the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Once microscopic matter is inhaled, it can result in harmful scarring to the lungs and heart, said Croft. Croft said that a healthy person's heart muscle relaxes when it fills with blood. In the cases of the study participants, Croft said the heart remains somewhat stiff, which hinders blood flow and can lead to heart disease later in life. Croft tested about 1,200 police officers over an 18-month period and found that 53 percent had abnormal left ventricular functioning and 59 percent had problems with their right ventricle. This would come as little surprise if they were in their 80s, but the mean age in the group was 49, Croft said. ""If you're talking about 80-year-olds with these statistics, that's one thing,"" she said. ""But these are people in their 40s and 50s. That's unusual."" About 7 percent of 50-year-olds have this problem, Croft said. Croft said some questions remain. Law enforcement is generally a stressful occupation and police often work varying shifts and might sit in a patrol car for long periods -- all unhealthy for the heart, she said. The study, while revealing, needs to be further explored, she said. For example, testing police officers in other cities might help put the findings in context, she said.","Study finds unusually high occurrences of abnormal left and right ventricular functioning .

The study's results may not have been groundbreaking: Fewer than half of patients were fully following the recommended exercise regimen (the equivalent of brisk walking or stationary cycling for about two to three hours a week) by the end of the study, and the effect of exercise on mortality and hospitalization risk was small. But these benefits shouldn't be dismissed, given the poor quality of life many chronic heart failure patients have, says Clyde Yancy, M.D., medical director of the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute in Houston, Texas. ""Having any strategy that's reasonable, that has the potential to help even a little bit, is pretty important,"" says Yancy, who was not involved in the research. ""The real gain might be in helping our patients feel better."" About 5 million people in the United States have chronic heart failure, in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood through the body effectively. Not too long ago, bed rest was the standard treatment for these patients, who suffer from fatigue, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the legs, among other symptoms. But for the past 20 or 30 years, evidence has been trickling in to show that these patients can actually benefit from being active, says Kathryn E. Flynn, Ph.D., of Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. To get a clearer sense of the benefits (and potential risks) of exercise for heart failure patients, Flynn -- along with Christopher M. O'Connor, M.D., director of the Heart Center at Duke, as well as colleagues from several centers across the country -- randomly assigned 2,331 men and women with heart failure to one of two groups: standard medical care plus aerobic exercise training or standard care only. People in the exercise group started out with 36 supervised-exercise sessions, then were sent home with a treadmill or exercise bike and instructed to get 120 to 200 minutes of exercise a week. Within three months, Flynn and her team found, the exercisers said they felt better. ""The average difference was modest, but it happened early,"" Flynn says. ""And it persisted over time: 54 percent of the men and women in this group reported clinically meaningful improvements in their health status three months into the study, compared with 29 percent of people in the control group."" After two and a-half years, the people in the exercise group were slightly less likely to be hospitalized for any cause or for heart failure. They were also at modestly reduced risk of death from any cause, as well as death from heart failure. Unsurprisingly, exercisers also were somewhat more fit than they were at the study's outset. Health.com: What puts you at risk for high cholesterol? ""I think this study really helps to show that when you look across a lot of different people, exercise is a good thing,"" Flynn says, noting that past studies have included far fewer women and older people. Given that fewer than half of the patients in the exercise group were actually following recommendations for physical activity by the end of the study -- par for the course with behavioral-intervention trials requiring lifestyle changes -- O'Connor says he wasn't disappointed that the benefits were small. ""Really, it's quite remarkable in my opinion that we found these modest improvements,"" he adds. Health.com: Good fats vs. bad fats: Which fats are good for your heart? When O'Connor and his colleagues broke down the results based on how well people were sticking to the exercise recommendations, an analysis not published in the JAMA paper, more striking differences emerged. ""The more you did with greater intensity, the greater benefit,"" O'Connor says. It's also important, he adds, that the research was able to confirm that exercise does not carry risks for people with stable heart failure. ""It was not known that it was safe with this degree of certainty,"" O'Connor says. The question now, Yancy says, is whether insurers will decide to pay to help chronic heart failure patients exercise, given the modesty of the benefits. ""We really can't deploy this in a broad way without getting support from payers,"" he adds. ""I can't forecast which way that will go."" Health.com: How I survived a heart attack at 43 . But O'Connor is willing to hazard a guess. Because his analysis suggests that patients with the most severe heart failure benefit the most from exercise, he says, it's likely that insurers will pay for exercise training for these patients who will offer them the ""biggest bang for the buck.""

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Cell phones and TVs converging with the Internet? That's so 2008. The next big tech trend may be the marriage of computer technology to your car or truck. This spring, Ford will offer a dashboard computing system on its full-size pickups and E-series vans. This month, Hyundai is launching a system that warns motorists when they drift out of the lane they're traveling in. Another manufacturer has developed pedestrian-detection software that works with heat-seeking cameras to alert drivers when someone is in their path. In March, Ford will release a fully functional, dashboard computer -- complete with keyboard -- geared to contractors and other business folks who want to access the Web, review documents and log inventory while on the go. In the spring, AT&T will launch an in-car entertainment service with 22 satellite TV channels. Industry executives hope the new technological bells and whistles will put some sizzle back into stagnant vehicle sales. ""Consumers want a vehicle that's always on and always connected,"" said Kieran O'Sullivan, vice president at Continental Automotive Systems, which supplies parts and technology to automakers. In the near future, he said, ""consumers and carmakers will be able to customize the [dashboard] instrument panel to their individual tastes the same way that people customize their mobile phones."" O'Sullivan spoke Thursday at a panel discussion at the International Consumer Electronics Show subtitled, ""The Automobile's Convergence with Consumer Electronics."" Panelists, including executives from Microsoft, Nokia and GM's OnStar service, agreed the industry is just beginning to tap the potential of in-car computing. ""We'll someday use this information technology in ways we can't even predict today,"" said Tom Phillips, general manager of Microsoft's automotive unit. ""To me, we're in the infancy in terms of the amount of evolution that's going to occur."" As consumers are growing accustomed to having mobile Internet through their smart phones, more car buyers are seeking connectivity in their vehicles that will allow them to move seamlessly between their digital lives at work and home, panelists said. Half of the new vehicles sold in the United States are now compatible with MP3 players and 80 percent can connect with wireless Bluetooth headsets, said automotive technology expert John Waraniak, who served as the panel's moderator. iReport.com: Are you attending CES? General Motors' OnStar service, which can remotely unlock car doors, reduce gas flow to a stolen vehicle or dial 911 if a car is involved in a crash, now has almost 6 million subscribers. Toyota said this week it plans to launch a similar driver-assist program on certain models beginning this summer. Not to be outdone, Ford's similar Sync system, which now comes standard on many vehicles, is adding voice-activated, on-demand traffic, sports and weather reports, plus GPS-assisted navigation. In a keynote speech Thursday at CES, Ford CEO Alan Mulally said the automaker is learning to think more like an electronics company. Ford will begin installing its Works Solutions package on its full-size pickups and E-series vans this spring. The dashboard computing system costs $1,195 plus a monthly Web access fee, has a 6-inch touch screen and runs on Windows. It will allow electricians and other contractors to create Excel spreadsheets, print invoices and even access other computers. ""Ford is truly making the office mobile,"" said Ford product development manager Bill Frykman while demonstrating the system Thursday to reporters in an F-150 parked in a large tent outside the Las Vegas Convention Center. ""This bridges the gap between the full laptop and a smart phone."" Meanwhile, an entire hall at CES is devoted to the latest in automotive technology, from portable navigation units to rear-mounted cameras which, with the help of a dashboard screen, allow the driver to see what's immediately behind his vehicle while backing up. Here's a quick peek at some other automotive technology on display at CES this week: . -- FLIR Systems, Inc. makes a thermal-imaging camera, an option on BMW's 6-series sedans, with a new pedestrian-detection feature. When the camera detects a heat source in the shape of a human being, the on-board computer alerts the driver by highlighting the pedestrian in yellow on the dashboard screen. -- AT&T's CruiseCast service brings 22 satellite TV channels to your vehicle with the help of a small rooftop antenna, augmented by video-buffering technology that supposedly maintains the signal underneath overpasses and trees. It will cost $1,299 plus a $28 monthly fee and is being pitched to parents with kids and pre-game tailgaters. ""It's an extension of your living room,"" said Jackie Lapin, a spokeswoman for AT&T. -- Nervous about handing the car keys to your 16-year-old? The CarChip ($119) plugs into any post-1995 model vehicle and records 300 hours of how the car has been driven, including mileage, speed, braking and acceleration. Parents can remove the chip, download its data to a computer and use the information to verify driving agreements with their teens. Newer features even let parents set restrictions on their kids' driving. ""If you want to set it at a certain speed -- say, 'I don't want my kid going over 65 mph' -- it'll beep at them until they slow down,"" said Michael Copeland, sales manager for manufacturer Davis Instruments. -- Hyundai's latest vehicles can be outfitted with a system that detects when a car is drifting across lanes, then sounds a buzzer or vibrates the wheel to alert the driver. Some Hyundai vehicles also contain ultrasonic sensors that help drivers to park by measuring the distance between a car and other objects. In fact, the next generation of automotive technology may employ automatic steering and braking systems that relieve drivers of much of the responsibility for, well, driving. ""Maybe 15 years from now, cars will drive themselves. That's certainly a goal some companies have,"" said Jay James of FLIR Systems. ""It's not just 'Jetsons' stuff now. It's really starting to happen."" Some 2,700 exhibitors and 130,000 attendees are in Las Vegas, Nevada, for CES, the nation's largest consumer electronics trade show. The event runs through Sunday. The 2009 North American International Auto Show follows next week in Detroit, Michigan.","More automakers are shipping vehicles with computerized features, Web access .

"(CNN) -- Travelers heading for Mumbai were urged to postpone their journeys Thursday amid fears that foreigners could be targeted following Wednesday's terror attacks that left more than 100 people dead and two luxury hotels under siege. Indian reserve soldiers keep vigil outside the residence of the Indian Prime Minister on Thursday. In a televised statement Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the attacks had been intended to ""create a sense of panic by choosing high-profile targets and indiscriminately killing innocent foreigners."" At least six foreigners were reported dead in the attacks including Italian and British nationals. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said the situation in Mumbai remained fluid and warned those planning to travel to Mumbai to postpone their journeys for at least the next 48 to 72 hours. ""Those currently in Mumbai are asked to take shelter at their current location and contact family and friends,"" the embassy said in a statement. The U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai opened for emergency passport issuance Thursday despite the Thanksgiving holiday. ""U.S. citizens who have immediate travel plans and have lost or damaged passports can come directly to the Consulate to obtain an emergency replacement passport,"" a statement said. The UK's Foreign Office advised against ""all but essential travel to Mumbai until further notice."" ""We have said to the people of Mumbai they should avoid going out and about more than they need to for the time being. And those planning to visit Mumbai should only do so if they have essential business to do. That is roughly in line with the advice the government has given, that today is not the day to go to Mumbai,"" Richard Stagg, the British High Commissioner to London, told CNN-IBN. Read more on the international reaction . The French Embassy in New Delhi said those living in or traveling to Mumbai should be ""doubly cautious"" and warned: ""Hotels, public places (markets, railway stations, cinema halls, etc.) should be avoided and movements outside restricted to a strict minimum until fresh instructions are issued."" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade urged Australians to avoid travel to Mumbai and told those already in the city to remain in a safe location and monitor the media for information about new security risks."" Flights to and from India were largely undisrupted Thursday. A spokesman for Air India at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport told CNN the airline was maintaining a normal schedule and said there had been no cancellations or major delays. Singapore Airlines urged passengers to allow extra time for check-in because of additional security checks at the airport's perimeter. A spokeswoman for London's Heathrow Airport told CNN services were operating normally. British Airways was running a regular service to Mumbai but said customers with bookings made prior to the attacks could rebook on a different date or to an alternative Indian city at no extra cost. The Taj hotel chain, whose flagship Mumbai residence was attacked by gunmen, said it was working closely with authorities and was taking ""necessary precautions"" across all its hotels. The Oberoi hotel chain said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"" and cooperating with police and government authorities. Meanwhile Indian cricket authorities have canceled the remaining two matches of India's one-day series with England and postponed the inaugural Champions League tournament which was due to start next week. Participating teams from England and Australia had been due to fly to India on Thursday.","Travelers urged to postpone journeys to Mumbai following terror attacks .

"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- The youngest hadn't lived half a year. The oldest had lived nearly a hundred. A rescue worker Friday kisses the coffin of a child killed by this week's earthquake in central Italy. The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest. They included Antonio Loavan Ghiroceanu, who was born December 11. He would have been  6 months old on Saturday. The oldest-known victim of the quake was Evandro Testa, 96, who was born in 1913. More than 200 caskets were lined up at the funeral, draped with flowers. At least one small white coffin belonging to a child sat atop a larger coffin, a baby's pastel outfit hanging off the side. The funeral was being held outside a hangar in Coppito, a town adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter of L'Aquila. Officials elected to hold the Mass in the open air to avoid the risk of injury from falling debris. Aftershocks continue to shake the region more than four days after the earthquake, and some were even felt during Friday's funeral. All of the area's cardinals and bishops, along with 100 priests, attended the special funeral Mass. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was also there, greeting and embracing some of the thousands of mourners before the service. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone presided over the Mass as an envoy from Pope Benedict XVI, who plans to visit the region after Easter.  Watch Italy bury its dead Â» . Bertone said the funeral was a ""precious moment"" to understand the meaning of life and death. ""Everything can stop in a second -- projects, plans -- everything finishes. All that remains is love,"" he said. Watch more on funeral . Mourners, who were transported to the funeral on buses, dabbed their eyes and noses. Some stared at the ground or held each other. Few appeared focused on anything but remembering the victims. ""I feel rebirth in the heart, because below that rubble there is a will to rebuild, to start again, to plan and to dream,"" Bertone said, offering a message of hope. The towns of L'Aquila and the surrounding region, he said, ""will come back stronger, will have more courage and give life to these places with that power and strength and dignity of the soul that distinguishes them."" As well as sending Bertone to deliver his message, the pope sent holy oils to L'Aquila and a chalice with which to take Communion. Archbishop Giuseppe Molinari of L'Aquila also planned to deliver a message. The 6.3-magnitude quake Monday morning left about 30,000 people without their homes. Almost 20,000 of them are braving chilly nights in tents while about 11,000 others are staying in hotels, said Agostino Miozzo, a spokesman for the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Watch more on the aftermath . Recovering from such losses and rebuilding the city of L'Aquila will take several years, according to Miozzo. The medieval city is about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome. Berlusconi has said rebuilding will cost several billion euros. Aftershocks have heightened anxiety in the area -- including a moderate 5.6 magnitude tremor that struck the area Tuesday. ""The mood is a little bit afraid,"" said Marco Volponi of the Civil Protection agency. He was working in a tent camp, housing people whose homes were inhabitable. In the nearby village of Onna, 40 people -- more than one out of every eight residents in the town of 300 -- were killed in the earthquake. On some streets, every single home was destroyed. Anna Rita Difilice lost her son, Fabio, 20, to the quake -- the deadliest to strike Italy in decades and the first major quake in the country in seven years. She said she doesn't know what comes next for her. Her village has become populated with tents, fold-up beds and feeding stations handing out food, water and other supplies for survivors. But she said she knew one thing: she's not going anywhere. ""My son died here,"" she said. ""There is no way I'm leaving this town -- not ever.""","Italians have gathered to farewell nearly 300 earthquake victims .

"(CNN) -- Lynn Malerba has years of experience taking care of hearts -- those of her patients as a nurse, those of her community as health director and now, as chief, those of her tribe. Recently, Malerba officially accepted the leadership role of chief of the Mohegan tribe -- the tribe's first female leader in almost 300 years. Malerba, 56, holds a nursing degree and a master's degree in public administration and lives in Uncasville, Connecticut. CNN talked with her about her role, beliefs and the future of the Mohegans. Who are you? How do you define yourself? I define myself by my relationships as well as by my chosen career path. I need to know that my actions personally and professionally make a positive difference in people's lives. My name, Soqsqua Mutawi Mutahash, translated means ""Female Sachem Many Hearts"" or ""Chief Many Hearts."" It reflects my life's work: I have cared for many hearts in my past roles as critical care nurse and health and human services director for the tribe. As the new Mohegan Chief, I will care for the many hearts I know today and those I have yet to meet. It is an honor to be so connected to our ancestors and to share such a vibrant and rich culture with an extended family. It is unique and something to be celebrated. My great-grandfather, Chief Matagha, was known for the love of his culture. His name represents both ""He Who Dances"" as well as ""Brave and Faithful Soldier."" He passed that love down to all generations following him. My generation has seen a tribal chairman, a tribal chairwoman and two elected elders in service to the tribe. His example is obviously one to live up to. It is my duty to faithfully follow in his footsteps as well as the footsteps of my mother, who so carefully kept our tribal history and culture alive for my family. What is something that everyone should know about you? I love being Mohegan because it is something bigger than ourselves. We are a community that shares a very rich history that informs us as a people. It is also essential that we pass on our tribal traditions to the next generations and that we pave the way for them to live successfully in two worlds: Mohegan and the local community. We have a sense of family and roots that goes very deep, and stays with us wherever we go. Growing up in Uncasville, Connecticut, in the 1950s was a much simpler time than what we have today. We lived next door to my grandmother, two aunts lived on my street and two of my mother's cousins lived on my street. So to say we were surrounded by family is a bit of an understatement. Growing up on Mohegan Hill, you were immersed in your culture and in your greater Mohegan family in a very casual way. We visited the museum regularly, visited with our Mohegan relatives, went to Fort Shantok (which holds one of our burial grounds) for family picnics (and even swam in the little pond there) and understood our place on this earth. The thought of being chief was never in my consciousness as an aspiration. When the tribal membership was asked by the Council of Elders who they thought should be appointed chief, I exercised my right as a tribal member and wrote a letter stating who I thought should be appointed (not me) and certainly never in my wildest dreams thought I would be selected. What gets you up and going each morning? I love the fact that each day brings something new and that no two days are the same. This was true both in my career in critical care nursing as well as my role here as chairwoman and now chief of the tribe. I love being busy and working hard -- and love that there is no shortage of surprises in my day. My greatest hopes for the future of Mohegan are simple: that we always look back and are faithful to the vision of our ancestors while we protect the generations to come. We need to work to ensure that our tribal family preserves our culture, protects our lands and protects all generations of the tribe through health care, education, elder services and youth programming. What is in your pocket right now that might surprise us? I keep an arrowhead in my purse that someone had given me as a reminder of the fact that we Mohegans live in two worlds -- the modern world of commerce and business, and the ancient world of nature and tradition. What would you tell your younger self about who you are now? It is great to have a plan but not to hold on to that plan too tightly, because you might miss all the surprises and fun along the way. What do you believe in? I believe that one should try to always be a positive force in the world. It is a form of spirituality to work for the good of others. What message does this (being voted as the new Chief of the Mohegan tribe) send both to today's ""Indian Country,"" and the U.S. as a whole? My being elected as chief confirms to those outside of Indian Country, what we have known all along: Tribes are very egalitarian and women are strong advocates for their people. The word ""chief"" may conjure up a male image to many peoples' minds, but in truth women such as Ada Deer and Wilma Mankiller have also provided inspirational leadership for Indian Country -- I hope to be able to continue that kind of legacy in my work as chief.","Malerba is the tribe's first female leader in almost 300 years .

"BANGOR, Maine (CNN) -- Karen Walker has shaken half a million hands in the last few years -- at least that's her best guess. Korean War veteran Don Guptill greets a returning soldier at Bangor International Airport in Maine. She and the other 40 or so members of the Maine Troop Greeters have made it their mission to welcome every incoming and outbound flight of soldiers and Marines who use Bangor International Airport as a refueling stop. No matter what time of day or night, there will always be applause, handshakes and hugs to make the troops feel appreciated. The goal is clear: ""Greet the troops, and thank them for what they do,"" says Korean War veteran Don Guptill.  Watch the volunteers in action Â» . Guptill says he remembers coming home from that conflict and receiving no welcome at all. Guptill and other veterans, including those who served in Vietnam and World War II, were determined not to let that happen again. For those heading to Iraq or Afghanistan, the recognition is noticed and greatly appreciated, troops say. ""It makes me feel good,"" said one soldier headed out on his first deployment. ""I'm a little nervous,"" he continued, adding that the warm greeting helped ease his nerves. Another soldier, firmly shaking the hands in line, said, ""This is fantastic. These people are wonderful for coming down."" The group of volunteers first started during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and continued following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. As of October, the group has seen off 3,598 flights, 727,292 troops and 135 military dogs, according to the greeters. Besides the support of the receiving line, troops also are offered snacks and the use of a cell phone to call their loved ones, free of charge. ""All they do is put an ID card down and pick up a phone,"" says Bill Knight, who stands behind a counter giving out the phones. Cell phone carriers donate the minutes. The airport donates the room where Knight works. Once a duty-free shop, it's now decorated with flags, unit patches, pins, photos and other items given to the Maine Troop Greeters as a show of appreciation from the many units that have passed through the airport. While the firm grips of so many soldiers sometimes can make the greeters' hands a little sore, the volunteers get used to the strong handshakes. ""They used to [cause tenderness],"" Walker says, ""but not anymore."" When a handshake won't do, some military men and women will reach out and just hug the person who came by to welcome them home. Meeting the troops also tugs at the emotions of the greeters. ""It's a good feeling,"" Guptill says. ""Some days it's a tear-jerker."" After about an hour and a half on the ground, it's time for an outbound flight to take off and head to a war zone. The greeters line up again to wish the soldiers well as they head up the ramp to the plane, thanking them for their service. Guptill says if the war ended tomorrow it would be fine with them, but adds, ""We'll do this until this thing ends.""","Maine Troop Greeters welcome soldiers and Marines at Bangor International Airport .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They are the tales of two very different people. Director Danny Boyle's film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shines a stark light on poverty in India. One an amoral businessman pouring out his life story to the Chinese Premier, the other a lovelorn teenager appearing on ""Kaun Banega Crorepati,"" the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" But if their protagonists are polar opposites, both stories -- one as told in Aravind Adiga's best-selling novel ""The White Tiger,"" the other in ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the new movie from ""Trainspotting"" director Danny Boyle -- have much in common. Both are based in modern day India, both feature characters who succeed against all the odds, and both have garnered considerable critical acclaim, with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" recently awarded the three top prizes at the British Independent Film Awards. ""Slumdog,"" which is set in Mumbai, has also assumed a particularly poignant resonance in light of the recent terror attacks that left 174 people dead. Above all, both narratives shine a stark light on poverty -- an aspect of Indian society that has increasingly been pushed into the background by a decade and more of upbeat headlines about the country's dramatic economic growth. ""The growth aspect has tended to receive much more attention than the darker side of the Indian story,"" Professor Babu Mathew, Country Director of Action Aid India, told CNN, ""More and more the poverty goes unnoticed, and there is less and less of a voice for the excluded peoples."" The breadth of the divide between what Aravind Adiga calls the ""India of Light,"" and the ""India of Darkness,"" is both dramatic and shocking. Since 1991 when ""neo-liberal"" market reforms were introduced, India's economy has ballooned. From 1991 to 2004, the world's largest democracy grew at 6.5 percent annually, a figure which increased to over 9 percent between 2005 and 2007. The result has been a massive explosion of wealth creation among the middle and upper echelons of Indian society, with Indian billionaires now occupying four of the top eight slots on the annual Forbes rich list. While growth has benefited one section of society, it has left a vast swathe of the population lagging far behind. ""People in urban areas, the rich, the middle classes, the educated -- all of these have benefited from economic growth,"" Dr Arun Kumar of Development Alternatives Group, a sustainable development organization based in Delhi, told CNN, ""Those who have not benefited are the small farmers, the rural poor, the artisans -- for these their situation has worsened."" Nisha Agrawal, CEO of Oxfam India, agrees. ""Economic growth has been primarily focused on manufacturing and services and largely in urban areas,"" she told CNN, ""Rural agriculture has not received the kind of attention it deserves. And since the bulk of poor people derive their incomes from agriculture, that has left us with two Indias, one rich, one impoverished."" Even a cursory glance at the statistics reveals a problem on a huge scale. According to World Bank estimates, 456 million people -- just over 40 percent of India's population of 1.2 billion -- now live on less than $1.25 per day, a sum recognized as the international poverty line. Almost half of India's children are malnourished; 1000 die every day from diarrhea; hundreds of millions have no access to proper sanitation. These figures provide a grim counterpoint to the glitzy high-rises and designer shopping malls that have sprung up throughout the country's major cities. How to narrow this gulf between the haves and the have-nots is a fiendishly complex issue and one that has no quick or easy solutions. More investment in basic infrastructure is seen as crucial, as is a reform of international trade agreements. ""Import and energy prices have increased for farmers, but global markets are not opening up for Indian agricultural products,"" Agrawal told CNN, ""That needs to change."" Greater access to institutional finance, the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities, and the spread of information technology all have a major role to play. ""We already have small pockets of improvement,"" says Arun Kumar, ""But these involve limited numbers in limited geographies. ""We need to scale everything up. It is a huge challenge."" The global economic problems have not bypassed India. Inflation is now running close to 12 percent and the Mumbai Stock Exchange has almost halved in value from a peak in January 2008. Sensex -- the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index -- has not registered any significant drop as a result of the recent Mumbai attacks, and it remains to be seen what the longer term effect will be on the Indian economy. Nonetheless, these difficult and uncertain times may make the challenge of poverty reduction an even harder one. Will India be able to successfully reduce the gap between rich and poor? Leave your comments in the SoundOff box below . Both Kumar and Agrawal remain hopeful that change is coming to India, albeit slowly. ""We are eternal optimists,"" says Kumar, ""I do believe things are changing."" ""The government recognizes that people don't just want a high level of growth,"" adds Agrawal, ""But also growth that is more equalizing. We need to bring the two Indias together, and I believe we can do it."" Despite their optimism, the problems remain vast, and the darkness intense. For the foreseeable future it seems likely the question most on the minds of India's 456 million poor will be less ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" than ""Will I be able to feed myself and my family today?""","Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shines a light on slum-dwellers in India .

"(CNN) -- Rivers are the arteries of our infrastructure. Flowing from highlands to the sea, they breathe life into ecosystems and communities. A levee breach in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River System could have dire effects, a new report says. But many rivers in the United States are in trouble. Rivers in Alaska, California and the South are among the 10 most endangered, according to a report released Tuesday by American Rivers, a leading river conservation group. The annual report uses data from thousands of rivers groups, local governments, environmental organizations and citizen watchdogs to identify waterways under imminent threat by dams, industry or development.  ""Our nation is at a transformational moment when it comes to rivers and clean water,"" said Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers. ""Water is life, yet our nation's water infrastructure is so outdated that our clean drinking water, flood protection and river health face unprecedented threats."" American Rivers has released its annual endangered rivers report since 1986. The report is not a list of the nation's most polluted waterways, but highlights 10 rivers facing decisions in the coming year that could determine their future. Here is American Rivers' Most Endangered Rivers list for 2009: . 1) Sacramento-San Joaquin River System . Location: California . Outdated water and flood management puts California's largest watershed at the top of America's most endangered rivers list for 2009. A recent breach in the delta's 1,100-mile levee system could have dire effects on surrounding ecosystems, farming and agriculture, commercial fishing and California's civil infrastructure. State and federal authorities are looking at alternative water-management strategies for the river system, which serves 25 million Californians and more than 5 million acres of farmland. 2) Flint River . Location: Georgia . The Flint is one of 40 rivers nationwide that still flow undammed for more than 200 miles. Conservationists say that dams proposed by Georgia lawmakers would bury more than 50 river miles, destroy fishing and boating opportunities and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The American Rivers group believes that fixing the state's leaky pipes, using water meters and minimizing water waste would be a cheaper and more cost-effective alternative. 3) Lower Snake River . Location: Idaho, Washington, Oregon . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built four dams to irrigate and generate energy for the Northwest, but these dams also prevent salmon and steelhead trout from reaching their spawning areas. Every year, those dams kill as many as 90 percent of juvenile salmon and steelhead trout that migrate downstream to the ocean. Conservationists say that removing the dams would eliminate a growing flood threat in Lewiston, Idaho, and create an opportunity to modernize the region's transportation and energy systems. 4) Mattawoman Creek . Location: Maryland . A highway development project here jeopardizes one of the Chesapeake Bay's few remaining healthy streams. The project threatens clean water sources, thousands of acres of forests and wetlands, and an internationally-renowned, multimillion-dollar largemouth bass fishery. 5) North Fork of the Flathead River . Location: Montana . A proposed coal-mining project across the Canadian border puts Montana's North Fork of the Flathead River in jeopardy. An estimated 50,000 acres of the Flathead headwaters could be transformed into an industrial gas field. The projects threaten the river's clean water, local agriculture, fish and wildlife and recreational industries such as rafting, camping, fishing and boating. American Rivers and its partners have called on local Canadian governments and the U.S. State Department to work together to halt these projects. 6) Saluda River . Location: South Carolina . Excess levels of sewage waste threaten the drinking water of more than 500,000 South Carolina residents, conservationists say. Sewage in the river increases phosphorous and algae levels, depletes oxygen, and kills fish and other aquatic life. American Rivers is asking the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control to improve sewage-treatment standards and ensure the river reduces its phosphorous levels by 25 to 50 percent. 7) Laurel Hill Creek . Location: Pennsylvania . Known for its fishing, swimming and kayaking, this popular vacation spot faces threats from a bottling plant and tourism-related development. Without adequate planning and safeguards, withdrawals will continue to exceed the creek's reasonable capacity, putting recreation, the local water supply, and fish and wildlife in jeopardy. 8) Beaver Creek . Location: Alaska . One of the nation's last wild rivers faces extinction if an oil- and gas-development project constructs 600 miles of roads and pipelines, airstrips, drilling pads, and gravel mines along the creek. Alaska native communities depend on the area for subsistence hunting and fishing. It's also a popular destination for anglers, boaters, skiers and hunters. 9) Pascagoula River . Location: Mississippi . The U.S. Department of Energy wants to hollow out natural salt domes 30 miles northwest of the Pascagoula to create a storage area for up to 160 million barrels of oil. A pipeline 330 miles in length would be constructed to withdraw water from the Pascagoula to dissolve the salt domes and distribute oil to and from the site. The DOE predicts 18 oil spills and 75 spills of salty, polluted water during the construction and initial fill of the hollowed domes, damaging rivers, streams, and wetlands in the basin, conservationists say. 10) Lower St. Croix National Scenic Riverway . Location: Minnesota, Wisconsin . Rezoning of a 26-mile stretch of the river's state-protected section would allow for the construction of a major development on the riverfront. American Rivers believes the development could lead to land erosion along the river and more storm run-off while harming the region's biodiversity. ""Being named as one of America's most endangered rivers is not an end for the river, but rather a beginning,"" said Wodder. Through the collaborative efforts of citizens and local, state and national governments, a number of waterways from past American Rivers' endangered lists have been preserved. ""With the listing comes a national spotlight and action from thousands of citizens across the country,"" Wodder said. ""These 10 rivers have a chance to be reborn and to serve as models for other rivers all across America.""","Report: Rivers in Alaska, California and Georgia are among the 10 most endangered .

"Editor's note: CNN agreed not to use the full names of the family members in this article due to concern for their safety. Youssif, now in an apartment in Los Angeles, will need months of treatment. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Youssif, the 5-year-old Iraqi boy who was savagely burned by masked men, arrived in the United States late Tuesday with his family -- the first step toward his lengthy rehabilitation. For a family whose lives were tortured by the random and brutal violence of Iraq, the sheer magnitude of stepping onto American soil was surreal. His parents were rendered speechless. Quite simply they grinned from ear to ear. They didn't need to speak. The joy on their faces was palpable. They had traveled more than 7,500 miles to get help for their son, from war-torn central Baghdad to coastal Los Angeles. It marked the first time the family had ever left their homeland, let alone flown on a plane. ""Oh my God, it's so green. Am I in heaven?"" Youssif's mother, Zainab, said after arriving in Chicago before the family flew on to Los Angeles where Youssif will be treated. ""I feel like I'm in a dream,"" said his father, whom CNN has agreed not to name. ""Someone needs to pinch me.""  Watch Youssif's doctor's prognosis for the burned boy Â» . The family left Amman, Jordan, early Tuesday en route to the United States. The night before they departed, Youssif didn't sleep a wink. He woke the family up extra early, shouting, ""Let's go! Let's go!"" Youssif, his parents and his infant sister, Ayaa, finished their 24-hour journey in Los Angeles around 11 p.m. PT Tuesday. They were greeted by members of the Children's Burn Foundation, the nonprofit organization that paid for the family's travel and is covering all of Youssif's medical bills. Youssif playfully fought with his father over the luggage cart in Los Angeles International Airport. ""I want to push it. I want to push it,"" he said gleefully. The family was then whisked away to the two-bedroom, two-bath apartment where they will be staying during Youssif's treatment. It's a stark contrast to their humble one-room home in a rundown central Baghdad neighborhood rife with violence. There was a television, toys everywhere, and a balcony. A crib sat in the kids' bedroom and the kitchen even had a high-chair so that Youssif's sister would be able to eat with them at the table. For the first time in a long time, the family laughed out of pure joy.  See Youssif play with his new toys Â» . When Youssif walked into the new home, he glanced at the plush wall-to-wall carpet and ordered everyone to take their shoes off. Don't get it dirty, he said. His mother opened a door in the master bedroom and marveled at the walk-in closet. ""Is this a bedroom? It can't be a closet,"" she said. Standing on the apartment's balcony, Youssif's father turned to Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. ""You see America on television, but you never imagine or dream that you will ever be here."" He paused, tears in his eyes. ""It's more than paradise."" This is the same father who walked the streets of Baghdad seeking help for his boy. He went to the Health Ministry and even wrote letters to the Iraqi parliament and the prime minister's office for help. No one would listen. Desperate, he turned to CNN. ""Look at what these monsters did to my boy,"" he said. Watch how Youssif was transformed from a smiling boy to a disfigured victim . CNN and CNN.com first reported his story on August 22 after the family risked their lives to tell his story: On January 15, masked men grabbed Youssif outside his home, doused him with gas and set him on fire. The story prompted an outpouring of support to get help for Youssif. More than 12,000 CNN.com users have contributed to a fund set up by the Children's Burn Foundation. In recent weeks, the foundation worked feverishly with the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to secure the necessary paperwork for the family's travel to the United States -- something that typically takes months, if not years, to do. Youssif and his family are expected to be in the United States for six months to a year while he undergoes multiple surgeries and extensive rehabilitation. They are to meet with Dr. Peter Grossman, the plastic surgeon who will perform the operations, Wednesday afternoon. Grossman works for the nearby Grossman Burn Center and is donating his services to Youssif's cause. On this day, the family was simply ecstatic to have finally made it here. They arrived on September 11 -- the date the United States will always remember as a day of unspeakable horror. But for this family, 9/11 will always mean something much different: Hope and a better future for their son -- and a newfound love for America. ""This is a moment that will stay with us forever,"" Youssif's dad said. Friedman smiled broadly and said, ""For us too.""

"(CNN) -- As the swine flu outbreak escalates across the globe, U.S. travelers returning from Mexico are wondering what to do when they come home. Travelers leaving a Mexican airport fill out questionnaires about their health. On Wednesday, Christine Kovar of San Francisco, California, returned from a vacation to Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico. She said she wasn't sure whether she should attend work or stay home. ""I feel fine,"" said Kovar. ""It will be the discretion of my boss whether I go back to work."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising U.S. travelers back from Mexico with at least two of the swine flu symptoms to stay at home and avoid public places upon return. Symptoms of swine flu, also known as 2009 N1H1, can include a fever, sore throat, cough, chills, headaches and runny nose. People with symptoms should report to a health care provider or local health department and provide itinerary details and symptoms, according to the CDC. If infected, the swine flu is contagious for up to seven days. People who aren't sick should continue to work and use normal precautions like washing hands, according to the CDC. They should monitor their health for seven days. ""As long as they aren't presenting any flu-like symptoms, there is no reason why they can't continue to do things that they normally would,"" said Llelwyn Grant, a spokesman for the CDC. Meanwhile, the death toll from swine flu continues to climb. On Thursday, the World Health Organization reported 236 cases of swine flu worldwide. In the United States, the CDC said it confirmed 109 cases of swine flu, or 2009 H1N1, in 11 states, an increase of 18 from its previous total. On Wednesday, the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 5 on a six-step scale . These numbers are causing alarm among the public, as schools and businesses try to contain the disease and protect the health of others. Some companies are erring on the side of safety, telling employees who returned from Mexico to stay at home for a few days. One university in Pennsylvania barred nearly two dozen students back from Mexico from attending graduation. More than 100 schools across the country have shut down. Greenville County School District in South Carolina shut down on Thursday to clean the buildings and busses when 18 students reported flu-like symptoms after a band trip to Disney World in Florida. School officials are awaiting the test results of the children. ""We are being proactive and trying to take [the] right precautions,"" said Oby Lyles, spokesman for the Greenville County School District. Several state health departments such as the New York, where there are 50 confirmed cases, and Kansas, where there are two confirmed cases, said they haven't made state-level advisories yet on whether travelers from Mexico who feel healthy should attend work or not. If travelers are feeling sick, the state departments said travelers should follow CDC guidelines and stay at home. ""If you aren't sick, make sure you are practicing the common sense precautions,"" said a spokesman at the New York State Department of Health. ""Wash your hands. Cover your mouth when you sneeze."" In addition to advising ill U.S. travelers returning from Mexico to stay confined, government officials are turning to the travel industry for help, particularly air travel. The CDC is advising airline crew members who have arrived from domestic and international areas affected by the swine flu to be on the lookout for ill passengers. Airlines have been advised to stock the planes with gloves and face masks in case of an emergency. The CDC said airline crew members need to ask passengers who appear sick to be quarantined at one of the CDC's 20 locations across the country. It's been smooth sailing at U.S. airports, several passengers say. There have been no nationwide questionnaires being issued at the airports, according to a spokeswoman at U.S. Customs and Border Protection yet. In contrast, at some Mexican airports, travelers are asked to fill out forms asking about his or her health, passengers interviewed say. Still, travelers will find warnings about swine flu all over the airport. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, travel warnings about the flu are being distributed. Signs informing passengers about swine flu, particularly in the international terminal, are posted. As of Friday, the CDC was recommending U.S. travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico.","Travelers with flu-like symptoms coming back from Mexico should stay at home .

"(CNN)  -- Trying to answer the question ""Who am I?"" is a tricky undertaking. I tend to despise labels, but it's probably helpful to have some idea of who you perceive yourself to be and how others perceive you. It seems logical that you can examine this question from many angles: where you fit in statistically, physically, economically, spiritually, geographically, educationally and in so many other ways. When I was a boy, my Cal Tech-educated father, an engineer and lawyer, used to tell me I was made up of nine dollars and 73 cents worth of chemicals and minerals. I'm fairly certain he was joking, but I think he was also trying to get me to consider the duality of humans, as both significant and insignificant. He certainly caused me to ponder who and what I am. I grew up in many regions of the United States, and I'm a member of that particular ""baby boomer"" generation that came of age in the 1960s, so many things define me. I'm still guilty of believing that ""Love is all you need,"" although I usually keep that to myself. Without pretending to be all-encompassing, a few things pop to the front of my mind when I consider who I am. I'm a human being, a presumably sentient being, living in the 21st century. I'm one of the fortunate who lives in the United States with good health and health care, a great job, a close family, good friends and, thanks to my wife, a beautiful home. As a citizen of this country, I'm also a taxpayer, a consumer of many things and, I hope, someone who gives back something and isn't too voracious in his consumption. I love my job acting on a TV show, and I value the people I work with. I'm an imperfect but fairly responsive husband, father, brother, cousin, nephew, friend, co-worker and acquaintance. I'm also a survivor and a person with a disability. I became disabled in 1978 when I lost both legs in a freeway accident. An 18-wheeler truck hit me, and my car's gas tank blew up, leaving me burned over 60 percent of my body. I spent several months in a hospital and learned to walk on two prosthetic limbs. I've gone on to success in my career in radio and as an actor and musician. I used to hate the word ""disability,"" but I've come to embrace the fact that I'm one of more than 58 million Americans with some kind of physical or learning disability. As anyone who's been there will attest, it's difficult at first to be ""different,"" whatever that means to you. Discrimination is usually directed at people who are seen as the ""other."" I've experienced that in my life, but not to an overwhelming degree. Working my way through my career and my life has been challenging but interesting. The obstacles I've faced have helped to shape me and make me who I am today. Along with my parents and teachers, my experience with disability has been a great learning tool. It's helped me to begin to answer the question ""Who am I?"" So, at the risk of sounding self-absorbed, I'm Robert David Hall, Caucasian male, early 60s, pretty strong for my age, of Irish-Welsh-Scots heritage, proud of my grandfather, Robert A. Hall, Naval Academy, class of 1912; my father, Robert F. Hall, very smart man and decorated WWII naval officer; my mother, Mary Martha Davies, mother of five who encouraged me in the arts and died at 47;  and almost all my relatives. I'm college educated (UCLA), a decent guitar player and songwriter, a pretty fair actor, an AK/BK double leg amputee and a guy who values his friends. I hope to use my remaining days being creative with acting and music, traveling and helping to create more opportunities for people with disabilities. All that aside, my greatest joy in life -- my ""who I am"" constant -- is being the father of Andrew and the husband of Judy.","Robert David Hall hates to admit it, but he still believes that ""Love is all you need""

"(CNN)  -- As a child, I looked forward to nothing more than the dazzling Fourth of July laser and fireworks show in Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, Georgia. It was family tradition to eat a hearty meal at an Indian restaurant and then watch the show on the crowded lawn of the park. One year, as I struggled to eat my melting ice cream, a man sitting near us taunted, ""What planet are y'all from?"" I observed my family, attired in their extravagant Indian clothes and scarves from the restaurant party. For the first time, I wondered if we really did not belong in America, celebrating its Independence Day. I usually hear the friendly version of this question. When my parents are asked, ""Where are you from?"" and answer ""Georgia,"" it is not surprising to hear the follow-up, ""I mean where are you from?"" after which they will understandingly answer ""originally from India."" But when the latter question is posed to me, I can only shrug helplessly and repeat, ""Georgia."" I used to wonder if I was being facetious in offering such a simple answer, but I honestly don't know what else to say. The same is true when I'm occasionally told to ""go back where I came from."" I don't just brush these comments aside, as many immigrants to America bravely do, but really question my identity by asking myself: Where would I possibly call home except Georgia, where I was born and raised, or Massachusetts, where I have been educated? To put it in perspective, if all of us ""went back to where we came from,"" meaning the places of our family origin, there would be nobody in America except for Native Americans, and the rest of us would be in a predicament. The popularized ""clash of civilizations"" thesis would suggest that racial and especially religious elements of my background conflict with my identity as an American. Many people genuinely believe that you have to fit a certain racial and religious archetype to be a ""real American."" I am a Muslim and I am an American. My religion teaches me to treat others with dignity and respect, speak the truth, and accept one God as my creator and sustainer. A religious loyalty to God certainly doesn't make anyone less of an American, or three of the largest religions in the United States would not belong here. But sometimes, people assume that Muslims must also have a specific loyalty to another country that precludes their patriotism to America. Contrary to this misconception, there is no such concept in Islam. A fair study of Islamic and American values would find corroboration, not contradiction. While the 2010 U.S. Census will not ask for my religion, it will ask for my racial background. When my parents came decades ago, they were alternately identified as ""Asian"" and even ""Caucasian,"" since according to United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, South Asians are Caucasian, although not white like Europeans and Middle Easterners. They were surprised that color was a determinant of their ethnic categorization. Racial classification has become clearer since then, and I will choose the ""Asian Indian"" option on the Census, an element of my identity that influences my love for rich South Asian food, clothes and literary traditions. But I would be a stranger in my parents' birthplace of India. Ironically, it took my being an alien in foreign lands to realize just how American I was. In Britain I was told, ""Nafees, you want to see everything, just like an American."" Turks discovered that my odd habit of drinking cold tea came from my Georgia origins. The Dutch guessed I was American based on the way I ""carried myself."" I couldn't erase my apparently nasal American accent from my French in Paris.  Indians tell me only an American can justify four years of liberal arts, as opposed to vocational, education. Of course, some comments were based on foreign exaggerations of what ""American"" means, and some I still don't really understand. But obviously, America has shaped who I am. What was even more significant was that the speakers never saw my religion or ethnic origin in tension with my nationality. Neither do I. There are three important dimensions in my life -- my religion, my ethnicity and my country -- and they are all at peace.","Nafees Syed and family at July 4th fireworks when a man said, ""What planet are y'all from?""

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar will retire from football at the end of the season, he announced Thursday. The 40-year-old former Dutch international has been at Old Trafford since 2005, winning three English Premier League titles and helping them to their Champions League triumph in 2008. Van der Sar began his professional career with Ajax Amsterdam, helping them to the Champions League in 1995. He subsequently had a spell in Italy with Juventus before joining United's fellow Premier League side Fulham. ""It's been coming for a while,"" van der Sar told the official Manchester United website. ""After playing for so many years, you reach a point where you have to make a decision. ""There are a couple of things to consider -- whether you still have an appetite for it, your family. Van der Sar's wife Annemarie collapsed with a brain haemorrhage in December 2009 and he admitted that retirement had been ""playing on my mind"" since that health scare. Van der Sar, whose brilliant save from Nicolas Anelka clinched their penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final in Moscow, has remained in fine form during United's unbeaten start to the season. But he said he wanted to out out at the top. ""You can't play Superman into your 40s,"" he added. ""It's a mutual decision (with manager Alex Ferguson) that this season was the last. When I first came here I was just happy to sign a two-year contract. ""I wanted to win the league before I retired. I was lucky to achieve a little bit more than that.""

"(CNN)  -- It was April 1975 when I was packed into a military transport plane with two of my siblings as the Vietnam War ended. We left Vietnam to escape communist rule and eventually, take on an additional identity. I was 8 years old, and  being separated from both parents for the first time in my life was confusing and scary. My mother decided to stay behind with my five remaining siblings to wait for my father to return. An officer in the South Vietnam Army fighting alongside the Americans during the Vietnam War, my father spent the next seven years in the communist prisons, which were euphemistically called ""re-education camps."" It was many years later when our family was reunited. The challenges I faced growing up were probably not that different from the struggles all other immigrants face when they first arrive in the United States. I suppose most immigrants, regardless of origin, would have to deal with obstacles such as the language barrier and unfamiliar customs. I vividly remember small things like missing rice as the staple in my diet and bigger challenges, including loneliness and the sense of being displaced. I never imagined that one day I would think nothing of ordering gumbo or eating burritos, much less have a career in politics as the U.S. congressman representing the 2nd District of Louisiana. Like most immigrants, my siblings and I learned to assimilate into this big melting pot called the United States of America. We worked hard on our studies and in our businesses. Along with other Vietnamese immigrants and refugees of the time, stories of successes and heartbreaks quickly spread around the community. Although the academic achievements of Vietnamese students in schools were touted in the media, we also agonized over the horrific news about the plights of the Vietnamese boat people. Facing persecution and hardship in the old country, Vietnamese refugees braved the perilous seas aboard small fishing boats to seek freedom. Many lost their lives to piracy, storm and starvation. The lucky ones who were able to land somewhere would face cold rejections by a world grown tired of having to deal with refugee problems. The boat people saga continued well into the 1990s. I volunteered with Boat People SOS, a national organization that advocates for the refugees. My experience with them shaped my path in the years to come. After graduating from Baylor University with a bachelor's degree in physics, I joined the Jesuits for the priesthood. After working with some of the poorest communities in Third World countries, I decided that politics would bring about quicker changes for the less fortunate among us. I studied to be a lawyer, and while working as an immigration lawyer in New Orleans, Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina changed my life. The storm destroyed my home and office. Like many in my Vietnamese-American community in New Orleans, I came back to pick up the pieces after the storm. Facing one obstacle after another, we fought as a community to rebuild our homes and lives. During our efforts to close a landfill the city and state had opened right next to our community, Rep. Mike Honda came to hear our complaint and did not find anyone from within the community in public office to advocate for ourselves. He asked: ""Who among you wants to run?"" I raised my hand and began a new course as a public servant. It has been 35 years since the first wave of Vietnamese refugees landed on American soil. Now things like Pho and spring rolls have joined the Americana mainstream. I no longer see myself as a displaced stranger; I am a Vietnamese-American.","Ahn ""Joseph"" Cao left Vietnam at 8 in a military transport plane at war's end .

"(CNN) -- His father's death certificate, long-lost relatives and a town possibly named after an ancestor are just a few of the details John William Harris found as he researched his family tree. Harris, 62, a sales executive and consultant from Atlanta, Georgia, had always hoped to learn more about his family, including his father, John Henry Harris, whom he said was murdered by another man when he was 5 years old. ""The man who killed my father was never tried in a court of law. In small-town Gainesville, Georgia, in 1953, such a crime -- black on black -- was not considered important and often went unpunished,"" said Harris. Lt. Stephanie Gilbert of Hall County Sheriff's Department said there's no file telling exactly what happened, because records from that period were burned by a former sheriff. Gainesville police said they did not have records from that time, either. His death certificate indicates Harris died from complications after a stab wound. ""I had long put the lack of knowledge of his murder behind me,"" said Harris. ""This revelation about the lost records only rekindles the old feelings and my desire to know the truth of what happened."" Harris' journey to learn more about his father's life and death and his family background took him to the internet and into U.S. census records and other online websites. Harris grew up with his mother's family on Race Street in Gainesville (the family called it the ""Big House"") and heard a lot about their history. But Harris said his family hid most information about his father's death in order to protect him and they did not have a lot of recorded information about that side of his family tree. However, Harris said he was inspired to learn more about his past after recently watching the PBS special ""African American Lives."" ""After seeing what was possible and how fulfilling it was for those who discovered their backgrounds, I felt both encouraged and a little guilty I hadn't made the effort before,"" said Harris. Harris is one of millions of Americans interested in learning and researching details about family origins. A Harris Interactive poll (no relation to John Harris) found 87 percent of Americans want to know more about their family background. For his search into his father's side of the family, Harris didn't have much information to work with when he started  -- only his father's and grandmothers' names. When Harris began, he found it difficult to focus on his career or even eat and sleep. ""I was so engaged about learning information about my history and spent many hours researching it online. My wife joked that I spent more time on the computer than I did with her or at my job,"" Harris said with a chuckle. ""Researching family history is not hard, but it takes work being a detective,"" said Harris. ""The computer, the internet and the accumulation of databases that never existed before make it easier to get started right in your own home."" Many subscription websites allow you to access databases for a fee and it's a big business. For instance, ancestry.com says it has more than 1 million paying subscribers and has the largest collection of records on the internet. Subscribers can pay as little as $12.95 a month for access to some records. Higher fees provide greater access. Some of the other fee-based sites are onegreatfamily.com, worldvitalrecords.com and footnote.com. Familysearch.org is maintained by the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). This site is free. It is organized by volunteers, so there is no hidden cost to join or access the vast database. LDS said it has about 50,000 hits a day on its site. Microfilm copies of original U.S. census records from 1790 through 1930 are available for research at the National Archives in Washington and its 13 regional archives. Many libraries and courthouses also store tax and property records and other documents that might help trace people through history. For Harris, his first big discovery was an unknown uncle, Ebbie Harris, listed in a 1920 census record. Harris learned his father's brother had died as a schoolboy. ""I was shocked he ever existed,"" said Harris. Harris also said he discovered at least 50 relatives he didn't know about while using census reports from 1900 to 1930 on Gainesville, Georgia. ""It was exciting to see the names of all of my family."" The census records opened his eyes to how big his family was. Harris was amused by some of the details revealed by the records. ""I learned my grandfather Wade Harris was 69 years old and married to my grandmother, who was only 31 when the census was taken in 1920. I was amazed at their age difference,"" Harris said with a chuckle. Harris didn't find out a lot of new details about his father beyond the year of his birth and the exact date of his death. ""It was thrilling to see confirmation of his date of death. Though the details were minute, the joy of discovery was overwhelming for me,"" Harris said. For Harris, researching his past has been a roller-coaster ride of many emotions, but he was glad to be on the journey. One of his greatest highs was when he discovered the town of Chamblee, Georgia, may have been named after his great-great grandfather.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran said Wednesday it is investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week's disputed election. The aftermath of anti-riot police actions at Tehran University shows smashed computer terminals. Tehran University students told a CNN iReporter that government forces staged a massive crackdown early Monday at the university's dorm. Some students were detained in the raid. Students jumped out of windows to escape the Iranian police forces who threw tear gas and beat students, according to the iReporter, a former Tehran University student who now lives outside Iran. He did not want to be identified for security reasons. CNN has been unable to confirm the account because of restrictions on international media in Tehran. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani on Wednesday called for an ""unbiased report"" by the team of lawmakers appointed to look into the ""unfortunate incidents"" at the university dorm, according to Iran's government-funded Press TV. ""There has been news of unfortunate incidents taking place in parts of the city such as the Tehran University dormitory, and it appears that hidden hands are at work to feed foreign media outlets with propaganda,"" Larijani said. The investigating lawmakers have spoken to Tehran University students and other officials and are demanding the release of the detained students, Press TV reported. The lawmakers are also calling for the arrest and punishment of those who perpetrated the violence and for students to be compensated for their loss, according to Press TV. The CNN iReporter said one Tehran University student e-mailed him as the assault on the dormitory happened between 1 and 5 a.m. Monday. ""So around 4 a.m., he sends this very frightening e-mail. He says, 'Right now Ansaar [pro-government] forces are outside of buildings and threatening students to, 'Get out of the rooms like good boys.' Thank God the night is going to be over soon. Please pray for us!'"" the iReporter told CNN. A couple hours later, the student wrote, ""Some students jumped out of windows to save themselves and got injured, but the shameless forces even beat and arrested those too. ... Some of the arrested students are released after more beating and interrogation, others are missing."" The iReporter said he believes Iranian students have ""a very important role"" in Iranian politics, but noted that the current protests in Iran are more than just a student movement. ""At least the perspective that those forces have is that the students are at the leadership of this movement,"" he said. ""This might or might not be true especially right now because all the people are involved in this protest and it's not only students. They have a very important role here."" There have been reports of crackdowns on other Iranian universities. Amateur video posted on YouTube showed several injured people identified as Isfahan University students. Amnesty International said it appeared students were also targeted at Tabriz University in northwestern Iran when security forces entered dormitories there and detained 10 students. Amnesty also reported similar crackdowns on university students in the cities of Shiraz, Mashhad and Zahedan. The human rights agency called on Iranian authorities to ""end attacks on students.""

"(CNN) -- As the mug shots of the alleged killers of NFL star Sean Taylor were shown on television, I kept wondering when we were going to see their parents step forward. I saw a couple of mothers, but their dads were missing in action. Roland Martin credits two strong parents with raising him to do right by them. Dads matter, and it's ridiculous for us to act as if all it takes is a loving mom. Now, I don't know what it means not to have a father in your life. I'm not familiar with a mom being strung out on a crack binge. And when my parents were called to the school when there was a discipline problem, Mom and Dad didn't go off on the teacher or principal. In fact, I can still feel the pain of my elementary school principal's paddle being applied to my butt when I acted a fool. The principal could only pop me three times. Dad? He had no limit. Bottom line: I can sit here today and celebrate them and enjoy a wonderful life because my parents were hell-bent on raising their children to do right by them, especially my dad. We can spend all day talking about the ills afflicting urban America -- and there are plenty that are institutional -- but the decaying value of life in inner cities clearly can be traced to the exodus of fathers from the lives of so many young men. Excuses often are tossed about as to why black men leave their children (and their children's moms) to fend for themselves. But a lot of them are just sorry and refuse to accept the responsibility that comes with raising a child. A lot of my colleagues will suggest it's too simplistic to assign such a high value to a dad being in the life of a child. But just take a visit to your local jail, juvenile hall or state prison. You likely will be confronted with a sea of black men -- strong, able-bodied, creative and restless -- who have spent or will spend years and years with a prison number identifying who they are. According to the U.S. Justice Department, of all the black men in the U.S. between the ages of 25 and 29 in 2002, 10.4 percent were incarcerated. Hispanic and white men? Just 2.4 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. If a poll were done on how many grew up without fathers, I can guarantee you the numbers would be staggering. The rampant poverty that exists has led many young blacks to a life of crime, choosing to sell drugs and involve themselves in gangs as opposed to focusing on education as a way out of the cellar of life. But you see, when nearly 70 percent of black kids are born to unmarried parents, likely to a too-young mom, that puts tremendous pressure on grandmothers (and some grandfathers), sisters and brothers to take up the slack. But if the person who impregnated that woman were on the scene, not only helping to pay for the raising of the child but also serving as a strong influence, I just don't believe we would see such a chronic condition. And the black men who have done their job are scared to death about what the tendency for black men to leave relationships means for their daughters. The day before leaving for vacation, I got word that a good friend, Chicago attorney Reynaldo Glover, had died of pancreatic cancer. He was 64. In our last extensive conversation before he was diagnosed in July, Reynaldo pleaded with me to use my national media stage to be a voice to sound the alarm about what's happening to black men in America, because he wanted to know that his daughter would have a respectable man to marry one day. (I'm sure if she chose to marry someone who's not black, Reynaldo wouldn't mind, but he realized that as a nation, we mostly marry within our race.) I promised Reynaldo that I would do all I can, because this has been an issue for me for many years. In fact, my mom gets angry because I'm always talking about my dad on television, radio and in my books. That's because when you see black men who have ""made it,"" the accolades are plenty for their moms, and their dads are hardly mentioned. I just think it's critical to show daddy some love, too. This is not an issue that black America can continue to sweep under the rug. I've heard countless folks talk about it, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, who noted that his dad left his family when he was a toddler and didn't see much of him growing up. Even in the Republican CNN-YouTube debate, GOP candidate Mitt Romney said fathers are part of the answer to addressing crime in inner cities. We shouldn't shame our young girls who get pregnant, but surely it shouldn't be seen as a blue-ribbon day. Teenage black girls and black boys should be focused on picking colleges, not the names of babies. When a young girl wants a baby christened, her pastor should be asking to meet with the father as well, even if the two don't get along. We also should be telling black women not to lie down with any fool. A moment of pleasure could lead you to a lifetime of raising that child. Alone. A friend of mine suggested more black men need to mentor young black men. I agree. But that's a bandage. If we get black men to handle their business in the first place, no one else would have to stand in the gap. Unless black America owns up to this problem -- and fast -- we are going to see another generation of young black men who are angry with their lot in life. And the result will be more discipline problems in school, which will lead to folks dropping out, and that is nothing but a one-way ticket to jail. Black men, it's time to man up. Enough with the sperm donors. We need real men to stand up and accept their responsibility. The state of our boys is on us. And no one else. Roland S.

"They're bigger, brawnier, and faster than the typical male, but are National Football League players healthier than other men their age? Justin Bannan, who plays for the Baltimore Ravens, participated in the study on NFL players. Yes and no, according to a new NFL-funded study that looks at the cardiovascular health of young athletes. The good news is that NFL players have cholesterol levels similar to other men in their 20s and 30s, and their blood sugar tends to be even healthier. However, they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren't professional athletes. ""It's a step in the right direction to have this study,"" says Justin Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and took part in the research. ""I think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do, the better."" The study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could potentially strain an athlete's heart in youth or even after retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high-profile deaths. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes . In particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was 6'3"" and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005. ""He's sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,"" says lead study author Dr. Andrew M. Tucker, the team physician for the Baltimore Ravens. ""We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation."" Other heavy players-- such as defensive end Reggie White-- have also died at an early age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004. In the study, Tucker, who is the cochair of the NFL subcommittee on cardiovascular health, and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007. The researchers measured the players' height, weight, percentage of body fat, and other factors, and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). Health.com: 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off . They found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood-sugar problems than other men (only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same. However, 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension, or borderline high blood pressure, compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men, respectively. Tucker notes that the football players outweighed the men in the CARDIA study by an average of 70 pounds and that it's natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure. ""But what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension,"" says  Tucker, who is also the medical director of sports medicine at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat . The study found that NFL athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men-- regardless of the size of the player or his position. ""So our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver, they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line,"" says Tucker. ""So there's something that we're trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone-- there's got to be something else."" Health.com: Cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions . That ""something else"" could be strength or resistance training, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sleep apnea (which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure), or diet, including excessive sodium intake. Dr. Tucker doesn't think anabolic steroids are to blame. Even though he and his colleagues didn't ask players if they used steroids, he says that the NFL's year-round testing program should have ruled out any use. ""[However] I'm concerned about the widespread use of performance-enhancing agents, which contain stimulants that can not only increase blood pressure but of course have stimulating effects on the heart,"" says Dr. Tucker. He adds that, in the last several years, such stimulants have been linked to sporadic deaths in college and even professional athletes. Although today's players are much more likely to weigh in excess of 300 pounds than those in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean they are fat, Dr. Tucker explains. Athletes are larger nowadays due to rule changes in the 1970s and 1980s that were aimed at protecting their lower bodies; those guidelines also gave larger players a competitive advantage. If one goes by body mass index alone-- a measure of height and weight that doesn't take into account muscle mass-- more than half of players are obese, according to a 2005 study. However, Tucker and his team found that the average percentage of body fat was 14 percent, ranging from 8 percent to 10 percent in the leaner positions-- such as wide receivers and linebackers-- to 20 percent in defensive linemen and 25 percent in offensive linemen. ""Even our offensive linemen are really on the upper limits of what's considered healthy,"" says Tucker. ""There are plenty of my regular patients who would take that."" Health.com: Olympic swimmer discusses life with exercise-induced asthma . Overall, Tucker says he is most worried about older, retired athletes. ""I'm concerned about whether there is a constellation of things going on that puts them at risk when they're 45 or 55,"" he says. More attention is being paid to detraining athletes so that they can adopt healthier lifestyles and better nutrition after they retire, says William Kraemer, Ph.D., a professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut. ""It really is tough because you're trying to stay big in your playing days,"" says Kraemer. ""The big fear is, [after retirement] you stop exercising and you keep eating the way you used to when you were expending a lot of calories. A lot of times when kids get out of college or they get out of the pros, there is no system in place that helps them make the transition."" The Ravens' Bannan says the older generation is teaching younger players the importance of changing their lifestyle after retirement. ""If you're a heavier player, a lineman that's over 300 pounds, really what it comes down to is a lifestyle change and eating healthier, losing weight when you are done, and staying active and staying healthy,"" says Bannan, who is 6'3"" and 310 pounds. ""Make a few changes in your life; I think that's going to make things a lot better for you down the road."" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's a question that I have asked myself for a long time. Why can't Portugal produce a top golfer? Antonio Sobrinho was the only Portuguese golfer to make the cut at the recent Portugal Masters. The weather is great, courses are popping up all over the country, and still, they don't have a single player in the top 400 of the world rankings. On the surface, it might not make sense, but if you dig a little a deeper, like I had a chance to do during a recent Living Golf report in the Algarve, there are plenty of reasons why golf isn't taking off among the locals. The most shocking statistic of all is that in the whole country there is not a single public golf course. This means if you want to play, you have to become a member of a club or pay something in the region of 100 Euros ($137) for a round of golf. Considering the minimum salary in Portugal is under 400 Euros a month, it becomes clear the vast majority of Portuguese people simply can't afford it. This means most of the people out on golf courses in Portugal are foreign, and while this is great for tourism, it's doing nothing to help the grass roots of the game in the country. Another issue is that the sport is seen as elitist and is not part of the nation's sporting culture. There is great passion among Portugal's youngsters, as there is in many European countries, for football. And though people play other sports, and you can get lessons in sports like golf, there is an almost complete lack of interest -- no-one really talks about golf. What the country really needs is a golfing superstar to kick-start a revolution and inspire the new generation -- a Cristiano Ronaldo of golf. The Portuguese Golf Federation says the tide is turning and they claim they are doing their best to invest in young amateur players. They also have allies with some of the private investors who have built golf courses in Portugal sponsoring some of the nation's top prospects. Oceanico is an example of this, with the company that has built seven courses in the Algarve backing three of Portugal's five professionals. The more organizations that invest in up-and-coming golfers like this, the more chance Portugal will have in producing the next Tiger Woods. There could yet be hope for golf in the country, but it will take more investment, more time and a figure to unite an otherwise football obsessed country around a relatively neglected sport. Watch Pedro examine Portugal's golf scene on this month's Living Golf, which airs Thursday, November 6, 1400, 1830; Saturday, November 8, 0800, 1830 Sunday; November 9, 0400, 0830, 1430 (all times GMT).","Portugal has an ever-growing number of great golf courses .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Latino rights group and other immigrant and labor organizations called Thursday for a national boycott of Arizona over the state's new immigration law, which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency. The call for a boycott was led by the National Council of La Raza, which bills itself as the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States. Other organizations calling for the boycott include the Asian American Justice Center, the Center for Community Change, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Puerto Rican Coalition, the Service Employees International Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The groups pledged not to hold major conventions, conferences or other special events involving significant travel to Arizona from out of state and ""asked others to consider whether their purchases of goods and services might perpetuate the unjust and discriminatory law in Arizona,"" La Raza said on its website. ""When a law so contrary to our values is passed, we must act decisively,"" said La Raza President and CEO Janet Murguia. ""We are calling for a boycott because this law will blow open the door to increased racial profiling, wrongful arrests and other discrimination."" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the immigration measure April 23, says it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts. The law, known as SB 1070, is scheduled to go into effect this summer. The measure has drawn criticism in the United States and abroad. In Arizona, the Tucson and Flagstaff city councils voted this week to file suit against the measure. The city councils said they're taking action because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on Arizona's tourism industry. In Tucson, council member Regina Romero introduced a motion for ""the city attorney to bring a legal challenge"" because the immigration bill is ""unconstitutional"" and ""a bad law, which could cost the city millions of dollars in lawsuits."" ""This bill opens the door to racial profiling, and it puts Latinos in Arizona in automatic suspect mode,"" Romero said. Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal Mexican visitors. The state immigration law threatens Tucson's businesses, Walkup said, just when ""the city is just beginning to recover from the economic downturn."" Criticism also has come from abroad, with the Mexican government issuing an advisory to its citizens last week to avoid travel to Arizona. The Organization of American States expressed its concern about the law last week, and presidents of South American countries meeting in Argentina for a gathering of the Union of South American Nations condemned the law Tuesday. Well-known Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes recommended this week that dark-skinned people, men with mustaches, women who use shawls, or anyone who does not speak English well should not go to Arizona, because the state has ""officially declared itself racist,"" the government-run Notimex news service reported Wednesday. The Phoenix Suns basketball team also criticized the new law, and wore jerseys marked ""Los Suns"" in Wednesday night's NBA playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs. ""The frustration with the federal government's failure to deal with the issue of illegal immigration resulted in passage of a flawed state law,"" Suns managing partner Robert Sarver said in a statement. ""However intended, the result of passing this law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question, and Arizona's already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill-afford them."" Arizona legislators say they passed the law because the federal government has failed to safeguard the border with Mexico, allowing more than 450,000 undocumented immigrants to settle in the state. On Thursday, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York wrote a letter to Brewer, asking Arizona to delay implementing the law for one year ""in order to permit Congress sufficient time to enact comprehensive immigration reform to address Arizona's security needs.""","Groups pledge not to hold conventions in Arizona because of new immigration law .

"(CNN) -- If anyone's going to be the last man on Earth, then Will Smith seems like an ideal candidate. Will Smith plays the survivor of a plague in ""I Am Legend."" Cool and athletic, focused and unflappable, he's not someone who's going to give up on humanity just because the odds are stacked against him. Even at several billion to one, he's still adamant he can fix this thing. A third movie version of Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel ""I Am Legend"" has been on the table at Warner Bros. for a long time. In the '90s, Arnold Schwarzenegger talked about following in the footsteps of Vincent Price and Charlton Heston (remember ""The Omega Man""?). Smith is such a different type, it's odd to think that he's taken over this mantle. In fact, he's scored consistently well in sci-fi, from ""Independence Day"" through ""Men in Black"" and ""I, Robot,"" and there's no reason to suppose the tense, scary ""I Am Legend"" won't continue that impressive box office run, even if the movie itself flags on the last lap. The opening couldn't be sharper. A television news report hails a medical breakthrough -- a viral cure for cancer, no less. Cut to New York three years later: abandoned cars, no one in sight, grass growing waist-high around Times Square. Something has gone very, very wrong. Smith is Robert Neville. The cover of Time on his fridge door pictures a ""Soldier. Scientist. Savior?"" but that hanging question mark is well chosen, and we divine that his immunity is pure chance. He's not quite alone. Neville patrols Fifth Avenue in his Mustang with Sam, a German Shepherd (also immune to the airborne virus), broadcasting into the void, then returning home to his Washington Square townhouse to put up the shutters before nightfall. That's when the ""Dark Seekers"" venture out: feral, contaminated people with a rabid appetite for flesh but no pupil dilation reflex to protect them against sunlight. By now, anyone who caught ""28 Days Later"" or last year's sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" may be experiencing deja vu -- in fact, if they called this movie ""2.8 Years Later"" it could pass as the third installment in the series with very little tweaking. Which is not to downplay the special frisson of seeing the Brooklyn Bridge ripped across the middle, for example. Wisely dispensing with the Luddite rhetoric that bogged down ""The Omega Man,"" ""I Am Legend"" doesn't have much time for Neville the soldier. While Chuck Heston dedicated himself to exterminating the albino hordes, Will Smith starts out firmly on the other end of the kill-or-cure scale. At the same time, the film suggests his self-sufficient scientific rationalism is not enough. By day 1,001 he's on the point of suicide -- which is when the movie gets God in the comely intervention of born-again Alice Braga. If the last half-hour feels thrown together, ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence mostly makes a virtue of the lean script, getting in and out quick, suppressing those inevitable nagging questions (are cockroaches immune?), always stressing Neville's solitary isolation. So often, sci-fi is overproduced, but ""I Am Legend"" doesn't look like a CGI extravaganza. It looks like an edgy suspense movie shot on the fly in New York City after the fall. And because of that, it's all the more effective. ""I Am Legend"" is rated PG-13 and runs 100 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban in Pakistan have issued a direct challenge to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government, by declaring the country's entire legal system ""un-Islamic."" Taliban representatives leave talks in Peshawar in February after reaching a deal on Sharia law in Swat. ""Let the judges and the lawyers go to Islamic university,"" said Muslim Khan, a Taliban spokesman in Pakistan's Swat Valley. ""(After) they learn Islamic rules, Islamic regulation, they can continue to work."" In a telephone interview Tuesday with CNN, Khan demanded the imposition of Islamic sharia law all across the country. He also called for the creation of jaziya, an Islamic tax, to be levied on all non-Muslims in Pakistan. And Khan denounced any Pakistanis who disagreed with his interpretation of Islam, calling them ""non-Muslims."" The Taliban militant echoed statements made by Sufi Muhammed, an Islamist fundamentalist leader who helped broker a peace deal between the Pakistani government and the Taliban in Swat Valley. Last week, the deal led to the implementation of sharia law in Swat, an alpine region that was once one of Pakistan's most popular destinations for foreign tourists. Speaking before an audience of tens of thousands on Sunday, Sufi Muhammed declared democracy and Pakistan's judicial system ""un-Islamic."" Since reaching his peace deal with the government in Islamabad, Muhammed has been appointing qazis, or clerics, to serve as judges in Islamic courts in Swat. The rise of the Taliban in Swat has alarmed and frightened some members of local civil society there. ""This is a time bomb for the country,"" said Aftab Alam, the head of the lawyers' association in Swat district. Speaking by telephone from the town of Mingora, Alam claimed Taliban militants have kidnapped, ransomed and even killed lawyers in recent months. ""The only sane voice against the militants, the only sane voice against the criminals, is the lawyer community,"" he said. ""And this is why we have been declared by them, I mean the militants, liable to death."" This week, some secular Pakistani political parties publicly condemned the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islam. But many other prominent officials appear unwilling or unable to challenge the creeping Taliban conversion of Pakistani society. For example, Ali Ahmed Kurd, one of the leaders of the lawyers protest movement which helped bring down the government of military ruler Pervez Musharraf, declined to comment on Tuesday when asked by CNN about Sufi Mohammed's comments. In recent months, videos have emerged showing what appear to be Taliban militants in Swat meting out vigilante justice. One video shows men beating a woman accused of adultery with a cane. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan initially claimed responsibility for the public caning in interviews with Pakistani TV stations. But in his interview with CNN on Tuesday he reversed his position, accusing ""opponents of Islam"" of making fake videos to hurt his movement's image. Meanwhile, in another Taliban-run region called Orakzai, details emerged of militants forcing a small community of Sikhs to pay a jaziya or ""minority tax"" of 10.5 million rupees, roughly 18,000 dollars earlier this month. During his interview, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said that if his vision of an Islamic society is fulfilled in Pakistan, terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden will be welcome to travel and live openly here. ""Sure, he's a Muslim, he can go anywhere,"" Khan said. Khan added that he would like to see sharia law implemented beyond Pakistan, even in America, a country he knows intimately. For four years, the Taliban spokesman lived in the United States, working as a painter near Boston.","Taliban in Pakistan demand imposition of Islamic sharia law across country .

"(CNN) -- Famous for honest self-portraits, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo said that she painted her reality and that her paintings carried a message of pain. Her life was full of it, both physical and emotional, and she used it to fuel her art. Frida Kahlo was born in this house and lived in it with her husband, Diego Rivera. Much can be learned about both her private and public life by visiting the home she shared, first with her parents and later with her painter husband, Diego Rivera. The bold blue house with red trim stands out in the quiet residential street of the CoyoacÃ¡n section of Mexico City. It was painted that way because Kahlo and Rivera felt that the bright colors represented Mexican culture better than the original white paint. This home-turned-museum, known as La Casa Azul, is where Frida Kahlo was born, began to paint and died, making the house a witness to one of the most important artistic lives in Mexican history. The museum entrance leads to a large patio where pre-Columbian sculptures collected by Diego Rivera throughout his lifetime are scattered among the plants and fountains. The couple's love for traditional Mexican art can be seen throughout the house, from the large fireplace designed by Rivera that dominates the first room, resembling a step pyramid like the ones built by the Mayas and Aztecs, to Kahlo's paintings and the couple's collection of smaller sculptures. Some of Kahlo's most well-known works, such as ""Viva la Vida,"" a still life of watermelons, are on display in the museum, but it is the personal objects that tell the most interesting stories. An entire room is dedicated to communist paraphernalia. Kahlo was very politically active and did not hide her political leanings. In fact, she and Rivera invited exiled Russian communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and his wife to live with them in the late '30s. As visitors move through the museum, it is the remnants of Kahlo and Rivera's private life that begin to tell their story. Part of the collection is a bed with a mirror attached to it, used by Kahlo in order to create many of her celebrated self-portraits. At the age of 18, she was left bedridden for a few months when her spine was broken in a serious bus and trolley accident. It was during those months that Kahlo began to paint, to help pass the time and keep her spirits up. Also on view are several corsets that Kahlo had to wear during her lifetime because of lasting injuries from the accident, several surgeries and a childhood bout of polio. It was because she began painting that Kahlo met Diego Rivera, who was at the time a famous Mexican muralist. Kahlo wanted to know whether she had talent enough to make art a career, so she sought out Rivera to get his opinion. That was the start of their famously tempestuous relationship. They were married for the first time in 1929, but after infidelities on both sides (including an affair between Kahlo and Trotsky), they divorced in 1939. They were married again a year later. She once commented on their relationship, saying that there had been two great accidents in her life, the trolley and Diego; Diego, she claimed, had been the worst of the two. The house, which was witness to the birth of Kahlo on July 6, 1907, was also witness to her death July 13, 1954. Rivera put her ashes in a pre-Columbian urn, which remains in the house to this day. He donated the house in 1957, and it opened to the public as La Casa Azul, Museo Frida Kahlo in 1958. So the blue house, which has seen so much of the history of two of Mexico's most famous artists and was witness to so much of Kahlo's personal suffering, is open to the public, ready to tell their story to all who are willing to listen.","Frida Kahlo was born in La Casa Azul and lived there with Diego Rivera .

"(CNN) -- In-form Borussia Dortmund made it five straight wins on Sunday with a topsy-turvy 3-2 Bundesliga victory at Cologne having looked like they had thrown the three points away. Mats Hummel opened the scoring in the 28th minute and doubled Dortmund's lead in first-half injury time. That remained the score going into the final 10 minutes and Kevin McKenna's 82nd-minute strike looked nothing more than a consolation for the home side. Youssef Mohamad equalized with two minutes left, reacting quickest from McKenna's header. However, Kevin Grosskreutz popped up to win it in injury time with a shot that deflected past Cologne goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon. That goal sealed victory for the visitors -- who remain fifth in the table, five points off the pace. Meanwhile, Kevin Kuranyi's goal early in the second half was enough for Schalke to beat Nuremberg 1-0 at home to continue their good recent form. Kuranyi scored the only goal in the 48th minute and the Schalke defence held firm to seal the points. Felix Magath's side clinched their fourth straight victory and fifth in the last six games to return to second place in the table, just one point behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen.","Borussia Dortmund make it five straight wins with a topsy-turvy 3-2 Bundesliga victory at Cologne .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been in talks with high-level Taliban members, but the effort has failed to yield ""practical reconciliation"" or the ""resolution of many issues,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. ""We don't think the Taliban believe that they're losing to the degree that they'd come to terms in large numbers. Without question, they're hurting. We have it on good information that they're feeling the pressure. Just not enough,"" the official told CNN. Karzai has been forging reconciliation efforts to seek peace with Taliban members and end the nine-year-old Afghan war. One idea his government has pushed is the Afghan Peace Council, which was formed to help negotiate with the Taliban. That group convened for the first time on Thursday, a meeting in which Karzai called for militants to seize the opportunity for peace. ""I call on them once again to use this opportunity and say 'yes' to this endeavour. I want them to come and bring peace to this land,"" Karzai told the group, made up of about 68 Afghan clerics and elders. The senior U.S. official said the peace council and its efforts may pay off down the road. The U.S. military supports Karzai's efforts, and that any reconciliation must be Afghan-led, the official said. Nevertheless, the official put high expectations in perspective, saying outsiders can't expect a ""rock solid agreement"" every time there are talks. ""It will be messy,"" the official said. The official also noted that the Taliban and al Qaeda have to be thought of, and dealt with, differently. ""While al Qaeda just wants to kill people, the Taliban have definite governing ambitions. They want Afghanistan back -- but to accomplish that, they only need to do the minimum. They don't need to control every inch of land, just be present enough to exert influence,"" the official said. The al Qaeda terror network attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, when it was harbored by Afghanistan's Taliban-led government. A month later, the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled that government. Another effort is also under way to forge peace. This week, political figures from Pakistan and Afghanistan sat down in Kabul for talks in what one Afghan official called a ""new phase"" in building bridges and making peace with the Taliban. The meeting is part of an effort called the Abu Dhabi process. A Taliban spokesman has told CNN that the group was not interested in peace talks. Zabiuhullah Mujahed, the spokesman, said the group had no representative in the alleged negotiations in Kabul. Peace negotiations would not happen until the Afghan government met the Taliban's precondition to withdraw foreign forces from the country, the spokesman said. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Karzai tells the group it can help make peace in Afghanistan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is ready to fund a third search of the Atlantic Ocean if a second search, now under way, fails to find debris from last month's Air France crash, the company said Friday. Investigators pore over wreckage of Air France flight 447 which crashed killing 228 people on June 1. Airbus is discussing a payment of between 12 to 20 million euros ($17-28 million) to help pay for a third search, but it is still too early to settle on a figure, company spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said. ""We are ready to give a significant share, whatever is needed,"" he told CNN. The company is driven by the desire to understand what caused the crash of Air France Flight 447 on June 1, he said. All 228 people aboard were killed. ""Our priority is increasing aviation safety,"" Schaffrath said. ""The aviation community can learn from an accident."" Airbus is already helping in the second search alongside Air France and the French accident investigations agency, the BEA. French investigators began the second phase of their search for remnants of the flight Thursday, weeks after the locator beacons of the plane's flight recorders would have stopped working. A ship arrived in the area of the Atlantic considered the most likely location of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, according to the BEA. Using two submersible units and lateral scanning sonar, search teams will look for debris sites on the sea floor that could lead to finding the recorders, the BEA said. The locator beacons of flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders are designed to emit acoustic beacons, or ""pings,"" for 30 days after a crash. Flight 447 went down in stormy weather during a flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, on the first day of June. The search for the pings ended July 10. Investigators hope the recorders will help them determine the cause of the crash. Flight debris recovered so far is being stored in France, authorities have said. Only 51 bodies were recovered from the crash of Flight 447, the worst accident in Air France's 75-year history.","Aircraft manufacturer Airbus ready to fund third search of Atlantic Ocean .

"(CNN) -- The whole world is watching how Barack Obama picks his cabinet, but he and his wife Michelle have a much more personal choice to make at home -- and it's very political too. Sasha Obama, left, and Malia Obama will make the White House home come January 20. When they move to Washington, will their daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, go to public or private school? For many US parents, that decision is more revealing than the ones they make at the ballot box. What do you think the Obama family should do? Americans of a certain income who choose public school are demonstrating that they trust the government to educate their children. Americans who send their children to private school are saying that the government hasn't earned that trust. In some areas, it's also been a way for white families to avoid sending their children to school with black children. Republicans tend to favor giving poor families subsidies so they can afford private schools too. Most Democrats, including Barack Obama, are opposed to the idea, because they think it undermines the public school system. It's not an issue every president faces. George Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were both college students by the time he took office. The Obamas' two Democratic predecessors made contrasting choices. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter's daughter Amy went to public school. The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, went to a private school. In Chicago, the Obama girls have been going to a private school. But now their father is preparing to be president. All around the country, the media are reporting on the story and taking sides too. Some of them have already noted that the president-elect who opposes ""school choice"" for the poor has been able to afford it for his own children. This week, Mrs. Obama took the girls to visit some of Washington's elite private schools, with tuition of about $28,000. In an interview with CBS News, she resorted to the kind of careful phrasing that practiced politicians use to avoid controversy. ""What we have asked people to understand is that the decision that we make will be based on the best interests of the girls. We haven't made that decision yet. We want that to be a personal process, and people have been really good about respecting that."" They can't avoid the decision for long.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A yellow smiley-face badge, smeared with blood, has become the trademark for ""Watchmen,"" the most critically revered of all comic books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big screen. ""Watchmen"" opens with the unexplained murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Note smiley badge. The subject of fervent debate in the geekosphere for more than two decades, ""Watchmen"" finally rolls out in the U.S. and other territories from the first week of March onward. But it's not as well known to wider audiences, who may puzzle at all this heat about a superhero movie with no A-list star attached. Instead, they may simply ask: ""Watch-what?"" ""Watchmen,"" created by the UK comic-book team of writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, surfaced in 1986 as a monthly 12-issue series published by DC Comics (part of Time Warner, which owns CNN parent company Turner Broadcasting).  Are you looking forward to ""Watchmen?"" Or think it's just hype? It was a defining year for the medium: aside from ""Watchmen,"" '86 also saw Pulitzer-prize winning holocaust drama ""Maus,"" from The New Yorker contributor Art Spielgeman; and Frank Miller's hyperviolent Batman reworking ""The Dark Knight Returns."" ""Watchmen,"" which takes place in 1985, is set in a  parallel world where America never lost Vietnam, Russia is about to invade Afghanistan and Richard Nixon still holds power (Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward were murdered). Meanwhile a superhero team -- only one of whom has special powers -- reforms after a fellow operative is mysteriously slain. But what lifts ""Watchmen"" above its superhero peers is a complex, multi-layered narrative and depth of characterization that ensured it was the only comic book to make Time's 100 best novels since 1923. A dark, downbeat work with a heady 11th-hour twist, it puts as much store on subsidiary characters like a newspaper seller as its does blue-skinned man-god Dr. Manhattan. Its influence can be traced to current small-screen favorites like ""Heroes"" and ""Lost.""  Watch ""Watchmen"" trailer. Â» . Perfect fodder, one might think, for the multiplex -- but ""Watchmen"" has been lodged in Development Hell for the best part of two decades. At various times Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vin Diesel were mooted to play Manhattan; Mickey Rourke and Ed Norton were suggested for right-wing vigilante Rorschach. Directors set to shoot have included Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, Paul Greengrass and David Hayter (whose script has been retained for much of the final film). Several planned shoots failed to materialize due to studio fears about the budget (locations include Antarctica and Mars as well as New York) and how the ending might be perceived in a post-9/11 world.  But film-makers such as Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro also believed that the complex material would be better treated as a TV mini-series. As the latter, the ""Pan's Labyrinth"" filmmaker, told IGN: ""I just couldn't get my head around 'Watchmen' being two or three hours long."" Whoever made ""Watchmen"" would also do so without Moore's blessing. Still resident in his hometown of Northampton, central England, Moore cuts an imposing figure. At least six-and-a-half feet tall, with chest-length beard and hair, talon-like rings on his fingers and the skull of a centuries-old Buddhist monk in his study, he resembles Doctor Who as reimagined by Edgar Allan Poe. (In person he's gracious and affable, as this writer will attest from a few years back.) Moore has had a mixed relationship with both the mainstream comic-book industry (which he accuses of over-commercialization and exploiting creators' rights) and Hollywood. The comic-book series ""From Hell,"" in which Moore uses the Jack the Ripper killings as a precursor to 20th-century violence, runs to about 500 pages, including 40-plus pages of footnotes. On film it became a melodramatic pad around Victorian London, gamely carried by a pre-""Pirates"" Johnny Depp. Two other Moore adaptations also failed to translate. Stephen Norrington's ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003) was widely derided and the subject of a court case into which Moore was dragged; by the time of James McTeigue's better judged ""V For Vendetta"" (2005), Moore had asked his name be taken off any movie adaptations and refused to take royalties. Enter Zack Snyder. In 2004, Snyder came to the attention of mainstream cinemagoers with his well-regarded remake of George A. Romero's zombie flick ""Dawn of The Dead."" Following the $450m-plus taken worldwide by Snyder's ""300"" (2006)  -- a hyper-stylized take on Frank Miller's ancient Greek suicide-mission -- it was announced that ""Watchmen"" would be his next project with Warner Bros. Paramount, which abandoned plans for the movie in 2005, took international rights. The $150-million feature went into production in Vancouver in mid-2007, wrapping in early 2008, and with a cast including Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley. Snyder has retained ""Watchmen's"" 1980s setting and also recruited original artist Gibbons -- who still retains friendship with Moore -- to advise on production design. Mindful that a narrative so complex could never work as a movie, Snyder has jettisoned several parallel subplots, which will surface as DVD extras and in director's cuts. Word is that the ending has also been changed. But wary of over-tweaking, Snyder told Entertainment Weekly last year: ""You can't make it into something else, you really can't. It's not 'Fantastic Four,' it's got to be hard R [cinema rating], it's got to challenge everyone's ideas."" Meanwhile Moore, who sometimes mentions that he worships a Roman snake-god, hinted in the LA Times that he had cursed the feature. ""I can tell you that I will also be spitting venom all over it for months to come,"" he added. So was it Moore who saw ""Watchmen"" end up in the courts for a case that risked scuppering its release? Last year Twentieth Century Fox claimed it still retained rights through an earlier deal with producer Lawrence Gordon in the 1980s; Warners Bros. disagreed but a judge decided there was a case to answer. A settlement was eventually  thrashed out last month, only weeks ahead of release. And so ""Watchmen"" ticks toward early March and a rollout in spring, the now-traditional season for edgier comic-book adaptations like ""300"" and ""Sin City."" Trailers and early footage have drawn praise, with several scenes playing like detailed frames from the original artwork. But key will be whether Snyder can match ""Watchmen's"" dramatic beats against its green-screen chicanery for more than two hours (the Internet Movie Database lists the running time at 163 minutes). After all, successfully mixing pyrotechnics and narrative is how the most satisfying genre features of recent years -- such as Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" -- have found artistic, as well as commercial, favor. Should Snyder pull it off then will he earn the gratitude of fan boys everywhere, as well as no small thanks from a fair few movie executives. What Alan Moore might think is another issue. 'Watchmen' is released in the UK on 6 March.","Comic-book movie, directed by Zack Snyder, took two decades to reach cinemas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When HIV-positive Winnie Sseruma was invited to speak on the subject at the United Nations in New York last June, she never expected that her condition would prevent her from obtaining a visa. HIV positive Winnie Sseruma was repeatedly questioned before being allowed into the United States. Winnie Sseruma has been  living with the disease for over 20 years. Preparing for her trip, UK-based Winnie discovered that the United States was one of 70 countries worldwide that either banned or restricted inbound travel for people with HIV. ""I was told I needed to come to the U.S. embassy for an interview and bring a doctor's letter stating I was fit to travel,"" Sseruma, HIV coordinator for charity Christian Aid, told CNN. ""At first, the embassy told me that the first available appointment for my interview would be at a date past the U.N. High-level Meeting I was meant to attend."" Only when the U.N. intervened on Sseruma's behalf was she granted an earlier interview date. Sseruma was relieved when she finally received her visa on time. But the hurdles were far from over. At the airport in New York, Sseruma was detained twice for further questioning. ""It was so humiliating,"" Sseruma said. ""The immigration officers were asking me very personal questions about my health."" A month after Sseruma's ordeal, the U.S. Senate passed the re-authorization of President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), including an amendment to the ban on travel and immigration for HIV-positive non-citizens. But the United States travel ban still remains in effect, and will continue to be the law until the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) modifies its regulations. Fifty-eight Members of Congress have sent a letter to the HHS, urging them to take action. Russia also places restrictions on travelers with HIV. Affected visitors are not permitted to stay in the country for more than three months. Anyone applying for a visa for long-term stay must present a certificate stating that they are HIV negative. The Russian embassy's spokesperson in London told CNN no changes to the ban were currently being considered and declined to comment further. Crusading against these bans is ""Ctrl.Alt.Shift,"" a UK-based organization that attempts to engage youth to combat global and social injustices. The organization argues that there is no public health rationale for ""restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of HIV status."" Are these laws outmoded? What do you think? Tell us in the Sound Off below. The fight against stigmas associated with HIV and AIDS has been widely adopted by the organization's young members. Many are joining Ctrl.Alt.Shift's protests across London. Last week, following two protests at the embassies of Saudi Arabia and South Korea -- both countries ban HIV positive travelers from entering their borders -- the organization launched its third protest in front of the Russian embassy in London. ""The level of proliferation of the HIV virus in countries that do not implement bans on HIV travelers is proof that these bans have no impact whatsoever, except for reinforcing the stigma,"" said Neil Boorman, Ctrl.Alt.Shift's project manager. Boorman told CNN that the bans and restrictions further the spread of the epidemic by driving the issue underground and force people to lie about their health on visa applications. Tinchy Strider, a 22-year-old British rap artist, was also present at the protest. ""I'm here because many young people are not aware of these issues, but if they knew these bans existed, they would want to do something about it,"" Tinchy explained. Eighteen-year-old Sian Anderson agrees. Anderson believes it is bad enough to live with HIV and that these regulations make life ""even harder."" ""Some people are completely not at fault, they might have gotten the virus through blood transfusion and Russia doesn't take that into consideration,"" Anderson said. ""Science has moved on from the days where HIV was an unknown virus. Now the world needs to move on too,"" Sseruma said. ""Stigma remains our biggest challenge.""","Russia is one of 11 countries worldwide that restricts HIV positive visitors .

"(CNN) -- Siberia's Lake Baikal, the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake, faces the prospect of severe ecological disruption as a result of climate change, according to team of U.S. and Russian scientists. The Baikal seal is the world's only freshwater seal. Publishing their analysis in BioScience magazine the team found the most pressing threat came from the dependence of the lake's food chain on microscopic algae. Lake Baikal's algae are particularly vulnerable to expected reductions in the length of time the lake is frozen each winter. The lake is considered a treasure trove for biologists and was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because a high proportion of its rich fauna and flora are found nowhere else. The report's authors say Lake Baikal's climate has become measurably milder over recent decades, and that annual precipitation is expected to increase. The average ice depth in the lake is believed to have decreased in recent decades, and the ice-free season to have increased. Changes in the lake's food-chain composition have been noted, the scientists say. Shorter periods of ice cover is expected to slow the growth of the lake's algae, the authors say; the organisms bloom under the ice in springtime and are highly dependent on ice cover for their reproduction and growth. Algae is the principal food of tiny crustaceans abundant in the lake, which in turn are food sources for the lake's fish. The crustaceans could also be affected by changes in the transparency of the ice, an expected result of shifting precipitation and wind patterns. Shortened periods of ice cover and changes in the ice's transparency may also harm the Baikal seal, the lake's top predator and the world's only exclusively freshwater seal. Because the seals mate and give birth on the ice, premature melting forces them into the water before molting and drastically reduces their fertility, the authors say. A warmer, wetter climate may be the principal threat to Lake Baikal's unique biological heritage, but it is not the only one, say the report's scientists. The secondary effects of climate change, including greater nutrient inputs and industrial pollution from melting permafrost, may also exact a toll on an already-stressed ecosystem.","Study says climate change threatens important algae in Russia's Lake Baikal .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that U.S. intelligence has had considerable success, but that the botched Christmas Day attack shows ""the system has failed"" in a major way. ""When a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day, the system has failed in a potentially disastrous way,"" Obama said at the White House in a statement to reporters. The president used even stronger language in a private meeting in the Situation Room with top aides, a senior administration official said. ""This was a screw-up that could have been disastrous,"" he said, according to the official. ""We dodged a bullet, but just barely."" Tragedy was averted ""by brave individuals, not because the system worked, and that is not acceptable. While there will be a tendency for finger pointing, I will not tolerate it,"" the senior official quoted Obama as saying. In his public comments, the president said that U.S. intelligence had uncovered numerous ""red flags"" prior to the attack. ""The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack, but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list,"" Obama said. ""In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had,"" the president said. ""The information was there, agencies and analysts who needed it had access to it, and our professionals were trained to look for it and to bring it all together."" Obama said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work, ""but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged,"" he said, adding: ""That's not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it."" According to authorities, Nigerian-born Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its approach to Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. He faces federal charges. AbdulMutallab had a multiple-entry U.S. visa. His father, a leading banker in Nigeria, warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists, but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa. In his address, the president listed steps so far to enhance security, including more airport screening and tighter monitoring of U.S. visa holders. In one step, senior State Department officials told CNN on Tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from U.S.-bound flights. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material, the officials said the United States has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no-fly list or revoke their visas. If the new criteria had been in place before Christmas, AbdulMutallab would have been added to the no-fly list, the officials said. Obama said he ordered his national security team to complete preliminary reviews of the situation this week so that suggested reforms can be implemented right way. ""Time and again we've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary,"" Obama said. ""So we have to do better, and we will do better, and we have to do it quickly. American lives are on the line."" Obama reiterated, however, his intention to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda,"" Obama said. ""In fact, that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."" Critics of the Guantanamo transfers have raised concerns over political instability in Yemen and the presence of al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, noting that some previous detainees released to Yemen by the Bush administration have renewed their terrorist ties. Obama repeated an earlier statement by his spokesman that transferring Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo back to Yemen would be halted for now. ""Given the unsettled situation, I've spoken to the attorney general and we've agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to Yemen at this time,"" Obama said. Earlier in the day, the president met with FBI Director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, an administration official said. The group was to have discussed possible changes to terror watch lists, as well as accountability by responsible authorities. The president met with Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan for 90 minutes on Monday and was scheduled to meet with him again Tuesday, the official said. Brennan gave Obama an update on his review of the terror watch listing system. Tuesday's meetings were held just hours after the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. It had been closed after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives could have been planning an attack on the compound, a senior administration official said Monday. Authorities say AbdulMutallab may have received training in Yemen from the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A statement posted on the Embassy's Web site said ""successful counterterrorism operations"" conducted by Yemeni security forces Monday north of the capital, Sanaa, addressed ""a specific area of concern and have contributed to the Embassy's decision to resume operations."" Yemen's state-run news agency, SABA, reported Monday that two al Qaeda suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a Yemeni anti-terrorism unit. FBI investigators ""gleaned usable, actionable intelligence"" from AbdulMutallab in the hours after his arrest, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Gibbs declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence.

"ST. LOUIS, Missouri (CNN) -- Michael and Steven Roberts didn't have two quarters to rub together a couple of decades ago.

He says he likes to tell youths and college students: ""What would your life be like if you could eliminate the fear of failure, and where would you be at this point in life?"" There will be times, he says, when you will stumble, but don't let those hiccups get you down. ""If you eliminate the fear of failure and if you use every moment to its fullest extent -- a very existential concept -- then you are able to take your ideas, your dreams, your aspirations, and you can pursue them with courage and confidence and bravado."" What are the challenges for black entrepreneurs, businesses? The brothers operate on a simple business philosophy: You diversify or die. And they don't believe in a full retirement. ""What other animal retires?"" Michael Roberts says. ""If a lion retires today, tomorrow morning he becomes his brother's breakfast."" They point to their father as exhibit A. At 86, he still comes to the office that his sons named after him, the Victor Roberts Building, a large complex complete with restaurants and retail stores. He worked 39 years in the Postal Service before retiring in the 1980s. He now keeps a keen eye on his now grown boys. He refuses a paycheck. ""I suggest anyone who has a father,"" Michael says with a laugh, ""please hire them, because you can get them for free."" The two brothers also have served in public office, elected to the St. Louis Board of Alderman in the late 1970s. They recently walked through The Roberts Orpheum Theatre in downtown St. Louis. It symbolizes their quest for a legacy. Decades ago, their mother and other black people were only allowed to sit in the highest balcony. Now, the brothers own the theater. They stood on the stage and scanned the empty seats. Again, they laughed. ""Mom can sit wherever she likes,"" Michael Roberts said.","Michael and Steven Roberts, both African-Americans, built a $1 billion empire .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- News that a British soldier died after he received the cancerous lungs of a heavy smoker has sparked intense debate as to whether organs from people with unhealthy lifestyles should be used in transplants. Surgeons ""aren't in a position in to turn down organs because they're not absolutely perfect."" Corporal Matthew Millington, 31, died in 2008, less than a year after receiving a transplant at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire, England. However a transplant surgeon has told CNN that smokers organs will continue to be used as long as medical services face a severe shortage of organs. Chris Watson, vice president of the British Transplantation Society, told CNN that 49 percent of last year's lung donors in the UK were smokers. ""We're not in the luxurious position in transplantation to turn down organs because they're not absolutely perfect -- there are very few perfect organs,"" he said. What should be done to encourage organ donation? ""In the case of Corporal Millington the donor had a chest X-ray, broncoscopy and a careful inspection of the lungs once they were removed,"" he said. ""When they found the tumor in Corporal Millington it was seven millimeters across and it was likely to have been two or three millimeters when it was transplanted. To find something that small you'd need to chop the lungs up into fine pieces, and then you can't transplant."" The UK National Health Service National Reporting and Learning Service (NRLS) recently released an alert  saying it had found 11 reported incidents ""relating to the condition of an organ for transplant or other errors."" One incident reported to the NRLS read: ""Kidney arrived completely surrounded by fat and muscle -- nothing was recognizable. After dissection, a fatty tumor appeared on the upper pole, decision was taken to transplant anyway. ""After unclamping, there was a massive bleed from the tumor leading to urgent transplantectomy -- kidney sent to the path lab -- renal cell carcinoma... not fit for purpose."" Watson told CNN that organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before they are transplanted. He said that once a patient has been diagnosed as brain dead and donation is a possibility, a donor coordinator will approach their family to learn more about the patient's history. Medics ask about the donor's medical history and lifestyle. They also take a blood test and may contact the donor's doctor for more information. But Watson stresses that medics only have a few hours between diagnosis of brain death and organ removal. When the organs are removed the donor's body is examined for evidence of infection, cancer, or anything else that might affect decision to use an organ. In the case of lung transplants, the donor will have a chest x-ray and broncoscopy, where an endoscope is used to examine lungs from the inside. ""The main thing is how well lungs work,"" Watson told CNN. ""We would check blood gases, taking a blood sample and seeing how much oxygen is dissolved in the blood to see how well lungs are working. ""If they work well and there's no evidence of any problems then we would use them, regardless of if they came from a smoker."" Watson says a biopsy is carried out on donated livers to check for any damage. He says fatty livers are common, not because the donor is overweight, but as a result of the donor having been starved in intensive care. Different organs have different tolerances to being without a blood supply. Watson says a heart doesn't respond well to being out of the body for more than three or four hours. Livers can remain viable for around 12 hours and kidneys for about 24 hours. Those time constraints mean medics have to make quick judgments about the suitability of donated organs, even if it that means using imperfect organs. ""We're happy to use the organs available knowing they're not ideal and we'll make the best use of them and keep them functioning as well as we can,"" said Watson. ""The alternative for recipients is to die, so there's really not much choice for them.""","Surgeon says shortage of donors mean they must use imperfect organs .

"(CNN) -- Shaquille O'Neal is fighting allegations from a former employee who says the NBA star stole his personal information and attempted to frame him for using child porn. Shawn Darling, who was O'Neal's personal computer consultant, said the NBA center acted in retaliation because Darling had proof that O'Neal cheated on his wife with several women. O'Neal's Florida lawyer said he will file a motion on Thursday to dismiss Shawn Darling's lawsuit claiming privacy invasion, racketeering and intentional infliction of emotional distress on the grounds that the suit has no basis in law. ""Even if everything he was saying were true, we believe there is no basis in the law to bring the case,"" Miami attorney Ben Reid said. ""But in this case, none of it's true."" O'Neal, who this summer signed with the Boston Celtics, employed Darling from 2008 to 2009, while O'Neal lived primarily in Miami. During that time, Darling performed various odd jobs that gave him access to O'Neal's e-mail and cell phone accounts, according to the lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in August and posted Wednesday on RadarOnline.com. The 15-page complaint describes O'Neal's dealings with three alleged mistresses and his ex-wife, whom he was divorcing at the time. Among them are allegations that O'Neal used law enforcement contacts to obtain information about Alexis Miller, and that he hacked into a phone belonging to Vanessa Lopez, erasing messages and changing her password. The lawsuit also accuses O'Neal and an associate of throwing his computer into a lake after Darling performed a ""'Defense Department' type wipe"" of the computer. Darling also claims that O'Neal believes he has pictures of him with Dominica Westling. As a result, the lawsuit alleges, O'Neal has attempted to ""control"" Darling's actions through threats of violence and attempts to frame him for possession of child pornography and to have him arrested using O'Neal's extensive law enforcement contacts. ""O'Neal knows that Darling not only has knowledge of his bad acts that might be used against him in litigation, but O'Neal also knows that Darling has evidence that shows he cheated on his former wife [Shaunie O'Neal] with many more people than just Vanessa Lopez,"" the lawsuit states. ""Darling is in apprehension and fears for his safety,"" the lawsuit says. O'Neal's lawyer issued a statement after the lawsuit was reported on Wednesday that described Darling as an ex-con who has served time in a federal prison in Wisconsin for misusing Social Security numbers, and said Darling failed to disclose the prison record to O'Neal. An online inmate search of the Federal Bureau of Prisons showed that a man named Shawn Darling was released on March 22, 2002. An attorney for Darling did not return calls seeking comment. Reid said Darling used his position to copy O'Neal's e-mails and communications. Over the past 12 months and through three separate lawyers, he has demanded $12 million for their return, Reid said. When O'Neal refused to cooperate with Darling, he filed the lawsuit, Reid said. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. ""It doesn't take much to file a suit and unfortunately, this seems pretty common in our society. People target celebrities,"" he said.","Former computer consultant says he has proof of Shaquille O'Neal's affairs .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on President-elect Barack Obama's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks, with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama's inauguration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will not go on a break until an economic recovery package is passed. Obama will take office January 20. If that schedule slips, Pelosi, D-California, pledged to cancel the House's planned weeklong break in mid-February for Presidents Day. ""We are not going home without an economic recovery package,"" Pelosi said. Pelosi said Obama's plan has broad public support ""almost sight unseen,"" citing a poll from Politico that says 79 percent of Americans support the president-elect's plan. A senior Pelosi aide said discussions about the details are ongoing between the Obama transition team and key leaders. The Ways and Means Committee will focus on the tax piece, approximately $300 billion in tax cuts. Obama transition aides met with Democrats on that committee Wednesday morning to discuss various proposals, according to another Democratic aide. The Appropriations Committee is tasked with drafting details on spending hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure projects, food stamps and other aid to states. Sidestepping a question on possible roadblocks for the bill, Pelosi instead touted the new muscle of the expanded Democratic majority. ""We have been so used to an uphill fight, but now we have arrived. We have a big, strong, something like an 80-vote majority in the Congress, in the House, with a Democratic president in the White House,"" she said. In a speech Thursday, Obama said it was imperative that Congress move quickly to pass the stimulus package once he takes office, warning that a failure to do so would have devastating long-term consequences to the nation's economy. ""We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks,"" Obama said at George Mason University in Virginia.  Watch Obama call for ""dramatic action"" on the economy Â» . ""I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible,"" Obama continued. ""If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years."" Key members of Obama's own party, however, said they opposed central tax measures of the president-elect's proposals after emerging from a closed-door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee.  Watch Obama explain his tax proposals Â» . In particular, they do not think that giving employers a $3,000 tax credit for each worker they hired would work. ""I'm not that excited about that,"" said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. ""Having a tax credit for hiring is not going to change that dynamic; creating a direct job will. So I'd rather spend the money on the infrastructure, on direct investment, on energy conversion and other kinds of things, much more directly and much more rapidly and much more certainly create a real job."" Sen. Kent Conrad agreed. ""I think it's unlikely to be effective,"" the North Dakota senator said. ""If you think about it, businesspeople are not going to hire people to produce products that are not selling. Who is going to hire in the auto industry if you give them a $3,000 credit to make cars that people are not buying?"" A second Obama tax proposal that several Democrats were down on is payroll tax credits, amounting to about $20 per paycheck and totaling $500 per person and $1,000 for couples earning less than $200,000 a year. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said he doubted that proposal would do much to stimulate the economy. ""We have an example from the first stimulus that indicates just giving people $500 to $600, while certainly welcome when there's this much economic hurt, may not be the best use of stimulus,"" Wyden said. Instead, Wyden said, pumping more money into infrastructure spending would be more effective in creating jobs. Conrad agreed with Wyden. ""Twenty dollars a week? I don't think that will be effective, either. That is in terms of economic impact. We have got to focus on what is actually going to lift the economy,"" Conrad said. None of the senators CNN spoke with after the meeting said they thought the opposition to these provisions would derail the bill but suggested that many meetings would be needed with the Obama team to hammer out an agreement. First votes in the Finance Committee, which must approve the tax components of the stimulus plan, could come in the next two weeks, senators and aides said. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Speaker Nancy Pelosi sets full House vote on stimulus for week of January 25 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus (HPV) has prompted a widespread freeze on the country's national vaccination program. Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008, the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers. More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service (NHS) started administering it in September 2008. Natalie Morton's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in  Coventry. Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine, according to media reports. It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton's death. Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death. Glaxo Smith Kline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a ""precautionary measure.""  Watch reaction to Natalie Morton's death Â» . ""At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown,"" the company said in a statement posted on their Web site. ""Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night, we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie's death is conducted."" On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations. ""As a purely precautionary measure, we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case,"" a spokesperson for the NHS said. ""Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches, they should continue with the vaccination program."" Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine. What is HPV? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus. Although there are more than 100 types of HPV, only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer. Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts. HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease. Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life, according to the British National Health Service. HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix. Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer. Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV. What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV (16 and 18) that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women. The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm, or thigh, in three doses within six months, and is recommended for teenage girls. How effective is the Cervarix vaccine? According to the manufacturer, Glaxo Smith Kline, Cervarix is over 99 percent effective. Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV? No. Gardisil, manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide. Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV (16, 18, 6 and 11). Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions, such as genital warts. Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck. Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated, 32 deaths were reported, though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence. Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK? According to the NHS, Cervarix, ""was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria. The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated."" When was the vaccine introduced? In September 2008, England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13, and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls. Do condoms protect against HPV? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission, but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover. What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries, according to the NHS. The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site, nausea, a mild temperature, dizziness, diarrhea and muscle aches. In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred.","Teenage girl dies after receiving Cervarix vaccination for HPV .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- From the custom-made, hand-beaded white dress to silver-studded high-heeled shoes, diamond jewelry and tiara, Jenny Ferro is preparing for a day she's dreamed about since she was 3 years old. Marlene Ferro, left,  who emigrated from Cuba, says Jenny's quinceanera was a gift to both of them. ""I'm really excited,"" says Jenny, eagerly nodding her head. ""Really, really, a lot!"" She isn't getting married. The 15-year-old is preparing for her quinceaÃ±era, a coming-of-age ritual in Latin culture, marking a young girl's entrance into womanhood. The centuries-old tradition began as a ceremony to introduce girls to society on their 15th birthday and signified that they were ready for marriage. Today, many quinceaÃ±eras have become much more elaborate. Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music. The theme of the party is bedazzled. First, there is the dress, which Marlene had designed specially for her daughter. It cost about $800. Then there are the shoes, high-heeled and silver to match the dress. During the party, the high heels will be ceremoniously slipped onto her feet to replace her flat shoes -- a symbolic transition of her journey from childhood to womanhood.  Soledad O'Brien takes a look at Jenny's dress, shoes and photos Â» . ""It makes her look like a princess,"" gushes Marlene Ferro. QuinceaÃ±eras are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of ""QuinceaÃ±era!"" a comprehensive guide to the celebration. ""The 15th birthday, culturally, is a milestone. It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special,"" Salcedo says. Experts believe the quinceaÃ±era is rooted in Mayan, Aztec and European traditions. Today, many coming-of-age ceremonies resemble lavish ""Sweet 16"" celebrations. Beyond the elaborate apparel, food and festivities, modern quinceaÃ±eras often feature a court of 15 people, typically consisting of family and friends. As the event continues to grow in popularity, the makeup of the court has also changed. ""It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends,"" says Salcedo. ""So it's a way of reaching out and extending social ties and bringing people in who might not otherwise have an opportunity to know a Latino family and to know the culture."" Family plays the largest role in the quinceaÃ±era, leading up to and during the party. Mothers, fathers, grandparents and godparents can spend years preparing a night to remember for the young girl. The tradition is just as important to the family as it is to the young woman. The large, extravagant celebrations often symbolize a family's hard work and success. How has America changed Latinos? Marlene Ferro, who emigrated from Cuba as a child with her parents, says Jenny's quinceaÃ±era was a gift to both of them. The 43-year-old, single mother of three, saved for years and estimates that she spent at least $20,000 on her daughter's quinceaÃ±era. ""I was able to accomplish something that I had been looking forward to for 15 years,"" says Marlene Ferro. The parties can be as big and expensive as a family can imagine and costs can escalate into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Salcedo. She recommends that families manage expectations before the party planning even begins. iReporter Alexis Fernandez's quinceaÃ±era was a big event in Alaska . ""Sometimes people go way overboard and [spend] much more on the celebration than they can afford and that's the downside of the quinceaÃ±era,"" says Salcedo. ""Because when it's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through."" QuinceaÃ±eras have changed over the years. Even though her tiara was taller than her daughter's, Marlene says her quinceaÃ±era was simple. It was a small gathering at her sister's apartment with family and friends. She wore borrowed jewelry from a family member, had a homemade cake and danced with her father. Marlene Ferro's 15th birthday present was a telephone in her bedroom. ""I didn't have a big quince party. I chose to have a small party with my friends,"" she remembers. ""My dress was really easy ... I didn't have an option. It was this one or that one. Now, we give our kids the option."" iReporter Diamond Ramirez's mother, grandmother never had quinceaÃ±eras . There's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well, says Salcedo. The church plays a role in helping to prepare teenage girls for this transition to womanhood. Ceremonies and classes before the coming-of-age celebration teach the young women that with adulthood come certain responsibilities, both physical and spiritual. ""When it's done in the spirit that it probably should be, the girl has certain responsibilities and by the end of the process, she's met them and she has showed her mother that she can, in fact, be responsible and she does acquire ... a bit more maturity then she [had] before,"" says Salcedo. As the celebrations become more popular in the United States, they also offer an opportunity for more Americans to participate. ""It's a way to push back a lot of the negativity that a lot of Latinos feel is directed at Latinos,"" says Salcedo. ""It is a way for people who have recently arrived, or maybe not so recently arrived, to say 'I have done well here' ... I'm throwing this party for my daughter and I'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we've done.""","QuinceaÃ±eras, or 15th birthday celebrations, mark a girl's transition to womanhood .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A 100-inch, high definition screen projects an intense college basketball game. Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter. Sean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California. This is not your typical barbershop. And that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood. ""We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,"" says Heywood. MR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops. ""We're trying to thrive, not just survive,"" Heywood said. MR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network. ""We looked at our social lives, and we had black friends, Asian friends, Latino friends, white friends. We would do a lot of things socially together, but when it came to getting our hair cut, we would all split up,"" Walker says.  Watch Walker talk about the difficulty of starting and running a business Â» . The two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track. Among other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly. ""We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,"" Walker says. Giving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago. ""All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,"" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago. Imagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area. That was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921. But on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. ""People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' "" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. ""We evacuated. They were destroying everything."" The death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials. The riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered. ""It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,"" says Walker. Wess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, ""We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box."" His advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it. ""Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,"" Young says. Walker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him. ""I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,"" he says. ""I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.""","Entrepreneur read about famed Black Wall Street that was destroyed in 1921 .

"SOWETO, South Africa (CNN) -- It's late Sunday morning inside a cavernous Salvation Army Church in Soweto, South Africa. Services, complete with African and traditional music, have just finished and a catchy drum beat with a distinctly American hip-hop sound is coming from the stage. Laura DiFilippi, 12, gets ready to board the bus in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to go to the airport. The group of teenagers dancing around the drums is 8,000 miles and an 18-hour plane ride from their New York home. They are mostly from Bushwick, Brooklyn -- a community of about 109,000 people only five miles from Manhattan. For some of these kids, it's their first time away from home. Unfamiliar with Bushwick? It's mostly a working class neighborhood where families have often struggled. For years it was a community with a thriving drug trade, severely under-achieving schools, extreme poverty and a staggering rate of teenage pregnancy. It was ravaged by fires and looting during the summer of 1977 and hit hard by the crack epidemic in the 1980s. Bushwick is recovering now, but half of the children under age 18 still live below the poverty line. A quarter of the adults never make it past the ninth grade and more than half never graduate from high school. The children on this trip to South Africa are what educators and social workers call ""at-risk"" -- at risk of having babies as teenagers; at risk of never finishing high school or achieving their dreams; at risk of never knowing the world beyond their neighborhood. Thirty of these children, between the ages of 12 to 16, have been paired up with college-aged mentors and brought to South Africa by Malaak Compton-Rock, the wife of comedian Chris Rock. She brought them to volunteer -- to serve the impoverished and the AIDS orphans in this country with the highest HIV-infected population in the world. Watch the kids' video diaries from South Africa Â» . Compton-Rock has carved her own niche in espousing service -- giving back. She often quotes her mentor Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund: ""Service is the rent we pay for living."" The South Africa trip is Compton-Rock's brainchild -- to broaden the horizons of young teens and give them perspective on their own lives.  Watch: The kids witness devastating effect of AIDS in South Africa Â» . ""I believe by traveling you open up your life,"" Compton-Rock tells a crowd gathered for a press conference the morning after the group has arrived. ""You don't think locally, you start to think globally and internationally and I think it gives you a sense of confidence."" She also wants the children to know, ""that in the United States of America, even in Bushwick, we have certain services that I want the children to understand that they need to take advantage of."" Compton-Rock is talking about access to free public education, food, knowledge and social mobility -- elusive things for South Africa's impoverished and particularly so for 1.4 million AIDS orphans there. One of the mentors on this trip is 20-year-old Alicia Gerald. ""I know that in my own experience,"" Alicia says. ""Just having someone put their hand out and say 'I believe that you can be great,' has really helped me rise to those expectations.""  Photos: Meet some of the kids Â» . Alicia is from Bedford-Stuyvesant, a troubled community just blocks away from Bushwick. It's also where Compton-Rock's husband grew up. Compton-Rock has required all of the children selected for the trip to sign one-year contracts to become ""global ambassadors."" As ambassadors they are required to tell their friends and neighbors about their experiences -- through writing, blogging, photographs and speeches. The idea, Compton-Rock explains, is that if a child is given a unique opportunity, she or he, is ""obligated to bore a hole and take someone through with you."" Among the children on Compton-Rock's ""Journey for Change"" mission is Laura DiFilippi, a quiet girl who's overcome a lot of challenges in her 12 years. Constant moving and instability in her family life meant it was tough to find the documents needed for travel. For a while, it seemed as thought she wouldn't be able to get her U.S. passport. With the help of Compton-Rock's assistant, Cece Falls, Laura got the paperwork done and her passport was issued just 24 hours before the kids piled onto the bus for the airport. There is also 15-year-old Jeremy Baker, with a broad smile and slight frame. He is growing up in the projects with four siblings and hits the basketball courts every morning before breakfast during the summer. His dream? ""Senior year I'd get a scholarship to Connecticut, UConn, play there,"" says Jeremy. ""Then, like after my sophomore year in college, go to the NBA, get drafted by Detroit."" It's a dream of many young black men, but a recent study suggests only .03 percent of the youngsters playing ball as seniors in high school actually make it to the NBA. Another young man, who makes magic with the drums and also smiles broadly, is 14-year-old Jonathan Severe. Compton-Rock snaps pictures while dancing to the beat and tapping on a nearby African drum. She is shaking her head in both joy and disbelief, clearly thrilled by what she sees. It's been less than 48 hours since the group has arrived; they haven't even begun their service yet, and already the young man is opening up in a way she had never expected. Jonathan said maybe six words during his interview for entry to the program, and despite Compton-Rock's best mothering skills he never lifted his eyes from the floor. His grandmother came with him to the interview and kicked his leg under the table to get him to speak. It didn't work. He barely spoke and when he did, you could hardly hear him. It wasn't easy for Compton-Rock to decide to take him to Africa. Her selection committee feared he didn't have the communication skills needed to be an ambassador. Two days into the trip and Jonathan is effusive. I literally have to cut him off in interviews to get a word in. To see that, so early on, has been one of the thrills of this trip for me. Two days in and I can already tell this experience will be life-changing for all of us. What will they learn and discover about themselves, and the world? I'll let them tell you. All the kids have been asked to blog about the joys and the challenges, the things they're learning and the disappointments. We're taking photos and documenting every step they take in South Africa. The Bushwick kids came to make a difference in the lives of these vulnerable kids in South Africa. It will be equally interesting to see how South Africa's children make a difference in the lives of these children from Bushwick.","Thirty kids from Bushwick, Brooklyn, took part in ""Journey for Change""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government has aired videos showing three men, who claim to be members of the ousted Baath Party, saying they were involved in last month's devastating Baghdad attacks. In recent months the Iraqi government has played a number of such videos for reporters. Many Iraqis have voiced skepticism about their authenticity. In the videos shown Sunday, the men said they were Baath Party members who were involved in planning and executing the October 25 bombings at government buildings. The two suicide vehicle bombings that struck the Ministry of Justice and other government buildings in October killed 160 Iraqis and wounded more than 500. It was Iraq's deadliest attack in more than two years. The attacks mirrored a pair of bombings on August 19 at the Foreign and Finance Ministries that killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds more. The Islamic State in Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for both the August and October attacks. The Iraqi government has said both attacks were a coordinated effort by Baath loyalists and al Qaeda in Iraq. In recent weeks, the government and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki have stepped up the anti-Baath rhetoric ahead of the country's upcoming national elections, an escalation that some fear is a political ploy to keep some Sunni Arab candidates from running in the elections. Sunni Arabs -- a minority in now-Shiite-led Iraq -- dominated Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, which ran the country for decades and persecuted majority Shiites and minority Kurds. The party is illegal in Iraq now, and most of its former mid- and high-level officials are banned from government jobs. In an interview with al-Iraqia State TV on Sunday night, which re-aired on Monday, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the attacks originated from people in Syria. Al-Dabbagh cautioned that the Iraqi government is not accusing the Syrian government of involvement. He said a group based in Syria was planning and carrying out the attacks. He said the confessions shown Sunday were only a part of the information and confessions the government has. After the August bombings, tensions between Iraq and neighboring Syria reached an all-time high and both countries withdrew their ambassadors. Iraq accused Syria of harboring Baath Party members who, it said, were financing and planning the attacks in Iraq. Earlier in August, al-Maliki and a high-level delegation visited Damascus and asked the Syrian government to hand over a number of mid-level and senior Baathists living in Syria. Syria refused, and the Iraqis accused Syria of supporting the August attacks by providing a refuge for Baathists who were working with al Qaeda in Iraq. In late August, Syria repeated its willingness to help the Iraqis investigate the bombings and discounted the tapes the government had released as fabricated evidence. ""Syria informed the Iraqi side of its readiness to receive an Iraqi delegation to inspect the evidence available to them concerning the bombings' perpetrators,"" a Syrian official said, according to SANA, the state-run news agency. ""Otherwise Syria considers what has been broadcast through the Iraqi media as mere fabricated evidence intended to serve internal political goals, and the conflicting and contradicting statements by the Iraqi officials are proof of that."" The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, told reporters last week that investigations into the October bombings were under way and a number of suspects were in custody. He said al Qaeda in Iraq has teamed up with remnants of the Baath Party -- a statement that gave more weight to the Iraqi government's claims. ""We have been able to significantly reduce the capability of several groups to include al Qaeda and some of the Sunni rejectionist groups, so what I think we have seen happen over the last year or so is that these groups have started to work together. And so they have started to coalesce, especially at the local level. ... So it blurs the lines sometimes. And I think sometimes it's semantics. Some people say al Qaeda, some people call them Baathists. I would argue that they are probably both involved, they are coordinating at the local level,"" Odierno said. When asked if there was any indication the attacks came from Syria, Odierno said: ""I think my experience is that there probably was some movement of fighters or explosives coming in from Syria. But again, we will continue to work our way through that."" Odierno and Iraqi officials have warned that they expect more such high-profile attacks before the January national elections, the country's second national vote since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. ""We believe there will be attempts to conduct more attacks between now and the elections, because they want to destabilize those. We are working hard with Iraqi security force partners to come up with a comprehensive strategy to stop that, we are increasing efforts, the Iraqis are increasing efforts in the belts around Baghdad and Mosul. ... We are increasing our efforts on the borders and we are increasing our counterterrorism targeting, and the tempo of that has increased significantly over the last month or so,"" Odierno said.","Iraqi officials air videos showing alleged confessions by Baath Party members .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama wrote a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il that a U.S. envoy delivered, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. Stephen Bosworth, U.S. special envoy for North Korea, delivered the letter for the North Korean leader during a three-day visit to North Korea last week, the official said. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Bosworth noted last week that, during his visit, he ""communicated President Obama's view that complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is a fundamental undertaking of the six-party process ... and that the absence of progress on denuclearization is an obstacle to improving our relations."" As Obama ""has made it clear, the United States is prepared to work with allies [and] partners in the region to offer ... North Korea a different future,"" he said. Bosworth also said he wanted to reaffirm the goal of ""fully implementing"" a September 2005 joint statement issued by the nations in the six-party talks, declaring that North Korea had ""committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs."" North Korea, however, has refused to return to the talks conducted by the United States, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, insisting that it wants to talk directly with the U.S. government. In April, Pyongyang declared the talks ""dead"" in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests this year. Bosworth's visit did not result in any promise from the North Korean government to return to the six-party negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear program. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, last week called the meeting ""quite positive."" ""It does remain to be seen whether and when the North Koreans will return to the six-party talks, but the bottom line is that these were exploratory talks, not negotiations,"" she said. Clinton previously said the United States was willing to meet bilaterally with North Korea but only within the framework of the six-party talks. She also has warned the United States will not normalize ties with Pyongyang or lift sanctions unless North Korea takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program. Some analysts said North Korea might be trying to buy time with its new outreach to the United States. Recent reports in Seoul, South Korea, have claimed North Korea is in the final stages of restoring its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which Pyongyang had begun to disable before walking away from the six-party talks. Given the secrecy of the North, those reports could not be verified. Analysts said North Korea also is desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain, especially after the U.N. Security Council imposed tougher sanctions on the country in response to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","U.S. envoy delivered Obama's letter while visiting North Korea, official says .

"(CNN)  -- At least 1 million people marked the passing of another year at the iconic ball drop in New York's Times Square, despite an early morning dusting of snow and late-night freezing rain. With the help of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and students from 12 city high schools, the dazzling crystal ball began its descent at 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday. Revelers counted down the final seconds of a decade that many were happy to bid farewell to. Though it seemed the whole world was packed into a small portion of Manhattan, celebrations were spread across the globe. The New Year got under way with blasting horns and fireworks shot from the Sky Tower as revelers partied Friday morning in Auckland, New Zealand. Similar celebrations moved like a wave from east to west as midnight joyously struck across the globe, starting at the International Date Line in the mid-Pacific Ocean. Throngs danced to pounding rock 'n' roll music and cheered a spectacular 12-minute fireworks display over the picturesque Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia. A giant bell rang before a huge crowd in Seoul, South Korea. Crowds across Europe braved near-freezing temperatures to ring in 2010. In London, England, people gathered along the banks of the River Thames to hear Big Ben strike midnight and watch a fireworks display at the London Eye. A multicolored light show at The Eiffel Tower dazzled crowds in Paris, France. Always up for a party, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was among the first places in the Western Hemisphere to say hello to 2010. In New York, security was tight for Thursday night's iconic ball drop. After the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane over Detroit, Michigan, security forces were on high alert. ""We want people to have a happy experience. But we are also concerned about a terrorist event. We have to do that after 9/11,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Celebrating? Share your photos and videos . New York police estimated a million people had already filled the square by early Thursday evening. Weighing 11,875 pounds, the sparkling sphere features 2,668 crystals woven into a triangular pattern and is powered by 32,256 LED lights. It is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million vibrant colors and billions of patterns, according to the event's official Web site. This New Year's ball is also greener, consuming 10 to 20 percent less energy than last year's ball and 78 percent less energy than the 2007 ball. It uses the equivalent amount of energy per hour as two traditional home ovens. The 2010 numerals are also more energy efficient, as Duracell Batteries set up a lab in which visitors ride stationary bikes to provide the power to light the numbers on the ball. Key stories in 2009: You rank them . Times Square has served as one of the most popular sites of New Year's festivities since 1904, though the New Year's Eve ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at One Times Square in 1907. That first ball, built with iron and wood, featured a hundred 25-watt light bulbs and was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metalworker. The New Year's Eve ball has beamed every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943, when America was embroiled in World War II and New York City observed a city-wide ""dimout"" to cut energy costs. As in previous years, security was tight. Police searched garages and subway tunnels for bombs, trash cans were removed and mailboxes and manhole covers were sealed. Detectives were asking hotel and restaurant personnel if they had noticed any suspicious people or activity. See images from Times Square . Law enforcement officials have a number of tools at their disposal to help combat potential crime and terrorism, including sniper teams, bomb-sniffing dogs, infrared radar-equipped helicopters, and radiation detectors on New York's waterways, Kelly said. In the years before terrorism was a concern inside the United States, the Times Square celebration was a rowdy affair, fueled by copious amounts of alcohol, often transported via backpack. These days, alcohol and backpacks are banned from the area on New Year's Eve, and revelers are herded into 2,500-person pens, but the mood is festive nonetheless. New Yorker Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere, a CNN iReporter, said he's too jaded to take part in the spectacle, but that wasn't always the case. ""When the ball drops, it's like an earthquake,"" he said. ""The amount of people screaming and stomping -- it's amazing.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's vision of a new ""Sputnik moment"" for the United States carried echoes of a new ""New Frontier."" If not the Kennedy-era agenda, at least the song by Steely Dan co-founder Donald Fagen. Or perhaps another Fagen tune, ""I.G.Y.,"" with its visions of trains of ""graphite and glitter"" and cities powered by the sun. Obama coupled his pitch with an appeal to a nation groaning under an unemployment rate over 9 percent -- a vision of new technologies, fostered in part by government investment, bringing new jobs. Hearkening back to the stunning 1957 news that the Soviet Union had beaten America into space by launching the first artificial satellite into Earth orbit, Obama said the United States ""had no idea"" how to respond at first. ""The science wasn't even there yet. NASA didn't exist,"" he said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. ""But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs."" Fact Check: What did the Space Race do for the economy? -- Plenty, according to most experts. The space program helped spur the miniaturization of electronics that fueled the computer revolution and spawned the Internet. Other products whose development has been linked to the space program range from cordless drills to car navigation systems. -- The U.S. semiconductor industry grew rapidly from its origins in the late 1940s, ""greatly aided"" by NASA and similar military technology, a 1983 Rutgers University analysis of the industry noted. Today, the industry boasts U.S. sales of $115 billion and employs more than 200,000 people, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. -- The commercial satellite industry, meanwhile, was nonexistent before the 1960s. By 2003, commercial space revenue had topped $90 billion in businesses that employed more than 576,000 people, according to a 2005 paper for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. -- At a 2009 conference in Washington, George Washington University space policy researcher Henry Hertzfeld estimated the space economy at $250 billion, roughly half of which was commercial. But he said the true size was difficult to calculate. Bottom line: . Obama is correct in describing the space program as a boost to nascent U.S. industries. But the goal he set Tuesday night is just the first stage in what is likely to be a tough debate about the role of government in the economy.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Francisca Abreu was anxious. It was February 20, 2007, and she laid her head down on her desk in her seventh-grade science class. Trapped between two worlds, Francisca Abreu became depressed. At 12, she says she wanted to kill herself. ""I was crying; I was very depressed. I had written a note to myself,"" Francisca remembers. ""I just said I can't do this anymore. I want to kill myself."" Francisca's school called home, and her mother, Isabel Valdez, learned for the first time that her daughter was in serious trouble. ""I never told her,"" says Francisca. ""I never bothered her; she probably never bothered to notice."" Such a disconnect between mothers and daughters is what Dr. Luis Zayas, a psychologist at Washington University, suspects is leading an alarming number of Latina teenagers to want to end their lives.  One out of every seven Latina teens, or 14 percent, attempts suicide according to a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of high school students. And Latina high school students have higher attempted suicide rates than white non-Hispanic (7.7 percent) or black non-Hispanic (9.9 percent) girls their age, the CDC reports.  Zayas has spent the last 25 years trying to find out why. He says the typical Latina teen who attempts suicide is 14 or 15, the daughter of immigrant parents, lives in a low-income setting and is caught in an intense battle with her mother over Latino and American cultures.  Research conducted by Zayas has found the girls' parents hold strictly to traditional Latino values, while teens who grow up in America learn ""very different models about what girls should do, can do and are permitted to do."" Zayas is nearing completion of a five-year study of more than 200 Latina teenagers who live in New York City. More than half of those studied have attempted suicide, including Francisca Abreu, who is now 15.  Francisca talks about falling into a deep depression Â» . In 1997, Francisca's mother, Isabel, left the Dominican Republic for the promise of work in the United States. Desperate to find a better life for her three children -- she left them behind. Francisca, who was 3 at the time, says she was devastated. ""I used to tell her, you always say you're going to come but you never do. You always say you're going to call but you never do,"" Francisca says. ""I used to be very depressed because I thought she wasn't going to come."" Four years later, Isabel went back to get Francisca and her brothers to bring them back with her to the United States. But Francisca says life with her mother in the Bronx wasn't what she thought it would be. Her mother worked three jobs, and Francisca barely saw her. As she spent time with her new American friends, the distance grew between Francisca and her mother. When her mother wasn't at work, Francisca says they were fighting. ""There are many girls who are well-behaved,"" Isabel says. ""But there are others who are on the wrong path. They like to flirt. They like hanging out. They like to stay out late. These are not the friends I like for my kids."" Francisca says her mother wanted her to stay home, learn how to cook and clean the house. She says she wasn't allowed to hang out with her friends. ""I did want to do what I want, be outside, not too late, but be outside period. Be able to go to the pool, regular stuff like other kids,"" Francisca recalls. The conflict between mothers and daughters is what Zayas says is driving many of the Latinas he has studied to the brink. Francisca reads her poem . ""Teenagers have certain freedoms; they don't need to consult with their parents to make certain decisions,"" Zayas says. ""That's the culture that's here, and inserted in that is the Latino family that says the family is much more important than the individual."" Trapped between two worlds, Francisca says she fell into a deep depression. ""I would cry about my dad, not being with him. How I missed my country. How I wish I wasn't like this with my mom, or my mom wasn't like this with me,"" Francisca recalls. ""Like she wouldn't be mean to me, [she'd] tell me mean stuff like 'I wish I could put you back in my belly. ... I wish you weren't born.' ""   Isabel says she remembers a difficult child who wouldn't open up. ""She would throw things, stomp her feet. When she got home, all she wanted to do was sleep. She didn't talk and was rude to her brothers and me,"" Isabel says. ""Maybe I wasn't very understanding with her. I don't know."" Trying to escape the pain, Francisca made a desperate choice and decided to take some of her mother's pills. ""I was tired of being another burden in my mom's life,"" Francisca says. But the pain didn't go away. A year later, Francisca was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a teacher found the note she wrote at school. Three days later she was released and started counseling.   Several weeks later, Francisca met 15-year-old Xavier Cardona at school. She says their connection was instant. ""The first time we were ever together, he hugged me, and I felt like, 'Oh my God, that felt so good.' I felt so safe, I felt secure,"" Francisca says. ""It felt good to have someone hug you that way with such meaning."" Breaking all her mother's rules, she skipped school to spend time with Xavier. Then, two days after her 14th birthday, Francisca came home with devastating news -- she was pregnant. ""I felt like I was going to die,"" Isabel remembers. ""I was embarrassed when it came to the rest of the family. What were they going to say? That I was the one who didn't take care of her?"" In November, Francisca gave birth to a baby girl. She named her daughter Destiny, and slowly she says she began to understand her mother better. ""All she did was be a good mother, sacrifice her life for us,"" Francisca says. ""That's all she did."" Today with the help of therapy, Francisca says she's learning to cope with her depression. In June, she shared her experiences about growing up Latina at a fundraising gala for her counseling center. Before hundreds of people, she thanked her mother. ""I came to this country not knowing the language, the people or how it is here,"" Francisca told them. ""But at the end of the day, my mom was my biggest support."" Francisca says she now understands her mother, and Isabel says she understands the struggles of growing up Latina in America. ""At least now she knows I tried to do the best I could,"" Isabel says. ""Times change. My times are different from hers, and I have to understand that.""","At 12, Francisca Abreu says she was so depressed she wanted to end her life .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama announced $8.3 billion in loan guarantees Tuesday for two nuclear reactors to be built in Burke County, Georgia. A new nuclear power plant has not been built in the United States in three decades. The new reactors are to be part of an expansion of an existing nuclear facility near Augusta, Georgia, operated by Atlanta-based Southern Co. The loan guarantees will help create 3,500 on-site construction jobs and 850 permanent operations jobs, administration officials claimed. The reactors will help provide power to over 550,000 homes and 1.4 million people, it said. ""This is only the beginning,"" Obama said during a visit to an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers training facility in Lanham, Maryland. ""We'll continue to provide financing for clean energy projects ... across America."" The president acknowledged that construction of new nuclear facilities will meet with some political resistance. Nuclear development has traditionally been opposed by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party. But nuclear power, he said, remains the country's largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions. ""To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we'll need to increase our supply of nuclear power. It's that simple,"" he said. At the same time, the president argued, traditional Republican proponents of nuclear power should acknowledge that comprehensive energy legislation is needed to help provide incentives to make clean energy more profitable. Any new nuclear facilities, he promised, will ""be held to the highest and strictest safety standards."" Leading congressional Republicans -- including both Georgia senators -- were quick to praise Obama's decision. ""This announcement represents a step in the right direction,"" said Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia. ""The power generated by [the Burke County facility] is safe, reliable, emissions-free and environmentally responsible."" Nuclear power critics, on the other hand, slammed the administration's decision to back the construction of new reactors. ""The last thing Americans want is another government bailout for a failing industry, but that's exactly what they're getting from the Obama administration,"" energy analyst Ben Schreiber said in a press release issued this past weekend. Schreiber works for the progressive group Friends of the Earth, which opposes nuclear power. ""The Department of Energy is putting taxpayers on the hook for bailing out costly and dangerous nuclear reactor projects when the loans used to finance those projects default. This is great news for Wall Street but a bad deal for Main Street."" The risk of default is high, Schreiber argued, while nuclear power ""remains unsafe and dirty."" Energy Secretary Steven Chu, in turn, claimed that modern nuclear reactors are far safer than those built prior to the accident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island in 1979. Chu also told reporters in a conference call that one of the reasons the Georgia facility was the first to receive a federal loan guarantee is the project's low probability of default. He added that the administration is now considering at least a half-dozen additional loan applications for nuclear facilities. We are working ""as hard and as fast as we can"" to ""recapture the lead in nuclear technology,"" Chu said. America has been ""sitting on the sidelines... for far too long."" Obama's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget triples loan guarantees for nuclear power plants to over $54 billion, the White House noted. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux, Evan Glass, Deirdre Walsh and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Modern reactors far safer than pre-Three Mile Island reactors, energy secretary says .

At the end of his show Friday night, Olbermann announced his departure in typical deadpan style, evoking scenes from the film ""Network"" and thanking viewers for keeping him on the air for eight years. ""In the mundane world television goodbyes, reality is laughably uncooperative,"" Olbermann said before launching into a story about his exit from ESPN 13 years ago. ""As God as my witness, in the commercial break just before the emotional moment, the producer got into my earpiece and he said, 'um, can you cut it down to 15 seconds so we get in this tennis result from Stuttgart,'"" he said, half-smiling, pausing for composure. ""So I'm grateful I have a little more time to sign off here. Regardless this is the last edition of 'Countdown.' "" Olbermann thanked his crew and co-workers, with special praise for the man he called ""my greatest protector and most indefatigable cheerleader,"" Tim Russert, the host of NBC's ""Meet the Press"" who died in 2008. Olbermann was suspended for two days in November of 2010 after the news website Politico revealed donations made to to three Democrats seeking federal office. One of them was Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded earlier this month in a mass shooting and attempted assassination in Tucson. He gave $2,400 -- the maximum individual amount allowed -- to Giffords' campaign, and the campaigns of Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway and Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva. Conway lost his bid, while Grijalva and Giffords eked out wins. NBC said the donations violated a policy that requires employees of the news organization to obtain permission ahead of any political donations or activities that could be deemed as a conflict of interest. Olbermann complained publicly about his frustration with NBC's management. He made it clear that he resented the insinuation that he was attempting to hide his actions. ""When a website contacted NBC about one of the donations, I immediately volunteered that there were in fact three of them; and contrary to much of the subsequent reporting, I immediately volunteered to explain all this, on-air and off, in the fashion MSNBC desired,"" Olbermann also said in a statement released during the time. He also accused NBC of ""inconsistently""applying its policy and suspending him without first hearing his side of the story. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Olbermann was suspended in November for making political donations .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens, dignitaries and politicians. South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former  president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday. The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament, with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers. The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim, who died Tuesday of a heart failure. Kim's age at the time of his death was in dispute, with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83. Kim's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Another president, Park Chung-hee, was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979. Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea. The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953. But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor, Roh Moo-hyun. Ahead of the funeral, President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation, who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries. Lee, in turn, reiterated his government's firm stance, presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan was quoted as saying by Yonhap. But in a possible sign that icy relations between the two rival nations are nevertheless thawing, South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday. It was the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years. The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""provocative"" and ""unwise."" CNN's Jake Perez contributed to this report.","South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft had trouble solving the problems with its Vista operating system, so what are its chances of fixing climate change? Burning issue: It's not hip or sexy, but could greenhouse gas accounting be key to combatting climate change? The global software firm has created an online tool called Project 2 Degrees for cities across the world to monitor their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, the hope is, then do something about them. While Bill Gates' company have tailored an online carbon accounting tool for cities, businesses are increasingly turning on to the benefits and need to track their own GHGs, opening up an area for enterprise software companies to provide the best tools for the job. ""A lot of companies are worried and interested in carbon accounting, but don't necessarily feel an urgency to adopt it. But there is enough regulation in the pipeline, certainly in the U.S., that makes it look real and coming in a couple of years,"" said Scott Clavenna of Greentech Media. ""It will go from a niche of a couple of hundred companies using this kind of software right now to thousands."" The call for more carbon accounting doesn't have any emotive ad campaigns or Hollywood celebrity-backing, instead it uses cold hard data to track emissions and empower those responsible to try and reduce them. Cities account for only 2 percent of the worlds land mass but produce up to 75 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, so became the focus for Project 2 Degrees that is a collaboration with software designers Autodesk and the Clinton Climate Initiative. ""This is a long journey for our governments, be they local or national, but we could have the biggest impact by working with local governments as they have the ability to measure what's happening locally in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and to have an effect on the local economy and the local environment first,"" Matt Miszewski, Microsoft's general manager for Worldwide E-government, told CNN. Being one of the world's richest and most profitable companies, Microsoft offers it's online GHG accounting tool for free but says Miszewski, it goes further than that. ""We want to show how software can help solve some very difficult issues. A great deal of the importance of this project is to be able to share this information from city to city, region to region,"" he said. The first cities that will be comparing their CO2 high scores come from the 56 cities associated with the inaptly named C40 group that is in partnership with the Clinton Climate Initiative. New York and Sydney were heavily involved in beta testing of Project 2 Degrees that started last year, and once more results are in it will be offered to around 1,000 other cities. ""It is eye opening to be able to chart actual emissions against targets to see the quantum of emissions reductions required. Typically these figures are not so readily accessed and this will be a major benefit of Project 2 Degrees,"" a spokesperson for Sydney's local government told CNN. Who accounts for what? Even if the tool is working as well as possible, it seems more needs to be done by businesses and cities to accurately collect and measure GHG emissions. ""Higher level guidance should come in the form of advising what emissions to report and provision of data where possible, however each city needs to take responsibility for the emissions it creates,"" a spokesperson for Sydney told CNN. Knowing what needs to be reported is a challenge that is being met. The World Resources Institute's Greenhouse Gas Protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool for both governments and businesses, covering the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol. ""The World Resources Institute has done a really good job in defining the protocols in the data gathering. What do you gather from where and how do you report it? Now everyone is starting to compare apples to apples,"" Clavenna told CNN. It could be a boom area for carbon accounting software developers. As well as numerous start-ups the big players including Microsoft's non-altruistic arm and SAP have begun their own programs aimed at businesses. ""The stakes are high for enterprise software,"" said Clavenna. ""The big players are not aggressively marketing yet, but getting ready to come out with a big product when their customers need it."" Over 200 companies are developing accounting software, according to research by Greentech Media, and over 3,000 businesses are using their products to track their GHG emissions. Big corporations including Dell, Xerox and Pfizer have all been early adopters stretching back to 2002. Limited carbon emissions regulations, such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and at state level in the U.S., are in place, and a number of international voluntary programs also exist. Yet most of the early-adopter businesses are responding to public pressure for them to be environmentally-aware and shareholder requests for their business to be greener. ""There have been some light triggers -- stakeholder requests, even in HR, young people asking for proof that their company is green. In a down economy a company can choose to put them aside or table them for a while,"" said Clavenna. But more significant factors are on the horizon: ""The big triggers are a cap and trade regime, which [in the U.S.] would come through congress and set by the EPA who will say which companies need to report and what they need to report,"" said Clavenna. A cap and trade program would mean thousands more companies would have to account for and report their GHG emissions as a market is created to trade excess CO2. Strict accounting of emissions can also be a means to beat some corporate 'greenwashing', particularly in terms of companies making claims over their carbon footprints. Ultimately however it is about reducing those footprints and aiming to limit global warming to only 2 degrees Celsius. ""There is a market out there for software that manages cap and trade, both from an intergovernmental aspect and a commercial aspect. Copenhagen will be a tipping point for those kinds of activity to move forward world wide. These folks are going to have an increased responsibility,"" said Miszewski.","Greenhouse gas emissions software designed to track and then reduce GHGs .
Microsoft developed online tool for cities; many more designed for businesses .
Worldwide over 3,000 businesses use carbon accounting software; number to rise .
Being able to quantify emissions will lead to more effective action say analysts ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hailed as India's greatest actor, he's the legendary star of Sholay and leader of the mighty Bachchan clan. CNN talked to Amitabh Bachchan, the De Niro of Bollywood, at an International Indian Film Academy event in London... ......................................... Amitabh Bachchan talks to Myleene on the green carpet at the Indian Film Awards in Yorkshire, England . CNN: Right now, it's an exciting time for Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan: Yes, I think it is. It's a great progression from where we were a few years ago, where even though we were the highest-making film nation in the world, we were looked upon with a certain amount of criticism and skepticism about our content and the way we make our films. Gradually, over the years, people have come to expect and accept that this is how we make the films, and it's all turning out to be profitable and exciting with viewers all over the world. CNN: Why do you think people had been so skeptical? Bachchan: Well, they felt that the content wasn't exciting enough, they couldn't understand the song and dance routine, they didn't like the very cliched stories or formulaic storylines, but that's the way we are. We must have song and dance in our lives; we've had it ever since the inception of cinema in India. Our stories are very social-based, very human-based. We are a very emotional nation. All our culture and tradition of over 5,000 years has come through a lot of heat and fire and eventually come out on top. That's how it is, and that's how it's going to remain. CNN: Is Bollywood escapism for the Indian people? Bachchan: You have to see it in a larger perspective. There are large numbers of people in India below the poverty line, there are large numbers of people who lead a meager existence. They want to find a little escape from the hardships of life, and come and watch something colorful and exciting and musical. Indian cinema provides that. So yes, the content of our television and our cinema is escapist in nature because we are there to provide entertainment. The select group of people who do make realistic cinema, who do make cinema perhaps a little more acceptable to the Western audience, is a very small percentage. CNN: What are the main differences between a Hollywood and a Bollywood actor? Bachchan: Conceptually we are both the same. We are all human beings, we are actors, we are put in different situations and conditions and we act. Perhaps the content of the Indian cinema is a lot more varied and diverse as compared to the ones the Hollywood actors get associated with. They more or less have a very single track presence, so to say. Indian actors, because of the format of our stories, need to be good actors, and be able to perform emotional sequences, do a bit of comedy, dance and singing, action, because all of this forms just one film. In many ways I'd say there are greater demands on Indian actors than there are on Hollywood. CNN: So do you think Hollywood actors could learn from the Bollywood actors? Bachchan: I don't know that we are worthy enough for learning something from us, but I do know that actors in India are very capable, very talented, and can be compared to the best anywhere in the world. CNN: What makes you the best actor in India? Bachchan: I don't use any techniques; I'm not trained to be an actor. I just enjoy working in films. It's more instinctive rather than anything else. I don't do the calculated rehearsed kind of approach, and I hope that I can continue that because I believe that instinct is much stronger and greater when you are performing on camera. CNN: Tell us about the upcoming remake of ""Sholay."" Bachchan: ""Sholay"" is an extraordinary film. It's the highest-grossing film and it had a great impact on our society. Obviously remaking it is a huge task. We are purely using the inspiration of the film. I am playing the baddie in the film, as opposed to one of the leading men in the original. It's a great challenge for any actor to do something different in a film. I will obviously not be playing the leading man, but it's exciting. At my age you don't get to run after the girl and win them over and fight the baddie, but I'm happy that I'm doing the negative role in this film and I'm enjoying it! CNN: Tell us about ""Sarkar 2"" -- it's becoming a bit of a family affair! Bachchan: It's a very powerful film, it takes influences from the Godfather. It's not exactly a remake, but it took inspiration from the Godfather and put it in ""Sarkar."" We are now doing ""Sarkar 2,"" which is going to have Abhishek, my son, and his wife to be, so I think it will be wonderful for the three of us to work together again. Sarkar 2 will be a much larger film, larger in concept, larger in visuals. It promises to be very exciting. CNN: Is it nice to work with your family? Bachchan: The entire filming industry in India is one big family. We all feel that way whenever we make a film: it's a very homely feeling; we all live together, eat together, move around together. It's a wonderful feeling. I don't know how Hollywood behaves, but this is how we behave, and yes, when you have members of the family working with you it makes it all the more exciting. CNN: What's next for you? Bachchan: I think that it's important that actors keep getting challenged every day. For every creative person it's a terrible moment when they say they have done all they want to do. I like to feel the butterflies in the stomach, I like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how I'm going to be able to accomplish this feat, get jittery. That hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people. I'd like to believe that tomorrow is another challenge for me. I'm sure there is lots more for me to do, because there is lots and lots of stuff still to be explored. E-mail to a friend .","CNN talked to Amitabh Bachchan, the De Niro of Bollywood .

"(CNN) -- From ""Mississippi Masala"" to ""Vanity Fair,"" Mira Nair's movies have entranced audiences in India and the West. CNN spoke to the director of ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Salaam Bombay!"" at the Bollywood Movie Awards in Long Island about filmmaking in India and America and her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel about loss and family, ""The Namesake."" ............................... Film director Mira Nair . CNN: What inspired you to make ""The Namesake""? Mira Nair: I happened to read ""The Namesake"" on a plane in early 2004, when I traveled from New York to Jo'berg to finish the filming of ""Vanity Fair."" I read ""Namesake"" while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [Mira's mother in law]. It was at that state of mourning that I picked up this novel, and in it Jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country, and I thought I had been understood by someone. It was also a story that linked the two cities in which I had grown up -- Calcutta and New York City -- and it was almost certainly the road that I had traveled. It just spoke to me and I felt compelled to do this film. A few months later we were shooting it. CNN: It's filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures. Tell us about the universal themes involved during the film. Nair: Well, the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills. It's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another, and tried to find out who we are through these places. Then when we have children, life gets more interesting. It is about growing up through our adult lives and our children's lives. It is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who don't send roses and diamonds for love; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other. It's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another, versus the clang and hustle of young Gogol who is 15 and grows up in an American world because he wishes to be American. That flow -- that see-saw between parents and children, that's what ""The Namesake"" is about. CNN: Tell us about casting the role of Gogol. Nair: Well, Kal Penn plays Gogol and he's known as a comic star, but I had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said, ""This has to be your Gogol."" I didn't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home: ""Tell me in the morning it's Kal Penn!"" he would say. And then Kal wrote to me and told me he became an actor because he had seen ""Mississippi Masala"" when he was eight years old and realized people on the screen could look like him, and other such seductive things. He came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing, and so much the real thing, that I cast him as Gogol. CNN: How have Indian audiences reacted to your heavily western-influenced films? Nair: It's not that different a kind of audience, that's what pleases me. ""Salaam Bombay!"" we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff, and also with ""Deeply Alternative,"" which ran for 27 weeks. ""Monsoon Wedding"" was also a big hit in India. But no, they don't come to my films for Bollywood fare; it's a completely alternative thing. In terms of audiences on both sides, I've been blessed: the films have been really well received and highly anticipated. CNN: ""The Namesake"" was filmed in America and India. What differences were there in the two locations? Nair: In India it is more about orchestrating chaos, and it's about sifting the chaos, but I get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on, and in America it's about paying for the chaos, you know every head has to be placed there and paid for. CNN: ""The Namesake"" is about not losing the identity of Indian culture. Was that a challenge? Nair: I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do. It so happens because I am fluent in both worlds that my films enter both worlds, perhaps. CNN: Do Indian and American audiences behave differently? Nair: No, not really. I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That's what I hope to do when I make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Africa is not a country, and Africans generally do not live in trees or hunt game with spears. Nor do they all walk around in the nude among lions and zebras. Chinedu Ezeamuzie shows some of his company's Web designs after an interview last week. African immigrants to the United States say cartoonish caricatures and a Western media penchant for reporting on Africa's disease, hunger and war -- rather than the continent's successes -- trivialize their cultures. They complain they have trouble dispelling the stereotypes once they arrive in the States. They concede, though, the myths run both ways and some say they were surprised to find their values more often aligned with those of white Americans than African-Americans. ""I have been laughed at because of my accent and asked all the ignorant questions,"" said iReporter Ajah-Aminata N'daw, 25, of Fall River, Massachusetts. ""Questions like: Did I live on a tree? Roam the jungles naked? Have wild animals at home?"" N'daw emigrated from Dakar, Senegal, in 2001. She works in a hair-braiding salon and has met African-Americans who share her values of hard work and family, but in most cases, ""we are raised differently, taught different values and held up to a different moral code."" iReport: Read why N'daw is not African-American . Gaddafi Nkosi, 18, recently graduated from The Piney Woods School, a historically African-American boarding school about 22 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. He has since returned to Pretoria, South Africa, but recalled well the misnomers he faced in the U.S. ""I came down from South Africa and so many people thought that maybe that's a jungle or maybe I'd go out chasing lions or something like that,"" he said.  African, black students find common ground at Mississippi school Â» . Nkosi's American classmates acknowledge their misconceptions. Cydney Smith, 17, of Nashville, Tennessee, said she once believed Africa was populated with ""uncivilized tribes."" Raphael Craig, 17, of Hyattsville, Maryland, said the television misinformed him as well. Before Craig visited the continent in 2005 and 2006, he thought of Africans as ""half-naked, running around with tigers in the jungle,"" Craig said, confessing he was unaware tigers roam only Asia. But in Ghana and Nigeria, Craig saw children playing the same games he and his siblings played. He saw many signs of modernity, including Mercedes and other brands of cars found in the United States. ""OK, this country is running how we're running, just two different schools,"" Craig recalled thinking. ""It really opened my eyes to the point that everything you see on TV is not always the actual thing."" If the Western media are doing Africans no favors, then the African media are also a disservice to African-Americans because it portrays them as criminals, some immigrants say. Sandi Litia, 19, a Piney Woods graduate from Limulunga, Zambia, said she was initially scared of African-Americans because the African media show them ""wearing clothes like gangsters and killing each other."" Nkosi concurred that African media ""made it seem as if they were these aggressive people that did nothing constructive with their lives except occupy prison space."" Trying to fit in . Chinedu Ezeamuzie, 21, of Athens, Georgia, arrived in 2003. He had spent the majority of his life in Jabriya, Kuwait, and came to the U.S. to pursue his education. The recent Georgia Tech graduate said he considers himself Nigerian because his parents -- both from the village of Uga -- instilled in their four children strong Nigerian values of family, community, spirituality and self-betterment.  Test your Africa knowledge with a quiz Â» . In Athens, Ezeamuzie found his ideals at odds with those who shared his skin color at Clarke Central High School, his first stint in a public school. On his first day, he donned khakis, a button-down dress shirt and nice leather shoes. He caught the African-Americans' attention upon stepping into the cafeteria, he said. ""They give me the look,"" he said. ""Why is this guy dressed like the white folks, like the preppy guys?"" Ezeamuzie didn't understand why so few black students were in his advanced-placement classes. He didn't understand the de facto lunchroom segregation or the accusing glances he got for eating with white classmates. One classmate called him a traitor and asked, ""Do you not like black people?"" ""My whole life I had reaped benefits from being in different circles and bridging them,"" so he wanted to fit in, he said. iReport: What are the unique struggles of being African in America? He found clothes akin to what he saw many African-Americans wearing --- baggy pants and an oversized T-shirt. He relaxed his British-trained tongue and tried out for the basketball team, the 6-foot-5 Ezeamuzie said. Ezeamuzie recalled finding himself more confused by his experience with some African-Americans: Why were they so cliquish? Why did they mock students for being intelligent? Why were they homophobic and bent on using the n-word? Why did every conversation seem to involve drugs, girls or materialism? ""They kind of accepted me. They saw me a little differently, but I was thinking this is a very narrow mindset,"" Ezeamuzie said. Ezeamuzie and other Africans say they feel African-Americans too often dwell on slavery and the racism that has persisted for more than a century since the Emancipation Proclamation. ""We have all been tortured,"" said iReporter Vera Ezimora, 24, a Nigerian student living in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Now that we are free, holding on to the sins of white men who have long died and gone to meet their maker is more torture than anything we have suffered."" iReport: Read about questions Ezimora faced when she came to the U.S. Values at core of misunderstanding? Martin Mohammed, president of the U.S. African Chamber of Commerce, estimates there are 3 million African immigrants in the U.S. -- about twice the U.S. Census Bureau estimate. He has heard from numerous immigrants struggling to find commonalities with Americans who share their skin color. Mohammed emigrated from Somalia in 1998 and is now naturalized. He considers himself African-American, but ""it does not mean that I have already assimilated into the culture."" Values and upbringings may lie at the center of the cultures' misunderstanding of each other, he said. Many Africans come to the U.S. to escape dire conditions such as poverty or civil war. Their objectives are often advancing their education or finding good jobs, Mohammed said. They also strive to reunite their families, or at least support them back home. Remittances from the U.S. to Africa total about $20 billion annually, according to the World Bank. However, African immigrants find that education and good jobs elude their African-American brethren, and there is a perception that many African-American men aren't committed to supporting their families, Mohammed said. The two cultures have much to teach each other -- especially politically and economically -- but they must accept they have something to learn. ""Honestly, what we need to do is realize both cultures are important,"" Mohammed said. Myths thrive on ignorance . iReporter Emeka Aniukwu, 35, hails from Ebenebe, Nigeria, and said he has heard all the American misperceptions about Africa, but the cure to ignorance is communication. He began dating Sonya Roberts, 25, of Austin, Texas, shortly after he arrived in the U.S. in March 2005. She taught him about African-American culture, and he taught her about Nigeria. The couple married two years ago. ""Talk to people, stop showing ugly face and don't be shy about your accent,"" he advised African immigrants. ""Most of the media coverage about Africa is all about hunger, diseases and war, so what do you expect? People are curious and just want to know, so calm down and educate them as much as you can."" iReport: Read why Aniukwu loves Africa-Americans . At Piney Woods, where about 35 of the 200 students emigrate from Africa, the school's president, Reginald Nichols, concurs that education is integral to understanding. He's heard Africans say the African-Americans are aggressive, while the African-Americans accuse Africans of being reserved -- but the more they mingle the more they mesh, he said. ""You have the African students tell me that they have learned so much about standing up from the African-American students, and the African-American students said they've learned how to simmer down, so it's a wonderful thing,"" Nichols said. Mohammed, too, said he'd like to see more African-Americans dispelling myths about Africa, which is increasingly important as Africans in the U.S. begin wielding more economic influence. The chamber estimates African immigrants have about $50 billion in annual purchasing power. Numbers from the University of Georgia's Selig Center of Economic Growth indicate the number is just behind the nation's Native American community, which had $61.8 billion in buying power last year. The entire African-American market was estimated at $913 billion and the Hispanic market at $951 billion. History dictates that economic power precedes political power. Mohammed said Africans can learn much about politics from African-Americans because of their ""level of influence in Washington."" ""I'm also interested to the extent that the black population can play a role in solving global conflict. We can help these discussions around the globe, but we must begin here in the U.S.A.,"" he said. iReporter Faraji Goredenna, 53, of Layton, Utah, said he encourages African-Americans to learn more about Africa and lend a hand to Africans so they know ""America's institutions and opportunities are open to them, too."" iReport: Read how Goredenna embraces both cultures . But he'd like a symbiotic relationship, he said, explaining, ""We African-Americans want to learn more about our history and culture as it exists in Africa, but we have also created a culture for ourselves here that we ask our brothers and sisters from Africa to respect.""

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani military reported killing 40 militants Thursday near the border with Afghanistan -- the latest in a string of clashes in a frontier region rife with extremism. Pakistani soldiers carry their weapons as they patrol. On the other side of the border, however, security forces have made such gains that a top American commander said Wednesday he does not expect a Taliban offensive in eastern Afghanistan this spring. The flare-up of violence on the Pakistani side of the border, along with the commander's comments in Washington, suggest that the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies may be focusing more on western Pakistan even as violence subsides just across the border in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently noted the increase in activity in Pakistan. ""Al Qaeda right now seems to have turned its face toward Pakistan and attacks on the Pakistani government and Pakistani people,"" he said on December 31. In the latest clashes in Pakistan, the military said it killed 40 ""miscreants"" and detained 30 in South Waziristan, a remote tribal region on the Afghan border that is a stronghold for militants allied to the Taliban and al Qaeda. Clashes between the Pakistani armed forces and militants there have killed scores of people in recent weeks. The increasing violence on the Pakistani border comes amid security improvements just over the border, in eastern Afghanistan, according to an assessment provided Wednesday by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. David Rodriguez, who commands American forces in eastern Afghanistan. The general said Wednesday that he did not expect the Taliban to launch an offensive in eastern Afghanistan this spring, as some have expected. The United States recently announced plans to send about 3,000 Marines to southern Afghanistan, however, citing the possibility of a spring offensive in that region. In the eastern part of the country, Afghan and American security forces report fewer militants crossing into the country from Pakistan, Rodriguez said. Challenges remain, he said, but functioning local governments and increased commerce have boosted confidence.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It has taken nearly two decades and $8.6 billion, but London Heathrow's Terminal Five finally opened for business Thursday morning. A general view of the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport prior to its official opening on Thursday. When British Airways Flight 26 touched down from Hong Kong at 4:42 a.m. (12:42 a.m. ET), passengers made their way to the 400-meter-long terminal, the largest freestanding building in Britain. With 60 aircraft stands actually attached to two new buildings, ""T5"" can handle dozens of planes at the same time -- including the new Airbus A380 superjumbo -- and can process 12,000 bags an hour. All of this is for just one occupant: British Airways. It's a new era for BA and the 30 million passengers who will pass through T5 each year. Both have suffered for years at the four older terminals of what's been derided as ""Hassle Heathrow."" ""I've been very critical of the airport,"" BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told CNN. ""(It's) because of the problems we have faced as a result of poor infrastructure at the airport. ""So we now have the infrastructure. We have a state of the art baggage system; we've got a state of the art terminal building. We've got lounges like you have never seen before and it will be down to us and it will be down to the people at British Airways to make it a success."" Part of this strategy is to get passengers to the airport earlier to avoid delays. Travelers will be encouraged to check in online, and there will only be 54 of the classic check-in desks compared to 96 self-check-in kiosks. No passengers will be allowed through if they arrive less than 35 minutes before their flight. For those having to wait in the terminal, airport operator BAA built T5 with 112 shops and restaurants, including British chef Gordon Ramsey's first airport eatery. Critics say T5 is just a massive shopping mall, but the architect says it's a throwback to old-fashioned travel. ""We wanted to make the experience of being in an airport exciting. We wanted to capture the spirit of travel,"" architect Richard Rogers told CNN. ""The greatest stations, whether it is New York or London, the 19th century stations did exactly that."" BA rival Virgin Atlantic calls it a gift for BA. Airport expansion protesters say it's just the latest step in a fierce battle to enlarge the world's busiest international airport. Heathrow sits to the west of London in a densely populated area. There are already plans for a sixth terminal and a third runway. Supporters say expansion is vital for London's economy, but environmentalists say expanding London's three main airports -- Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted -- will only add to harmful climate change. More expansion may be years away, but T5 will affect most travelers using Heathrow. Many of the other airlines will be shuffled around the other four terminals over the coming months, and next year Terminal Four is expected to undergo major renovation. ""Hassle Heathrow"" may not be an outdated criticism just yet. E-mail to a friend .","Heathrow Airport's $8.6 billion new Terminal 5 finally opens to public .

"Dutch Harbor, ALASKA (CNN) -- In Dutch Harbor the smell of fish wafting from the docks and the canneries is the smell of money. And lately, the town has smelled a lot less fishy. High seas high jinx: Tobias gives his shipmate Hanns a haircut at sea using a sail bag as a barber cape. Over fishing, new quota systems and changes in expected weather patterns have all played a role in changing the face of this once swashbuckling Alaskan town, fishermen say. ""Last summer we thought that pollock fishing was over for good, it was so bad. Time to turn out the lights and go home. But then they cut the quotas by 30 percent and now there are some small signs of more small fish, so maybe they are coming back,"" said Guy Collins, who coordinates with fishing captains who unload their catch at the Unisea docks in Dutch Harbor. ""The fishermen have to go further north toward Russia now to get the fish that are near the ice. It used to be the boats would go out 100 miles, now they go out 500. It could be partly due to temperature change and weather patterns."" Dutch Harbor saw a revival in popularity with the reality show The Deadliest Catch, but even the high-fiving enthusiasm of the deck hands on the TV show can't match what the town was like in the glory days. ""Those were the days, in the mid 1980's, there was booze, drugs and partying. You had lines of coke going down the bar and no one said anything,"" says Byron Singley, captain of the 24-ton fishing boat the Nancy Allen. ""People were making big money and spending it as fast as it came in. I earned $78,000 as a deckhand the first year I was here but I can't remember where it went. Those days are long gone."" Aboard the Silent Sound, as we sail north through the Bering Sea, we're finding other things are not quite like they used to be. For starters, we've been becalmed for much of the trip when we were expecting to encounter strong winds on the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. We have motored nearly half of our 2,300 miles so far. More importantly, the ice we were bracing ourselves for may not be where we expected to find it. While this is good news for the expedition from a sailing perspective, it's less attractive for wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses that use the ice as a platform for hunting, mating and migration. ""The present extent of northern sea ice is very similar to the extents at this time in 2008 and in 2007. It is close to values seen also in 1995 and 1990. It is about five per cent below the long-term average of 12.2m square kilometers,"" said Dr Humfrey Melling, a research scientist with the Institute of Ocean Sciences near Victoria, British Columbia. September 2007 was the first time that the Northwest Passage was open water from end to end. An ice forecast issued by the Canadian Ice Service on July 1 showed earlier than normal break up in many key areas in the Western Arctic. ""In the Western Arctic region, the breakup pattern is one to three weeks early in many coastal areas and by as much as one month in isolated areas,"" the report said. But we're still some 400 miles from the Arctic Circle and a month from entering the heart of the Northwest Passage, which gives the Arctic plenty of time to surprise us.","Team aims to discover how climate change has affected Arctic and Inuit people .

"(CNN)  -- An al Qaeda spokesman released a video message in English offering condolences to its ""unintended Muslim victims"" killed in attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere. Adam Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, appeared in a 17-minute video released on Islamist online forums late Friday. Al Qaeda ""have condemned and continue to condemn"" all attacks by Western powers or ""secular political forces,"" Gadahn said. ""We express our condolences to the families of the Muslim men, women and children killed in these criminal acts,"" he said in the video. ""And we ask Allah to have mercy on those killed and accept them as shohadaa (martyrs)."" ""We also express the same in regard to the unintended Muslim victims of the mujahedeen's operations against the crusaders and their allies and puppets, and to the countless faceless and nameless Muslim victims of the murderous crusades"" in Afghanistan, Pakistan's Waziristan regions and Swat Valley, and elsewhere, he said. It is a rare example of al Qaeda offering condolences to the families of those killed in the group's own attacks. The video comes nearly two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, as part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government. Obama said he would begin sending the additional troops in early 2010, with the goal of starting to withdraw all forces from Afghanistan by July 2011. The additional forces, Obama said, will help accelerate the handing over of responsibility to Afghan forces. U.S. commander: We cannot have endless surge . The video did not address the troop surge, but Gadahn had a general warning to any countries partnering with the United States in the region. ""Those who have made the foolish decision to stand with America and its allies in their losing war against Islam ... you have not only betrayed Islam and Muslims and left the fold of faith, but you have also caused the destabilization of nations and the displacement ... of thousands of weak and oppressed people,"" Gadahn said. ""The blood of countless Muslims is on your hands, and the security and very future of the countries you claim to defend and serve has been placed in jeopardy because your external enemies are taking advantage of your heedlessness as you fight and kill your fellow countrymen for American dollars."" The al Qaeda member is an American-born Muslim convert who has released video and audio statements in the past. Gadahn is on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists. The FBI says Gadahn was indicted in the Central District of California for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to Gadahn's alleged involvement in a number of terrorist activities, including providing ""aid and comfort"" to al Qaeda and services for al Qaeda. Pakistani news outlets reported twice in 2008 that Gadahn had been killed by a predator drone strike, but al Qaeda then released a video message by Gadahn to prove he was still alive. Al Qaeda uses Gadahn to issue messages to a wider and English-speaking audience. His whereabouts are unknown. Many analysts believe Gadahn remains in touch with al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri.","Adam Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, appeared in video released on Internet .

"(CNN) -- ""Within the oil crisis and climate change there is the opportunity for an economic, social and cultural renaissance the likes of which we have never seen before,"" says environmentalist and perma-culture designer Rob Hopkins. Falmouth in England is one of many towns across the world that have 'transition' initiatives. ""If only we can just unleash all the creativity and genius around us, rather than just lurching from crisis to crisis."" Hopkins is the founder of the ""Transition Town"" movement, and the author of its bible, ""The Transition Handbook."" The movement was founded in Totnes, Devon, and Kinsale, Ireland, in 2005 and 2006, with the aim of helping those communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil output and climate change. Since then it's spread across the United Kingdom and to towns across the world. There are now 60 other projects already in action, and nearly 700 others considering getting involved. There is even a Transition storyline on the popular BBC radio soap opera, ""The Archers."" Fundamentally, it's a grassroots initiative, and Hopkins believes that the move to an oil-free society is about community and individuals more than industry and government. ""We use about nine barrels of oil each per year in the UK,"" he says. ""The first three we can influence ourselves, the next three are down to our communities, and the final third are the Government's responsibility. We try and focus on the first six barrels."" Transition works by helping local people get together and find ways they can reduce their reliance on oil as a community, and cut their carbon footprint in the process. In Totnes, Transition have created local food guides, formed a sustainable building company, given talks and lectures to landowners and local government officials to show them how peak oil and climate change affect their management decisions. They have even created an alternative currency, the ""Totnes Pound"", which can only be spent within the town in an attempt to localize the economy and reduce reliance on imports. The fact that so much food was brought into this rural, agricultural region from many hundreds of miles away seemed one of the crazier excesses of the cheap oil era Hopkins believes is already over. In an attempt to change this -- both to prepare for the day it becomes too expensive and increase the town's resilience - Transition Totnes encourages everyone to grow their own food. They operate a ""garden share"" scheme that unites keen gardeners without land with those who don't have the time, or fitness, to tend their own patch. They are also aiming to make Totnes the nut tree capital of Britain. ""We have identified unloved and derelict bits of the town, planted fruit and nut trees and trained the people living nearby how to look after them,"" says Hopkins. ""You can get more protein and carbohydrate per hectare from a hybrid nut tree than anything else."" So far, Transition estimate between 10 and 15 per cent of the population have had some involvement with them. Ideas spreading from the fringes to the mainstream . Totnes is a town with a strong tradition of alternative lifestyles and environmental awareness, and exactly the sort of place Transition would appeal: the high street is crammed with health food shops and healers. But in the two years the program has been in operation, word has spread and the concept seems to have struck a chord with thousands of people across Britain, many in areas without such a radical precedent. ""Now the people getting involved now aren't just the usual suspects, the hard core environmentalists,"" says Hopkins. ""We have professionals, teachers, the Women's Institute. ""The Archers"" storyline was, for me, a real indication we had reached into Middle England. ""One of the reasons why Transition has grown so fast is that it's expanded into a vacuum. ""People have known about climate change for some time, and now the idea of peak oil is spreading fast. But there was a real lack of action, what could you do after you'd felt bad about it all for a few days? That's where Transition comes in. ""It's not about finding out whose fault it is and chaining yourself to them, it's about rediscovering old skills, like thrift; being practical, taking control. ""Fifty years ago we all had these skills, but now we've become the most useless generation ever to walk this planet. One of the nice things about Transition is that it brings older people in and makes them feel valued -- because they know these things."" Transition works by uniting local communities and forming groups to tackle individual areas -- energy, food, housing -- with the ultimate aim being the construction of an ""Energy Descent Plan"" to plot out a twenty year divorce from oil. ""The British government's own plans for the future assumes oil will be $65 a barrel in 2010. Well, it has already hit $136, with many analysts predicting $200 soon, so it's quite clear they are not thinking this through. ""I think [UK prime minister] Gordon Brown could really do with being honest about energy. At the moment he isn't and that's a very dangerous situation to be in. It's no good saying we'll up North Sea production or going off to talk to the King of Saudi Arabia, we need leadership that takes a proper appraisal."" Hopkins acknowledges that it's hard for governments to take action until they know the country is behind them, but argues again, that's where Transition comes to the rescue. ""We can help create that mandate,"" he says, ""and revitalize democracy in the process.""","'Transition towns' help local people get together to work to toward an oil-free future .

"(CNN) -- The U.S Army has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military, the Pentagon and a group representing him said. Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi, a doctor, is a Sikh, a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair. Kalsi filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion. This month the Army granted his request, the Sikh Coalition told CNN. The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair. The civil rights group hailed the move as ""a major step toward ending a 23-year-old policy that excludes Sikhs from service."" Kalsi said he was ""overjoyed."" ""Like the many Sikhs who fought before me, I know I will serve America with honor and excellence,"" he said in a written statement. But the Sikh Coalition provided what it said was a copy of the letter from the Army. Maj. Gen. Gina Farrisee said in the letter that Kalsi's ""beard, uncut hair, and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times."" She said her ruling applies only to Kalsi's case, and is not a change of Army policy. ""This accommodation is based solely on the facts and circumstances of your case,"" the letter said. ""This accommodation does not constitute a blanket accommodation for any other individual."" She said the exception could be revoked ""due to changed conditions."" Her letter was dated October 22 and released by the Sikh Coalition the next day. Kalsi is not the only Sikh asking permission to keep his hair, beard and turban while serving in the Army. Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan, a dentist, applied at the same time as Kalsi. His case has been deferred until he receives the results of his dental board examinations, the Sikh Coalition told CNN. Both were scheduled to report for active duty in July. The Sikh Coalition said Kalsi and Rattan had been assured when they were recruited to join the Army's Health Professions Scholarship that their unshorn hair and turbans ""would not be a problem."" ""Both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in July 2009. However, the U.S. Army is now disputing their ability to serve with their Sikh identity intact,"" the Sikh Coalition said in an April 14 letter addressed to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""It doesn't make sense to me, especially in these hard times,"" Kalsi told CNN at the time. ""The military is hurting for professionals. They need doctors, they need nurses."" Amardeep Singh, the head of the Sikh Coalition, told CNN in the spring that the issue affects observant Sikhs, not those Sikh-Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair. The issue is important for the roughly 500,000-strong American Sikh community, Singh said. Sikhs faced hostility after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when people associated them with al Qaeda terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants' appearance. The Sikh religion was founded in India. ""The perception is still there,"" Singh said. ""We're sort of still feeling it."" He said surveys chronicle the problems Sikhs face. Among them is one conducted in the Queens borough of New York City recently in which children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse, he said. ""These kids are being harassed in New York. It's Queens, the most diverse county in the United States. If this is happening in Queens, it's happening in other parts of the country."" So, he said, the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army sends the opposite message  -- ""that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country."" CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi is a doctor in the U.S. Army, practicing Sikh .

"(CNN) -- It's the season of brackets, beer and, of course, basketball. Duke Blue Devils fans cheer on their team at the ACC Tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. Come mid-March, the country falls sick with college basketball fever, and the NCAA Tournament is all the talk. As men's college basketball comes to a close with the last game April 6, fans are anxiously watching to see who will claim victory in this year's national championship game. More than a century after James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA training school in Massachusetts, the sport continues to captivate millions of fans. Over the years, college basketball has sparked great dedication among its fans, from those who camp out for three months for a ticket to those who attended games before they could read. CNN, with the help of experts at the NCAA, chose a handful of basketball towns filled with great fans, rich traditions and history that make these places worth a visit. 1. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill . College basketball is deeply rooted in North Carolina culture, thanks to the success of the men's teams at the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The epic rivalry between Duke's Blue Devils and North Carolina's Tar Heels draws in so many fans that some sports experts say it is partly responsible for reviving the waning college basketball viewership in the first half of this decade. Visitors will find that Duke basketball fans don't shower their support only on game day. At Duke University -- seeded No. 2 in the East -- student fans, dubbed the Cameron Crazies, are so eager to snare one of the 1,200 first-come-first-serve spots in the Cameron Stadium student section that they camp out for up to three months for the infamous North Carolina-Duke matchup. The grassy tenting area outside the basketball arena, known as Krzyzewskiville, is named after Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has been named National Coach of the Year 12 times. ""It's so easy to become enthralled with the culture of Duke basketball,"" said Joel Burrill, a senior who headed up the tenting efforts this year. Outside the stadium, visitors will discover plenty of Blue Devil spirit off-campus in Durham, a former tobacco town. Satisfaction Restaurant and Charlie's Pub & Grille are among the favorite hot spots where visitors will discover student and local fans watching the games. About a 20-minute drive from Durham is the historic town of Chapel Hill, home to the University of North Carolina, which was seeded No. 1 in the South this year. The school has a strong record of basketball success, appearing in more than 40 NCAA tournaments. It is also the college team of professional basketball legend Michael Jordan. Adam Lucas, publisher of Tar Heel Monthly, has been decked in baby blue Carolina gear since he was a child. He even skipped school so he could attend the games with his parents, both Tar Heel alums. ""It's not just a sport,"" he explained. ""It's the number one thing talked about during this part of the year. You'll have trouble holding a conversation in Chapel Hill in March if you don't know the basics of Carolina basketball."" If visitors can't get one of the coveted tickets to watch the game in the Dean E. Smith Center, aka the Dean Dome, there is plenty to do in the quaint city of Chapel Hill. Visitors can walk to Franklin Street, the heart of town, where eateries, shops and sports bars are ready to embrace UNC fans. They can also visit the 8,000-square-foot Carolina Basketball Museum, located on campus, which holds more than 450 interactive displays, memorabilia and photos documenting a basketball program that began more than a century ago. 2. The University of Kansas in Lawrence . To understand the fan devotion for the defending national champions and a Midwest No. 3-seeded team this year, one must make a trip to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. The Jayhawks' indoor arena is old-school -- smaller than some college basketball stadiums -- built in the 1950s and named in honor of revered former Coach Forrest C. ""Phog"" Allen. In 1952, ""Phog"" led the men's basketball team to its first NCAA victory. The energy from thousands of fans in Allen Field House is contagious. In addition to the ""Rock Chalk Jayhawk"" chant, KU students are famous for their clever antics against the other teams, particularly their longstanding rivals at the University of Missouri. But if you can't get a ticket during the regular season, check out the Booth Family Hall of Athletics, a 26,000-square-foot museum adjacent to the stadium. The museum, which opened about three years ago, houses artifacts and information about the history of KU athletics, including the men's basketball team. Visitors can head to colorful Massachusetts Street, the main drag in downtown Lawrence. The street is lined with plenty of restaurants and bars catering to Jayhawks followers on game day. When Kansas beat Memphis to clinch the national championship last year, more than 100,000 fans poured into the street, university officials say. ""People who come [to Lawrence] never want to leave,"" said Jennifer Sanner, a 1981 alumna and editor of Kansas Alumni magazine. ""And if you're a basketball fan, that's all the better."" 3. Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana . Sure, the Hoosiers didn't have a stellar season after going 6-25, and they didn't make it to the NCAA Tournament. After Kelvin Sampson resigned as coach in February over allegations that he had violated NCAA recruiting standards, the team lost many of its top players. Despite this, college basketball in Bloomington, Indiana, remains sacred, devout Hoosiers fans say, and they believe that the men's team will be back in full force over the next few years. Indiana University has one of the top basketball programs in the country, winning five NCAA championships. The team was led for many years by hot-tempered but incredibly successful coach Bobby Knight. If you are lucky enough to get a ticket to see the Hoosiers play at their stadium, Assembly Hall, you will find droves of student fans. Assembly Hall holds one of the country's largest student sections, holding more than 8,000. Officials at Bloomington Indiana Visitors & Convention Bureau say basketball game days flood local restaurants and bars with students and local fans. The games tend to sell out, so be prepared to explore Bloomington. Most fans head to Kirkwood Avenue near campus and drop by Nick's English Hut, where the walls are covered with Hoosiers athletic photographs and gear, or Yogi's Grill and Bar to watch the game. ""Basketball is a religion in this state,"" said Zach Osterman, the men's basketball columnist at the university's student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student. ""It goes way back before Bobby Knight. It's what people do up here."" 4. Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . There is no football team at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That means students and alumni are even more dedicated to the men's basketball team, they say. Marquette may be a Jesuit university with just over 11,000 students, but it boasts one of the highest attendance rates at basketball games in the country. Students at Marquette don't pitch tents like at Duke, but the games are so popular, some will bring their sleeping bags 10 hours before the game to get the best seat in the house . ""It's such a great feeling to know you can walk anywhere in the city when you have a Marquette shirt on a basketball day and people will talk to you about basketball,"" said Sarah Dembkowski, a sophomore at the university. ""It gives this city a bonding feeling."" Although the West region No. 6-seeded Golden Eagles lost to the University of Missouri in the tournament last week, a trip to the Bradley Center, where the Marquette men's basketball team plays (and where the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play) is well worth the visit. Marquette students, called the Superfans, are famous for their peculiar behavior, dressing up in costumes to support their team and distracting opponents with oversized cutouts of celebrities' heads. On campus are several bars, including the Union Annex, that tout cheap beer pitchers and food specials for fans. Just several blocks from the university is downtown Milwaukee. On Water Street, where most of the fans crowd on game day, visitors can hang with the locals and enjoy a hub of sports bars, taverns and restaurants. 5. Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington . Gonzaga University officials call it the ""Gonzaga Effect"": This small private school in Spokane, Washington, has qualified for the NCAA tournament for the 11th straight year. The Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team is an obscure team that seems to emerge from thin air each March. This year, the team entered the tournament seeded No. 4 in the South region. ""There have been a lot of one-and-done schools, who make a splash and disappear, but we've been able to sustain it,"" said Dale Goodwin, a spokesman for the university. Fans in ""the Kennel Club"" at Gonzaga go wild for basketball despite the school's smaller size. For more than 17 years of the Kennel Club's existence, the Bulldogs have won more than 75 percent of their games, including over 90 percent during the past eight seasons, according to the Gonzaga athletic department. Visitors will be delighted to watch the games in the school's arena, the $25 million McCarthey Athletic Center, which opened in 2004. Before the opening, the basketball team was playing in a glorified high school gym, university officials said. On Hamilton Street near the university, visitors will want to head to Jack & Dan's Tavern, which belongs to John Stockton, a former NBA and Gonzaga player. The Bulldog, which claims to have the best burgers in town, is also a popular hangout during the games. Meanwhile, Spokane is preparing to host the NCAA first- and second-round men's basketball tournament next March. The town, tucked into eastern Washington, is excited to welcome visitors. A single event will probably bring in $2.75 million, according to the Spokane Regional Convention & Visitors Bureau.","Men's college basketball will end with NCAA championship game April 6 .

"(CNN) -- Recent threats and attacks from militant groups have made it almost impossible for the World Food Program to get food to hungry people in southern Somaila, the aid agency said Tuesday. The actions by militant groups have led to a partial suspension food distribution in much of southern Somalia, the agency said in a statement. This has left more than 1 million people in the area in peril, the United Nations food agency said. ""WFP is deeply concerned about rising hunger and suffering among the most vulnerable due to these unprecedented and inhumane attacks on purely humanitarian operations,"" the agency said in a statement. One of the recent threats to the food agency occurred in late November when Islamist militants in Somalia warned the agency to buy food from Somali farmers or stop sending aid to the impoverished African country. That threat came from al-Shabaab, a group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the U.N.-backed government of transitional President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. Four of the agency's staff members were killed in Somalia between August 2008 and January 2009. Despite difficulties in southern Somalia, the agency says it is still dispensing food in the capital city Mogadishu and several other areas. The agency says it is still able to reach more than 60 percent of those in need or about 1.8 million people.","Recent attacks make it near impossible for aid agencies to deliver food in southern Somalia .

"(CNN) -- The White House may be the official residence of the U.S. president, but it's only a temporary address. The former homes and libraries of presidents offer an inside look into the lives of the select few who served as the nation's leader. Nearly 80 million visitors have toured Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. From simple log cabins to expansive estates, hundreds of presidential homes and historical sites are open to the public. Visitors can read the love letters between Harry Truman and his wife, Bess, examine hand-drawn maps by Herbert Hoover or eye the tintype photograph of young wife Lucy that Rutherford B. Hayes carried with him daily on Civil War battlefields and later in the White House. As we witness a new leader take office and celebrate past commanders-in-chief on President's Day this month, CNN asked William Clotworthy, author of ""Homes and Libraries of the Presidents,"" to recommend five places for travelers to see a very human side of history's presidents. Lincoln's birthplace . There's more than split rails at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky. The site, run by the National Park Service, offers exhibits and walking tours so the visitor can experience a little of the frontier life that shaped the nation's 16th president. The centerpiece is the large marble and granite Lincoln Memorial Building, which houses a small and humble log cabin. The cabin is not actually Lincoln's birth cabin -- that has been lost to history -- but it does try to replicate as closely as possible the tiny and primitive surroundings that sheltered the future commander in chief. ""There's something about the Lincoln log cabin,"" Clotworthy said. ""I think it's an inspiration that a man born in a log cabin ... grew up to become president of the United States. I know it's corny, but that's what I find inspiring."" iReport.com: See Lincoln's childhood home after an ice storm . This February 12, the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth, events are planned around the park and the Hodgenville area, including a ceremony presenting new Lincoln pennies for circulation and the dedication of a second replica log cabin. Reagan library . Ronald Reagan's final resting place can also be an excellent starting point for those curious about his life. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California, not only houses all Reagan's official presidential papers and records, but also includes such personal objects as his college letter sweater, movie memorabilia from his film career and even a glass jelly bean jar. From his presidential life, highlights include a section of the Berlin Wall presented by the people of Germany and a walk inside Air Force One -- one of Clotworthy's favorite experiences. ""They have built a glass-enclosed pavilion"" for the Boeing 707 used by Reagan, he said ""and you stand there and you get the impression you're flying. It's fabulous."" Visitors are able to peek inside the president and first lady's cabins, the galleys and cockpit. On the lower level, an entire pub from Ireland that Reagan visited was shipped over in 2004 and is now a snack shop. Mount Vernon . Home to George Washington for most of his adult life, Mount Vernon in Virginia has been open to a curious public since 1860. Nearly 80 million visitors have toured the first president's home since then, making it the most popular historic home in the United States. On Presidents' Day, admission is free. Today, visitors can tour the meticulously restored mansion, tour the four gardens, hike the nature trail or explore personal artifacts such as the first president's shoes or his favorite swivel chair in a vast state-of-the-art museum on the grounds. Also in the museum are new life-size models of Washington, so visitors can get a glimpse of what the future Founding Father was like as a teenager. ""There are no real pictures or ideas of what Washington looked like before he was 45 years old, so [anthropologists] made a study of existing pictures, his teeth, his hair and they've now built these incredible figures of Washington as a younger man,"" Clotworthy said. Jackson's Hermitage . Inspired by the success of the women's organization that opened Mount Vernon to the public, a similar group in Nashville, Tennessee, saved Andrew Jackson's home from ruin in 1889. Today, Hermitage visitors can tour the mansion, stroll the formal gardens, examine slave cabins and see the original log cabin where the Jacksons lived for a time. A robust visitor's center tells the life story of Jackson, or ""Old Hickory,"" from hell-raising youth to feisty frontier battler of the British to powerful president. Besides tours and exhibits, summer visitors can also watch excavations as Hermitage archaeologists uncover some of the estimated 100 buildings on the grounds. A standout of the Hermitage is its many educational programs for the public, including a ""hands-on-history"" class for kids. FDR's home . When it comes to touring presidential lives, the Franklin D. Roosevelt  complex of sites in Hyde Park, New York, offers travelers one-stop shopping -- the lifelong home of a president, a museum and official presidential library all within walking distance of each other. Roosevelt was born and spent most of his life at Springwood Mansion, which offers visitors a look at the personal side of the only four-term president, including wheelchair ramps installed after Roosevelt contracted polio in 1921. On the same grounds is the FDR Presidential Library and Museum, the first presidential library and one Roosevelt designed himself. Among the museum highlights are a 1936 roadster fitted with hand controls so the president could drive himself, his White House desk as he left it (including a pack of Camel cigarettes and Roget's thesaurus) and even objects from his childhood (the future author of the New Deal had quite the snazzy rocking horse). Also part of the complex are a cottage designed by FDR as a retreat in 1939, expansive gardens and grounds by the Hudson River, and a visitor center that plays an orientation film, ""A Rendezvous with History"" -- which is what travelers can plan on when visiting the nation's presidential sites.","The Lincoln birthplace features a replica of the log cabin where Lincoln was born .

"(CNN) -- After Denise Honeycutt sashayed down the catwalk modeling a sleek sleeveless black dress with a blue lace jacket, she felt so good she bought the outfit. A model walks the runway at the Arlington United Methodist Church fashion show in an outfit from Goodwill. ""I got those two pieces and a skirt for $20,"" she said. ""How's that for a deal?"" Such bargains may not be haute couture, but during a recession they are a thrifty shopper's dream. As budgets tighten during the economic crunch, buying used clothing is no longer just for fans of vintage wear. Many are discovering the hidden treasures in consignment shops, as well as thrift stores and other places once thought to be only for the destitute. That's a message that Brendan Hurley, senior vice president of Marketing and Communications for Goodwill of Greater Washington, has been working hard to get out. Goodwill of Greater Washington provided the fashions Honeycutt modeled for the show at the Arlington United Methodist Church in Arlington, Virginia, and has been actively campaigning to spread the word that Goodwill fashion is contemporary and hot. ""Most people have a misunderstanding of Goodwill's mission and they believe that our mission is to sell inexpensive merchandise to the poor,"" Hurley said. ""In fact, Goodwill's mission is to provide job training and employment services to people with disadvantages and disabilities. We just happen to fund that mission through the resale of donated items at our retail stores."" To change the negative perception, Hurley said that four years ago they started a campaign to make the stores more appealing as a source of inexpensive fashions by holding virtual and live fashion shows.  See one of Goodwill's fashion shows Â» . Hurley said things really took off after they launched a viral marketing campaign and the very successful DCGoodWillFashions blog. Em Hall is the retail marketing manager who blogs as the DC Goodwill Fashionista in a gig that has become so high-profile that she was invited to blog this year from Fashion Week in New York. About once a month on average, Hall and her team put together ""travel and trunk shows"" where they pull merchandise from their nine stores, put them on rolling racks and take them to events for attendees to shop. People respond to the great prices and selection as well as the opportunity to recycle by buying someone's gently used clothing, Hall said. iReport.com: Tell us about your thrift fashions . ""The response has been tremendous,"" Hall said. ""We know that finding that treasure at Goodwill, finding that vintage piece, really resonates with people."" Across the country, Goodwill stores have launched several creative ideas to attract divas (or divos) who may have more style than funds. Goodwill Industries of Michiana Inc. of South Bend, Indiana, has ""Boutique Days,"" where they work with local fashion reporter and consultant Kathy Friend to raise awareness that Goodwill can be an excellent resource for brand name and designer clothing. Those who donate at least 20 clothing items receive an opportunity for a private consultation with Friend at a reduced rate. ""On a trip to Goodwill I've found Chanel handbags still in the tissue paper and in Saks Fifth Avenue bags,"" said Friend, who as part of her consultation teaches clients everything from how to spot signs of wear to how they can get pieces altered. ""I was like, are you kidding me?""  See examples of fashionable outfits from Goodwill Â» . The Goodwill/Easter Seals program in Minnesota held a ""Second Runway"" fashion show in February where 30 volunteer fashion designers took existing clothes from surrounding Goodwill stores and turned them into hip new outfits. The event attracted more than 500 attendees. ""We were given $50 and we could create up to three looks out of things we found at the Goodwill,"" said designer Kristina Bell, who whipped up a cute little dress out of recycled T-shirts. ""I've always been a thrifter, but now it's a really good way to save money."" Someone else's hard times can be a fashionista's gain. Denise McShane owns McShane's Exchange, whose two locations in the Chicago, Illinois, neighborhood of Lincoln Park have seen an uptick in those unloading their Prada and St. John. ""Business has really boomed,"" McShane said. ""The bad news is that we are in a recession, but I absolutely have had a surge in consigners."" McShane said she offers those who still have a cash stash a bit of retail therapy during hard times. They can get great buys at a reduced rate. Such shops, known in the industry as resale stores, have long attracted quality merchandise, said Barbara Nell, owner of The Daisy Shop on Oak in Chicago. Nell said women are bringing in only the best for resale. ""Women seem to be cleaning their closets of their most luxurious items,"" said Nell. ""It's not just the bread and butter or staples of their wardrobe anymore."" iReporter Elizabeth McElherne scored a $25 mink coat in August at a shop in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Check out Elizabeth's iReport on her find . ""If you can't buy something new, you might as well recycle and buy someone else's stuff,"" McElherne said. ""I saw that coat and I said 'If it's less than $100 I have to get it.' "" Nicole Mladic is the ""babe"" behind the ""Budgeting Babe"" blog for ""young, working women who want to spend like Carrie in a Jimmy Choo store but have a budget closer to Roseanne."" Mladic said she encourages her readers to not only shop thrift, but also to be generous in their giving. ""I make sure to thin out my wardrobe every so often,"" she said. ""Any pieces that I am not wearing, I donate."" That type of generosity is much appreciated, especially in the current economy. Melissa Temme, a national spokeswoman for the Salvation Army, said that while the need for low-cost clothing is increasing, donations for such clothing have remained consistent and that could spell trouble. ""It means that down the road we may not be able to stock our shelves,"" Temme said. ""In the long term, that's a concern."" Katherine Ransom, communications manager for Goodwill of Orange County, California, said that as more people turn to thrift fashions to help stretch their dollars, they are discovering the clothing is a lot more current than they might have imagined. Ransom said even Hollywood types are getting in on the act, as wardrobe consultants for television shows and movies are also perusing the racks for good buys. A recently launched coupon campaign is bringing in even more shoppers, she said. ""People are saying 'I've never done this before, but now is a good time to start,' "" said Ransom, whose organization launched shopgoodwill.com 10 years ago. It now includes merchandise from 77 Goodwill organizations around the country. ""They are taking advantage of the quality merchandise with really deep discounts.""","Buying used clothing gains popularity during a recession .

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab rebels attacked a town in central Somalia early Saturday, sparking an intense firefight between rival Islamic groups, according to eyewitnesses and local journalists. Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Dere said the Islamist rebel group took control of Dhusomareb after fighting members of Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a, a moderate Muslim group, according to Shabelle Media. However, the rival group claimed it pushed out the al-Shabaab rebels by Saturday evening. While neither side officially claimed casualties, witnesses told a journalist about 30 people died in the fighting. Al-Shabaab is made up of former allies of Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, who once led the Islamic Courts Union -- the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006. But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N.-brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought, Al-Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against Somalia's transitional government. The transnational Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a has maintained a strong presence in southern and central Somalia, where it has gathered powerful but small Sufi sects to counter extremist Islamist groups, especially al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has been trying to expand its influence farther north in Somalia, including Dhusomareb, the provincial capital of Galgaduud. A U.S. missile strike on Dhusomareb in May 2008 targeted and killed several senior members of al-Shabaab. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Al-Shabaab rebels' attack sparked an intense firefight Saturday .

"(CNN) -- They are football's royalty, the marquee players whose almost super human ability on the ball wins cups and championships; their faces adorn billboards and magazine covers from China to Colombia. Lionel Messi could miss out on the 2010 World Cup if his team Argentina fail to improve. But, amazingly, the likes of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry may all be absent from the World Cup finals in South Africa. Qualification for next year's tournament has thrown up a host of surprise results with a number of top teams, including Argentina, Portugal, France and Egypt all in serious danger of missing the tournament.  The 2010 World Cup missing stars? Â» . The highest profile strugglers are Diego Maradona's Argentina, who were defeated by Paraguay in the last round of qualifiers and remain outside of the automatic promotion places in their group. Would you miss Argentina at the World Cup finals? Portugal, featuring World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo, are playing catch up to Sweden and Denmark in their group and may not even make the playoffs. Add fellow-strugglers France to the mix and, suddenly, Africa's first World Cup could be remembered more for the teams that didn't make it, rather than for those that did. But would the failure of football's heavyweights to qualify for the World Cup necessarily be as apocalyptic as many have suggested? Does it actually open the door for less established football nations to write their own sporting histories? When England failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, just eight years after lifting the Jules Rimet trophy, it was a relatively unknown Polish side that benefited. The Poles went on to take the tournament by storm, losing the semifinal to eventual winners West Germany 1-0. ""The Polish team was just as perfectly structured as our team in 1972,"" admitted Paul Breitner, the German defender who scored the opening goal in the final against the Netherlands, to FIFA.com. Other teams have also benefited from the profligacy of more established footballing nations. Portugal were pipped to the 1982 World Cup in Spain by Northern Ireland, then the smallest national association to ever qualify for the finals. The team went onto to set the tournament alight, disposing of the hosts en route to the quarterfinals. And the great Bulgarian trio of Hristo Stoichkov, Yordan Letchkov and Trifon Ivanov would never have shone on the world stage at USA 94 if their team had not qualified at the expense of a talented France side containing the likes of Eric Cantona, Jean-Pierre Papin and David Ginola. This year a host of talented minnows like Gabon, Bosnia and Bahrain are all hoping to take advantage and make it to their first-ever finals. Whilst the likes of Argentina take qualification for granted, an appearance at the World Cup for a fledgling nation can have a dramatic social, as well as sporting, effect as qualification by Cameroon, Iran and South Africa has proved in the past. For other teams coasting towards South Africa, though, the failure of the bigger teams brings unexpected benefits. ""It's good for England,"" explained England captain John Terry before his team's qualifier against Croatia tonight. ""When we didn't qualify, I went back to Chelsea and the attitude of the foreign players was: 'We have a better chance of winning the World Cup.' First and foremost, we think about ourselves. If we go there without some big teams in the competition, then it's even better."" What do you think? Would the World Cup really miss Argentina, Portugal or France? Or would a new generation of stars step in to fill the void?","A host of top teams are in danger of missing out on the 2010 World Cup finals .
