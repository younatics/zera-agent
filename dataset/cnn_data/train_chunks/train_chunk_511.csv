The child has since been discharged from hospital and is making a recovery. The HPA said the strain of the bacteria was often associated with contact with rural environments that may have been contaminated by animal faeces. Sutton Park, in Sutton Coldfield, covers around 2,400 acres and is thought to attract around two million visitors annually. Cows are free to roam around the park - sharing space with the public. Designated a National Nature Reserve, the former royal deer park is included in English Heritage's list of historic parks and gardens, and includes sites of archaeological interest. Signs have been put up around the park to warn visitors of the risk of contracting E. coli O157 from s cowpats and rabbit droppings . HPA's Dr Roger Gajraj said: ""E. coli O157 can be very serious in young children and can in some instances cause kidney failure.

Tripping in public and getting food stuck between teeth are also humiliating moments that most try hard to avoid and one in seven say a relationship has ended because something embarrassing happened.

Commissioned by Ladbrokes, the research found that the biggest embarrassments were most likely to have been in the workplace while stories involving things going wrong in front of the in-laws were also very common. A Ladbrokes spokesman said: ‘Everyone does their best to be composed and cool wherever they are, but it isn’t always going to work and clearly there are many pitfalls. ‘The good thing is once the awkwardness clears the little things that throw us can eventually be looked back on and laughed about.’ Terrible teeth: Discovering food stuck in between teeth is a common humiliation .

A hot hairdryer left by a woman on a bed set fire to her husband and killed him in a tragic accident, an inquest has heard. Beautician Bina Dawett Joshi left the appliance, which was turned off but still plugged in, smouldering under the fabric, starting a freak blaze which killed husband Ram, 57. Fire crews wearing breathing gear battled in vain to rescue Mr Joshi from the huge house fire Wolverhampton, after neighbours raised the alarm on February 11 this year. Mrs Joshi told the inquest she had left her husband of three years sound asleep after he had returned home drunk at around 7.30pm. Tragic accident: Ram Joshi died in a raging house fire that was ignited by his wife Bina's hot hair dryer that she left on the bed he was sleeping on . She had attended a charity evening at nearby Woodfield School and had gone for a curry afterwards, when a neighbour got in touch and broke the tragic news by phone. Coroner Robin Balmain recorded that her husband had died as a result of an accident. Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Joshi said: 'I miss him and I haven’t been the same since. 'I don’t even feel like living in this country any more. Everything here reminds me of him. I miss cooking for him; I haven’t cooked properly since he died.' Both she and her husband had children from previous relationships. In an emotional tribute to her husband she told the inquest at Walsall Manor Hospital: 'He was very friendly, charming, outgoing and he loved his drink.' Mr Balmain heard Mr Joshi, who loved whisky, had returned home after watching a football match at the Bruford Arms in Penn Fields. Although he had not been behind the wheel, he was around three-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit. Couple: Bina Joshi with her husband Ram - the heartbroken beautician has spoken of her horror at his death . Aftermath: The Joshi's home in Wolverhampton was wrecked by the fire in February caused by the hairdryer . Mrs Joshi had dried her hair before embarking on a night out. She was at Balti Palace in Merry Hill, Wolverhampton, when she received the phone call telling her what had happened. She said: 'I didn’t smell any fumes - I did switch the hairdryer off but I didn’t unplug it at the wall.' She added she may have left clothes or a towel on top of the dryer. Fire investigator Nigel Adams said Mr Joshi, who had previously run storage and packaging firms, had been found by firefighters on the landing but, despite the efforts of paramedics, could not be revived. He said fragments of towel were found attached to the badly burnt dryer and added: 'By covering the hair dryer up, it doesn’t allow for any ventilation at all.' Mr Balmain said Mr Joshi had died of cardio-respiratory arrest due to carbon monoxide poisoning, resulting from smoke inhalation. He added Mr Joshi had eventually become aware of the fire but too late to save himself. The coroner said: 'Any appliance shouldn’t simply be switched off at the appliance. It should be switched off at the mains.'","Ram Joshi died in the tragic accident at the couple's home in Wolverhampton last February, an inquest heard .

Consumer groups are pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to set federal guidance on allowable levels of arsenic in rice, prompting the agency to study the issue and consider possible new standards. So far, FDA officials say they have found no evidence that suggests rice is unsafe to eat. The agency is in the middle of conducting a study of 1,200 samples of grocery-store rice products — short and long-grain rice, cereals, drinks and even rice cakes — to measure arsenic levels. Arsenic is thought to be found in rice in higher levels than most other foods because it is grown in water on the ground, optimal conditions for the contaminant to be absorbed in the rice. Grain by grain: Consumer groups are pressuring the FDA to set federal guidance on allowable levels of arsenic in rice, prompting the agency to study the issue . Posing a threat: Inorganic arsenic - the type found in some pesticides and insecticides - can be toxic and may pose a cancer risk if consumed at high levels or over a long period . There are no federal standards for how much arsenic is allowed in food. Arsenic is naturally present in water, air, food and soil in two forms, organic and inorganic. According to the FDA, organic arsenic passes through the body quickly and is essentially harmless. Inorganic arsenic — the type found in some pesticides and insecticides — can be toxic and may pose a cancer risk if consumed at high levels or over a long period. How much organic and inorganic arsenic rice eaters are consuming, and whether those levels are dangerous, still remain to be seen. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg says consumers shouldn't stop eating rice, though she does encourage a diverse diet just in case. 'Our advice right now is that consumers should continue to eat a balanced diet that includes a wide variety of grains — not only for good nutrition but also to minimize any potential consequences from consuming any one particular food,' she said. Testing: The FDA will study arsenic levels in rice products, including cereals . The agency on Wednesday released 200 of the expected 1,200 samples after the magazine Consumer Reports released its own study and called for federal standards for arsenic in rice. The FDA will not complete its study until the end of the year, Hamburg said, and cannot draw any conclusions from the results until then. Both studies show relatively similar levels of arsenic in rice. The FDA's analysis showed average levels of 3.5 to 6.7 micrograms of inorganic arsenic per serving, while Consumer Reports found levels up to 8.7 micrograms. The FDA released 200 samples, while Consumer Reports tested 223. It is almost impossible to say how dangerous these levels are without a benchmark from the federal government. Consumer Reports uses New Jersey's drinking water standard — a maximum of 5 micrograms in a litre of water — as comparison because it is one of the strictest in the country. But it is unclear how accurate it is to compare arsenic levels in water and arsenic levels in rice — most people consume more water than rice, so drinking water standards may need to be tougher. It is because of this uncertainty that consumer groups have urged the FDA to set a standard. Urvashi Rangan of Consumer Reports says the group is not trying to alarm rice eaters and parents feeding their children rice, but to educate them so they can diversify their diets. Consumers should be more protected since arsenic is a known carcinogen, she said. Advancements: Scientists have known for decades that arsenic is present in rice, but the issue has renewed interest as consumers are more interested than ever in what they eat and technology has advanced . 'It doesn't make sense not to have standards for rice,' she said. The Consumer Reports study found higher levels of arsenic in brown rice than white rice, a result of how the two different types are processed. It also found higher levels in rice produced in Southern U.S. states than in rice from California or Asia. Hamburg cautioned that neither the FDA nor Consumer Reports had tested enough samples to be certain of any trend. 'These are very few samples and there is great variability in the levels,' she said. Scientists have known for decades that arsenic is present in rice, but the issue has renewed interest as consumers are more interested than ever in what they eat and technology has advanced to the point that inorganic and organic arsenic can be measured separately. The consumer group's push on arsenic in rice comes a year after it pressured the FDA to define standards for arsenic in apple juice. Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, said Tuesday that the agency had completed that assessment and would be making recommendations soon. The levels found in apple juice are low, he said.","Inorganic arsenic - found in some pesticides and insecticides - can be toxic .

Jailed: Dean Coleman persuaded Hannah Rogers to get into his car to kiss and make up after a row but when she ran away from his car he reversed into her . A promising young jockey was jailed yesterday for driving his BMW car into his girlfriend after a row. Dean Coleman, 24, persuaded Hannah Rogers to get into his car to kiss and make up and drove the 22-year-old to a beauty spot near Ogmore, South Wales. The pair argued again before she ran away from his car. A court heard Coleman - who has ridden 25 winners at courses across Britain - reversed into her. Prosecutor Eugene Egan said: 'He hit her in the back knocking her down - then apologised and threatened he would take an overdose. 'He drove Hannah to hospital where she spent two weeks with a displacement to her spine. 'Coleman visited her and sent her texts asking her not to tell the police what had happened.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Coleman was on bail for intimidation and suspected arson against a fellow jockey when he injured Miss Rogers. Coleman also deliberately drove into the back of Miss Rogers' car at traffic lights after an earlier argument. He admitted causing actual bodily harm, attempting to pervert the course of justice, threats to cause damage, intimidation, and two charges of dangerous driving. Coleman, of near Bridgend, was jailed for two years. David Elias, defending, said: 'He once had a bright future, was hard working and earned good money and hopefully on his release can get back there.

Ordeal: Tracey and Andy Ferrie, who were held for 66 hours on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, said it was a 'living nightmare' The couple held by police over the shooting of two intruders at their isolated  cottage spoke yesterday of their ‘living nightmare’. Andy Ferrie said he ‘plumbed the depths of despair’ when police told him he could face a charge of attempted murder. Tracey Ferrie said being kept in a police cell away from her husband had ‘petrified’ her and she was haunted by the ‘stomach-churning’ experience. Mr Ferrie, 35, and his 43-year-old wife were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after he called police to report that he had discharged a shotgun, hitting two of four men who had broken into their home. They were held in separate cells and handcuffed for a court appearance where detectives sought more time to hold them for questioning. Mrs Ferrie, a saleswoman, said: ‘I was completely petrified. Being locked up in a police cell just yards from my husband, but banned from talking to him, was agony. ‘When I can get some sleep now I wake up with a start and think I’m back in the cell. It’s mortifying and stomach churning.’ She said their cottage at Welby,  near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, looked like ‘something out of CSI’ as police swarmed around the hamlet following the incident early last Sunday. Mr Ferrie, who runs a mobile home repair business, said being told he could ultimately face an attempted murder charge had left him too anxious to eat during almost three days and nights in custody. The Ferries were eventually released on bail late on Tuesday evening. Crown lawyers lifted the threat of prosecution the following evening after concluding the couple ‘did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves and their home from intruders’. Defending their home: Andy and Tracey Ferrie leapt from their bed to . confront intruders after being woken by the sound of broken glass . Mr Ferrie fired at the men using a weapon held legally by his wife, a keen clay pigeon shooter. The intruders suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary – along with their alleged accomplices – at Leicester Royal Infirmary. ‘I was petrified, scared stiff,’ Mr Ferrie told The Sun. ‘I only did what any other bloke would have done given the situation. I’m no hero or hard man. I did what I did to protect my precious, lovely wife. ‘I was only a few feet away, I could have shot to kill but I didn’t. I was relieved later when I was told the injuries I had caused were not life-threatening. The events of the last few days have scarred us for life.’ Mr Ferrie, who plans to emigrate to Australia with his wife next year, said that during his time in custody he was ‘told my case had been upgraded to attempted murder’. He added: ‘I just crumpled. I saw . myself being sent to prison for a long, long time. I was offered food . but didn’t eat for the whole 66 hours we were held.’ Last . week, a court heard how the couple were woken by the sound of banging . and breaking glass as the intruders forced their way inside just after . midnight.

Inquiry: Mrs Ferrie said their cottage in Leicestershire 'looked like something out of CSI' as police investigated the shooting . His wife believes she was arrested after telling officers she had grabbed a crowbar and a torch as the incident unfolded. Mr Ferrie said that when police informed them no further action was to be taken, it felt as if a ‘weight had been lifted from our heads that was slowly crushing us’. Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, admitted burglary at Loughborough Magistrates Court last week. He was remanded in custody for sentencing.

Ryanair is to be investigated by Irish and Spanish aviation authorities following accusations from pilots’ leaders that the budget airline is ‘courting disaster’ by flying planes with near-empty fuel tanks to cut costs. Spanish pilot union leaders accused Ryanair of ‘operating on the very limits of legality’ in the way it fuels its planes. Ryanair denies any wrong-doing and insists its planes are safe with sufficient fuel reserves. Standing firm: Ryanair denies any wrong-doing and insists its planes are safe with sufficient fuel reserves (file picture) The decision to investigate came at a meeting of Irish and Spanish air safety experts in Dublin on Tuesday. The investigation relates specifically to the diversion to Madrid of a Ryanair flight from Paris to Tenerife on Sunday. But it follows a spate of incidents in Spanish airspace involving Europe's largest budget airline – including a number where flights have declared ‘emergencies’ and demanded to land because they were running low on fuel. In a joint statement Ireland’s Department of Transport, Tourism & Sport and the Spanish Ministry of Development met ‘to discuss oversight of Ryanair’s operation in Spain.’ They added: ’As an example of this increased cooperation it was agreed that the circumstances of a specific incident in Madrid airport on 16th September would be jointly examined.’ Spanish authorities are also investigating emergency landings by three Ryanair planes in Valencia on July 26 after they approached their minimum required fuel after being diverted from Madrid because of bad weather. The pilots had been asked to circle above Valencia because thunderstorms in Madrid prevented them from landing there as planned. They were asked to join a queue but were given priority when they declared an ‘emergency’ because fuel was running close to the 30 minute minimum. Ryanair has said the July landings were fully in line with EU safety procedures and that passengers were in no danger. Ryanair has also rejected claims by the . Irish pilots' union (IALPA) that it pressures flight crew to carry the . minimum amount of fuel required under European regulations. Defence: Ryanair, whose CEO is Michael O'Leary, pictured, has rejected claims that it pressures flight crew to carry the minimum amount of fuel required . Last night Ryanair’s Stephen McNamara said: ‘We welcome today’s joint statement from the Irish and Spanish Governments which affirms that Ryanair’s safety standards are on a par with the safest airlines in Europe.’ Ryanair said it had invited the Spanish Ministry to send a team of inspectors to Dublin to correct any ‘misplaced concerns’ about Ryanair’s compliance with Europe’s highest operating and maintenance standards. It was providing them ‘with unfettered access to Ryanair operating, maintenance and flight training facilities and unlimited access to Ryanair’s safety, flight management, engineering and maintenance personnel. ‘ . Spanish authorities are also looking into an incident in which a Ryanair flight diverted and landed at Barcelona's El Prat airport after a possible engine fault was detected. Ryanair has accused the Spanish aviation authorities of falsifying information on incidents involving its planes, an accusation Spanish officials have rejected. 'The executives send instructions to the crew, emphasising that for every x kilos of fuel they pump in the airline loses x amount of money. As a consequence those in charge of the aircraft are confronted by a cost-cutting exercise that could lead them into difficult situations' Juan Carlos Lozano, SEPLA . The Irish department of transport added in their statement after the meeting: ‘The Irish authorities gave an assurance of the Irish Aviation Authority's rigorous oversight of Ryanair's operations and on their satisfaction with Ryanair's safety standards which are on a par with the safest airlines in Europe.’ The row came as an official of the Spanish pilots’ union SEPLA criticised Ryanair for pushing legal and safety limits to the maximum. Accident investigator and spokesman for the union’s technical department, Juan Carlos Lozano warned that cost-cutting on fuel by Ryanair compromised safety stressing they were not breaking the rules but adding: ‘They are operating on the very limits of legality.’ He explained: ‘Having a bit of spare fuel allows pilots to think and to make decisions, and if this variable is limited, obviously the crew’s capacity to react is compromised, and the chances of a mistake happening are suddenly multiplied.’ He added: ‘The executives send instructions to the crew, emphasising that for every x kilos of fuel they pump in the airline loses x amount of money. 'As a consequence those in charge of the aircraft are confronted by a cost-cutting exercise that could lead them into difficult situations.’ In an interview on Spanish national radio on Monday, Lozano said Ryanair’s low fuel emergency landings were on the increase. It was not possible to operate an airline with ‘this policy of pressure always working to the limits,’ he said. He said if no action was taken then Ryanair was ‘courting disaster’. Ryanair last year carried more than 30 million passengers in Spain making it the country's largest passenger carrier. Spain's Public Works minister Ana Pastor, whose ministry runs aviation safety, has called for tighter safety regimes at low-cost airlines following a series of media reports about emergency incidents .","Pilot union accuses it of 'operating on limits of legality'

A mother’s children are never far from her mind – and scientists may have worked out why. They believe that if a woman has a son, some of his cells pass into her body before reaching her brain. And the male DNA may linger there for decades. Bond: Scientists believe that if a woman has a son, some of his cells pass into her body before reaching her - and the male DNA may linger there for decades . While there is no evidence it makes the woman more masculine, it may have important implications for her health. American scientists examined brain specimens from 59 women who had died between the ages of 32 and 101. A gene that is carried on the Y chromosome – and so should only be found in men – was present in almost two-thirds of the brains. The researchers, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, say the most likely explanation is the gene came from a son when he was carried in the womb. Helping hand: The male DNA may help a woman fight breast cancer by boosting her immune response . In the same way that a mother passes . oxygen and nutrients to her unborn child through the placenta, . ‘traffic’, including cells, also moves in the other direction. The . study suggests that the baby’s cells – or their descendants – persist . in the mother for decades, as male DNA was found in the brain of a woman . who died aged 94. It is thought having a daughter also leaves a mark on the mother’s brain – but testing for this would be more difficult. The study, published in the journal PLoS . ONE, is the first to find male DNA in women’s brains. It is too early . to say what effect, if any, it has. Previous studies have found male cells in women’s blood, bone marrow, hearts, lungs, livers and other organs. And the phenomenon, which is known as microchimerism, is thought to be good for a woman’s health. A vaccine that cuts the odds of premature births, miscarriages and other problems in pregnancy is a step closer. Scientists have shed light on white blood cells made by the mother-to-be which suppress her immune system and stop it attacking the ‘foreign’ baby. It is thought that some complications in pregnancy may be caused by not having enough protective cells, or them not working properly. The study, published in the journal Nature, found the cells rein in the immune system while still protecting the mother against infections. The male DNA may help a woman fight breast cancer by boosting her immune response. It may also help with rheumatoid arthritis and the repair of damaged tissues. Some scientists believe that the infusion of ‘fresh’ cells from child to mother could help explain why women tend to live longer than men. But microchimerism has also been linked to higher odds of bowel and skin cancer. Researcher Dr Lee Nelson said: ‘Foetal microchimerism – the presence of foetal cells in the mother – appears to be something of a Jekyll and Hyde phenomenon.’ She added that finding out more about how the cells cause or protect against disease could lead to new treatments. ‘Better understanding of the actions of the transferred cells could someday allow clinicians to harness the stowaways’ beneficial effects while limiting their destructive potential,’ said Dr Nelson.","Cells pass into mother's body before making it to brain .

Campaigner: Trenton Oldfield pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court after the start of his trial in which he is accused of causing a public nuisance . A campaigner 'protesting about elitism' brought the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race to a chaotic halt when he jumped into the Thames and swam into the rowers' path, a court heard today. Trenton Oldfield, 36, stopped the annual contest for around half an hour on April 7, the first time in the history of the 158-year event that it had been disrupted by a swimmer. BBC television footage of the annual event between the two elite universities, played to the jury, showed Oldfield being booed by spectators as he halted the crews racing neck and neck at the halfway mark. Oldfield, of Whitechapel, east London, denies causing a public nuisance. He could face jail if convicted at Isleworth Crown Court. Louis Mably, prosecuting, told jurors the race between Oxford and Cambridge was spoiled for spectators watching from the banks of the river or live on BBC TV, no to mention those taking part. He said that despite it continuing, 'so far as the Boat Race was concerned, Mr Oldfield had obviously caused chaos'. 'The feeling of disappointment was obvious,' Mr Mably told jurors. 'Not only had everything been delayed but the crews and the public had been denied a natural conclusion to the race that they had come to the river to see.' The prosecutor said that after being rescued from the river, Oldfield was detained by police who asked him why he had jumped in the river. 'He replied that he was protesting about elitism,' Mr Mably added. 'Exactly what he meant by that - who knows?' Mr Mably said the two eight-man teams were just 'settling into the rhythm and the race was developing into what was a close and exciting contest' when the disruption occurred. 'The crews began to negotiate one of the bends of the course,' he told the jury. 'By this time both crews were rowing flat out neck and neck. 'What happened next was the race, which all the spectators on the towpath had come to see and was being watched by those tuning into the TV at home, was brought to an unexpected and sudden halt. 'There was one person who wanted to disrupt it and that person decided that he took precedence over everyone else. 'That person was the defendant who sits in the dock, Trenton Oldfield. What he did was jump into the river wearing a wetsuit and swim out into the path of the competing boats.' The court heard that Oldfield, who was clad in a wetsuit, had swum into the paths of the two boats as they neared Chiswick Eyot between the two and three-mile markers of the race, which had set off from Putney. Mr Mably said that although 'to some extent' there was a risk of danger to the rowers, the real threat was to Oldfield himself as he narrowly avoided being hit by the blade of an Oxford oar. 'One doesn’t need to imagine too much the danger that could be caused to him if his head or neck had been struck by an oar being pulled through the water with full force.' The prosecutor added that Oldfield was at risk of further danger from the motor boats which flank the rowing boats throughout the race. 'They were coming straight towards him, straight on course to plough into him,' he continued. 'The risk to his welfare and to his life was obvious. This was averted by the race umpire.' Moral support: Oldfield, of Whitechapel, East London, appeared at court smartly dressed accompanied by an unidentified woman . The jury heard that having seen Oldfield in the path of the oncoming boats, umpire John Garrett stopped the race. 'What Mr Oldfield had done was in effect to force someone else to take responsibility to stop him from serious injury,' Mr Mably said. 'Of course, ordering the race to stop, bringing it to a halt in front of the tens and thousands of people who were watching at the river and on the television, it is not something that a race official is going to do lightly as obviously it spoils the race for everyone - the crews and the spectators. 'One person decided for his own reasons to disrupt a national sporting event and in the process the enjoyment of the spectating public.' The court heard how Oldfield donned a wetsuit before diving into the Thames and swimming across the path of the race as it neared Chiswick Eyot between the two and three-mile markers . The Australian national brought the annual race to a 'chaotic' halt, the prosecutor said, just as it had begun to develop into a 'close and exciting contest' Louis Mably, prosecuting, told jurors that while there was some risk to the race's participants, the real threat was to Oldfield himself, who narrowly missed being struck by an Oxford oar . Oldfield pictured after he was plucked from the waters by an RNLI lifeboat crew . Oldfield, an Australian, was plucked from the water by a boat and transferred to Chiswick Pier where he was met by police. Both crews had to reposition their vessels at the new start line, close to where the incident had happened, while other boats had to move or cut their engines to keep the water flat. The disruption also caused great mental and physical stress to the rowers, the court was told, as they had to prepare to start again, with Cambridge having an advantage. Jurors watched the footage of the crews as they continued to battle towards the finish line at Mortlake, with Cambridge powering on to victory. Isleworth Crown Court: Oldfield faces a potential jail sentence if he is found guilty of causing a public nuisance, which he denies . Summarising his opening speech, Mr Mably said it was for the jury to decide whether or not Oldfield had caused a public nuisance. 'It would be a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs for the public as a whole if we have to live in a society where one person is able to stop these kind of events from happening,' the prosecutor said. 'If the enjoyment of the public is at the mercy of any crank, oddball or self-righteous protester who decides that their views were more important than anybody else's.' The trial, which is expected to last up to four days, was adjourned to 10.15am tomorrow when prosecution witnesses will begin giving evidence.

A restaurant has unveiled the largest chilli cheese hotdog in Europe with 13,000 calories - that's six times a woman's recommended daily intake. At over one metre-long and filled with 1.5kgs of beef sausage, a whole pound of homemade chilli and lashings of cheese, the Monster Dog at Smokey’s Joint in Walsall, near Birmingham, contains an estimated 13,000 calories. It is more than five times the daily recommended allowance of 2,500 calories for a man. Amy Ironside, 23 front of house manager, prepares to tuck into the massive hotdog that measures over one metre long . The gastronomic gauntlet is the latest in what the eatery hopes will be a long line of food challenges and follows the creation of the 3lb cheeseburger, which has yet to be successfully tackled by any contender. Dean Key, 30, director of Smokey’s, said he began seeking out a new challenge following his customers failed attempts to complete the Monster Burger. He said: ‘I’ve had people asking us for weeks when it’s going to come out and if it’s ready yet. ‘We’ve spent ages developing the prototypes and we’ve had a lot of fun trying them out. The most any of the guys here have managed to eat is about half of one. ‘The real struggle was in sourcing a really big sausage and eventually we got a local butcher to supply the meat which he uses to fill extra large sausage skins ordered especially from Holland. ‘It’s pure beef sausage. We wanted to make sure the ingredients were of a really high quality because if you’re going to eat that much of something it has to taste good.’ The Monster Dog boasts a massive 1,000 grams of fat as opposed to the modest 70 grams recommended as part of woman's recommended daily intake, and 100 grams recommended for a man. The chefs help lift up the latest challenge, which is more than a couple of handfuls, to Miss Ironside . The restaurant's latest challenge contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt and 523 grams of saturated fat . It also contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt. With 80 people so far having attempted - and failed - to overcome the gut-busting burger, it is unlikely anyone will manage to complete a whole Monster Dog in the near future. Dean said: ‘Both the burger and the hotdog are £29.95 or free if you eat it in an hour. ‘When we made the burger I had a load of T-shirts printed that said “I conquered the Monster Burger” and I still have all of them. ‘I wish I’d got a bunch that said, “I was defeated by the Monster Burger” because I could have sold dozens of them.’ The restaurant launched the challenges after enjoying the hit American show Man vs Food, in which presenter Adam Richman travels the US seeking out the biggest food challenges. Dean, who runs the restaurant with business partners Jonanthan Caddick, 31, Dale Key, 27 and Stefan Hilton, 22, believes the Monster Dog is the biggest in Europe, dwarfing the competition. However, it has a long way to go to beat the current world’s longest meat hot dog record holder, measured at 203.8 m and manufactured by Ochsi of Paraguay.

Ford has gone back to the drawing board to re-design the classic 1960s Cortina and make it fit for the 21st century as it today celebrates its 50th anniversary. Ford Europe’s chief designer Paul Wraith undertook the commission to mark five decades of the original Dagenham-built MKI Cortina, which was launched in 1962 to great acclaim. The commission came courtesy of motoring magazine Auto Express, which wanted to know how the car giant might transform the legendary family saloon car and re-invent it for today. The re-designed Ford Cortina combines parts of the iconic bodywork with the manufacturer's latest technology . Memorable design: The new Cortina displays recognisable nods to the legendary model . The original Ford Cortina was launched 50 years ago today on September 21, 1962, costing from £573 for the standard 1200 saloon. Today a similar car range would cost from between £16,000 and £22,000. Auto Express Editor Steve Fowler said: ’Ford is celebrating 50 years of the Cortina and we’ve got them to design a Cortina for 2012 – meeting all today’s regulations, but with the size and style of the original. ‘We told him we weren’t looking for a new take on the original but wanted him to stay as true to the design of the original as possible, but with every modern bit of technology and safety built in. New look: The updated Cortina design features a wider rear windscreen and a lower, sleeker roofline . Crumple zones would have to be added and the supporting pillars around the windscreen thickened for the Cortina to pass modern safety tests . ‘We effectively wanted a hi-tech, five-star crash test rated, pedestrian friendly Cortina of the Sixties.. Not much to ask.’ The original Ford Cortina was launched 50 years ago on September 21, 1962. It cost from £573 for the standard 1200 saloon. A similar car range today would cost from between £16,000 and £22,000. There were five generations of Cortina: the MK I (1962-66); MkII (66 to 70); Mk III (70 to 76), Mk IV (76 to 79) and Mk V (79 to 82). The original MK I Cortina with a 1.2 litre 4 cylinder petrol engine had a top speed of 76.5mph, took 20 seconds to get to 60mph from rest, and fuel economy of 30.2mpg. The souped-up Lotus Cortina had a top speed of 108mph and could sprint from rest to 60mph in 10.1 seconds and averaged 21.3mph. The 21st century Cortina with its frugal EcoBoost 1.0 litre 3-cylinder engine will sprint to 60 mph in 10 seconds with a top speed of 120mph and would average 56.5mpg. Some 4.3million Cortinas were produced over 20 years from 1962. The last Cortina was assembled in July 1982, to be succeeded by the Sierra costing £4,515. The Cortina was Britain's best-selling car for 10 of the 20 years it was on sale: 1967, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981. UK sales for the Ford Cortina totalled 2,816,639 and its best-selling month of all time was 25,790 in August 1981. Total Cortina production was 4,279,079, of which 3,155,161 were built at Dagenham. Cortina assembly also took place in Genk (Belgium), Amsterdam, Cork (Ireland) and at Cheshunt (Lotus-Cortina Mk I only). The Ford Cortina has made dozens of film and TV appearances including Carry On Cabby released in 1963. The MkII model turned up in productions as diverse as Billion Dollar Brain – driven by Michael Caine who, in reality, didn’t have a driving licence at the time – and The Benny Hill Show. Ford designer Paul Wraith said: ‘The original car was accessible and agile. The body shape is really iconic and those ‘ban the bomb’ tail-lights are so recognisable. ‘But obviously we’ve got a host of global legal requirements we need to meet. ‘We also need it to be recognisable as . a Ford from the outside. The original designers would have had a tight . brief limited by the fact that they had to make it profitable.’ The . original Cortina design – with a jutting front bumper and sharp edges, . would not pass today’s vitally important European crash tests to protect . driver, occupants and even pedestrians, he says. Crumple . zones would have to be designed in, the supporting pillars around the . windscreen thickened and the windows made shallower to survive side . impacts. The distinctive . rear tail-lights are retained but given a sharper and more modern look. The two sharp ridges or ‘pontoons’ on the boot are retained in the 2012 . version. But a wider rear windscreen is needed to ensure all-round . visibility. And a lower, sleeker roofline is needed to fit with modern . sporty taste. The boom in . demand for diesel engines which are bigger and need more cooling, would . require a bigger front opening. But Ford’s new frugal 1.0 litre . three-cylinder EcoBoost petrol engine would be the perfect fit while . satisfying today’s demand for fuel economy and performance, managing the . sprint from rest to 62mph in about 10 seconds – compared with 20 . seconds for the original - with a top speed of  about 120mph. This . is despite the extra demands of technology and safety pushing the . weight of a new Cortina up by 50 per cent to 1.2 tonnes, compared to 0.8 . tonnes for the original in the Sixties. That . means more powerful brakes are needed and the chassis would have to be . strengthened to cope. Air-conditioning, Bluetooth connectivity and DAB . digital radio would be musts today.

In the new design, the distinctive rear tail-lights are retained but given a sharper and more modern look. AutoExpress editor Mr Fowler said: ’It all seems a world away from the simple, original car that made such a splash in the Sixties. But these days buyers are more demanding. We want our cars to be practical, efficient and hi-tech – all for a great price.’ More than a million of the original Mk1 Cortina’s were built between 1962 and 1966 with total Cortina production topping nearly 4.3million by the time the Mk IV came to the end of the road in 1982. Celebrated in song, in poetry by Sir John Betjeman, in movies and on TV, some 3.15million Cortinas were built at Ford’s Dagenham plant in Essex, now given over to engine production. Will Ford put their designer Mr Wraith’s 2012 version into production and bring back the Cortina name? Lovely to think so – but don’t hold your breath.","The .

The stresses and strains of modern life are being blamed for causing a slump in the bedroom, after it was revealed one in three married Brits find sex 'a chore'. Sheer fatigue, stress at work and a general lack of satisfaction in the bedroom have emerged as some of the main reasons why for many being intimate with their spouse is now well down the list of priorities. Worryingly, one in four went so far as to say sex was 'boring' and one in seven 'would rather read a book'. A lack of attraction towards their partner and over-familiarity also ranked highly for killing the romance. Not tonight: One in four married couples find sex 'boring', while others blame tiredness for a lack of desire . The study of 2,00 adults, commissoned by a health and well-being mutual organisation, found the average couple has sex just five times a month. The results of the study revealed a . resigned one in ten of those polled say they just 'don't click' with . their partner in that way any more. And, sadly, one in 20 confessed they just don't think they love their partner enough. Meanwhile, a fifth have faked an illness rather than face getting intimate in the bedroom. Lawrence Christensen, spokesman for Benenden Healthcare Society, which commissioned the study, said: 'The strain of modern life is forcing married Brits to put their romantic lives on hold. 'Sadly, it appears that the statistics confirm the stereotype of sex lives taking a downward plunge within marriage - with it becoming a chore for a third of married Brits. 'Married couples are finding that their priorities are elsewhere and this is down to a variety of reasons, but the important point is that this is causing worry and impacting on mental well-being. 1.  Too tired . 2.  Stress at work . 3.  I don’t feel attractive . 4.  It’s too hot . 5.  I want to read my book . 6.  Not confident in my body . 7.  I have too much on my mind . 8.  I’ve got a headache . 9.  I have neck or back pain . 10. It’s too ‘the same’ every time . 11. I don’t really enjoy it anymore . 12. I’m too full from dinner . 13. It’s too cold . 14. I don’t have enough time . 15. Sometimes it bores me . 16. I want to watch sport . 17. If there’s a film I want to watch . 18. I have too much household stuff to do . 19. I’m not attracted to my partner . 20. I don’t think my partner deserves it . 'Sex isn't just the physical act but includes the expression of intimacy towards a partner and the statistics show that even then, Brits would rather read a book.' The study shows the average Brit now ranks reading a book, watching television or making sure the kids lunches are made up as more important than sex. Ensuring work is all done and making sure there is ‘nothing good is on TV’ are also distractions. One in five said they have to feel their partner has shown them affection that day before they feel as if sex is an option. And 43 per cent think their diet has impacted on their sex life. The majority of people said it was inevitable their sex life faded after marriage - with one year, eight months and 23 days the actual point given for the spark fading. One in ten married described their sex life as ‘non-existent’ while four in ten said it was ‘okay’. Only a quarter reported they had a ‘good sex life’. And if ever there was a reason for not letting yourself go once the wedding bells have faded, a massive 40 per cent of the study claimed they don’t find their partner as attractive as they did when they first got married. Stress: Experts say lack of sex could be causing arguments and worries among couples, leading to 'great mental strain' Unfortunately though four in ten Brits think they and their partner are not well matched in terms of sex drive. Mr Christensen said: “While a fifth of Brits say that sex is not an important part of marriage, many are finding that modern lifestyles are preventing a functioning sex life even when it is important to them. “This is leading to worries and arguments and placing great mental strain on individuals. Is it time for married couples to reconsider their priorities?”","One in three married Brits find sex a chore, says study .

He believed the car was the Bugatti that won the 1931 Casablanca Grand Prix, driven by Count Stanislas Czaykowski. But when he died earlier this year after a long illness the UK’s leading Bugatti expert David Sewell was brought in to establish the car's true provenance. He determined it is almost certainly a very skilfully executed replica, although it may contain parts of the Czaykowski car.

This amazing Nasa image shows a 'sprite', a flash of red and blue light which flashes for a thousandth of a second. Researchers have previously been unable to capture them on film at high resolution. Scroll down for video . Stunning images taken by a Japanese TV camera reveal a lightning 'sprite' high above the earth. It is the first time the phenomenon has been captured on film . Researchers hope the new insights could further our attempt to . understand the sun and the dynamic space weather system that surrounds . Earth. The phenomenon occurs 50 miles above Earth, where the bursts of red and blue light, known as 'sprites,' flash for a scant one thousandth of a second. They are often only visible to those in flight above a storm, and happen so quickly they are often missed. However, Nasa realised astronauts aboard the International Space Station. On April 30, 2012, astronauts on the ISS captured the signature red flash of a sprite, offering the world and researchers a rare opportunity to observe one. Indeed, sprites are so hard to catch on film, that pilots had claimed to see them for almost a century before scientists at the University of Minnesota accidentally caught one on camera in July of 1989. Since then, researchers aboard planes have occasionally snapped a shot, but it continues to be difficult to methodically film them. So a group of scientists, along with help from Japan's NHK television, sought them out regularly for two weeks in the summer of 2011. The first color image of a sprite ever captured. It was taken in 1994 by a NASA-sponsored project through the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) that flew special cameras on two aircraft flown out of Oklahoma City. Filming at 10,000 frames per second on two separate jets, the team recorded some of the best movies of sprites ever taken – movies that can be used to study this poorly understood phenomenon and the forces that create them. By filming from two jets flying 12 miles apart, the team mapped out the 3-dimensional nature of the sprites. Ground-based measurements rounded out the picture. A sprite glows red in this image captured by astronauts on the International Space Station on April 30, 2012. 'Seeing these are spectacular,' says Hans C. Stenbaek-Nielsen, a geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Alaska. 'But we need the movies, because not only are they so fast that you could blink and miss them, but they emit most of their light in red, where the human eye is relatively blind.' During those two weeks, the scientists hopped into their planes in Denver, Colo. each evening and chased storm clouds. Just figuring out which direction to fly next was a full time job, assigned to a single person with a computer watching the weather systems. Once a plane found a hot zone of sprites, however, they often lucked into filming numerous sprites in a row. The sprite's first flash is usually followed by a break up into numerous streamers of light – figuring out what causes this divergence is one of the key things researchers will try to understand from these films. The basic understanding of sprites is that they are related to lightning, in which a neutrally charged cloud discharges some of the electricity to ground. Normally negative charge is carried from the cloud to the ground, but about one out of every ten times it's positive charge -- and that leaves the top of the cloud negatively charged. With this one in ten chance, the electric field above the cloud is ""just right"" to produce the sprite, an electrical discharge 50 miles above the thunderstorm. Typically the weather we experience on the ground is considered to be a separate phenomenon from the weather that goes on higher up in the atmosphere, in the area known as the mesosphere. The sprites show, however, that some fundamental science connects these two regions, opening interesting physics questions about the interchange of energy between them.","Images reveal rarely seen phenomenon from the International Space Station .

But true to his word, here he is at the music shop he runs, grafting away as normal. Mr Bayford, 41, who built the Suffolk Music Centre from a market stall, is regularly seen manning the till and doing odd jobs. And it's not uncommon to see him up early to open up the premises of the store he runs with business partner Richard Hudspith. Loves his job: Euromillions winner Adrian Bayford back at work at his high street music store despite his £148m fortune . Shoppers saw the big-hearted family-man - officially the 516th richest person in Britain after his win - moving stock, collapsing boxes, and chatting with his regulars. He was even up before the rush on Friday morning to open up the store he runs with Richard Hudspith just after 8.30am.

'He was behind the counter it just seemed perfectly normal, he's obviously such a nice guy. 'There were a couple of local kids in there. They seemed to be chewing the fat. 'They've got a couple of couches in there. It's a really laid back atmosphere. 'The shop seemed quite busy. Whether that's because they want to buy a guitar, or because they want to look at the lottery millionaire - I don't know. 'They all certainly seemed to be interested in guitars. 'He seemed to be having a good laugh with his pal. It was really nice to see him enjoy work because, let's face it, he doesn't have to. You can see why he has gone back.' Adrian and wife Gillian, 40, scooped the second largest lottery jackpot in British history in August with a ticket Adrian bought at his local newsagents. The first evidence of the start of their spending spree was spotted this week in the shape of a modest Ford family car. The Bayfords have so far stunned Britain with the warm, laid back approach to super wealth and appeared to have continued the modest trend by opting for a £17,000 4x4 Kuga. The sensible buy is a far cry from the dream car Gillian admitted to craving when she discovered the win - a £60,000 Audi Q7. Millions of admirers were surprised to hear the Bayfords celebrated their fortune by having takeaway pizzas from Dominos. Next they shunned exclusive resorts and the tropics by jetting off for a caravaning holiday with Gillian's parents in Scotland. Gillian has worked in ward D2 at Addenbrooke's for three years but said she intended to leave the job to spend more time with her family. The couple are still living in the same four bedroom, detached house, they owned before the win with children Cameron, four, and Aimee, six. According to The Sunday Times Rich List, the Bayfords now have a fortune to rival Jamie and Jools Oliver (£150m), Sir Tom Jones (£140m) and Eric Clapton (£130m).

For thousands of years, people have gazed at the night sky and found things they can relate to their lives on earth. Where the ancient Greeks saw mythological characters in the stars though, today’s scientists have spotted something a little less glamorous. Astronomers have discovered a molecular cloud, formations in space known as the nursery of an unborn star, which they say looks like a pig’s tail. The giant 'pigs tail' cloud spotted 30,000 light years from earth . The Japanese research team found two giant molecular clouds 30,000 light years from our Solar System which they believe collided and formed the peculiar shape. And, spotting the twist in its tail, they gave the gas cloud an equally peculiar name. While the clouds often collide, few have been seen to do so with the spectacular consequences found by Shinji Matsumura, a second year Ph. D. candidate, and Tomoharu Oka, an Associate Professor, the research team from the Department of Physics at Keio University. They said they believe a magnetic tube was formed between the two giant molecular clouds, which is 'twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure during the frictional contact'. Their research suggested that the molecular gas is captured by the twisted magnetic tube, forming the distinctive 'pigtail' shape. Researchers believe the galaxy was formed between the two giant molecular clouds, which is twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure. Our Galaxy has a high quantity of the molecular gas which forms stars within a 600 light year radius from its centre. Those clouds become increasingly dense and orbit the Galaxy’s nucleus. At the distance that these two are found, there are two closed elliptical orbits clouds travel along and, at one of the two intersections, molecular clouds often collide. The huge gas formations can eventually give birth to new stars as they become denser. The gas is compressed even more when clouds collide with each other, meaning the strange shape observed by the scientists manning the NRO 45m Telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NAOJ) in the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan – which measures around 60 light years by 60 light years - could one day become a star itself. Mr Matsumura said: 'In order to solve the mystery of the pigtail molecular cloud, we carried out high-resolution spectroscopic observations of rotational spectral lines for six other molecules. 'Those molecules are clues to understanding the physical state. 'We were amazed by the clear and beautiful helical structure of the ‘pigtail’ molecular cloud in the data taken by the follow-up observation. 'The data revealed that the pigtail molecular cloud has a huge volume of gas, several hundreds of thousands times greater than the Sun has.'","Astronomers believe unique twisting shape was created when two clouds collided .

Some things are just better together - working hand in hand to bring the best out of each other. Take one away, and often what was once a magical combination becomes empty, meaningless and lacks that vital ingredient. Alive and kicking again: Tekken is set to explode on to consoles on September 14 . All except one...Tekken. A fighting game of such pedigree that not even breaking it from its arcade shackles, and swapping 'insert coin' for 'press start' could drag it into mediocrity. It kept its soul. It kept its identity and it blossomed, punching and kicking its way into thousands of homes. This was a tactician’s beat-em-up. A game not bought for its gruesome fatalities or buckets of blood. But one that rewarded you to spectacular fist fights for the long hours spent honing your moves, learning combinations and studying your challenger’s weak points. The inevitable sequels, spin-offs and (lame) movies soon spawned. Tekken had managed to do what many had failed to achieve. It had transcended the world of video games and had become a brand. But, like with any good thing, the dream had to end, and slowly but surely Tekken’s impact on consoles blunted – swamped by mediocre copycats that cared more about the size of their characters’ ‘assets’ than gameplay. Indeed, it looked like gamers had been treated to the last taste of true, arcade-style fighting. Until now... Three's a crowd: You'll be able to perform tag throws . Because like a roundhouse kick to the head, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is exploding on to consoles. Its mission…to restore faith in the struggling genre. It’s off to a good start, offering the largest roster yet in the series with 50 new and returning characters. Along with returning modes such as Arcade, Versus, Team Battle, Time Attack and Survival, there’s a new mode called Fight Lab for Tekken 'noobs'. Here, you take control of a Combot who is taught a load of moves through various stages. There’s even a (sort of) story there to keep you playing and to stop it feeling like a boring tutorial. But the real reason why you’d buy Tekken is for the multiplayer. This lets you challenge your friends in a 2-on-2 tag-team battle, 1-on-1 or 1-on-2. Players are able to switch their fighters at any time, which lets the resting character gradually recover some life they might have lost. You can do special techniques such as tag throws, which can be countered if your timing is good enough. And there are also loads of different items that can alter gameplay – ranging from weapons such as firearms and hammer hats, to superficial KOs. You can customise your character with some accessories, too. Graphically, the game’s looking sharp. The frame-rate never slows down, colours are vibrant and character models are full of detail. Level design is inspired, ranging from the hilarious to the down-right weird. One stage, for example, sees you fight in front of rapper Snoop Dogg, while he sits on a glitzy throne surrounded by women – his music (written specifically for the game) playing in the background. Bear-knuckle fighting: The weird world of Tekken sees you fight massive animals . Another sees you surrounded by pandas and bears wearing tutus, dancing around like ballerinas while some bizarre light show flashes away. But that’s the aim of this latest Tekken game – it pulls no punches on creativity. It’s striving to reinvent itself, to be remembered, and re-establish itself as the fighting phenomenon it once was. However, in a world where more and more gamers demand depth, story and multi-layered offerings, it’ll be interesting to see whether the simple beat-em-up genre can hold its own, or if its linear nature is now out-of-date with current gaming expectations. Come September, we’ll find out if Tekken Tag 2 has done enough to get the beat-em-genre alive and kicking again.

The firm hopes the new, minimalist logo will help improve its image. It comes as the Redmond giant prepares to release a new software and its first hardware product, a tablet designed to take on the iPad. The makeover unveiled on Thursday marks the first time that Microsoft has revamped its logo since February 1987 - when the internet was only beginning its rise to popularity, and mobile phones were rare. New age: The redesigned image is Microsoft's first new logo in since 1987 as the company prepares to launch a series of new products . Classic: The previous Microsoft logo which has not been changed since 1987 . Through the years: This image shows the evolution of the company's logo from 1975 to 1987 - the last logo before the new launch on Thursday . When Microsoft last revamped its look, The firm was putting . the finishing touches on the second version of its Windows operating . system. Two of Microsoft's biggest nemeses - Google Inc. co-founders . Larry Page and Sergey Brin - were just 13 years old. And Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs was just in the second year of an 11-year exile . from the company that went on to invent the iPod, iPhone and iPad after . he returned. By revamping its logo, Microsoft is trying to signal that it has changed its thinking and its products to cater to people who are interacting with technology much differently than just a decade ago, let alone a quarter century. Now, more computing tasks are being done on touch-based devices such as smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers tethered to keyboards and mice. Apple has changed its logo five times - but settled on a minimalist logo quickly . Many software applications are now supplied over high-speed Internet connections for a monthly fee instead of being installed on individual computers. Microsoft believes a radical change to Windows will ensure that the company survives the technological upheaval. Windows 8, due to hit the market Oct. 26, displays software applications in a mosaic of tiles and has been engineered so it works on both touch-based tablets and traditional PCs. The company also is releasing its own Windows 8-powered tablet to compete against the iPad, accompanied by a new version of Office applications tailored for such devices. There also will be a Windows 8 operating system for smartphones. The new logo ushers in 'one of the most significant waves of product launches in Microsoft's history,' Jeff Hansen, the company's general manager of brand strategy, wrote in a blog post Thursday. New look: The new Microsoft logo, left on the Microsoft store inside the Prudential Center mall in Boston, comes as the company toes to unify its branding ahead of a clutch of new product releases this year . New beginning: Employees jump with excitement as the curtain drops at the new Microsoft Store in Boston on Thursday . Ready for business: Microsoft employee Mykal Carton picks up his laptop sporting the new company logo on Thursday . The redesign features the Microsoft name in a lighter, straight font called Segoe to replace the italic bold type used in the old standby. The new logo also includes the familiar red, blue, yellow and green colors used in the flag on Microsoft's Windows operating system, but the colors will be in a square box instead of the curvy template that has been in place for years. Those color boxes invoke the tiles that will be central to Windows 8. 'The ways people experience our products are our most important 'brand impressions,'' Hansen wrote. 'That's why the new Microsoft logo takes its inspiration from our product design principles while drawing upon the heritage of our brand values, fonts and colors.' The new logo made its debut Thursday on Microsoft's websites, as well as three of its stores in Boston, Bellevue, Wash. and Seattle, which is located near the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters. This is Microsoft's fifth logo since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company 37 years ago. When it last changed its logo in 1987, Microsoft had been a publicly traded company for less than a year and boasted a market value of about $2 billion. It peaked at more than $600 million in 1999. Now, Microsoft's market value stands at $254 billion - less than half of Apple's market value of $623 billion.","Firm hopes new minimalist logo will help it compete with 'cool' Apple .

A high school senior has won the right to wear her 'I ♥ Boobies (Keep a Breast)' bracelet to school - after a two year battle with administrators who complained the accessory was disruptive. Sara Dickinson, whose grandmother died from breast cancer, was threatened with detention and even a court injunction after she wore the jewelry to support cancer awareness during her sophomore year at Nathan Hale-Ray High School in East Haddam, Connecticut. The high schooler enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Connecticut, who said the school was denying the teenager her First Amendment right to free speech. The little bracelet that started this war: Sara Dickinson displays the rubber wrist band that prompted a two year struggle with her school . According to Dickinson, she bought . the $4 rubber wrist band from The Keep A Breast Foundation, a . youth-focused cancer advocacy group during her sophomore year. But after wearing the bracelet for a . few months in 2010, she faced resistance and was told by her school . principal, Eric Spencer, that she could no longer bring it to school . because it was disruptive to students. 'I could see how [the bracelet] could . be distracting but my rationale was that kids in my school walk around . with hair that is absolutely neon pink,' Dickinson told The Hartford Courant, adding, 'I really feel that neon pink hair is much more distracting than a white bracelet.' She . relented and stopped wearing the bracelet but after a friend's mother . was diagnosed with breast cancer, she began wearing it again to school. This time it was confiscated on two occasions and she was threatened . with detention. Stand up to cancer: Sara Dickinson shows off the offending bracelet (left). Various versions of the wrist band were sold by The Keep A Breast Foundation, which works to mobilize youth to raise awareness for cancer . Dickinson . said that school officials presented a compromise last June, offering . to let students design a similar bracelet but with different language. She added that the school said they would seek an injunction to prohibit . her from wearing the wrist band at school if she persisted. Dickinson rejected this offer and instead contacted the ACLU for guidance. The advocacy group wrote to the . Connecticut school in early August, saying that a student's right to . free speech still must be protected within the confines of school . property, citing a Supreme Court case from 1969 - Tinker v. Des Moines . Independent Community School District. The . letter further explained that limits on a child's speech is only . justified if the language threatens to 'materially or substantially . interfere with ... the operations of the school' or if it is deemed . 'vulgar and lewd,' according to another case in 1986, Bethel School Dis. No. 403 v. Fraser. Disruptive? The teenager says she doesn't think her bracelet is as disruptive of some of the odd fashions she sees high schoolers sporting . In 2011, a Pennsylvania School District similarly objected to the 'I ♥ Boobies (Keep a Breast)' tagline and a group of female students from the area have been embroiled in a back-and-forth legal battle. A federal judge ruled in April that the ban, on the grounds the language is lewd, vulgar or sexually offensive, was unconstitutional. The school district has appealed the decision and arguments are expected to be heard in early 2013. Given the legal precedence, the ACLU requested that the Connecticut school district rethink their policy forbidding Dickinson and other students from wearing the bracelet. Not on school grounds: Officials at the Nathan Hale-Ray High School (pictured) in East Haddam, Connecticut told Sara Dickinson that her bracelet was disruptive to students . After receiving the letter, the school reached out to Dickinson's mother, Terry, informing her that Sara could resume wearing her bracelet to school. 'It's nice to know somebody is going to let me exercise my rights,' Dickinson told the local paper, adding, 'The whole point was to get everybody talking, to raise awareness of breast cancer.' The ACLU was similarly celebrating the victory. 'The school district has made the right decision. Public school students have free speech rights that can't be violated merely because school officials dislike the message or the way it's expressed,' Sandra Staub, legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said in a statement. 'While restrictions can be placed on speech that threatens a substantial disruption in the school or on speech that is so lewd and vulgar as to undermine the educational mission, Sara's bracelet caused no such harm,' she added.","Sara Dickinson wore the rubber wrist band after her grandmother died from breast cancer in 2010 .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 09:49 EST, 1 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:11 EST, 1 November 2012 . Dame Helen Ghosh said women were excluded because 'politics is so driven by networks that women looking after children could not break in' An ‘Old Etonian clique’ around David Cameron has helped exclude women from top government posts, a former mandarin has claimed. Dame Helen Ghosh said Westminster politics was driven by powerful groups that women could not break into because they were too busy with children to network like men. In a talk with students at Cambridge University she appeared to attack the Prime Minister’s ‘network of friends’ and bemoaned the lack of women running Whitehall departments. The former permanent secretary at the Home Office quit earlier this year after a 33-year Whitehall career. ‘If you look at the current government, not necessarily back to the Bullingdon Club days, but Cameron, it is true, it is well known, has a clique, a network of friends – the friends he made at school, friends he made at university,’ she said. ‘That kind of clique network was reinforced in Cameron’s case by the people who worked for him in opposition, the people who supported him in his leadership bid.’ Mr Cameron’s inner circle includes Old Etonian chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and ‘gatekeeper’ Kate Fall, who met Mr Cameron at Oxford. The Prime Minister recently made Old Etonian Sir George Young his chief whip and George Osborne’s chief adviser Rupert Harrison is a former head boy at Eton. Dame Helen told members of the Clare College politics society: ‘The fact that politics is so driven by networks does impact on women. ‘Women don’t network. It is actually quite difficult for a woman to get in as part of an Old Etonian clique. ‘They are far too busy doing other things, like bringing up their children, looking after their constituency. That kind of networking is actually a harder thing for women to do.’ She said that, despite a ‘magical moment’ in 2006 and 2007 – when half of the heads of Government departments were women – top jobs at the Treasury and the Cabinet Office were ‘still going to men, which I regret’. She added: ‘Female cabinet ministers do a bit of networking among themselves but the other networks in governments are often much, much more powerful – whether it’s the Etonian clique or the Brownites or the Blairites.’ Talks: David Cameron is pictured at Downing Street tonight with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf following a UN High Level panel meeting . Downing Street reacted angrily to the comments reported by the London Evening Standard. Officials pointed out that Mr Cameron was surrounded by high profile and powerful women, including his press secretary Gabby Bertin and Liz Sugg, who masterminds his public appearances and travels with him everywhere. Others observed that Dame Helen quit the Home Office after falling out with Home Secretary Theresa May, only the second woman to hold that senior Cabinet post. After the comments were denounced by the Prime Minister’s official spokesman as ‘not true’, Dame Helen issued a carefully-worded clarification. She said: ‘It is entirely false to say that I suggested that I think David Cameron surrounds himself by Old Etonians – or that he has too few women in his team. A cursory look at the important roles around him reveals it is simply not the case.’ But the Evening Standard stood by the story, saying it had a tape of Dame Helen’s comments. She did not deny the quotes attributed to her. Dame Helen Ghoash, who retired as permanent secretary of the Home Office, claimed David Cameron 'has a clique' of friends from school which it is difficult for women to break into . The observations are potentially damaging to Mr Cameron because they strengthen the view held by many MPs that he has a ‘woman problem’ and he is loyal to a fault to friends from school, university and his time in the Conservative Research department. In his September reshuffle, he kept the number of female Cabinet ministers at four but let the proportion of female ministers fall. Just last week, the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Gender Gap Report revealed Britain had slipped down the global league table as a result of the shake-up. He has also faced criticism for dismissive comments to female MPs in the Commons. The PM told Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’ and dismissed Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries as ‘frustrated’. Miss Dorries said last night: ‘Dame Helen is quite right. Girls do not get to go to Eton and it’s still a boys’ club in Westminster.’ Yvette Cooper, Labour’s spokesman for women, said: ‘Dame Helen Ghosh’s comments about the Prime Minister’s Eton clique are one more reason why women don’t get a look in and why the Government is out of touch. ‘His attitude to women is of a different era.’","Dame Helen Ghosh quits as Home Office permanent secretary with a devastating attack on the PM's top team .

Little more than half of British children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15, according to shocking statistics on the breakdown of family life. Eight out ten babies are born to couples living together, but that figure falls to just 55 per cent as they grow up. The figures were released as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced plans to pay private firms and charities to help keep Britain’s 120,000 problem families together. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today released figures showing how the percentage of children still living with both birth parents falls as children grew up. Source: Understanding Society, 2009-2010 . He said the Government would change the way it measures the success of social programmes for the poor, to make preventing the breakdown of family life the key yardstick. Rather than simply recording how much money is thrown at the schemes, officials will have to log how they promote family stability, combat worklessness and whether children in the families affected perform as well their peers in other families. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith used a speech today to say the government would intervene to stop parents splitting up . Companies will then be paid according to whether they improve those statistics in the 120,000 families identified as the cause of most anti-social behaviour in Britain. Calling family ‘the most important building block in a child’s life’, Mr Duncan Smith made clear the Government will prioritise keeping families together. In a speech yesterday at a Social Justice Conference in London, he said: ‘Stable, loving families matter. They matter for this government, and they matter for the most vulnerable in society. ‘By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.’ He added: ‘You don’t help  families by shrugging your shoulders when parental relationships fall apart. ‘When families are strong and stable, so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child’s later life can be devastating.’ The Government will also measure whether children from disadvantaged backgrounds do as well at school as other pupils and the percentage of young people who fall ‘into a pattern of offending’. A survey of offenders found 41 per cent had witnessed violence in their home as a child. Other measures of success will focus on outcomes for those in treatment for addiction, and re-offending rates for those who  have committed crime, recognising that such problems are often linked and overlapping. The proportion of benefit claimants who are able to work, but have been on out-of-work benefits for three out of the last four years will also be recorded to allow the Government to ‘concentrate efforts  on reaching those for whom worklessness has become a way of life’, Mr Duncan Smith said. Figures released by the DWP yesterday show that of those currently on out-of-work benefits, 59 per cent, or around 2.5million individuals, have been claiming for at least 75 per cent of the four-year period. That means 2.5million have been on benefits for three out of the last four years. Hailing the payment by results scheme, Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Because we are paying by results, we will only pay for what works - reducing the risk on the taxpayer and ensuring that every pound of Government money is only being spent where it has a positive impact on people’s lives.’","Works and Pensions Secretary warns of the 'devastating' impact on youngsters when parents split up .

A motorcyclist who was recorded doing the highest speed in the country when he was caught travelling at 152mph on a Sussex road, was today disqualified from driving. At the time he was caught, in October last year, it was the fastest recorded speed caught on traffic cameras to date. Engineer Steven Tull, 37, of Liphook, Hampshire, was sentenced at Worthing Magistrates' Court for dangerous driving, speeding and driving without a valid test certificate. Defence lawyer Marie Lewiecki told the court that Tull lives with his wife in Hampshire but works in Oxfordshire and would struggle with his commute if he lost his licence. Judge Roderick Hine sentenced Tull to a 12-month driving disqualification - the minimum he could impose. Tull was also ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £620 prosecution costs. Judge Hine said: 'I know you find it hard to accept your driving was dangerous. 'The reason you were convicted of dangerous driving is what could have happened. 'You could have been involved in a fatal accident, it was an unbelievable speed. 'You could have lost control of the vehicle putting other people at risk.' Tull was caught at 1.49pm on October 16 last year travelling at 152mph on his Yamaha R1 motorbike on the A27 at Binstead in West Sussex. Prosecuting Andrew Perry told the court Tull recorded the highest speed on any camera in England in 2011. He said: 'He was driving in the presence of other traffic the behaviour of which he is unable to predict. 'He wouldn't be able to see further than a white van which he overtakes. 'The potential for an accident is very apparent even without taking into account stopping distances. 'He is ascending a hill and there is a blind crest on the top of the hill and a junction which again he cannot see. 'There is potential for conflict with . other motorists, if he comes into contact with other vehicles at that . speed it's obvious he will be in an accident and possibly a fatal one.' He added that Tull was wearing dark colours and riding a dark bike making him harder to spot. Camera technician Christopher Snell was operating the camera which caught Tull. He was on the opposite side of the dual carriageway when he saw the motorbike. First shot: Tull was recorded traveling at 139mph by camera technician Christopher Snell . And then... Tull was then spotted going at 153mph just four seconds later . He said: 'The first thing I was aware of was the sound, I could hear clearly a large motorcycle engine. 'As I looked across I was pointing with the laser and as he went past me I knew instantly without a shadow of a doubt he was travelling at more than double the speed limit. 'It was phenomenal.' Mr Snell first recorded Tull as travelling at 139mph then four seconds later at 152mph. The court heard from Mr Snell that he had seen two fatal accidents and that on the day of the incident the traffic was 'medium to light' and most cars were travelling at the recommended speed limit. Defending, Marie Lewiecki told the court that over 20 years Tull has never had a previous speeding offence. Mr Tull told the court during his evidence that he had had a 'momentary lack of discipline.' He said: 'There was no reason to keep accelerating. It was a mistake, I shouldn't have exceeded the limit.' The court heard that in interview after the speeding offence Tull admitted he had been speeding but that he didn't know how fast he was going. District Judge Hine said: 'He is approaching the bow of a hill. His evidence is that he could only see 250 metres or so. 'He would have had less than four seconds to stop. More significantly there is a van which is plainly blocking his view. He would not have known if there was a vehicle in front of that van going slowly.' He added: 'The fact that nothing happened is nothing short of good fortune. The defendent had no idea what speed he was driving at any stage. I find that incredible. 'I have raised the issue of road kill which is relevant when we are talking about country roads. If you hit an animal not only would you fly in the air and kill yourself but you could hit someone else. 'For all those reasons I find him guilty of dangerous driving.'","Engineer Steven Tull was first caught at 139mph, then just four seconds later, 152mph .

The first details about the tragic victims of the massacre at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin earlier today are starting to emerge. Six people were shot dead by an unknown attacker, and three more critically wounded, before the gunman was killed engaging the police. At least two of the victims at the Oak Creek temple were priests, who had gathered to tend to the needs of worshippers at the Sunday morning ceremony. Another was a police officer, who was left fighting for his life in hospital after receiving multiple gunshot wounds to the face and abdomen. Dead: The president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, was shot by the gunman after fighting back . Prayer: Mr Kadeka's son Amardeep kneels in a parking lot near the site of the massacre . The identity of the shooter is currently unknown, but he is believed to have been a white man in his 30s, a former soldier with a skinhead and possibly a member of a white supremacist race hate group. Most of the victims have not yet been identified, but the stories of some of those caught in the horrific shooting spree have been revealed. One of the priests who died in the massacre was identified by a temple-goer as priest Parkash Singh, a 30-something father of two. Worshipper Manminder Sethi told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Mr Singh was 'a good guy, a noble soul'. He added that the priest's wife, son and daughter had only recently moved from India to join him in Oak Creek, where Mr Singh had been living for several years. Family: Relatives of the temple president look for more information on the victims' condition . Protection: Heavily armored police officers . patrol the entrance to the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, the scene of . multiple shootings in Oak Creek . The temple's president, 65-year-old Satwant Kaleka, was shot dead by the attacker after trying to fight back. His son Amardeep said that the community leader had attempted to 'knife and tackle the shooter', but was unsuccessful and died of his wounds while trying to hide in the temple. Mr Kaleka's nephew Gurmit Kaleka told the Journal Sentinel that the victim was a father of two who had presided over the religious community since 1996. Another nephew, Jatin Der Mangat, spoke of his grief at hearing of the shooting. 'It was like the heart just sat down,' he said. 'This shouldn't happen anywhere.' Terrified: Crowds of friends and relatives gathered outside the temple desperate for more information . Horrific: At least six victims have been killed . in the shootings. Witnesses describe a chaotic situation with an unknown . number of victims, suspects and possible hostages . Another victim sent to hospital by the gunman was a police officer, a 20-year veteran who was ambushed by the attacker and was shot multiple times. He is undergoing surgery for his injuries, but is expected to survive. Police are treating the incident as an act of 'domestic terrorism' - partly based on tattoos sported by the gunman. It is the second mass shooting to hit the U.S. in less than three weeks, after James Holmes opened fire on a packed movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 58.","Temple president Satwant Singh killed after trying to fight off attacker .

It is a campaign that has garnered global interest and provoked anger at her local council. Now nine-year-old Martha Payne's efforts to highlight the poor standard of food in her school have  found celebrity support. She is teaming up with celebrity chef Nick Nairn to help the council provide more nutritious meals at her school, Lochgilphead Primary in Argyll. Martha's father, Dave Payne, wrote in an email to today.com: 'Nick has been involved in promoting healthy food for many years. 'Martha enjoyed meeting him as did I and his knowledge and enthusiasm are invigorating.' Good cause: Martha's blog, Never Seconds, has raised more than £60,000 since she first started it . The only offer Martha and her father have accepted is working with Nick Nairn to improve the school's food . Martha first hit the headlines after she began her 'NeverSeconds' blog, posting pictures of her miserable school dinners online. The project has already helped generate more than £60,000 in donations to help feed impoverished children around the world. Martha's father told The Telegraph that they have received a number of offers to appear on TV shows around the world and approached by Hollywood about book, television and film deals. However, the only arrangement they have accepted is working with Nairn to improve the school’s food choices. The celebrity intervention comes less . than a week after officials at Argyll and Bute council ordered teachers . to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online. In a post headed ‘Goodbye,’ she wrote: ‘This morning in maths I got . taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office. ‘I was told that I could not take any more photos of my school dinners.’ But the officials seriously underestimated the youngster’s internet . following and thousands of people, led by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, . took to Twitter to criticise their decision, leading to a humiliating . U-turn by the council. Within hours of Oliver tweeting to Martha to ‘stay strong’ and urging . his 2.3million followers to re-post his message, the schoolgirl’s blog . became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide. Critics . lined up to accuse the council of ‘bullying’ Martha by trying to . ‘silence her freedom of expression’ and thousands signed a petition to . get them to overturn the ban. And now Nairn has stepped in to offer . his support. His restaurant Braeval  won a Michelin star in 1991, . making him the youngest Scottish chef to win a star . He went on to cook a main course of . Roe venison for Queen Elizabeth II and 250 guests at the Mansion House . for her official 80th birthday celebration. He will also be known to many as a regular chef on Ready Steady Cook. Mega-bite: The schoolgirl posted a photograph of one pathetic offering online as part of a writing project she and her father started . Back for more: The council had tried to shut the blog down before a Twitter bakclash forced a U-turn . Supporters inundated council phonelines with complaints and also pledged . thousands of pounds to the Third World children’s charity linked to . Martha’s blog, smashing her £7,000 target. Donations, from supporters all over the world, including Canada, Germany, America, New Zealand and Australia, now stand at £61,519.07. A school kitchen will now be built in . Malawi as the result of her fundraising efforts, and she has already . come up with a name for it. 'She decided on 'Friends of NeverSeconds'  to reflect all the generous donations,' her father added. Argyll-based Mary’s Meals, the charity supported by . Martha’s blog, revealed she had raised enough to build several kitchens . for starving children in Malawi. The charity said: ‘Martha’s support for Mary’s Meals has been amazing . and we are extremely grateful for everything that she has done to help . us reach some of the hungriest children in the world.’ Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them . Grim grub: Martha's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation . Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children . The decision also angered Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell, whose intervention forced the council to perform a U-turn. Council leader Roddy McCuish announced they would be withdrawing the ban . with immediate effect. He said: ‘It’s a good thing to do, to change . your mind, and I’ve certainly done that.’ Martha’s father, Dave Payne, 39, said common sense had . prevailed. ‘Martha is beaming,’ he said. ‘She came home from school with . a big smile on her face. ‘She is delighted she can carry on blogging, but more so about the money . being raised for the charity. People have been very, very generous. The . way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing, it’s just fantastic . that common sense has prevailed.’ The saga began seven weeks ago when Martha, with permission from . teachers at Lochgilphead Primary School, started taking pictures of her . £2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project. Victory! Martha Payne, 9, and her father David were all smiles after the council's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog . Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, . standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the . rest of Britain appear not to have been applied. Her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely . potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for . dessert and a lot of empty space. Alongside the photo, the schoolgirl wrote: ‘The pizza in the first pic . was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing . kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I can’t do it on one . croquette. Do any of you think you could?’ Beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger, two potato croquets, . a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly, Martha wrote: ‘Today’s . meal was on the menu as Cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you . can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream. I wish they had stuck to . the menu.’ Over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive . following, with more than two million people throughout the world . logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site. After seeing the photographs, Oliver, a veteran school food campaigner, . sent a tweet to her father, which read: ‘Shocking but inspirational . blog. Keep going. Big love from Jamie x.’ Martha later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his . Jamie’s Great Britain cookbook in which he wrote: ‘Dear Martha, great . work!!! Clever girl. Lots of love. Jamie O. XXX Keep it up!!’ But last week, Martha, whose mother is a GP, revealed that teachers . wanted her to stop taking the photographs. The council said the decision . was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper, under the . headline ‘Time to fire the dinner ladies’, left some members of staff at . the school in tears.

Safe: Police now confirm Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson is safe after a missing persons report was filed by her nephew on Saturday . In the whirlwind of bizarre family allegations over Michael Jackson's will and the disappearance of his 82-year-old mother and beneficiary to his estate, police say they have now been in contact with Katherine Jackson reported missing since Saturday. Katherine Jackson, the mother of Michael Jackson and guardian of his three children, is safe and with a family member in Arizona, authorities said late on Sunday, one day after another relative reported her missing to police. Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Mark Pope said investigators made contact with Mrs Jackson, but he did not have specifics on her whereabouts. The agency previously said they believed she was with a relative and safe, but wanted to speak with her, a request that went unanswered. 'Mother is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister, . Rebbie, resting up on doctor's advice, so it is beyond me how she can be . reported ""missing,""' her son Jermaine Jackson said in a statement late on Sunday. He said access to his mother is not being blocked but that her access to phones and computers was removed for her well being. 'Furthermore, it dismays me that such an alarmist ""missing person"" report has caused unnecessary anxiety among Michael's children who will understandably react to what they misunderstand, hear or are told,' he said. Scroll down for video . Legal guardian: Katherine Jackson, far left, is guardian to Michael's children Blanket, third left, Prince, center and Paris, right. She and his three children are also Michael's only beneficiaries. Appeal: Paris Jackson, Michael's 14-year-old daughter, tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on Sunday morning . Concerned: The late-singer's teenage daughter Paris asked for help finding her grandmother while concerned she's in the care of a man she disproves of . Katherine is guardian to her son Michael's three . children, Paris, Blanket and Prince, but her grandchildren reported losing . contact with her for a week's time, prompted a missing person report on . Saturday night by her nephew, Trent Jackson. With her three grandchildren and . herself being sole beneficiaries to his estate, Mrs Jackson's . disappearance occurred at the same time of a brewing battle among other . family members over his will believed faked after his death in June of . 2009. Worried for her grandmother's safety, . Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris tweeted on early Sunday that she . wanted her to return home. ‘yes, . my grandmother is missing. i haven't spoken with her in a week i want . her home now,' the 14-year-old tweeted adding a number to call if there . was any word. It was unclear who is taking care of the children in Mrs Jackson's absence. At the same time of Paris' pleas for help, her uncle Jermaine tweeted his own of assurance that his mother was safe and being taken care of during a time of medical need, naming a mini-stroke in recent months. Status updates: Jermaine Jackson took to Twitter to issue statements on his mother's whereabouts through the weekend . Reassuring: Michael's brother Jermaine assured that his mother is resting under doctor's orders but without her grandchildren claiming to know much more . That stroke was initially disputed by the teen who tweeted that ‘nothing had happened to her.’ The tweet was later deleted. The incident demonstrated divisions . in the Jackson family just days after five of the singer's siblings once . again claimed that the King of Pop's will was a fake and that the . executors of his lucrative estate should step down. The undated letter, signed by Janet, . Randy, Tito, Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson, claimed Katherine Jackson was . being manipulated by the executors, John Branca and John McClain, her . health had been affected, and she suffered a mini-stroke. - Paris Jackson . The estate has denied the . accusations, which have swirled since Michael Jackson died from an . overdose of a powerful anesthetic. Katherine Jackson obtained permission . from a judge to investigate the will's validity, but never pursued the . matter in court. Paris later hearing her grandmother was sent . away on doctor's orders did little to calm the teen, however, who . expressed concern of a possibly more dangerous situation brewing. ‘the same doctor that testified on . behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring . for my grandmother... just saying,’ she wrote. Radar Online identified that doctor as Dr Allan Metzger, the . same who wrote fraudulent prescriptions for Michael's sister Janet . Jackson leading to his 2009 reprimand by the Medical Board of . California. Last fall he testified in Dr Conrad Murray's trial that Michael had come to him requesting Propofol, the drug that ended his life. Metzger said he refused Michale's request and warned him of the consequences, aiding prosecutors despite being a defense witness. Care: Katerine Jackson's daughters LaToya, left and Rebbie, right, are seen beside her earlier this month while sources say the grandmother is currently staying with Rebbie in Arizona . Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the June 2009 . propofol overdose death of Jackson at age 50. According . to Radar Online, Metzger was called on specifically by brothers . Jermaine and Randy Jackson to treat their mother last week. Metzger is not Katherine Jackson's primary physician and her regular doctor . wasn't aware of his house call until concerns about Katherine Jackson's . whereabouts were raised, Jackson’s lawyer, Sandra  Ribera said. A phone message left for Metzger at his Beverly Hills practice was not . immediately returned Sunday. Earlier in the weekend he had said his mother was in Arizona resting 'on the orders of a doctor, not us,' where he reported himself being too. He reports his mother having suffered 'a mini-stroke some months ago. Doctor's orders: Dr. Allan Metzger, Michael Jackson's former physician, is seen last October during the Dr. Conrad Murray involuntary manslaughter trial. He's reported to be currently caring for Katherine Jackson in Arizona . 'She is fine now, but the timeline doesn't alter the fact it happened,' he tweeted. Michael’s three children have lived with . their grandmother since their father's untimely death. Not speaking to them . for a week was unheard of, according to . Ribera. According to Ribera, on July 15 Jackson left her Calabasas, California, home with her daughter Rebbie to attend a Jackson brothers concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico a few days later. It was on July 14 Metzger examined her after being brought to her Calabasas home by someone close to the family, she said. She had been scheduled to depart on an RV trip to the Southwest to watch her sons perform. The elder Jackson never made any of the shows and Metzger apparently told her not to take the trip, Ribera said. When Paris has called her grandmother she has been told she cannot speak to her, Ribera said. Missing guardian: Mrs Jackson, pictured with Prince and Paris during Michael's public memorial service in 2009, is the guardian of his three children though it's not known who is currently caring for them with her gone . Ribera said that Jackson 'has never gone 24 hours without talking to her kids,' and added that she was concerned the 82-year-old was not safe. The sheriff's homicide-missing persons unit was asked to investigate, Ribera confirmed. Since Michael's death his net worth has skyrocketed more than the amount when he was alive. According to Billboard, MJ Inc has made no less than $1 billion a year thanks to his record deal with Sony Music, which is extended until 2017, as well as his concern films. Michael's family bands The Jacksons and the Jackson 5 have sold approximately 800,000 albums according to Nielsen Soundscan while his independent albums have sold 9 million units in the U.S. alone.

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:58 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:58 EST, 22 August 2012 . A witness testified at Drew Peterson's murder trial today that the former Illinois police officer offered him $25,000 to hire a hit man to kill his third wife just three months before she was found dead. Prosecutors allege that Peterson, 58, killed Kathleen Savio himself because he feared a settlement after their divorce would ruin him, but they presented the hit-man testimony in a bid to establish that he had thought seriously about her murder in advance. Jeff Pachter told the jury that Peterson asked him to locate a hit man during a late night ride in his squad car in the Chicago suburb. Drew Peterson trial: Another pathologist stated that Savio could not have been killed as a result of falling because of the large gash at the back of her head . Power house: Attorney James Glasgow, far right, leaves the Will County Courthouse with his prosecution team as the Drew Peterson murder trial continues . Savio was found dead in a bathtub in her suburban Chicago home with a gash on the back of her head in March 2004, just three months later. 'He asked if I could find someone to take care of his third wife,' said Pachter, who worked with the Bolingbrook police sergeant when he was moonlighting at a cable company. 'He indicated that he would give me the $25,000 and if I could find someone to do it for less I could keep the remaining balance.' The two agreed on a code word that he would use to let Peterson know when the deed was done. Pachter said he couldn't remember the exact word but that it had something to do with cookies. Prosecutors, who say they could rest within several days, have no physical evidence, so they are trying to build a circumstantial case that leads jurors to conclude Peterson must have killed Savio. Her death was initially ruled an accident but was reclassified a homicide after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007. Peterson is a suspect in Stacy Peterson's disappearance but hasn't been charged in her case. Peterson hunched forward in his Joliet courtroom seat and appeared to listen intently to Pachter, 38, who spoke in a firm, monotone voice. Pachter said the officer also told him to let him know when the hit was scheduled so he could arrange a plausible alibi. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left. It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the . bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a . homicide . One idea Peterson mentioned was starting a fight at an amusement park on the day so there would be a record he was there. And he told the jury Peterson warned him to keep the plan quiet. 'He told me at the end of the ride along that, ""This is something you will take to your grave"",' Pachter said. During cross-examination, defense . attorney Joe Lopez pressed Pachter on his criminal record, which . includes a conviction for sexual abuse, and accused him of inventing his . story for personal profit. 'It's hard to remember things when . you are making them up, isn't it?' Lopez asked when Pachter said he . couldn't recall details of an earlier statement. 'You want your 15 . minutes of fame, don't you?' Pachter shot back: 'No, I do not.' Pachter conceded he had a hard time . telling if Peterson was serious about the request, describing him as . prone to kidding around and that he was always calm no matter the . situation. Forensic pathologist Larry Blum told jurors he didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh gash on the back of her head . And, he said, he took no steps to act on the request. Pachter hadn't heard that Savio was . dead when he called Peterson in July 2004 to ask how his newest wife, . Stacy, and their kids were doing. 'He said his family was doing good,' said Pachter. 'After that, he said, 'The favor that I asked you — I . don't need it anymore.'' Prosecutors' only witness yesterday . was pathologist Mary Case, who testified that a two-inch gash on the . back of Savio's head could not have caused her to pass out. That counters defense suggestions that Savio slipped in her bathtub, hit her head, lost consciousness and drowned. As Case spoke, prosecutors projected . autopsy photos of Savio's head with the top half of her skull cut away . and some jurors shifted uncomfortably in their seats. The wound penetrated the thick layer of skin around the skull, Case told jurors, but caused no damage to the brain. 'There was no brain trauma ... no internal brain injury that would have caused a loss of consciousness,' Case said. Case is one of several forensic experts to testify as prosecutors seek to prove that Savio was murdered. She . said Savio would have had to fall hard three separate times to account . for deep bruises on the front of her body and the injury to the back of . her head. But the judge upheld a defense objection about that comment and told jurors to disregard it. Last week, another pathologist  testified last week, saying he . didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh . gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front . of her bod . ‘I couldn't see how that could happen,’ Dr Larry Blum testified. Blum, a key witness for the state, was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day. Over the objections of prosecutors, . the judge let defense attorney Ralph Meczyk ask if three other . pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held Savio died . accidentally. Missing: Peterson, left, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . March 20, 2010: Drew Peterson stands in the bedroom of the home from where his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, disappeared from in 2007 . ‘Despite their opinion, you say homicide?’ the attorney asked. 'I haven't changed my opinion,’ Blum responded. Blum . also denied Meczyk's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results . to mesh with Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow's theory that . Savio was murdered. Blum . testified earlier that Savio's circular tub also had no edges . pronounced enough to cause the two-inch, straight-line wound on her . head. Also, . the position of Savio's body in the tub - face down and with her feet . jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she . slipped and hit the back of her head, he said. Peterson, . a 58-year-old former suburban Chicago police officer, has pleaded not . guilty to first-degree murder in Savio's death. He is also a suspect in . Stacy Peterson's disappearance, although he has never been charged in . her case. Authorities presume she is dead, though a body has never been . found.","Drew Peterson pleaded not guilty to murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004 .

Brought up in Cambridge and boasting a degree in Latin and history, Katherine Broadbent could be forgiven for thinking her ability to speak English would be beyond question. That was, however, until she tried to get a job with the NHS. After returning from working as a nurse in Australia, the mother-of-one has been told she must sit a costly series of exams to prove her fluency before she is allowed on UK wards. Despite being British, because she did her medical training outside of Europe, Mrs Broadbent will have to take an International English Language Test to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. By contrast, thanks to a European ruling in 2006, nurses who qualify in EU countries are exempt from the same tests to work here – even if they can barely speak English. Mrs Broadbent spent the first 26 years of her life in the UK before moving to Canberra shortly after graduating. She completed a nursing degree before working in intensive care and cancer wards of a hospital for nine years. But earlier this year she decided to return home, settling with her husband Robert, 44, and two-year-old daughter Elke near the Cotswold town of Lechlade. After being told she must pay £125 to sit the day-long IELT exam – which tests English reading, writing, speaking and listening – Mrs Broadbent, 40, wrote to the Department of Health and the NMC to appeal. Their response was that there can be ‘no individual dispensations’. She said: ‘There’s been a real lack of common sense and that has been really frustrating. ‘We lived for a long time in Australia and the systems over there were much simpler. ‘I would understand if I did my training in a non English-speaking country, but to include Australia is ridiculous. ‘We decided to come back to the UK . before our daughter was at school age to decide where we wanted to live. 'I thought it would be really simple to start working as a nurse and was . looking forward to starting in a hospital. ‘The . process has been quite long and I thought there would be someone who . would understand that I’m British and already have another degree from . this country. All I received though was letters saying there could not . be exceptions. ‘The test is quite expensive and was around £500 if I sat it in Australia.’ Untested: Due to EU regulations, candidates from countries within the union are exempt from the test . Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Dr Peter Carter said: ‘It is reasonable that communications skills are tested but, regardless of their background, nurses should not be discouraged by the cost of language testing.’ The bizarre situation comes after the . Daily Mail revealed NHS patients were being put in danger after European . nurses were resorting to sign language as they could not speak English. One . mistakenly handed out a trifle with nutty toppings to a patient with a . nut allergy because they did not understand warnings in his medical . notes. Lord Winston, the . world-renowned fertility doctor, expressed concerns last year about . Romanian and Bulgarian nurses working in the NHS who had been trained in . a ‘completely different way’. English speakers included: Even nurses from countries which have English as their first language, such as New Zealand, Australia and the US must take at test to register with the Nursing and Midwifery council . The NMC said all nurses from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the US would have to pass an IELT exam before registering. A spokesman added: ‘This ensures that all applicants meet the same standard in a system that is equitable, fair and non-discriminatory.’ The Department of Health said the NMC was responsible for ‘rigorous standards’ but would not comment on Mrs Broadbent’s case.","Katherine Broadbent grew up in Cambridge and moved to Australia aged 26 .

Doctors there confirmed a bladder infection, which kept him in hospital for five nights two months ago, had returned. Good spirits: The Duke appeared happy and healthy during an appearance at the Cowes Regatta on the Isle of Wight . Monday: The Duke looked in good health as he strolled around Cowes, Isle of Wight, waving at well-wishers . Appearance: The Duke spent Monday and Tuesday on the Isle of Wight, carrying out several public engagements . The Duke had met wellwishers and strolled around the Isle of Wight during his public engagements earlier this week, but has since been hospitalised . The latest health scare will raise . inevitable questions about the strains imposed on the Duke by his . workload of royal engagements. He made a number of visits to the Olympic . Games before travelling to Scotland, then heading for Cowes on the Isle . of Wight from where he flew back to Balmoral yesterday morning by . helicopter. Buckingham Palace said he was taken to . Aberdeen Royal Infirmary from the castle in the Cairngorms ‘as a . precautionary measure’ and was expected to stay in hospital ‘for the . next few days’. A palace statement said: ‘The Duke of . Edinburgh has had a recurrence of the bladder infection that he had in . the summer and has been admitted to hospital for investigation and . treatment.’ The Queen is being kept informed of his condition. It is not yet known if she will visit him. It is the third time in eight months . that the Duke has needed hospital treatment. He was in Papworth . Hospital, Cambridge, for four nights over Christmas after successful . heart surgery to clear a blocked coronary artery. Family time: The Duke with daughter Princess Anne watching Zara compete in the Olympics earlier this month . Treatment: Police stand guard outside the A&E entrance of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where Prince Philip has been taken . 'Precaution': The Duke's visit to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary comes after he suffered a bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations . In March Prince Harry said the . operation – in which a stent was inserted – had given his grandfather ‘a . new spurt of life’. But in June he was forced to miss some of the . Diamond Jubilee celebrations after contracting a bladder infection. He spent five nights in King Edward . VII hospital after being taken there by ambulance the day after he and . the Queen braved the elements for four hours during the rain-soaked . Jubilee pageant on the Thames. Doctors said the demanding event had . not caused the infection, but the cold and wet conditions, combined with . not drinking enough and infrequent visits to the lavatory while on the . Royal Barge, could have contributed to his illness. Despite his age the Duke still . undertakes many public engagements. He was at the Queen’s side during . the opening ceremony of the Olympics on July 27 and again the following . day when they toured the Olympic Park. Admitted: The Duke was staying in Balmoral with the Queen when he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . Summer break: The Queen and Prince Philip are pictured arriving at Balmoral in Scotland on Sunday . Private residence: Philip travelled to the hospital, about 40 miles away from Balmoral, (pictured) by road . The Duke was seen at the Games again . on July 29, for his granddaughter Zara Phillips’s Olympic debut, and was . at the ExCel exhibition centre a few days later to watch the boxing. He travelled to Scotland earlier this . month and continued to support the Queen at engagements, including . hosting a tea party for 3,000 guests at Balmoral last week to mark the . end of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. He then travelled to the Isle of Wight . for Cowes Week in his role as Admiral and member of the Royal Yacht . Squadron. On Monday, he attended a luncheon at Newport’s Chamber of . Commerce and then visited stove manufacturer A.J Wells and Sons before . dinner at the Pavilion in Cowes. Jubilee: Prince Philip was taken to hospital with a bladder infection days after River Pageant in June . Dedicated: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stood throughout four hours of wind and rain . On Tuesday he viewed the yacht races . in the Solent before attending a luncheon on the yacht My Farragon, . accompanied by local dignitaries. Onlookers said he appeared to be . relaxed and in good spirits during the visits, but the engagements and . the lengthy journeys between the South Coast and Scotland may have . placed an added strain on his health. The Queen’s husband of 64 years has . always enjoyed good health and most of his past ailments have been . sports-related. Before undergoing heart surgery at Christmas his most . recent illness had been a cold in October last year, which forced him to . pull out of an overnight stay in Italy. All smiles: Prince Philip smiled and waved after leaving hospital in June after his bladder infection . One of his most serious bouts of ill . health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a . chronic chest infection. Earlier this year the Duke, who is . linked to more than 800 organisations, announced plans to scale back on . all but his most important patronages, in the first nod he has given to . his age. But he still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest working members of the Royal Family.","Prince Philip to remain in hospital for 'next few days' says Palace .

What a splendid day for a dip in the lake. The sun was shining and the water was warm. A perfect setting, it seemed, for double world champion Keri-Anne Payne to win an Olympic medal in the Serpentine. But despite the roars of the crowd, and a formidable turnout by her mates from Team GB, she just couldn’t manage to refloat Britain’s swimming pride. The 24-year-old from Stockport came fourth in the gruelling ten-kilometre event, crossing the line just four tenths of a second away from bronze after a race lasting nearly two hours. But hey. The girl did her best. And . from what she was saying afterwards about being caught in a scrum which . swam only inches apart for much of the course, this wasn’t exactly . sports day at Cheltenham Ladies’ College. ‘It was a little bit violent,’ she . said with a smile. ‘It seemed to be a pretty tough, violent race from . the start. I’m not really a fighter – I’m more of a lover I guess. ‘I struggled in the pack with all the . fighting that happened and I got hit quite a few times in the face. I . tried to deal with it as best I could but it just took a lot more energy . out of me than I was expecting.’ Her failure to gain a medal after . being tipped for success mirrors a disappointing Olympics for our . swimmers, all of whom were trying to cheer her to victory yesterday from . the sideline. Every time she swam past, they jumped, . wriggled, shimmied and cheered her on. Sir Steve Redgrave joined . Keri-Anne’s bridesmaid-to-be Rebecca Adlington in the throng, as did her . fiancé and team-mate Dave Carry. Before the race Keri-Anne found time . to text Carry to remind him to put some sun-screen on. They are getting . married in Aberdeen next month and a panda-eye suntan for the wedding . photos would be a definite no-no. Perhaps in anticipation, the official . Olympic factsheet already has him listed as her husband. Keri-Anne said later that she was . caught off guard by the fast pace of the race, which, incidentally, she . normally sets. Heartache: Kerri-Ann Payne finishes fourth, just seconds behind her rivals in the 10km swimming marathon in Hyde Park today . Britain's Kerri-Ann Payne (foreground) leads the field away from the start pontoon in the The Serpentine, Hyde Park . Members of the British swimming team lend their support to Payne from the banks of The Serpentine . But she also admitted making a mistake when she stopped . off at the feeding station on the third lap. In open water races, . swimmers tuck gel packs into their suits and are handed drinks on long . sticks as they go by the feeding areas, usually flipping over on their . backs, like an otter, to take a few sips before flipping the bottles . away. But at one point she dropped the bottle. TV cameras caught the . green liquid spewing into the water. This is a tough race, and not just because of the pain and endurance involved. There are other potential difficulties, too. In the 2007 world championship in . Melbourne Keri-Anne was stung in the mouth by a jellyfish. Swimming in a . Chinese river before the Beijing Olympics, she found herself competing . against floating dead dogs. And the 282-year-old Serpentine didn’t . meet with universal approval. One swimmer inspecting the water . described it as ‘murky’. American broadcasters delighted in telling . folks back home that the 28 acres of water was widely known as the . Turpentine, despite strenuous efforts to clean it. Furthermore, GB performance manager . Mark Perry’s assertion that the royal swans had been rounded up and sent . to a holiday camp for the day with their families proved not to be the . case. Payne was just unable to keep up with the race leader, Eva Risztov of Hungary, and ultimately finished fourth in an exciting finish . Payne (right, number 15) tussles with Yumi Kida of Japan during the 10km open water swim . Five minutes before the athletes . walked on, 11 of the blighters glided by for a peek at the start line. They got a big cheer when they tried to return but were herded up and . driven off by Locog cowboys in kayaks. By the time the race was an hour . old, Keri-Anne was among nine swimmers who had started to put a gap . between themselves and their increasingly flagging opponents. And on the . last turn, with 1,000 aching, tortuous, exhausting metres still to go, . the front four began to create a vast space of clear water behind them. Keri-Anne’s tank was clearly running . low. Still, however, she refused to give up. In the end, fractions of a . second counted for everything. Little wonder she looked exhausted . afterwards. Touchingly, however, the first thing she did when she pulled . herself out of the water was to take a deep bow towards each side of . the lake, where thousands of spectators had loyally cheered every stroke . of the way. The swimmer is handed a drink on the end of a stick by her coach during the race . ‘Fourth in the world is not too bad but not really what I wanted,’ she said rather glumly afterwards. Her fiance said: ‘Yes, it was . disappointing but the thing is I’m going to be getting married to her, . so I’m just so very proud of her, and to see her smiling all the way . through the interviews as well has made me feel a lot better.’ Rebecca Adlington tweeted: ‘Absolutely . so proud of @KeriannePayne can’t believe I get to call her a friend!’ she gushed. ‘She’s amazing! 4th in the world at such a tough event!!’ All true, all very flattering. But GB . swimmers know they’ll have to do better than this to safeguard the . future of the sport’s £25.1million annual funding.

George Selby, 27, leapt into the water despite being unable to swim after his son Louis was swept off a rocky outcrop by a huge wave. Both died as the rest of their family watched from the shore of the Spanish island at about 11am on Saturday, during the first full day of their ‘dream’ first foreign holiday. Scroll down for video .

Manuel Gordini, 23, witnessed the drama from the beach, where he works as a chef in a bar. He said: ‘It was horrific, the worst . thing I’ve ever seen. The lifeguards managed to get the bodies on to the . beach but it was obvious they were already dead. ‘The mother was hysterical, crying. It was very upsetting. It was raining so there was almost nobody on the beach at the time.’ The sea conditions on the day at Cala .

When it’s like that those stairs . are extremely dangerous. The staircase really should be closed off when . the weather is like that.’ Yesterday Mr Selby’s best friend, . banker Graham Klerks, 31, said: ‘George going out into the sea to rescue .

He and Louis were alike in so many ways. ‘He was also very kind and generous. The family were working hard to make a better life for themselves.’ Last night Mrs Selby’s sister Melissa Silwood, 33, of Romford, said Mrs Selby had been left ‘feeling numb’ by the deaths.

In hiding: Salman Rushdie, pictured here just days before The Satanic Verses was released in February 1989, was forced to live in protective custody for fear that extremists would assassinate him . Salman Rushdie has revealed the scariest hour of his life when he thought that his ex-wife and young son had been killed because of his work. In preparation for the release of his new book detailing his months spent in hiding in 1989, British Indian novelist Rushdie wrote an article for The New Yorker telling how he feared that he would have to sacrifice himself in order to save his son. The journey begins after the release of his book The Satanic Verses in February 1989, when Rushdie went into protective custody after Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini went on the national radio and issued a fatwa, or religious order for Muslims, condoning his assassination and offering a bounty for his head. Though the threat started in Iran - far from Rushie's home in London - it carried great weight as the author's book was considered blasphemous by many Muslims throughout the globe. The threat was thought to be so credible that the British police deemed it Level 2, meaning he came after the Queen in the pecking order of possible targets. Shortly after being assigned a constant security detail - which included volunteer officers because the risk attached to the duty of guarding him was so great that the police could not order officers to take on the assignment - Rushdie and his then-wife fled London in hopes of steering clear of angry mobs. Before doing so, he visited his first wife Clarissa Laurd and their young son Zafar. They made a plan that they would check in every night at 7pm on the dot to make sure that both parties were alright. Angry protests: On February 14, 1989, the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini said on the national radio that a religious law- a fatwa- now existed against Rushdie because his book slandered the prophet Muhammed . The plan was to have Rushdie call Laurd's home phone, and if they knew they were not going to be there at the time, they would leave a message on Rushdie's machine in London. It worked perfectly for months and gave Rushdie the assurance that he needed while hiding out in the countryside. Fear: The British police deemed the degree of threats against Rushdie as Level 2, second only to the Queen . A month into his life of hiding, Rushdie called as per usual but had no response from Laurd and had no message on his machine. An hour went by, and Rushdie was in true panic mode. He had his security detail arrange for a London squadron go check on the house to see if it looked like there had been an attack. His fears were realized when the police reported that all of the lights were on in the home and the front door was open. Rushdie sat with his face dripping wet with tears as he ran through options where an angry mob had killed his ex-wife during a struggle but held on to his young son in an effort to negotiate a ransom for Rushdie's head. 'You understand, that if they have . him and they want a ransom, they want me to exchange myself for him, . then I’m going to do that, and you guys can’t stop me doing it,' Rushdie . told his body man, Stan. 'That . thing about exchanging hostages, that only happens in the movies. In . real life, I’m sorry to tell you, if this is a hostile intervention they . are both probably dead already. The question you have to ask yourself . is, Do you want to die as well?' Stan replied. The . minutes of tense waiting were punctuated only by the sound of Rushdie . dialling and redialling the home number of his ex-wife. Then and now: Though the fatwa has never been officially retracted, Rushdie no longer lives in hiding . Finally, . he heard his young son's voice pick up and explain that they had been . at a school drama event that ran overtime. All was fine but Rushdie's . calm had not returned as he feared that intruders were hiding inside the . house since police had seen that the door was ajar before Laurd and . Zafar got home. 'It would seem, that there has been a regrettable error. The car we sent to have a look looked at the wrong house,' Stan said. The phone schedule and the many other ways in which his life changed following the fatwa are the basis for the author's latest book, entitled Joseph Anton as an homage to his alternate identity used while he was under protection, which is released next week.",British Indian author sent into hiding after release of his book The Satanic Verses in 1989 .

A distraught father threw himself to his death four days after failing to save his wife from dying in a fall during a family holiday, an inquest heard yesterday. Roger and Mathilde Lamb had been staying in a rented apartment in Morocco with their children, who were left orphaned. First Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, slipped and fell 60ft from the apartment window during the night. Roger (right) and Mathilde (left) Lamb, who were killed in separate falls while on a family holiday last year . Four days later her grieving husband, who had previously suffered from depression, leapt to his death at a nearby hotel. Mr Lamb, a structural engineer, was found at the bottom of the stairs and died from his injuries the next day. It was his second suicide attempt following her death. He had previously walked into the sea wearing a rucksack full of rocks, . but was rescued and taken to hospital. An inquest into both deaths heard . that Mr Lamb, 47, committed suicide after seeing his wife fall. In a statement from one of the couple’s children, the hearing was told . that Mrs Lamb, 43, had slipped from the window sill in the middle of the . night. The child, who cannot be named, woke to find the apartment . filled with police. They said: ‘I asked my dad what happened and he said that mum had fallen out of the window to her death. Mr Lamb had taken a job in New Zealand, although his wife had visited friends said that she had been reluctant to join them . ‘He said there was a lot of banging going on downstairs and mum had gone to the window in the living room to see what it was. ‘She had stood on the sofa and put her foot on the wooden railing across the window, and had then fallen. ‘Dad said he had rushed to stop her but hadn’t managed to catch her feet and she had fallen.’ After the couple’s death last August, . in the Moroccan coastal town of Essaouira,  the Lambs’ family denied . reports the couple had been arguing. But the inquest was told their 19-year marriage was ‘on a knife-edge’ amid financial concerns and a . disagreement over whether to move from their £850,000 country home in . Pensham, Worcestershire, to start a new life in New Zealand, where Mr . Lamb had been working. His sister, Zara Bird, told the inquest in a statement: ‘Divorce had been spoken of but neither could decide.’ Mr Lamb was described as ‘suicidally . low’ before the holiday and it was said that he had a history of mental . health issues and had been prescribed antidepressants in New Zealand. After Mrs Lamb’s death her sister, . Charlotte Sebag-Montefiore, flew to Morocco. She described Mr Lamb as . being very tearful and in ‘a state of shock’. Tilly told friends that Roger had become 'obsessed' with Gypsy life, and wanted the couple to become new age travellers . Mrs Sebag-Montefiore’s husband Rupert . is chairman of the estate agent Savills and brother of the historian . Simon Sebag-Montefiore. His wife, Santa, and her sister, Tara . Palmer-Tomkinson, are friends of the Prince of Wales. Mrs Sebag-Montefiore said that he had . been getting progressively better before his death. She told the . inquest: ‘At breakfast he was unbelievably well. He had three or four . courses, pancakes, chocolate, cake. ‘He went upstairs to go to get his . swimming stuff. He just seemed a lot more positive.

A stalker was able to scour police databases for information about his 41-year-old victim while he volunteered as a special constable. David Hoar, also 41, of Stoke Newington, north-east London, loitered near her house and workplace and said he was her partner, the woman said. The Tower Hamlets officer also looked up the mother-of-two's contact details and turned up at events she was attending, she claimed. Stalker: Metropolitan Police special constable David Hoar, 41, was able to scour police databases for information about a 41-year-old woman . Hoar pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook Crown Court in July to using police databases to unlawfully search for her, but is yet to be sentenced. In one day alone he made 27 enquiries and accessed her records 51 times in total between May and August 2010, the court heard. The woman said Hoar first appeared on her doorstep, claiming he knew her at primary school, but she had no recollection of him back then. She claimed the Metropolitan Police 'ignored' her complaints about Hoar and he used a police badge to get into events she was attending. The woman, who said she even moved house in a desperate bid to escape him, added: ‘Hoar just walked into my life and ruined it.

I’m on antidepressants, I’m not sleeping and I’m suffering from anxiety.’ She claimed to have often called police about him, but believed he accessed those complaints to find out her contact details. Hoar pleaded guilty to a Computer Misuse Act offence and his sentencing last month was postponed for a mental health assessment to take place. A spokesman for Snaresbrook Crown Court told MailOnline that Hoar is due to be sentenced on September 26.

Newly-released recordings show Captain Schettino deliberately misinformed passengers and the coastguard to the extent of the Concordia disaster . The disgraced captain of the Costa Concordia told his passengers that the doomed cruise ship had simply suffered a 'power cut' moments after it had hit a reef and begun to sink. The disaster off the Italian Island of Giglio in January this year claimed the lives of 32 passengers including a five-year-old girl. Recordings retrieved from the ship's 'black box' show how Captain Francesco Schettino deliberately misinformed both the passengers and the Italian coastguard to the true extent of the accident. Seconds after the collision at 9.45pm he is heard saying: 'Madonna what have I done?' He then calls down to the engine room and asks: 'Are we really going down?' But three minutes later at 9.54, he instructs an officer on the bridge to tell passengers 'there has been a blackout'. And at 10.02pm he calls the Italian coastguard saying: 'We've had a blackout, we're just evaluating... at most we're going to need a tugboat.' He continued to resist calls from his . officers to abandon the ship until 11.19pm. Capt Schettino escaped the 1,000 ft liner before all the passengers had been evacuated and later told magistrates he had 'tripped' into a life boat. As the evacuation of the 4,200 . passengers and crew was under way, he telephoned his wife, Fabiola, to . say everything was 'under control'. 'We hit a reef, the ship is listing but I performed a great manoeuvre ... everything is under control.' But in a subsequent phone call he told her: 'My career as a captain is over.' Captain Francesco Schettino told the Italian . coastguard: 'We've had a blackout, we're just evaluating... at . most we're going to need a tugboat.' Sunk: The captain crashed the luxury liner into rocks, then claimed he accidentally escaped prematurely by 'tripping' into a life boat . In his own account of the fateful night he claimed that his . sailing know-how and 'intuition', abetted by divine intervention, had . caused him to change course at the last moment - and prevent a much . greater loss of life. 'At . that moment a divine hand definitely landed on my head,' he said. 'If I . had continued on that route, we would have hit the rock with the bow. It . would have been a massacre.' The black box recordings were obtained by the Italian La Stampa newspaper.

A student was awoken in the night by a serial burglar who forced his terrified victim to strip and dance before he sexually assaulted her. Stephen Smith, 18, threatened the . 21-year-old woman with a pair of scissors and said he would . kill her family if she did not do exactly what he wanted, after he broke into her London property on June 5. Today a judge branded Smith's crimes 'pitiless and life-scarring' as he sentenced the teenager, from Stratford in east London, for nine and a half years. A student was awoken in the night by a serial burglar who sexually assaulted the terrified victim after forcing her to strip and dance, Southwark Crown Court heard . The prolific burglar had left a 'trail of misery behind him' as he targeted homes in London's upmarket Mayfair area as well as properties in the east of the capital, in order, according to the prosecution,  to 'lead a glamorous lifestyle'. Smith, who has a two-year-old daughter, broke into 23 homes between April and June of this year stealing more than £40,000 of property and a string of expensive cars, including a BMW and a £10,000 Audi. Southwark Crown Court heard that since turning 13 the father had committed a total of 63 burglaries. Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCreath said although Smith may have been drunk when he carried out some of his burglaries all were calculated. Quoting from a statement by the Lord Chief Justice, Mr McCreath said: 'To be burgled and then subjected to the dreadful indignity of a violent, sexual offence,' and I know you did not use actual violence but you threatened it, 'is to become the victim of a pitiless, wicked crime, as those are pitiless, life-scarring, deliberately committed crimes'. 'What you did that night hardly needs repeating but you burgled that home and when the young woman, alone in her bed, awoke to find you in her room you threatened her with scissors, made her strip naked and dance for you, and you subjected her to a serious sexual assault.' Stephen Smith, 18, threatened the student with a pair of scissors . The court heard heard that Smith had climbed into the student's home through an open window before raiding the property and walking into her bedroom. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'He told her that if she did not stay there and stay still he would kill her family, and bizarrely told her his name was Paul Smith. 'He then demanded that she get out of bed. 'He took hold of the scissors and ordered her to strip naked and then told her that she must dance for him.' Smith took off his trousers and underwear and forced her on to her bed before he began to lick her body. Mr Zinner added: 'The Crown's case is that the defendant is a financially motivated, skilful, and prolific burglar who, between April and June of this year, left a trail of misery behind him. 'He then escalated what was already very serious offending to a new level by a prolonged and terrifying sexual assault on a female burglary victim alone in her dwelling. 'It was for financial gain to live a glamorous lifestyle well beyond what he was able to afford. 'The sexual assault was gratuitous, probably unplanned, but nevertheless devastating for the victim concerned.' For Smith, defence counsel Safora Syed said the teenager had suffered a 'feeling of rejection' after discovering, when he was 13, that he was adopted. She said: 'The reason why he wanted to make money was in order for him to pay off a drug debt'. Smith's latest spate of offending began on April 29, 2012, when he stole a phone and set of house keys  along with key's to a Vauxhall Astra which he drove off in. The court heard the property was snatched by Smith after the householder fell asleep at the teenager's east London home after a night out in Romford, Essex. On May 12 he broke into a flat in east London, and stole a laptop and a hat. Just 12 days later he burgled neighbouring flats in Mayfair, snatching property worth around £28,000, including phones, computers, cash, a camera and a watch. He struck again the following night at another flat, also in Mayfair, where he took a mobile. Smith stole property worth around £28,000 including phones and computers . Mr Zinner said the female owner had . been asleep but had awoken to find Smith 'asleep at the foot of her bed, . covered in vomit and smelling of intoxicating liquor'. Smith . fled the flat, but when the owner investigated she found her collection . of designer handbags lined up by the sofa 'ready to be taken'. He . returned to the same flat less than a fortnight later and attempted to . break in a second time before trying to get into another flat in the . same building. Between May . 27 and June 10 Smith also targeted a string of other west London . properties as well as homes in east London, stealing computers, and . other electrical equipment as well as the keys to Honda, Audi, and BMW . cars. All three cars were taken and dumped by Smith. Smith, of Stratford, in east London, admitted ten counts of burglary, four counts of taking a conveyance without authority, two counts of theft, two count of attempting to commit a burglary, one count of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration. Smith, who has previously been convicted of eight burglaries, asked for a further 12 offences of burglary to be taken into consideration. He was jailed for nine-and-a-half years, banned from driving for two years, and ordered to sign on the sexual offenders register for life.","Threatened student with pair of scissors and said he would kill her family if she .

A stressed City high-flyer phoned his wife from the bottom of their garden and said he was going to shoot himself, a coroner heard today. Managing director, David Lewin killed himself before his wife, Sophie, managed to get out of the house. The dramatic suicide followed a family party and was carried out after Mr Lewin, who was also a church warden, had driven their son back to boarding school. An inquest heard that the father-of-three had been under pressure at work and had been busy travelling around Europe making key presentations as part of his job in reinsurance. The 47-year-old was home for a family party when, after driving his son back to boarding school, took his shotgun into the garden and killed himself. Following the inquest into Mr Lewin’s death, his wife said that she had gone to bed when he called the house phone from his mobile. 'He rang me from the garden and told me where he was and I realised things were very wrong. Something very wrong was going on,” said Mrs Lewin. 'So I jumped out of bed, I was shouting ""no"". 'On my way down the stairs I could hear gunshot, I immediately rang 999 and got the police and ambulance. 'I was hoping that it was not what I thought.' Speaking at the inquest in Newbury, Berkshire., Mrs Lewin said that her husband had suffered from depression and anxiety for several years but had become increasingly stressed in the months before his death, after his own father died. 'It was more severe than I had seen him with it,' she said. 'He had started to lift out of the depression at the time he killed himself.' Mrs Lewin said that her husband had also been seeing a Harley Street psychiatrist, and was taking medication for his depression. The family had been celebrating a . birthday and after the party Mr Lewin drove one of their children, . James, back to boarding school in Dorset where he was sitting his GCSE . exams. Mrs Lewin told . the inquest that she had been worried about Mr Lewin on the 90 minute . drive as he was feeling tired after preparing for an important . presentation he had to make to clients in Paris. 'He said ""I want to take James back’"". Looking back I see that as saying goodbye to James,' she said. When . Mr Lewin returned to the family home in Westbrook, Boxford, West . Berkshire, the couple chatted about the party before Mrs Lewin went to bed . and the tragedy unfolded. Tragedy: The Berkshire family home where Mr Lewin shot himself in the garden . Mr Lewin’s body was found in the garden, the shotgun normally kept under lock and key, lying underneath his arm. A suicide note was also discovered inside the house. A post mortem examination confirmed that Mr Lewin had died from a gunshot wound to the head. Mrs Lewin said that she had never worried that Mr Lewin would kill himself but had feared he might become ill because of how hard he had been working. 'I was really worried that he would end up having a heart attack or a stroke. It never occurred to me he would have taken his own life,' she said. 'He was very much involved in the local community and in the church. He would have felt that would not have been something that was the right thing to do.' Paying tribute to Oxford University graduate Mr Lewin, who also worked as a warden at their local parish church, Mrs Lewin said he was a 'devoted husband and father'. He said: 'He showed an example of public service and concern for other people which he never had for himself. 'People have written in letters that he was ""too nice"" a person for the City - there are nice people in the City but he did not have a ruthless streak.' The Berkshire assistant deputy coroner, Anna Burnside, ruled that Mr Lewin had taken his own life while suffering from depression. She said: 'For the last 10 years or more Mr Lewin suffered anxiety and depression. He was taking medication and seeing a psychiatrist in London. 'His anxiety and depression was particularly bad in the last couple of years, he was under stress at work .

These fascinating pictures show the first time a great white shark has been caught and tagged in Cape Cod before being released back into the deep. A team of scientists and fishermen screwed satellite and acoustic tags on to the dangerous predator's dorsal fin in just 15 minutes, on a platform of their former crabbing vessel in the Atlantic off Massachusetts, U.S. These will track the 2,000-pound creature's movements through the ocean and - along with blood and tissue samples collected - should explain some of the many mysteries surrounding the great white. Working fast: Scientists collect blood and tissue samples from a female great white shark on the research vessel Ocearch in the Atlantic Ocean . Researchers screw satellite and acoustic tags on to the shark's dorsal fin, left, and expert Greg Skomal performs gas analysis on a blood sample moments after the 15-foot fish was released, right . Shark expert Greg Skomal admitted he . was 'nervous' when the Ocearch crew caught the 15-foot-long animal, because of the . research organisation's unorthodox methods. While other teams tag great whites using harpoons, Ocearch baits the fish and leads them on to a large platform that lifts them out of the water. The work is dangerous for both man and . fish, with one shark dying on the lift in South Africa. The crew has to complete its work within just 15 minutes. The sharks are attracted to the ship using 'chum' - bait made from fish parts, whale blubber  and blood - which is placed a mile from the Ocearch vessel. Smaller boats circle the area looking for great whites - and one group got lucky last Thursday evening. Feared predator: Captain Brett McBride places his hand on the snout of the crew's first specimen while scientists collect samples and attach tracking devices . Worth the risk: Ocearch's will now be able to track 'Genie', named for famed shark researcher Eugenie Clark . They hooked the shark, leading it four miles to the 126-foot Ocearch. Captain . Brett McBride guided the shark on to the wooden platform with metal . sides. He jumped in barefoot and the lift rose out of the water until it . was level with Ocearch's deck. The shark thrashed and bared her teeth as the water receded, curving her head and tail into the air. Captain McBride threw a wet towel over her eyes and removed the two-foot hook . from her mouth. He pumped water over her gills with two large hoses. The crew jumped on to the lift in jeans and long-sleeve shirts, and the clock began. They . measured the fish - 14 feet, 8 inches and 2,292 pounds - and screwed . the satellite tag, an accelerometer and an acoustic tag on to her dorsal . fin with a power drill. Researchers collected blood and tissue samples. Time pressure: Captain Brett McBride streams sea water over the gills of the 2,292-pound great white shark as it lies on the vessel's deck while tests are carried out . Captain McBride named the female shark Genie after renowned shark researcher Eugenie Clark. After nearly 15 minutes, everybody scrambled off as the lift was lowered back into the water. Captain McBride grabbed Genie's tail and slowly guided her back into the ocean. They were done in 16 minutes flat. Genie drifted down into the dark . water. The crew clinked beer cans and soda cups.

'Now I worry that we'll hurt them.' While great white sightings have risen near Cape Cod, they are much more common off South Africa or Australia. Mr Skomal estimates that 30 great whites roam the Cape Cod coast on any given day. The Ocearch crew hopes to tag five.

'These predators keep the next lower level in check,' said Bob Hueter, of Mote Marine Laboratory, one of the research organisations working with the Cape Cod expedition. 'It's a system of checks and balances.' The great white is the 'lion of the ocean,' keeping seal, squid and fish populations in check, Mr Fischer said. But it is also the shark that people are most interested in, making it a gateway for ocean conservation and advocacy, he said. Ocearch's real-time satellite tags . last five years.

Four men who pleaded guilty in the repeated sexual assault of an 11-year-old Texas girl were each sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison, terms they agreed to in deals with prosecutors. Their sentencing hearings came after another man charged in the 2010 case chose to go to trial and was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison. Legal experts said his harsh punishment prompted the four to plead guilty and will likely mean the seven defendants with cases still pending will seek their own plea deals. Sentenced: Rayford Ellis Jr., 21 (left) and his cousin Timothy Ellis, 20 (right) both pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child . Sentenced: Kelvin King, 23 (left) and Jared McPherson, 20 (right) must register as a sex offender once they are released from prison . Sentenced on Friday were: Timothy Ellis, 20; his cousin, Rayford Ellis Jr., 21; Kelvin King, 23; and Jared McPherson, 20. All had pleaded guilty earlier this month to aggravated sexual assault of a child, and each must register as a sex offender once released from prison. Rayford Ellis also pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a 2008 case, while King pleaded guilty to another aggravated sexual assault charge in a 2009 case involving an attack on a different girl. Each received 15 years for those charges and will serve those sentences at the same time as the ones for assaulting the 11-year-old. Each defendant was allowed to hug family members before being taken away by authorities. All except for Rayford Ellis had been free on bail. Relatives of the defendants declined to comment after the hearings. Defense attorneys and prosecutors also declined to comment, citing a gag order in the case. During his sentencing hearing, King told the judge he was unhappy with his attorney, Jerry Andress, and his plea deal. 'I feel like, well, my lawyer really didn't talk about the case,' King said. The only defendant to opt for a trial, Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison . Afterward, King's father, Kevin King, and Andress argued outside the courtroom about the sentence. Both men declined to comment to reporters. Prosecutors say the girl, now 13, was sexually assaulted on at least five occasions by 20 men and boys in the Southeast Texas town of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston. The girl was 11 years old during the assaults from mid-September through early December 2010. Police began investigating that December after a classmate of the girl's told a teacher he had seen cellphone video of men having sex with her. All six juveniles and six of the 14 adults charged, including those sentenced Friday, pleaded guilty. The only defendant to opt for a trial, Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison, but he wasn't in court to face his punishment. McGowen, who had been free on bail, skipped out during a break on the first day of testimony, which included the girl's tearful recounting of the assaults and McGowen's role in them. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 . The . trial, held in the nearby county seat of Liberty, went on without him . and a jury the next day convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a . child and then sentenced him in absentia. Authorities . tracked McGowen down to an apartment in northeast Houston and arrested . him on 11 September. Six law enforcement agencies had coordinated the search . for him. McGowen was apparently caught by surprise, as he was sitting on . a toilet when authorities entered the apartment and arrested him. Prosecutors' case against McGowen . included a videotaped confession and testimony from nearly a dozen . witnesses, including the girl, who is now 13. The . girl, who authorities haven't named, described the series of horrendous attacks that took . place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston. In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, police said . She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors . were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers . found inside and outside the house in the November incident. During . opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present . them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted . to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. Liberty County Courthouse: McGowen's trial went on without him and a jury convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child . The prosecutor added that while the . girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, . these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things . against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticized those suggestions. It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic. The four men sentenced Friday accepted their plea deals after McGowen was tried and convicted. Legal experts said the seven adult . defendants who still have cases pending are probably going to avoid . trial after seeing what happened with McGowen. 'Unless one of the remaining . co-defendants has something brand new, we are not going to see any more . trials from this point forward,' said Grant Scheiner, a Houston criminal . defense attorney not involved in the case. Joel Androphy, another Houston . attorney not connected to the case, said a 99-year prison sentence for . one defendant would definitely scare his co-defendants into pleading . guilty. But Androphy said he believes at least one of the remaining . defendants will probably decide to take his chances at trial. 'Trials are a roll of the dice. You have to weigh it all and decide how to handle it,' the attorney said .","All four pleaded guilty after agreeing deals with prosecutors .

Millions of middle-class Britons must get ready to pay higher taxes, Nick Clegg has declared. With the nation facing its longest period of belt-tightening since the war, the Deputy Prime Minister said the ‘top 10 per cent’ – around 3million earning more than £50,500 – should brace themselves for new levies. Options include an end to tax relief on pension contributions for higher-rate taxpayers, an ‘accessions tax’ to replace inheritance tax, and further increases in capital gains tax. Scroll down to watch . Unlikely class warrior: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg unveiled plans to hit millions of high-earning Britons with new taxes at the first full day of the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday . At the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, Mr Clegg today insisted Mr Clegg that the majority of people thought that a £60,000 salary was 'a considerable amount of money'. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The vast majority of people - 90 per cent of the people in the country - would think a salary of £60,000, £70,000, £80,000 is a considerable amount of money. Nick Clegg today said he had developed a ‘thicker skin’ after two years in government – and he thinks he now know what he wants to do with power. In a surprising admission, the Liberal Democrat leader appeared to suggest that when the coalition was formed in 2010 he did not know what he hoped to achieve, or how to concentrate on what was important. ‘Strangely enough – I know this is contrary to the characterisation that people want to impose on me – I am much clearer in my own mind now two and a half years into it what want to do for the second half of the parliament,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘Of course I have learned things. My skin has got thicker. ‘I have had to apologise for mistakes I have made, but I have learned I think more than I had at the beginning how to really distinguish the stuff that’s important - whether it is business banks, fairer taxes, more apprenticeships, that will stand the test of time - and the day to day stuff that can dominate daily politics.’ 'People - decent, fair-minded folk who are earning far, far more than the national average - understand that they do need to make a fair contribution.' Mr Clegg has said he is confident that the Conservatives would sign up to new taxes on the top 10 per cent. In return, he suggested he was open to Tory moves to cut more from the vast benefits bill. Mr Clegg said the highest earners were already paying more overall, thanks to Budget decisions taken by the Coalition. He added: ‘As fiscal restraint has to carry on for longer than we thought, you have to ask people at the top to make a [further] contribution.’ On the first full day of the conference: . It is the Deputy Prime Minister’s stance on tax, designed in part to appease his party’s restive Left-wing grassroots, that will most alarm Tory MPs. New taxes on those earning over £50,500 would hit middle-class families in Conservative heartlands in London and the South East. Among the jobs paying such a salary are primary school deputy head, police inspector, fire brigade watch manager and senior nurse consultant. The Lib Dems have long campaigned for a ‘mansion tax’ – an annual levy on high-value properties – but are devising alternative proposals having failed to persuade Mr Osborne to go ahead. In a policy consultation document, the party said the most significant levy on wealth was inheritance tax, paid on a person’s estate over the value of £325,000. It is avoided by many using trusts, gifts or various reliefs, for example on agricultural land and property. The document suggested an ‘accessions tax’, where the liability would fall on the person receiving the legacy rather than the estate of the deceased. This would make the tax impossible to avoid. Fighting for his political life: Mr Clegg and his wife, Miriam Gonzalez-Durantez, share drinks whilst meeting candidates from the party's candidate diversity programme during the conference yesterday . He's got her vote: Ms Gonzalez Durantez applauds her husband as he takes a question and answer session . The Lib Dems also want to target tax breaks offered to high earners on their pension contributions. Currently, annual retirement contributions of up to £50,000 are exempt from tax. The Chancellor cut that threshold from £255,000 in his first emergency Budget, but the Lib Dems want to go further. Mr Clegg told BBC TV’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘We now know that the country is going to have to go through a period of belt-tightening for longer than we’d hoped, and whoever is going to be in government in the next parliament – Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats or a combination of all three – will have to introduce further savings. ‘When I hear people from the Right say all the money should come from poor people . . . who have lost their work and need some support before they find new work, that all the money should be taken away from them – I’m saying no, hang on a minute, let’s make sure that we do this as fairly as possible.’ In the limelight: Mr Clegg told BBC political journalist Andrew Marr that he believed that the brunt of the government's austerity programme shouldn't be borne by the poor . Mr Clegg said there was a ‘very considerable chance’ of the Tories agreeing new wealth taxes, pointing out that the Coalition has already increased capital gains tax and stamp duty, while clamping down on tax avoidance. ‘I think many people who are of considerable wealth in this country want to play their part,’ he said. ‘I don’t think you can ask people on middle and low incomes who, after all, are the vast majority of the British population, to bear the brunt of this adjustment.’ The Lib Dems, who are flatlining in the polls, are desperate to use the conference to demonstrate areas where they differ from their Conservative coalition partners. As well as on the economy, they are highlighting arguments over the environment and civil liberties.","Deputy Prime Minister says 'top 10 per cent' should face new levies .

Fern Burke, 14, was told she could not return to classes at Middleton Technology School in Rochdale until her hair is darker. Fern’s mother, Tracey Burke, has attempted to darken it twice but after being told Fern's hair was still too bright she refuses to use a darker black dye because she fears her daughter would be bullied. Fern - a natural brunette - dyed her hair red over the summer but claims the colour faded over the summer. But within minutes of returning for the new school term her mother received a phone call saying Fern’s hair was too bright. Mrs Burke then darkened it with two bottles of brown dye - but teachers said that it still wasn’t ‘natural’ enough. Fern, who lives in Searness Road, Middleton, with her mother, father Patrick brother Dion, 17, and sister Grace, two, is now missing lessons. Mrs Burke, herself a primary school teaching assistant, said: 'Fern had always wanted to experiment and dye her hair red. 'As I know this is not allowed in school, we waited for the summer holidays to dye it. 'After seven weeks off, the colour had faded significantly and she returned to school. 'She was told the colour was still too red so at the weekend we dyed her hair twice with dark brown.' Mrs Burke said she refuses to dye Fern’s hair any darker, and added: 'The last time she dyed her hair black she was bullied. Angry: Fern's mother Tracey Burke said she has already twice tried to darken her daughter's hair with brown dye - but teachers argue it is still too bright . Unfair: Mrs Burke said while bright hair dyes are not allowed at Middleton Technology School she allowed her daughter to use a temporary dye she believed would have faded by the time the new school term started . 'Understandably, she doesn’t want to experience this again.' She added: 'I do not think it is fair considering there are teachers at the school with purple hair or highlights which are not natural colours. 'I understand the need for rules within the school in preparation for the working environment - but you tell me a job where you would be sent home or fired for the colour of your hair. She needs to be getting on with work. 'She’s just started Year 10 and needs to focus on her GCSEs.'

Admission: Nicholas Levene, pictured,has pleaded guilty to offences relating to fraud, forgery, money laundering and false accounting after an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office . A high flying City stockbroker today admitted carrying out a £32million ‘ponzi’ fraud and was told to expect a long prison term. Nicholas Levene, 48, the former deputy chairman of Leyton Orient FC, cheated investors by promising them high returns on their deposits but instead pocketed much of the cash. Levene, nicknamed ‘Beano’ because of his schoolboy love of the comic, kept customers happy by using other investors’ money to give the impression he was earning them healthy yields. He would then falsify documents to make it look like he had bought them shares or made them profits when in fact they were being stolen from. Levene, who had been due to stand trial next month, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to the four year-long scam. Investors were heard to have been offered shares in a range of companies, including HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland, Imperial Energy Ltd and Rio Tinto Plc. Among his victims were Stagecoach Group co-founders brother and sister Brian Souter and Ann Gloag who lost £10m to Levene. In April 2007 Levene tricked Yigal Ahouvi . into paying £14,900,000 into an account in Monaco held in the name of . Niblick Investments SA claiming it would be used to buy shares in Delek . Global Real Estate and cover transaction costs. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘The fraud counts to which Mr Leven has now pleaded guilty are in the sum of £32,352,027.83.’ Levene had faced five further counts, including allegations he had used two forged contract notes purportedly showing he owned almost £60m worth of shares in HSBC Holdings Plc. Mr Edis said: ‘The other counts on the indictment to which he’s not entered pleas will in due course, we submit, be ordered to lie on the file.’ Judge Martin Beddoe refused an application for a pre-sentence report saying: ‘There’s only one type of sentence I can pass’. He later added: ‘You will appreciate, as I am sure you have known for a very long time, how, obviously, this is a very serious matter. ‘Although you will get credit for your pleas of guilty there will inevitably be, in your case, substantial sentences of imprisonment for the 14 offences you have publicly accepted your criminal responsibility for today. ‘I think the justice of the situation is that your bail should continue notwithstanding the very serious position you are in and the inevitability of the sentences that must follow.’ Fraud: Levene ripped off people to the tune of up to £10m each in some cases . Levene’s offending began in April 2005 when he persuaded Tadco Limited to part with £571,261 on the pretense he would buy 140,000 shares in Imperial Energy Plc. In September of the same year, together with Rapahel Haas, he admitted falsifying six bank statements so they ‘did not accurately and fully represent the true debits, credits and account balances to the said account during the stated periods’. A year later he duped Timothy Hutchins and Parviz Hakim Rad into handing over more than £1m for shares in Imperial Energy Plc. Past: Nicholas 'Beano' Levene has also been on the board of Leyton Orient . Between January and September 2009 he defrauded Julan Shah out of more than more £1.6m for shares in Lloyds TSB, Xstrata PLC, ENEL, and Rio Tinto PLC. Also in 2009 he took £10m from Mr Souter and Mrs Gloag - to buy shares in mining group Xstrata Plc and HSBC. Levene further admitted to defrauding Philip Bowman and Timothy Clink into handing over almost £500,000 to buy Xstrata Plc and, later, Rio Tinto Plc shares, and taking around £1.6m from Simon Holden, Marvin Mermelstein, Akiva Klein, Jacob Sofer. Between April and September 2009 he pleaded guilty to taking £1m from Glenn Coleman and £1.3m from Russell Bartlett for ENEL and Rio Tinto Plc shares. Levene, of Barnet, Hertfordshire, admitted 12 counts of fraud, one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one count of false accounting. He was granted conditional bail and will be sentenced on October 22.","Nicholas Levene promised people he was buying shares but was in fact stealing some of the money .

A doting father who showered his . teenage daughter with thousands of pounds worth of luxuries - including a £20,000 Super Sweet 16 . birthday party where Tulisa performed - has been spared jail after going bust. A High Court judge had sentenced Harby Panesar to nine . months in jail after he set up a new company in defiance of court orders after his finance business collapsed. However, yesterday the Appeal Court quashed the prison term after Anysha, now 19, who he had bought thousands of pounds worth of presents, begged the court in a letter not to send him to prison. Panesar spent three years lavishing Anysha with gifts, even throwing her a celebrity-style birthday bash with a personal video from Hollywood star . Nicole Kidman and guest singer Tulisa from N-Dubz. The 45-year-old then bankrolled her . dream to be a top teenage model and beauty queen, and she went on to be . crowned America's Perfect Teen, becoming the first international cover . girl on SuperModels magazine. Lord Justice Rix allowed the appeal at the Civil Appeal Court and suspended his sentence for two years. The court was told that he is now 'far removed from his once luxurious life' - and is 'financially ruined and bankrupt.' Lord Rix said: 'The public interest will be sufficiently vindicated by suspending the term.' Panesar doted on Anysha, lavishing her with gifts and encouraging her to live a life of luxury. He bought his daughter a Gucci handbag . for her birthday, along with a £1,500 personalised mobile phone and a . pair of £400 sunglasses. He threw a Moulin Rouge-themed party and Anysha wore a £3,000 replica of a Nicole Kidman dress from the hit film. Problems: .

A judge yesterday said he had no choice but to give a ‘ridiculously short’ prison sentence to a driver who horrifically injured a policeman known as ‘Robocop’. Diederik Coetzee, who made an astonishing 404 arrests in 2006, was thrown 24ft from his bicycle in the hit and run. Ten months on, the once super-fit 55-year-old is still in hospital and has had to end his remarkable career. The driver, Mitchel Graham, sped from the scene, leaving the constable lying in the road. But Judge Jonathan Teare QC said Parliament had decided he could give Graham no more than 15 months behind bars. ‘That may seem ridiculously short for those who grieve for the loss of their husband and father, but that is all I can do,’ he told Nottingham Crown Court. The maximum sentence for dangerous driving is two years but a shorter term is given to offenders who plead guilty. Graham admitted dangerous driving and failing to stop. The court heard he knew his car was in a highly dangerous condition when he ploughed into Mr Coetzee, who was off duty and cycling to an exercise class in Blidworth, Nottinghamshire, at 6pm on November 25. Paul Stimson, prosecuting, said the drive shaft, exhaust and brakes of Graham’s car were defective and the tyres were worn. The de-mister was also faulty – meaning Graham was ‘driving almost blind’ on his near side, where Mr Coetzee struck the windscreen.

When the divers, who work for Think It Sink It Reef It, cleaned off the identifying plate, they were able to trace the wreckage back to the exact plane, crash, and pilot. After he survived the crash on December 2, 1974, Mr Besal went on to have a successful 30-year naval career and worked up the ranks to the position of rear admiral. On the morning of the crash, he was up in the air with three other pilots who were practicing for a training mission where they would be involved with bombing runs. He accidentally clipped the side of one of the other planes when they were 15,000 feet in the air, and he quickly responded by ejecting from the cockpit. 'It's not one of those things you brag about, honestly,' Mr Besal told CNN. High flyer: Mr Besal took a picture of a plane that was just like his during a flight just months before the crash .

In the online world, the ifixit.com site has become well known for ripping apart the latest gadgets as soon as they go on sale and revealing the components inside. However, with the launch of Apple's iPad mini, the site has excelled itself - ripping one apart before the gadget goes on sale. The £269 iPad mini goes on sale tomorrow, but the site has already posted a look inside the gadget set to become the must-have this Christmas. Scroll down for video . The iPad mini in pieces: US site IHS has added up the cost of the components, and found the base £269 model costs £117 to make . Apple's iPad mini uses a display from South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, one of Apple's major suppliers and also its fiercest rival in the global mobile-device market that the two companies dominate. Analysts say the Silicon Valley-based iPhone maker is trying to wean itself off its reliance on Samsung, as both giants are embroiled in a bitter international legal battle over mobile patents, for everything from microchips to displays. In the first dismantling of the iPad mini, which will be sold in 34 countries beginning tomorrow, teardown and gadget-repair specialist company, iFixit, discovered a Samsung display driver chip, which indicated that Apple had picked the Korean firm's screen technology. Like most producers of mobile hardware, the U.S. company typically employs several suppliers for the same components in its gadgets. Apple has been known to use screens made by LG Display, for instance. The chips (coloured) which reveal Samsung as the screen supplier for Apple's iPad mini . The ifixit site details the entire process of dismantling the iPad Mini . The iFixit.com site is well known for taking apart gadgets as soon as they are released. It aims to help third parties find out how easy their new gadget are to repair, and each new gadget is given a 'repairability index'. In the iPad mini's case, the index was low - meaning few parts can be repaired. However, the firm did find that the Samsung manufactured screen can be easily repaired. 'Though the markings on the back of the LCD (display) don't turn up much information, the Samsung display driver IC (chip) reveals that Apple, once again, went with Samsung in its display manufacturing,' iFixit said, detailing the teardown on its website. However, Apple does sometimes uses more than one supplier. Supplying parts for Apple's iPhones and iPads - some of the industry's most popular and advanced gadgets - is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers. The iPad mini also employs SK Hynix Inc flash memory, a Broadcom touch controller, and a number of microchips from Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc, according to iFixit, which acquired one early. The 7.9-inch iPad mini marks the Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment. The company hopes to beat back incursions into its home territory - carved out with the original iPad's launch in 2010 - with 7-inch slates that are popular with consumers, even as it safeguards its lead in a larger tablet space that even deep-pocketed rivals like Samsung have found tough to penetrate. It has won mostly positive reviews focused on its ability to wrap most of the functions of its full-sized iPad sibling into a smaller package, but critics pointed out the higher price tag of the iPad mini and an inferior display relative to those of rival products like Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google's Nexus 7. The main motherboard of the iPad Mini, with Apple's a% processor visible in the centre. However, the site has so far failed to identify many of the other components in the gadget. Online sales have run for a week, but Apple has not disclosed sales numbers so far. Friday's global sales rollout may offer a hint of demand for the gadget, which analysts expect to be strong. Apple and Samsung are engaged in patent disputes across several countries, and Apple is believed to be seeking ways to rely less on Samsung. But the Asian tech powerhouse remains a key supplier for Apple, manufacturing its application processors and providing other components. Samsung has stopped supplying displays for Apple's iPhone, and plays a reduced role in the full-sized iPad, according to DisplaySearch. Apple is also buying fewer memory chips from Samsung for the iPhone 5, relying more on Hynix and Elpida Memory. Many analysts believe Apple will also gradually phase out Samsung as the main producer of the mobile micro-processor and shift business to rival supplier TSMC.

Millions of pounds of unexploded bombs dumped in the Gulf of Mexico by the U.S. government after World War Two pose a significant risk to offshore oil drilling, warn researchers. It is no secret that the United States, along with other governments, dumped munitions and chemical weapons in oceans from 1946 until the practice was banned in the 1970s by U.S. law and international treaty, said William Bryant, a Texas A&M University professor of oceanography. As technological advances allow oil companies to push deeper into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, these forgotten hazards pose a threat as the industry picks up the pace of drilling after BP's deadly Macondo well blowout in 2010 that lead to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Scroll down for video . Unknown danger: Researchers suspect mustard gas has already leaked from these 55-gallon drums at a known chemical weapons dumpsite near the mouth of the Mississippi River . A German World War II submarine: In 2001, BP and Shell found the wreckage of a U-166 submarine 45 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River . Unexploded ordnance has been found in the offshore zone known as Mississippi Canyon where the Macondo well was drilled. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will auction 38 million acres of oil and gas leases in the central gulf in March. The U.S. government designated disposal areas for unexploded ordnance, known as UXO, off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. But nearly 70 years after the areas were created, no one knows exactly how much was dumped, or where the weapons are, or whether they present a danger to humans or marine life. 'These bombs are a threat today and no one knows how to deal with the situation,' said Bryant. 'If chemical agents are leaking from some of them, that's a real problem. If many of them are still capable of exploding, that's another big problem.' Disposal zones were designated from Florida to Texas, said Bryant, who will discuss his research findings at the International Dialogue on Underwater Munitions conference that begins Monday in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Unexploded bomb: Reseachers from Texas A&M University have found this 500-pound device . Expert: Oceanographer William Bryants says the oil and gas industries need to realize that these unexploded devices are a serious threat . While the practice of dumping bombs and chemical weapons, including mustard and nerve gas, in the ocean ended 40 years ago some effects are just beginning to be seen, said Terrance Long, founder of the underwater munitions conference. 'You can find munitions in basically every ocean around the world, every major sea, lake and river,' Long said. 'They are a threat to human health and the environment.' The oil industry is no stranger to leftovers from the World War Two. Last year, BP shut its key Forties crude pipeline in the North Sea for five days while it removed a 13-foot (4-metre) unexploded German mine found resting cozily next to the pipeline that transports up to 40 percent of the UK's oil production. BP discovered the mine during a routine pipeline inspection, then spent several months devising a plan to lift the bomb and move it far enough from the pipeline to safely detonate it. In the Gulf of Mexico, which accounts for 23 percent of U.S. oil production and seven percent of domestic natural gas output, the hazards are known, but generally ignored. In 2001, BP and Shell found the wreckage of the U-166, a German World War II submarine, 45 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River during an underwater survey for a pipeline needed to transport natural gas to shore. Bryant said he and colleague Neil Slowey have documented discarded bombs and leaking barrels over the past 20 years while conducting research for energy companies in the Gulf of Mexico. Records of where these munitions were dumped are incomplete and experts believe many dangerous cargoes were 'short-dumped,' or discarded outside designated zones. Bryant said he has come across 500-pound (227-kgs) bombs about 60 miles off the Texas coast and other ordnance 100 miles offshore, outside designated zones. At least one Gulf pipeline was laid across a chemical weapon dump site south of the mouth of the Mississippi River, he said. While the risk of an underwater bomb exploding may be small, environmental damage from chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, is worrisome and needs to be researched, Bryant said. 'We would like to do a survey to be able to say if (this material) is harmful or not,' he said. 'The condition of these barrels is deteriorating, so does it affect anything or not? We ought to know.' The experts claims that these forgotten bombs pose a threat just as the oil industry picks up the pace of drilling after BP's deadly Macondo well blowout in 2010 . Information does exist that charts some of the munitions dumpsites in the Gulf of Mexico . Calls and emails to various companies . with wells or pipelines in the gulf seeking comment were not returned. Neither the U.S. Army, nor the BOEM would comment as well. Sonar . data from a routine seabed survey performed by C&C Technologies . identified munitions in about 3,000 feet of water near a proposed . project, according to a paper presented at the 2007 Offshore Technology . Conference. After determining the bombs presented a low-to-moderate risk, the project continued as planned. The oil and gas industry needs to do more address the problem, Long said. 'It makes more sense to start dealing with the munitions from a risk-mitigation standpoint to be able to conduct operations in those areas rather than trying to avoid that they are there,' Long said. The BOEM, which regulates offshore drilling in federal waters, warns companies seeking leases to drill or add pipelines about the existence of unexploded ordnance and requires underwater surveys to assess and manage the numerous natural and man-made hazards.

Mossberg said Apple chose to go with a . lower-quality display because the existing 250,000-plus iPad . applications could only run unmodified in two resolutions - and the . higher level would have sapped too much power. 'The lack of true HD gives the Nexus . and Fire HD an advantage for video fans. In my tests, video looked just . fine, but not as good as on the regular iPad,' Mossberg wrote.

"By . Mail Today Bureau . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 1 February 2012 . The Delhi government has approved a proposal to open a 'semi-open jail' at Tihar. Seen as an effort to reintegrate and rehabilitate the inmates, the concept will allow them to step out of their cells to work and earn wages fixed by the government. Those sentenced to between five and 10 years and with a good track record in the prison will be eligible under this proposal. Curious: Director General of Tihar Prisons, Neeraj Kumar, right, takes a close look at creations by the jail inmates on Tuesday . There's a catch, though. The prisoners can't venture beyond the 400-acre Tihar complex. They will be employed in PWD, horticulture and other contract projects on the sprawling jail premises itself. Convicts with pending court cases against them or involved in prison violence such as assault, jailbreak and riots won't be considered in this scheme, as won't be inmates involved in robbery, terror, sedition, kidnapping and smuggling. A committee under the chairmanship of the DIG (deputy inspector general) (prisons) R.N. Sharma will select the convicts for the semi-open jail. In an annual review on Tuesday, the prison authorities detailed their 'achievements' in 2011 and revealed further plans to make the functioning of the jails smooth and friendly. More than 73 per cent of Tihar inmates are undergoing trial, above the national average of 66.4 per cent. Out of the 11,598 prisoners lodged in Tihar, 8,911 inmates are undertrials, including 410 women. In an initiative against smuggling of drugs and prohibited articles inside the jail, Tiharauthorities will also procure fullbody scanners. These scanners will detect metals stored inside body cavities. 'We also have sniffer dogs to search for drugs which cannot be detected by the scanners,' said Neeraj Kumar, director general (prisons). The authorities have also introduced smart cash cards to assist prisoners in various transactions in jail canteens, by replacing the old coupon system. The last year was eventful in the history of Delhi jails because many high-profile inmates were lodged in them, especially Tihar, which added to the safety and security challenges. Emphasising that the authorities never discriminated between high-profile and common inmates, Kumar said: 'Equality before law prevailed even in jail'. To ensure a corruption-free mechanism in Delhi jails, 32 prison officials were suspended and disciplinary action taken against 67 officials last year. At least 18 officials were found guilty, out of which 11 were handed out major punishments. 'We try to make the system cleaner and more transparent,' Kumar said.",Delhi government approves proposal for 'semi-open jail'

The political aide who became Tony Blair’s ‘office wife’ has spoken for the first time of her tensions with Mrs Blair. Anji Hunter was the former prime minister’s ‘gatekeeper’, controlling access to No 10 and, until now, keeping its secrets. But in an interview published yesterday the 57-year-old revealed that Cherie Blair resented intrusions into her family time. Power pair: Tony Blair with Anji Hunter in 1995 . ‘Cherie would, rightly, try to ring-fence family time and I’d be like, “Sorry, Cherie, I know it’s your wedding anniversary, but something’s cropped up...”,’ she said. ‘I don’t think Tony was entirely helpful on that score. ‘He’d probably blame me, saying, “I don’t know what Anji’s up to”.’ Miss Hunter, who is married to Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, said rumours of tensions between her and Mrs Blair were overblown. Mrs Blair ‘was the rock of that family’, she said, adding: ‘Do I blame her for being a bit shirty with us from time to time? No, I do not. As the office wife, I was often the harbinger of bad news. She got an unfairly hard time.’ Miss Hunter, who knew Mr Blair from school and Oxford, broke her silence while drumming up publicity for a new role, promoting a prize offered by the Royal Academy of Engineering. Cherie Blair resented instrustions into her family time . She left Downing Street for a short but lucrative stint as director of communications for BP. Miss Hunter denied there had been a romance between her and Mr Blair, pointing out that she was the girlfriend of his guitarist friend Mark Ellen in his student rock band, Ugly Rumours. ‘We were always like brother and sister in that regard,’ she said. ‘He just happened to be my best mate from school. 'Even as a teenager, he was always confident, funny, sure of himself, but not cocky – intelligent and interested in all sorts of things, but not political at all. ‘He wanted to be a rock star, and he’d have been a great one. He was going to be successful at whatever he went into, he had that drive, ambition. ‘He was very good with people, popular, academic, good at sport, plays – charismatic – a natural leader.’ Miss Hunter said Mr Blair saw her as a vital link to the hearts and minds of Middle England. ‘I was big-tent girl,’ the former private schoolgirl told the Sunday Times. ‘Open up those flaps and keep them open ... Tony was totally behind that, it was his invention. But I was the big tent writ large. ‘Tony’s strength was in the fantastic team he had around him ... and that’s all true about me being the voice of Middle England. I lived in Sussex, my kids went to the local school, my friends were farmers and builders and teachers and yacht chandlers. She added: ‘Working in No 10, it is just adrenaline every day. There is  nothing like it...  very high-octane stuff. It was all top secret: It was Paddy Ashdown talking about possibly having a coalition, or Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine discussing Europe – these were people who were not natural bedfellows of ours.’ Miss Hunter also told how she resented that other male aides and spin doctors, such as Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell, played down her contribution in their accounts of Labour’s years in power – and had earned twice as much as she did.","Forced to deny rumours of romance .

The father of a beautiful, 23-year-old Lacoste marketer who was partially beheaded and disemboweled after being stabbed some 30 times by her jilted boyfriend, has told a judge the look of 'terror' on his dead daughter's face will 'haunt me for the rest of my life.' Lynde Coit, a millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, Connecticut, laid bare his grief at the loss of his daughter, Sarah, in a Manhattan courthouse today, just days after Raul Barrera admitted to the brutal Lower East Side slaying, which left the woman with the blade of a knife still lodged in her skull. 'When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue,' Mr Coit testified, choking with emotion, 'her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.' 'A bright, wonderful girl': Sarah Coit had been studying marketing at Hunter College and was a former high school athlete . Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post. He read aloud his final text to his daughter - 'Love you,' which he sent as he set off for the city. Devastated: Lynde Coit, pictured, described to a judge how he will never forget the terror on his daughter's dead face . But she had already been dead for eight hours, prosecutors said today, and what he saw when he arrived in New York was Miss Coit's once-beautiful face criss-crossed by gashes in the city morgue, her perfect teeth grimacing in pain. Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos told . Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers, who will decide . Barrera's fate, that the killer murdered the young marketer with . 'breathtaking viciousness.' He . also described how neighbours awoke to her screams but heart-wrenchingly . couldn't work out where to send police, according to The Post. 'There . were so many soul-shattering screams that half-a-dozen New Yorkers got . out of their beds at 2.30 in the morning,' Bogdanos said. 'These neighbors roamed their hallways, calling, 'Where are you? Where are you?' Miss . Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan . neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left . neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the . building nextdoor. As such, . Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police . finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her . last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering . the floor. Barrera, 33, faces anywhere from 15 years to life in prison. Judge Carruthers will pass sentence after hearing evidence from both sides in the coming weeks. Prosecutors are expected to ask for the maximum sentence - 25 years to life. But defence attorney Paul Feinman is likely to argue that Barrera deserves a reduced sentence because of mental health issues. Guilty: Raul Barrera is walked from the 7th Precinct after surrendering to authorities for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death . Killer: Raul Barrera, 33, pictured right, told cops 'I did something bad' after grabbing a kitchen knife and butchering 23-year-old Sarah Coit . Crime scene: Raul Barrera stabbed Sarah Coit some 30 times in her Lower East Side apartment, pictured . Miss Coit was killed on Sunday April 8 after a heated row that woke the neighbourhood. 'It was pure anger,' one source said. 'He didn't want her to leave, and he didn't want her to be beautiful for anyone.' Brianna Andalore, 20, said she heard screams of 'No, no. Stop, stop. Don't hurt me' through the walls of an apartment she was . staying in. Horror: Sarah Coit, 23, was sliced across the face with such force that the knife broke . Another . neighbour said: 'When she was brought out, the cops were yelling, ""Don't . look Don't look"", her head was almost off. Her neck was wide open.' Assistant District Attorney William Beesch said: 'His father told him to turn himself in.' Public relations worker Barrera has since been held without bail. Sources close to the investigation said that after being picked up by police, Barrera said: 'I did something bad.' Joost Bohner, 33, said, 'I heard her yelling, ""Help me, Help me."" It went on for quite a while, at least 20 minutes. 'People . from the building were yelling out, ""Where are you, What apartment?"" She never answered them, and people started calling 911.' Miss . Coit was found face up on the living room floor with several stab . wounds and the gaping neck wound, sources said. She survived long enough . to be taken to hospital, but died an hour later. An autopsy revealed that the former high school athlete was killed by a stab in the back which left internal organs protruding.

Home Secretary Theresa May moved yesterday to damp down calls for a return of the death  penalty after the murder of  Manchester policewomen Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone. The callous killing of the two PCs, aged 23 and 32 respectively, led to demands for capital punishment, abolished in 1965, to be restored. The calls were supported last week by Paul Beshenivsky,  widowed husband of PC Sharon Beshenivsky, who was shot dead  in Bradford in 2005. Call for calm: Theresa May is against return of the death penalty . They receive further qualified backing in a new Mail on Sunday poll. But Mrs May told this newspaper last night that the death penalty would not have prevented the  killing of PCs Hughes and Bone. ‘The murder of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone was a callous and  cowardly act,’ she said. ‘But I do not believe in the death penalty, and I do not believe that the death penalty would have acted as a deterrent in this case.’ Nor did Mrs May think arming more police would help. ‘We have armed response units who are there to deal with specific threats, but I don’t want to see police officers routinely carrying guns.’ The complications involved in reintroducing capital punishment are illustrated in a Survation poll of 1,012 people interviewed online on Thursday and Friday. Poll: A survey shows the public's opinion is split . A total of 48 per cent want it restored, with 44 per cent against. If it were to be reintroduced, there is a clear preference for executing capital offenders by lethal injection, which is favoured over hanging or the electric chair. A surprisingly high number of those who support lethal injections for murderers, two out of three, say they would be prepared to administer the fatal doses themselves. However, when the survey delved further into public opinion, the  balance appears to tilt in the opposite direction. It could lead to murderers having a greater chance of getting away scot free. Nearly one in four say they would be less likely to return a guilty verdict if they were a juror in a murder trial where the accused faced the prospect of execution instead of jail. And more than half say a higher burden of proof would be required. Similarly, nearly half want more police to be armed. But when the pros and cons are explored in greater detail, voters appear more equivocal. A total of 67 per cent say carrying guns would not have saved PCs Hughes and Bone. One in five disagree. The public believe police would be marginally at greater risk themselves if they were all armed. And 51 per cent say it would lead to more killings by police of innocent civilians, against one in ten who say there would be fewer deaths. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Comes after a Mail on Sunday poll shows 48 per cent want penalty restored, with 44 per cent against .

Barclays was under intense pressure last night to strip Bob Diamond of his £18million golden goodbye. Vince Cable piled pressure on Barclays to block the pay-off to its former chief executive, warning that it would ‘heap shame’ on the beleaguered bank. Furious shareholders are also demanding that Mr Diamond, who has earned an estimated £120million from the bank since 2007, should not be given a penny more. Mr Diamond resigned as chief executive last week over the bank’s involvement in the interest rate fixing scandal. The Bank of England’s deputy governor, Paul Tucker, will face tough questioning from MPs today over what he knew about rate fixing at Barclays, following revelations last week that he telephoned Mr Diamond to discuss the issue at the height of the Libor scandal in 2008. Yesterday it emerged that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was among the ‘senior Whitehall figures’ who called Mr Tucker at that time to express concern about Libor – the interest rate at which banks lend to each other. A Whitehall source insisted he had done nothing to put pressure on Barclays to lower its Libor rate artificially. Business Secretary Mr Cable said ministers were powerless to stop the pay-off to Mr Diamond, but suggested he would be ‘very surprised’ if it were approved by the Barclays board as it struggles to rebuild the bank’s battered image. ‘There isn’t anything government can directly do about it, but I think in view of the shame that’s already been heaped on Barclays bank, I would be very, very surprised if the chairman and the board were to allow another outrage to occur,’ he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday. ‘I think in view of what’s happened, I sincerely hope that the board of Barclays take a fairly strict view about all of this.’ Uncomfortable: Ed Balls, left, and Vince Cable on the Andrew Marr Show . Quitting: Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and shadow chancellor Ed balls who wants the banking industry to have a 'root and branch' review in the wake of the Libor-fixing scandal . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who made . Mr Cable look uncomfortable on the show, also called for action to block . the ‘golden parachute’ payment to Mr Diamond, branding it ‘outrageous’. The National Association of Pension . Funds – one of the most powerful shareholder groups in the country – led . calls for Barclays to claw back bonuses from Mr Diamond and other . directors. Chief executive Joanne Segars said: . ‘Shareholders, including pension funds, have been negatively affected by . their investments in Barclays. ‘The message to Barclays from shareholders is that failure must not be rewarded. Under fire: Barclays has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the Libor-fixing allegations and the resignation of Bob Diamond . Pension savers and shareholders in .

Shares have slumped by almost 40 per . cent during Mr Diamond’s short but scandal-ridden reign. In the 18 . months he has served as chief executive more than £12billion has been . wiped off the bank’s value. Mr Diamond had been ‘promised’ £18million by Barclays in the form of share options and long-term incentive plans. But Alison Carnwath, chairman of the . bank’s pay committee, is said to be fighting ‘tooth and nail’ to prevent . Mr Diamond receiving the payments. But even if the bank wins that . particular battle, he still owns around 13.2million shares in the bank. He will also be automatically entitled to one year’s basic salary of . £1.35million. Mr Diamond repeatedly refused to give . up the payouts of his own volition during his three-hour appearance . before the Commons Treasury select committee last week, saying it is a . matter for the board. Last night one of the leading members of the inquiry admitted the committee had failed to hold Mr Diamond to account. Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said: ‘I don’t . think we felt we did a fantastic job either. It’s a fair criticism to . say “You guys were useless”.’ Mrs Leadsom, a former banker, said members had only seven minutes each to question Mr Diamond, armed with little more than what had appeared in the press. She added: ‘In a sense, we were batting in the dark.’ Under investigation: The state-owned RBS allegedly blocked the release of papers to Canadian investigators .","Business Secretary urges bank to take a 'strict view' after Libor 'shame'

"Christopher Williams, 49, had been prevented from entering play areas and country parks . Says he needs to use the local park to lose weight - despite having the Lake District on his doorstep . Promises he would not to go near any children's swings claiming: 'It doesn't interest me' By . Jaya Narain . UPDATED: . 18:42 EST, 16 September 2011 . Judge Andrew Woolman sitting with two magistrates relaxed the terms of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order allowing Williams more freedom to try and get fit . A paedophile banned from public parks to keep him away from children has had the court order relaxed because it was ‘a breach of his human rights’. Christopher Williams, 49, was jailed for seven years for tying up and molesting a 12-year-old boy, and the ban on entering parks and play areas was imposed when he was released from prison. But the paedophile claimed it prevented him from keeping fit – and now, after an appeal, a judge has relaxed the terms of the order. Judge Andrew Woolman ruled that Williams, who has health problems, should be allowed  to exercise in his local park under certain  conditions. He will be able to do so for an hour at a time on weekdays when children are attending classes, but not during school holidays or weekends. Judge Woolman, sitting with two magistrates at Burnley Crown Court, said: ‘If we did not allow him, it would be potentially damaging to his health and would probably be a breach of his human rights.’ Child-welfare campaigners condemned the decision yesterday and said the human rights of children should come first. Rosie Carter, of the child-protection charity Safechild, said: ‘We despair of this decision. ‘When that individual was . risk-assessed, they thought he would possibly molest children and that’s . why he was banned from entering parks and play areas. ‘I fail to understand why they would . disregard that consideration. This decision would not have been taken . lightly by experienced and qualified professionals. Risk: Williams cannot go near this play are but can visit the park around it . Williams had originally been imprisoned at Chester Crown Court in 1996 for indecent assault and gross indecency after molesting a 12 year old boy whose hands and feet were bound. He also had a 1980 conviction for indecent exposure and was subject of a life time Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from working with children. But last April a fresh warning was issued by the courts about his behaviour after he and another convicted paedophile David Higgs, 28, set up home together in Rishton, Lancs, and 'entertained' local children. Despite being monitored by police, one youngster later spent the night at the home of the two perverts and another was told cigarettes and alcohol were available there. Higgs would also go to another property where children aged between five and 16 congregated and would play hide and seek with them. Police arrested both men after Williams himself contacted one of the children's mothers, admitting they were not allowed to have children in the house and he wanted Higgs out. Higgs was found staying at the home of a young family. Higgs was jailed for 18 months and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years for breaching the sexual prevention order but Williams escaped with a suspended prison term. Despite not committing any offences against children for 15 years, he remains classed as a 'high risk sex offender' by police. ‘There must have been a serious risk identified, and parents and carers will be horrified that the Crown Court has overturned that decision. It’s truly appalling. They mention his human rights, but the welfare of children is paramount in English law, so we fail to understand how the court could overwrite the Children Act 1989. It’s frightening.’ Williams was jailed at Chester Crown Court in 1996 for indecent assault and gross indecency for his horrific attack on the boy. On his release, he was given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order that banned him from public parks and play areas in an attempt to prevent him from coming into contact with children. But last April a fresh warning was issued by the courts after he and another convicted paedophile, David Higgs, 28, set up home together in Rishton, Lancashire, and hosted visits by local children. Police arrested both men for breaching Sexual Offences Prevention Orders and Higgs was jailed for 18 months. Williams escaped with a suspended prison term. After the latest conviction, Williams, who lives at a probation hostel in Carlisle, applied to Hyndburn Magistrates’ Court for his prevention order to be varied so he could go walking in his local park and play golf. Magistrates refused the application after police objected, saying he could go walking in the nearby Lake District. But this week Williams appealed against their decision, claiming he had health problems and needed regular exercise. Relaxing the terms of the prevention order, Judge Woolman said: ‘We recognise that the possibilities for exercise under the existing regime, the existing orders of the court, are very restrictive. ‘It would be oppressive to leave the orders as they are and some limited alteration is appropriate.’ While Williams can now use his local park, he is still banned  from going anywhere near the children’s play area. He is also allowed to play golf. Williams – who also has a 1980 conviction for indecent exposure and a lifetime ban on working with children – told the court: ‘I have no reason at all to go anywhere near the swings. It doesn’t interest me. Williams, who lives in a probation hostel in Carlisle, Cumbria, claimed the ban was 'restrictive' because it prevented him from losing weight after doctors told him to get fit due to his heart condition, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis . ‘I admit I have done wrong and I know my risk level will never change, but from 1996 to 2010 I have not been in trouble.’ He said doctors had told him to lose weight as he suffered from a heart condition, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. The judge said no order of the court could prevent all contact between Williams and children –  he would, for example, come into contact with them when he was out shopping. The court order allows Williams out of his probation hostel between 9am and 3.15pm, 4pm and 7.30pm, and 8pm and 11pm.","Christopher Williams, 49, had been prevented from entering play areas and country parks .

He practically lived in the water, so friends of surfer Ben Linden, who was torn apart by a great white shark, said it was fitting they should say farewell him in the sea today. Scores gathered at a beach in Perth to paddle out a short distance in memory of 24-year-old Mr Linden who was attacked by the 15ft shark while surfing off a beach 100 miles to the north of the city. Lying across their surfboards, his friends – including members of a band he played for – and family members paddled out a short distance while a further 200 people remained on the beach. Tribute: Family and friends held a beach and sea memorial for 24-year-old surfer Ben Linden . Those who gathered under a picturesque blue sky were able to sign a surfboard and write messages on it before it was brought into the water. Then they formed a ceremonial . ring and cast flowers in the sea, while a bagpipe player gave a . rendition of Waltzing Matilda from the sand dunes. Mr Linden’s savage death shocked Western Australia because he was the fifth fatal shark attack victim off the coast in just 10 months. Among the mourners gathered on the beach was Mr Linden’s godfather, Reverend John Hewitson, who said he was amazed at the large number of people who had turned out for the moving ceremony. Couple: Surfer Ben Linden with his girlfriend Alana Noakes who gave a moving tribute to him at the memorial . Dangerous waters: There have been numerous shark attacks on the western coast of Australia . ‘Many people have been touched by this tragedy,’ he told the crowd. ‘Today in Ben’s life and death we celebrate that love conquers death, life conquers fear, peace transforms terror. ‘And that through Ben’s life we are challenged to stay stoked and to live and love abundantly.’ Mr Linden’s girlfriend, Alana Noakes, who stood with Mr Linden’s elder sister Kelli, told the crowd on the beach: ‘Two weeks ago I lost the love of my life, my best friend, my rock, my inspiration. ‘But I am so grateful to have spent the last eight years creating memories and savouring every moment of being with Ben. ‘I am honoured to have grown up with . him and most of all to have been loved by him. It is because of this . that I am the luckiest person in the world.’ Mr Linden’s sister said that riding the waves was going to be more lonely now. A . letter written by one of Mr Linden’s best friends, Peter Tuckey, who was . unable to be at the gathering, was also read out: 'We never know . when our clock is going to stop ticking,' the letter read. 'But if we did, we would live life to the fullest and Big Red was a living flagship of this statement. 'Let the sweet sounds of the ocean be your tune forever brother.'

Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore were also attacked by a shark when . they went spearfishing off the western coast of Australia two weeks ago. The episodes have cemented the west coast's reputation as the world's deadliest shark attack zone, according to The Independent. Jet skiier Matt Holmes, 23, said he was towing a surfing friend along when he saw the attack. 'I . just took my mate straight to the shore and went straight out and there . was just blood everywhere and a massive, massive white shark circling . the body. ‘By the time I got out there half of him had been taken. ‘I tried to lean off the side and . pull him on the back, but as I did that the shark came back and nudged . the jet ski to try to knock me off. ‘When I came back the second time, he took the rest of him. ‘I just thought about his family and if he had kids. I just wanted to get him to shore. I gave it everything I had.’ In Australia as a whole, an average of one person a year is killed by sharks. But Martin Garwood, a senior aquarist at the Sydney Aquarium, said . the spike in attacks is probably the result of human population growth . and the increasing popularity of water sports in isolated locations, . rather than a rise in shark numbers.

The woman who unknowingly married her father today said: 'We had a good life', but that the horror of finding out the truth nearly destroyed her. Valerie Spruill, who lives in Doylestown, Ohio, first told her story earlier this month to the Akron Beacon Journal, and today spoke with CNN about her story. She said that she wasn’t sure if her late husband Percy Spruill even knew he was her father, saying: ‘That conversation didn’t come up.’ Secret: Valerie Spruill, 60, from Ohio, discovered her husband was in fact her father after he died . A DNA test using hair taken from one of Mr Spruill’s hairbrushes confirmed that the two were father and daughter. In her interview with CNN, Mrs Spruill said that the only way to heal from the shocking news was to speak about her pain. ‘Pain and stress will kill,’ she said, ‘and I had to release my stress.’ After she and Mr Spruill met in Akron and moved to the nearby working-class town of Doylestown, she said she was happy. ‘He was a good provider,’ she said, and 'we had a good life'. She said he was accepting to her three children from her first marriage. She worked at the Goodyear plant in the accounting department for 34 years. However, after the truth came out following Mr Spruill’s death, the mother and grandmother said she had a crisis of faith. ‘It’s devastating. It can destroy you. It nearly did,’ she told CNN. At age 60, Mrs Spruill’s grandparents are long dead, as are many of her husband’s relatives that could have provided valuable information to her. Despite all of the hardship, Mrs Spruill has kept a remarkably strong spirit, something she credits to her faith in God. ‘I have no regrets in my life at all,’ she said. Spruill, who has three children and eight grandchildren, is now telling her story in an attempt to find her other siblings from her father. 'It needs to be told, because children need to know where they come from,' she told the Akron Beacon Journal earlier this month. 'And I know it hurts, because I have been devastated by this.' Better times: She said that her husband, who worked as a truck driver, provided she and her children from a previous marriage with a good life . The confusion began because she was looked after by her grandparents from 3-months-old. Her mother Christine was one the 'night ladies' - as she called them - who . testified in the 1980 trial of Summit County Probate . Judge James Barbuto, who was eventually convicted of sex charges. Valerie's mother and father got together when he was just 15 and the number of children they had is unclear, but she is aware of six brothers. She was cared for by her grandparents and her mother visited, although Valerie thought she was a family friend. Aged nine, she was devastated when she found out that Christine - who died in 1984 - had been her mother. It also meant the man she thought was her father was in fact her grandfather. 'This story needs to be told because children need to know where they come from. And I know it hurts, because I have been devastated by this.' But she was not told who her real father was and Valerie later met and married Percy. Percy, who was born in Mississippi, worked in Akron as a truck driver and a parking-lot attendant. He died in 1998 after a brief illness at the age of 60, but for years, she had heard bizarre rumours about their relationship. She finally learned the truth about her marriage from an uncle after Percy died, and confirmed the relationship with a DNA test after finding his hairs on a brush in their room. She does not know for certain that he was aware he had married his daughter, but she said she strongly . believes he did know but was simply . afraid to tell her. Since his death, Valerie, who is retired, has been seeing a therapist to help her deal with the horrifying revelation. Valerie has fought through serious . health problems, including a lengthy hospital stay, which she believes were only brought on by the stress of . discovering the traumatic family secret . She is hoping her story may help her reach additional siblings she didn’t know existed. 'My biggest goal is to find them and let . ’em know that [their mother] loved them, no matter what,' she said.  'And [to say], 'Thank God she gave you away like she did me, so you could have a . beautiful life.'","Valerie Spruill, 60, from Doylestown, Ohio, found out through a DNA test .

Smiling killer: Ensar Gol, 22, was found guilty of murdering his new bride and mother-in-law in a horrifying attack . A Turkish man, who knifed to death his new bride and mother-in-law in a prolonged and vicious attack, was today jailed for 36 years. Ensar Gol, 22, grinned in court again as he was jailed to two life sentences a day after he smirked at being told he would be going to prison for a long time. There were cheers in court when he was told of his fate by High Court Judge Mr Justice Supperstone. Gol repeatedly stabbed Michala, his . wife of six months, as she lay sleeping in their bed in Thame, . Oxfordshire, because he was unhappy in the marriage. Michala's mother Julie Sahin, who was watching television downstairs with a friend, rushed up to find Gol perched over her daughter repeatedly plunging the knife into her neck. As she tried to pull Gol away, she slipped to the floor where she was set upon in a frenzied attack. A post-mortem examination revealed the two women had been stabbed around 70 times. After murdering the two women Gol scooped up his three-year-old daughter and carried her through the streets, the kitchen knife still in his hand and his jeans splattered with the blood. Mr Justice Supperstone said: 'I have no doubt that you intended to kill your wife Michala and your mother-in-law Julie,” said the judge to a nodding Gol. 'These brutal murders were planned and pre-meditated.' 'You say you were unhappy here and didn’t get on with your mother-in-law,' the judge told Gol during the sentencing at Oxford Crown Court. 'I totally reject any suggestion that anything she said or did provides you with any mitigation.' Relatives of Julie and Michala cheered as Gol was told he would serve 36 years for each murder and 12 years for the attempted killing to be run concurrently. A jury sitting at Oxford Crown Court heard how he had been unhappy in his marriage, feeling forced to wed Michala in March 2011. They had two children together after meeting in the Turkish holiday resort of Bodrum in 2007. Bearded Gol smiled and nodded as the jury gave their unanimous guilty verdict for the killing of Michala on September 4 last year. Victims: Michala Gol, (left) 28, and her mother Julie Sahin were stabbed 70 times. Mrs Sahin had rushed to her daughter's aid after Gol attacked her as she slept in their marital bed . As . the public gallery cheered the verdict, Gol, dressed in a black v-neck . tee-shirt, stood still and stoney faced as he was also convicted of the . murder of Julie Sahin and the attempted murder of her friend Casey . Wilson. High Court Judge Mr . Justice Supperstone said he would adjourn Gol’s sentencing until the . following day although it was agreed by both prosecution and defence . that he would serve at least 30 years. As . he was led from the dock Gol broke out into a huge grin, laughed and . pointed at himself with two fingers, mouthing 'me, me, me'. The . jury previously heard how just hours before the double murder Gol . bragged on Facebook that his English bride and her mother 'would be . cut'. He had even had sex . with another woman before he went on the murderous rampage after he fell . out with bride Michala and mother-in-law - who disliked the way that . Gol treated her beloved daughter. During the seven day trial Gol had . denied the vicious killings, even callously claiming that it had been . Julie who had attacked him, and that he had only acted in self defence. 'I’ve never been scared that much in my life,'unshaven Gol told the jury while giving evidence. However a jury of seven men and five women decided that Gol had been guilty of killing 28-year-old Michala and 50-year-old Julie, as well as trying to kill Casey, who is now 20-years-old. Aftermath: Gol is pictured on CCTV clutching his three-year-old girl in one hand with the knife in the other just minutes after the killing at his home, in Thame, Oxon. Maniac: Gol is later seen on CCTV chatting on his mobile phone as he . strolls through the streets with the murder weapon still in his hand . Arrest: Police officers apprehend Gol as he lies on the street in Thame, Oxon. Before the killing spree, Gol wrote on . Facebook: 'Have a look, all the English papers will talk of me . tomorrow. The crazy wolf Kurdish Turk who covered London in blood. 'The knife is ready, you know I’m handy with a knife, good with knives.' Just hours later Gol returned to his marital home in Thame, Oxon., and stabbed his sleeping wife. Wedding picture: The couple had been married six months after meeting in the Turkish holiday resort of Bodrum in 2007 . Miss Wilson had described to the . court how she and her friend had rushed upstairs to help.She said: 'I . could see she had her hands up and one of her legs up.'Ensar had his hand up over her.' Miss Wilson managed to pull the . Turkish-born restaurant worker off her friend but was herself stabbed . four times, one of the wounds missing her pulmonary vein by just a . millimetre. She managed to flee but tragically petite Julie was trapped in the house with her knife-wielding son-in-law, and eventually collapsed through a lack of blood at the foot of the stairs, curled in the foetal position and inches from the front door. A post mortem examination revealed both women had died from the blood lost from their numerous stab wounds, most of which were dealt to their necks and chests. Both women also had defence-type injuries to their hands. Gol walked from the house into the town centre with the knife still in his hand and carrying his three-year-old daughter. He went to a pizza restaurant just minutes after the killings in the early hours of September 4, last year, where Julie’s husband Mehmet Sahin was working and chillingly told him: 'You didn’t believe me but I did it.' Gol had only been living in the UK for a month before the killings, but had wanted to return to Turkey.Michala had even bought him a ticket back to his homeland the week prior to her death, but then asked him to stay. He had already moved back to Turkey on several occasions during the short marriage but always returned because of the two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons.","Smirking Ensar Gol, 22, repeatedly .

A teenager who was shocked to discover she had breast cancer when she was just 15-years old is now educating other young women about the disease. Morgan Watson, from Herriman, Utah, was diagnosed with medullary carcinoma in August 2010 and spent the next year going through aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Now in remission she told KSL.com: ‘I'm just glad to be a part of it and spread information about the disease… and have them be aware that it can happen to them. Morgan Watson, who became a breast cancer sufferer at the age of just 15, is now helping other young teens to learn more about the illness . The exceptional teenager excelled at softball and is an aspiring thespian who enjoys drama and acting, but was then struck down by cancer before she could even get a driver's license . ‘Mine was an exceptionally rare case, but the more knowledge that you have the more you can prepare for things to happen in the future.’ Medullary carcinoma is a rare type of mutation to the more common breast cancer, accounting for approximately three to five percent of all cases. It usually affects women in their late 40s and early 50s. After consulting four different doctors, Miss Watson found 'a really great team of women' physicians at the Huntsman Cancer Institute who developed a suitable treatment plan. 'I was in very good hands from the very beginning and couldn’t have asked for anything better,' she said. Morgan, pictured here with mother Jana Pendleton, spoke to students at a Utah high school and encouraged them to wear pink for Halloween . Morgan was incredibly unlucky to be diagnosed with the form of cancer, with teenagers standing just a 1 in 20,000 chance of getting it . The 17-year-old, pictured here with friends who have died part of their hair pink, now wants to raise awareness of the illness among gilrs of a similar age . Yesterday the 17-year-old visited students at Jordan High School in Utah, who were encouraged to wear pink to school instead of Halloween costumes for the occasion. She urged the crowd that gathered to recognize that breast cancer doesn't just affect older women, highlighting the importance of a healthy lifestyle in warding off disease. ‘High school students tend to think more about their social lives - being the most important thing - but they don't really get involved with causes or things like that,' she explained. Recalling how she felt when she first received her diagnosis more than two years ago, the Utah State University student said: ‘I was terrified for my life. ‘I didn’t know if I was going to be alive for my next birthday. Every day was treasured as if it was my last.’ When her hair fell out she proudly went to school sporting her bald head, stating that 'I wanted to embrace it and not let it ruin who I was as a person'. Women have a 1 in 28 chance of contracting breast cancer between the ages of 60 and 70. But as a teenager the risk is less than 1 in 20,000.

But news quickly spread to other schoolchildren, with one speculating . online that the blow had cracked one of Leonie’s ribs, which had . punctured her heart and killed her. In rare cases, heavy blows can stop the heart. The schoolgirl may also have had an underlying health condition. East of England Ambulance Service spokesman Gary Sanderson said: ‘First . and foremost our thoughts are firmly with the girl’s family at this . tragic time. ‘The ambulance crew arrived at the scene within one minute and found . the girl in a critical condition. Following rapid treatment and . stabilisation by the ambulance crews, she was taken to an awaiting . medical team at Basildon Hospital where sadly she died shortly after.’ Leonie, who celebrated her birthday last month, had an older sister, Courtney, 14, and brothers Riley, ten, and Owen, four.

It immediately sparked anger among other local residents, who received the original newsletter in April and May which was sent to 8,107 council tenants. Peter Innes, 43, said today: ‘How can the council justify spending £630 on translating a magazine for just one person?' ‘The magazine is routinely just put in the bin by tenants and the advice in it is usually less than enlightening, so to my mind it is just a total and utter waste of money.’ Losing their marbles: The Crawley borough welcome many cultures and interests to their town like the Marble World Championships in 2006 (pictured) but translating for one resident is too much .

The man whose 'keen observational skills and strong sense of civic duty' led Dallas police to Lee Harvey Oswald was honoured yesterday on the 48th anniversary of John F Kennedy's assassination. Johnny Calvin Brewer received the department's Citizen's Certificate Of Merit and praised for his selfless act and 'exemplary conduct' on November 22, 1963. Dallas Police Chief David Brown presented the 70-year-old with his award at the Texas Theater, the location where Oswald was captured around 80 minutes after Kennedy was killed. Scroll down for video . 'Exemplary conduct': Johnny Calvin Brewer was yesterday presented with the Dallas Police Department's Citizen's Certificate Of Merit for leading officers to Lee Harvey Oswald in the Texas Theater (pictured) on November 22, 1963 . Apprehended: Oswald is taken out of the Texas Theater after Mr Brewer pointed him out to officers . After accepting the award and watching a video of his 22-year-old self recounting the events of that day, Mr Brewer said: 'I'm just so overwhelmed.' Then . a manager at a shoe store located about 90 yards from the Oak Cliff . neighbourhood cinema, Mr Brewer was listening to news coverage of the . president's assassination when he heard reports that a Dallas police . officer, JD Tippit, had just been killed a few blocks away. A man whose behaviour seemed suspicious then walked into the foyer of the shoe store. Mr Brewer said the man stared at the display in the window and acted scared as police cars with blaring sirens raced by. After the last squad car passed in . one direction, the man stepped out of the shop and walked in the . opposite direction towards the cinema. Mr . Brewer saw him go into the theatre without buying a ticket. He followed . him, alerting the woman in the box office to call police. In 1963, Mr Brewer worked as a manager at a shoe shop located about 90 yards from the Oak Cliff neighbourhood cinema . Oswald was sitting in this cinema when he was arrested. He had entered the theatre without buying a ticket . The seat where Oswald was sitting when he was arrested is commemorated at the Texas Theater . Mugshot: Lee Harvey Oswald as photographed bv police the day after Kennedy was killed . Lee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939 in New Orleans. Raised by his mother Marguerite after his father died before he was born, Oswald and his two older brothers moved around the U.S. and were even put up for adoption for a period of 13 months. At 17, he joined the U.S. Marines and qualified as a sharpshooter before defecting to the Soviet Union for a brief period from October 1959 to June 1962. It was in Russia, in March 1961, that Oswald met Marina Prusakova, a 19-year-old pharmacology student. They married less than six weeks later in April 1961 and had a daughter, June, in February the following year. In May 1962, the couple visited the U.S. embassy in Moscow to apply for a visa so Marina could move to America. The family travelled to the U.S. in June and settled in the Dallas / Fort Worth area of Texas. On the night of April 10, 1963, Oswald shot at anti-communist Major General Edwin Walker with his rifle. He confessed his crime to his wife and that he then buried the weapon that night. Seven months later, he was arrested in a Dallas cinema on suspicion of murdering police officer JD Tippit some 40 minutes after Kennedy's assassination. Oswald protested his innocence and was himself shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby just two days later as he exited a police station surrounded by officers and the press. Although the Warren Commission concluded that he had acted alone in killing Kennedy, the House Select Committee On Assassinations in 1979 concluded that he had 'probably' not acted alone. The debate as to whether Oswald was a lone gunman or part of a wider conspiracy continues to this day. Mr Brewer then shared his suspicions . with the concessions operator and the two searched the theatre and stood . by the emergency exits. Hearing noise behind his alley-exit . door, Mr Brewer opened it only to have police guns aimed at him. The . cinema lights went on and Mr Brewer pointed out the suspicious man . seated in the theatre. Oswald was arrested after a brief scuffle, during which he punched an officer and pulled a gun.As . he was taken from the theatre he hollered: 'I am not resisting arrest,' according to testimony Mr Brewer gave to the Warren Commission that . investigated the president's death. Oswald . was shot and killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby in the . basement of police headquarters while being transferred to the county . jail. Since then, Mr . Brewer has served in the Navy and then moved to Austin, where he still . lives, having retired from a career in sales. Beaming . family members, including two grandchildren, and friends who called him . a humble man, were on hand for Tuesday's ceremony.

Final moments: JFK and Mrs Kennedy ride through Dallas just before he was killed . Horror: President Kennedy lies slumped down in the back seat of his car after being fatally shot as the vehicle speeds away from the grassy knoll . Deputy Police Chief Randy Blankenbaker said: 'Mr. Brewer made a difference in the history of the United States. 'You not only helped us capture the . man who shot the president of the United States but you also helped us . capture a man who killed one of our police officers.' Patrolman Tippit's widow expressed her gratitude to Mr Brewer, as did retired Dallas police officer Ray Hawkins. Mr Hawkins, who handcuffed Oswald . that fateful day, said: 'I think it's a little late, but I'm glad he's . finally getting recognition. He's deserving.' Chief Brown speculated that the . tribute did not occur sooner because Dallas has been trying to move away . from the tragedy it's been associated with for so long that 'many of . the details of the actions by citizens like Mr. Brewer have been left . behind'. But Chief Brown, who became the . city's most senior officer last year, said as the department began . trying to revisit its legacy and history, Mr Brewer's story just 'jumped . out'.

But these long-lost relatives were quick to break the ice in the warmest of ways – with a great big bear hug. Kesho the gorilla and his younger brother Alf had been apart for nearly three years after being sent to different zoos. They were reunited this week in their new home in Longleat Safari Park and welcomed each other with open arms – followed by  shoulder squeezes, handshakes and the odd bit of brotherly rough and tumble. Embrace: Gorillas Kesho and Alf embrace give each other a hug after being reunited at Longleat Safari Park . Welcome: Kesho is settling in well with his brother at the safari park . The pair will now live together in a £3million enclosure at the Wiltshire park. Born at Dublin Zoo, they were separated when Kesho, 13, was sent to London Zoo to take part in a breeding programme. He proved to be infertile, but while . living with three females as the dominant male he became the leader of . the pack – and transformed from a small blackback gorilla to a strapping . great 35st silverback who towers over his nine-year-old brother. Fortunately, this wasn’t enough to . stop Alf recognising him. Gorillas, which share 98 per cent of their DNA . with humans, can identify each other by the shape of their noses. Long time, no see: Kesho and Alf shake hands after being brought together for the first time in years . Home: The brothers are kept in a £3million gorilla enclosure at the safari park . Mark Tye, head gorilla keeper at . Longleat, said: 'We weren’t entirely sure that the brothers would even . know each other, but the moment they met you could just see the . recognition in their eyes. 'They were touching each other through the cage that temporarily separated them and there were no acts of aggression. 'We put them together 24 hours later and it was like they had never been apart. 'They were very animated and there was a lot of rough and tumble on the floor, but not in an aggressive way. 'It is quite unusual to see that sort of childlike behaviour in a silverback.' Mr Tye said that Kesho was very tolerant and the gorillas had formed a 'really tight bond'. Like old times: Staff at the safari park say the gorillas are behaving as though they have never been apart . Family resemblance: The brothers were raised together at Dublin Zoo, but became separated when Kesho was chosen for a breeding programme . He added: 'Had they been two strangers there would have been a lot of face to face confrontation and some fighting and screaming. 'But Kesho and Alf were happy to turn their backs on one another which is a sign of trust. 'It is great for Alf to have an older brother to look up to and learn from and Kesho seems to enjoy being the centre of attention. 'It was very satisfying to see.' The brothers were born at Dublin Zoo but parted when Kesho joined three females in London.

A BBC sports presenter has infuriated union leaders by asking whether striking border staff threatening the Olympics should be sacked. Garry Richardson also asked if the union members were ‘a disgrace’ during an interview with Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday. Mr Hunt then dramatically escalated the row by admitting that Cabinet ministers have discussed the possibility of firing the 5,000 staff who are expected to go on strike. Heathrow: The airport celebrates the Olympics with the iconic rings but could be the source of chaos amid calls for strikes . Robust: BBC man Garry Richardson was seen to be 'goading' Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt into calling union workers a 'disgrace' His words stoked a growing Coalition row between Tories, who want legislation to curb strikes, and Liberal Democrats, who see no case for a change in the law. The Public and Commercial Services Union immediately called on Mr Richardson to apologise. It compared the BBC to Right-wing US news station Fox News and said it had made an official complaint. British broadcasters are required by law to comply with impartiality rules. But critics of the union said that Richardson had been following a ‘perfectly legitimate line of questioning’ and simply representing the views of the public. The interview was conducted on the Sportsweek programme on Radio 5 Live. Richardson said: ‘It’s great that you have got these contingency plans and you have got these people able to come in and you have trained them up to step in. ‘Why not just let those people go on strike and when they want to come back after they have done all their disruption say, “Sorry, your job’s not there any more”? Sack them.’ Earlier, he said of the workers: ‘They are a disgrace, aren’t they?’ Mr Hunt said he did not want to ‘escalate’ the row but admitted ministers had discussed the idea of sacking immigration staff, whose walkout on Thursday could paralyse Heathrow on the eve of the Games opening ceremony. He added: ‘Sack them? That is the Ronald Reagan approach and I can tell you that among ministers there have been people asking whether we should be doing that. ‘But I don’t want to escalate things by talking about that right now, because I know among those 600 people there are lots of people who want to do the right thing and turn up for work.’ In 1981 then US president Mr Reagan famously sacked hundreds of air traffic control workers who went on strike. Mr Hunt said the PCS was ‘totally out of tune with the mood of the country’. Chancellor George Osborne is said to be ‘furious’ at the behaviour of the strikers and is demanding tough laws to outlaw strikes called on a low turnout such as the 20 per cent who voted in the PCS ballot. Flaming fun: Skier Amelia Hempleman-Adams, at 17 the youngest person to ski to the South Pole, gets a bird's eye view of London yesterday . Only 1,800 of the PCS’s 16,000 members voted for the action. But the policy is controlled by the Department for Business run by Lib Dem Vince Cable. Employment relations minister Norman Lamb, another Lib Dem, said at the weekend he was ‘so far unpersuaded’ that unions’ powers needed to be curbed. On top of the strike, immigration staff and other Home Office workers will work to rule and refuse overtime from July 27 to August 20. In a letter to the BBC, the PCS wrote: ‘This is totally unacceptable for a BBC journalist, this isn’t Fox News, and [we] would like to know how Five Live proposes to remedy it as a matter of urgency.’ But Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Not only was Garry Richardson pursuing a perfectly legitimate line of questioning, but he was asking the question on the lips of many people up and down the country. ‘The PCS is intent on causing chaos on the eve of the Olympics as union members attempt to keep hold of their gold-plated public sector pensions and oppose necessary restraint in public spending. ‘It’s unsurprising that increasing numbers of taxpayers are wondering why there shouldn’t be consequences for a selfish minority causing such disruption, especially when the eyes of the world are focused on us.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Garry Richardson was seeking to clarify Jeremy Hunt’s views with robust questioning about the Government’s response to the planned industrial action. ‘The questions did not represent a personal point of view but were designed to explore and test the Government’s position. ‘The BBC is committed to reporting impartially on the week’s events.’","BBC presenter Garry Richardson infuriates unions with 'goading' of Culture Secretary .

A pregnant teenager from the Dominican Republican has died from leukemia complications this week after her mother said the hospital had delayed her chemotherapy treatment due to the Caribbean nation’s stringent anti-abortion laws. Doctors at Semma Hospital in Santo Domingo were reluctant to give Rosa Hernandez’s 16-year-old daughter her chemotherapy because it could terminate the pregnancy, which is against the law in the island nation where the Catholic Church remains a powerful force. According to Article 37 of the Dominican Constitution, which was passed in 2009, ‘the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death.’ Heartbroken: Rosa Hernandez said she tried to convince the Dominican government to make an exception for her daughter and approve her chemotherapy, but to no avail . Dominican courts have interpreted Article 37 as a strict ban on abortion even in extreme cases of incest, rape and malformation of the fetus, CNN reported. A Dominican doctor who provides chemotherapy treatment for a pregnant patient that results in the termination of the pregnancy may find himself in legal trouble. As a result, medics are afraid to carry out the procedure because it’s unconstitutional. Hernandez said she tried to convince the Dominican government and the doctors to make an exception for her daughter in order to safe her young life, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. ‘My daughter's life is first,’ she told CNN. ‘I know that (abortion) is a sin and that it goes against the law…but my daughter's health is first.’ Hernandez said her daughter, who has not been identified due to her age, started getting treatment for her illness only 20 days after being admitted to the hospital. On Friday, she passed away, according to Dr Antonio Cabrera, the legal representative for the hospital. Too late: The pregnant teen's treatment started some 20 days after she was first admitted to Semma Hospital in Santo Dominican . ‘They have killed me, I'm dead, dead. I'm nothing,’ the girl’s grieving mother said. ‘She was the reason for my existence. I no longer live. Rosa has died. Let the world know that Rosa is dead.’ The body of the teen, dubbed ‘Esperanctia’ in the press, rejected a blood transfusion and did not respond to the chemotherapy, and her condition worsened, Cabrera said. National debate: Dominican Minister of Health Bautista Rojas Gomez said he favored chemotherapy over protecting the girl's pregnancy . The teen, who was 13 weeks pregnant, suffered a miscarriage early Friday. She then went into cardiac arrest, and doctors were unable to revive her. The plight of the 16-year-old girl has sparked a national debate over abortion in the Dominican Republic, with some lawmakers calling on officials to reconsider the abortion ban. Leaders of the liberal opposition took up the girl’s cause, calling on the government to reconsider the nation’s stringent anti-abortion stance, and even Dominican Minister of Health Bautista Rojas Gomez said he favored chemotherapy over protecting the girl's pregnancy. However, Pelegriin Castillo, one of the sponsors of the Article 37, said the ban does not bar doctors from administering the treatment to treat cancer, but rather prevents them from using chemotherapy specifically to induce an abortion. However, the teen’s doctors were allegedly hesitant to start treatment for fear of facing persecution if the chemotherapy were to end the pregnancy. Reuters reported that Amnesty International has found that that in countries where abortion is totally banned, the rates of maternal mortality rise because doctors are unable to provide life-saving treatment that endangers pregnancy even when such treatment is necessary to save the mother's life.","Girl, 16, was admitted to hospital in capital of Santo Domingo when she was 10 weeks pregnant .

Court arrival; Nadir is seenoutside the Old Bailey this morning with his wife Nur before he was found guilty . As chairman and chief executive of the . conglomerate, which bought up Del Monte’s fresh fruit division and a . majority stake in Japanese electronics firm Sansui, he is said to have . smuggled enough bags of cash out of the country ‘to stand 300 times the . height of Nelson’s Column’, weighing a colossal 135 tons. But the mogul, who allegedly spent . millions on Mayfair mansions, grand country estates, antiques and sports . cars including a Bentley Continental, a Bentley Turbo and a Ferrari . Testarossa, infamously jetted off to his native northern Cyprus on the . eve of his trial for fraud in May 1993. It was not until August 2010 that Nadir returned to London claiming he could not live with the ‘burning sense of injustice’. Yesterday, however, following a seven-month trial, a jury convicted him of three charges of theft totalling £5.5million. Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck, arriving at his London home with his wife Nur after 17 years in Northern Cyprus . Asil Nadir and his wife Nur arriving at the Old Bailey, London, when he went on trial in January this year . Fraud charges: A courtroom sketch of Asil Nadir, sitting in the dock at the Old Bailey . In marked contrast to the scenes at . the beginning of the trial when Nadir entered the Old Bailey grinning . and waving to photographers with his glamorous wife on his arm, . yesterday he was a picture of disbelief. Dressed in a double-breasted suit with . a handkerchief in his jacket pocket, the flamboyant defendant stood . motionless in shock, staring straight ahead with his jaw working . furiously as the jury returned their verdicts. His wife, Nur, who at 28 is 43 years his junior, fought back tears as she sat just a few feet away in a black dress. Moments later she fled the court, . telling reporters outside in a trembling voice: ‘I am very disappointed, . that’s all I can say.’ As the jury continued to deliberate on . further theft charges, she was whisked away from court in a silver . chauffeur-driven Jaguar. Nadir was found guilty of stealing . £1.3million from PPI’s accounts to secretly buy shares in the company to . prop up its Stock Exchange value. Every penny on the share price . increased the value of Nadir’s publicly declared 25 per cent stake in . the firm by nearly £1million. Emotion: Nur Nadir, wife of tycoon Asil Nadir, leaves the Old Bailey after hearing that her husband has been found guilty of three counts of theft . He was also convicted of blowing . £1million on antiques, buying a pair of antique fireplaces from . Christie’s to furnish his lavish offices in Berkeley Square. Some of the cash stolen in this . tranche was also used to top up Nadir’s personal bank account when he . went overdrawn after splurging on gifts including jewellery in the . run-up to Christmas 1989. He was also found guilty of stealing . £3.25million, some of which was funnelled into an account Nadir’s mother . Safiye held in Geneva. Money stolen in this transaction was . ploughed into South Audley Management, which administered his family . interests and the Baggrave Farm estate, an elegant stately home nestled . in 2,000 acres in Leicestershire, part of which he planned to develop . into a model farm. Yesterday he was cleared of taking £2.5million to . support his charter airline, Noble Air, and to settle part of his tax . bill.

The jury is still deliberating on nine . other specimen charges of theft which relate to the disappearance of . £33million and $2.5million. But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, . claims the ‘much bigger picture’ is that he stole £146million and . $6.4million – which was equivalent to £3.9million in 1990 – in a total . of 64 transfers. Nadir is said to have ordered his . henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from . banks which he ‘dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family . or associates’. The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and . August 1990 from three accounts held by PPI, a major international . conglomerate which had over 200 subsidiaries trading in food, . electronics, textiles and leisure. Jury: The case finally went before a jury at the Old Bailey in January, with the businessman facing 13 specimen charges relating to the disappearance of £33.1m and US$2.5m . Most of Polly Peck's business was based in Turkey and northern Cyprus, where Nadir (pictured here) went into hiding . At the time, Polly Peck was a major success story and one of the best performing companies on the Stock Exchange. For a time, Nadir appeared . untouchable, buying the Del Monte fresh fruit division in a deal worth . $875million and acquiring a majority stake in Sansui. But his empire began to crumble when . the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into suspected . manipulation of its share price in September 1990. The firm was placed into . administration the following month with debts of more than £550million . and Nadir was charged with theft and false accounting. He fled the country a few months later claiming he was a ‘broken man’ who could not receive a fair trial. Now he faces a lengthy prison sentence.

Hygienic: Men in Taiwan are being encouraged to sit down to urinate rather than standing at the toilet or a urinal . Taiwan's environmental minister wants to rid the island of urine-splattered toilet seats by encouraging men to sit down to pee. Stephen Shen, the head of Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), said he himself has adopted the habit, and urged men to follow his lead in the interests of creating a cleaner environment. Despite the fact that the facilities in most men's restrooms in Taiwan are comprised mainly of urinals, local government officials are to be asked to put up notices in public areas advising men to take a leaf out of women's books by sitting on the toilet to relieve themselves. Officials behind the initiative have . said the more men who sit down to urinate the more likely it is that . public toilet seats will be clean and ready for the next user. Yuan . Shaw-jing, director general of environmental sanitation and toxic . substance maintenance at the EPA, said the initiative was an attempt to . follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan and Sweden. 'In Japan, we heard 30 per cent of the men sit,' he told the BBC. Taiwan's estimated 100,000 public toilets are visited regularly by inspectors, with most understood to be graded highly. But officials at the agency said some facilities are still marred by urine spatter. While the agency said it can't force men to change their toilet habits, it will be using the public notices to encourage them to do so. Mr Shen's campaign sparked a debate online according to the report, with the move largely welcomed by female commentators, but derided by some men who suggested it would not be easy to change the habit of a lifetime.

Apple has been awarded more than $1 billion in damages as it prevailed in its patent-infringement case against Samsung. The jury decided that the majority of Samsung smartphones and tablets violate patents held by Apple including features such as the zoom in and out innovation achieved by tapping the screen. The jury also decided that Samsung's infringement was intentional and said the firm's counter-suit for $399 million against Apple was without merit. Kevin Johnson, (right), and Victoria Maroulis, (left), attorneys for Samsung, leave the US Courthouse and Federal building after a jury reached a decision in the Apple Samsung trial on Friday, Aug 24, 2012 in San Jose, California . The iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S II: Apple claims Samsung ripped off their phone with the Galaxy . Outside counsel Jason Bartlett for Apple Inc. is surrounded by reporters after jurors found Samsung Electronics infringed on all but one of seven patents at issue in the patent case with Apple Inc. Samsung has said it will appeal against the ruling. 'We will move immediately to file post-verdict motions to . overturn this decision in this court and if we are not successful, we . will appeal this decision to the Court of Appeals,' a statement from . Samsung said. The verdict in the complex case came after the nine-member jury began deliberations on Wednesday. The software giant are set to call for a sales injunction at a hearing next month, demanding Samsung products are pulled from the U.S. market. The landmark legal case could also affect other territories such as the UK, as Apple could call for import bans on its rivals products. Apple . Corp. filed its lawsuit in April 2011 and engaged legions of the . country's highest-paid patent lawyers to demand $2.5 billion from its . top smartphone competitor. Samsung Electronics Co. fired back with its . own lawsuit seeking $399 million. But the day belonged to Apple as the jury rejected all Samsung's claim . against Apple. The jury did reject some of Apple's claims against the . two dozen Samsung devices at issue, declining to award the $2.5 billion . Apple demanded. During closing arguments, Apple attorney Harold McElhinny claimed Samsung was having a 'crisis of design' after the 2007 launch of the iPhone, and executives with the South Korean company were determined to illegally cash in on the success of the revolutionary device. Samsung's lawyers countered that it was simply and legally giving consumers what they want: Smart phones with big screens. They said Samsung didn't violate any of Apple's patents and further alleged innovations claimed by Apple were actually created by other companies. Reporters wait outside the United States Courthouse and Federal building after a jury reached a decision in the Apple Samsung trial on Friday . A Californian court has decided that Apple's iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages . Apple's legal team plans to formally demand Samsung pull its most popular . cellphones and computer tablets from the U.S. market. They also can ask . the judge to triple the damages to $3 billion. U.S. District Judge Lucy . Koh will decide those issues along with Samsung's demand she overturn . the jury's verdict in several weeks. The outcome of the case is . likely to have ripple effects in the smartphone market. After seeing . Samsung's legal defeat, other device makers relying on Android may . become more reluctant to use the software and risk getting dragged into . court. 'Some of these device makers might end up saying, 'We love . Android, but we really don't want to fight with Apple anymore,' said . Christopher Marlett, CEO of MDB Capital Group, an investment bank . specializing in intellectual property. 'I don't know if $1 billion is hugely significant to Apple or Samsung,' Marlett said. 'But there is a social cost here. As a company, you don't want to be known as someone who steals from someone else. I am sure Samsung wants to be known as an innovator, especially since a lot of Asian companies have become known for copying the designs of innovators.' Samsung conceded that Apple makes great products but said it doesn't have a monopoly on the design of rectangle phones with rounded corners that it claimed it created. The trial came after each side filed a blizzard of legal motions and refused advisories by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to settle the dispute out of court. Samsung has sold 22.7 million smartphones and tablets that Apple claimed uses its technology. McElhinny said those devices accounted for $8.16 billion in sales since June 2010. Apple and Samsung combined account for more than half of global smartphone sales. As part of its lawsuit, Apple also demanded that Samsung pull its most popular cellphones and computer tablets from the U.S. market. From the beginning, legal experts and Wall Street analysts viewed Samsung as the underdog in the case. Apple's headquarters is a mere 10 miles from the courthouse, and jurors were picked from the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple's late founder Steve Jobs is a revered technological pioneer. While the legal and technological issues were complex, patent expert Alexander I. Poltorak previously said the case would likely boil down to whether jurors believe Samsung's products look and feel almost identical to Apple's iPhone and iPad. Vengeance: Late Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up an . Apple iPhone: He vowed to fight to the bitter end against those who . stole its design . Apple CEO Tim Cook, (left) seen with Steve Jobs in 2010, took over Apple after Mr Jobs' death in October of 2011 . To overcome that challenge at trial, Samsung's lawyers argued that many of Apple's claims of innovation were either obvious concepts or ideas stolen from Sony Corp. and others. Experts called that line of argument a high-risk strategy because of Apple's reputation as an innovator. Apple's lawyers argued there is almost no difference between Samsung products and those of Apple, and presented internal Samsung documents they said showed it copied Apple designs. Samsung lawyers insisted that several other companies and inventors had previously developed much of the Apple technology at issue. Samsung has emerged as one of Apple's biggest rivals and has . overtaken as the leading smartphone maker. Samsung's Galaxy line of . phones run on Android, a mobile operating system that Google Inc. has . given out for free to Samsung and other phone makers. Google . entered the smartphone market while its then-CEO Eric Schmidt was on . Apple's board, infuriating Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who considered . Android to be a blatant rip off of the iPhone's innovations. After . shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Jobs vowed that Apple would resort . to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies. If . Android lose any ground in the mobile computing market, that would hurt . Google, too. That's because Google relies on Android to drive mobile . traffic to its search engine and services to sell more advertising. The . Apple-Samsung trial came after each side filed a blizzard of legal . motions and refused advisories by the judge to settle the dispute out of . court. Deliberations by the jury of seven men and two women began . Wednesday. Jurors left the courthouse without addressing the scrum . of international media who camped out at the San Jose courthouse for a . month. They notified the judge at about 2:30 p.m. that they had . arrived at a verdict after deliberating two-and-a-half days. Many . expected deliberations to last longer because of the complexity of the . case.

The U.S. case is one of some 50 lawsuits among myriad telecommunications companies jockeying for position in the burgeoning $219 billion market for smartphones and computer tablets.

The caped crusader - who wears a green Lycra costume, red mask and stick-on moustache - zooms around Perth, Australia, swooping on clamped cars to help drivers to escape a $135 fine. 'Wheel Clamp Man', who removes the clamps with a battery-powered angle grinder, claims he is taking an 'ethical stance' after having a bad experience as his workaday alter-ego. Green lantern: The masked Wheel Clamp Man helps motorists by removing clamps with an angle grinder . He does his good deeds for free, asking only for a donation to a homeless charity - but police see him as a masked menace and want the public to report him. 'He is committing the offence of criminal damage and if people have any info, they should contact Crime Stoppers and we will deal with him,' a police spokesman told Perth's Sunday Times. The mystery figure responded: 'I'm taking an ethical stance. I'm helping people out. I don't feel I'm damaging property. 'I got clamped myself. I went to a car park, pulled in, couldn't see any signs, and I must have walked less than 100m and I was clamped. It was a con because they were watching.' He vowed to keep fighting 'greedy' councils and wheel clampers and helping innocent people who don't deserve their fines.

In April, 36-year-old Adam Besso from Michigan found himself on the wrong side of the law after he allegedly fired a shotgun while fighting crime as his alter-ego Bee Sting. He was caught patrolling a trailer park with other 'superheroes', wearing a bulletproof vest, a black leather jacket with a bee logo, shin guards, knee pads and black leather gloves, according to police. In his possession they found a can of pepper spray, handcuffs and scissors.

Oliveira’s time was 21.25 seconds – slower than the world record Pistorius had set in the heats 24 hours earlier. Scroll down for video . Bitter: Oscar Pistorius claimed opponents used longer 'blades' for unfair advantage . Dispute: Alan Oliveira of Brazil (left) crosses the line ahead of pre-race favourite Oscar Pistorius of South Africa (right) to win gold in the Men's 200m - T44 final. Pistorius claimed his rival had an unfair advantage . But after the race, the 25-year-old . South African launched a tirade against his rival, accusing him of using . blades that gave him an unfair advantage. Pistorius, the most famous . Paralympian in the world, declared: ‘We are not running in a fair race . here, absolutely ridiculous. The guy’s legs are unbelievably long. ‘Not taking away from Alan’s . performance, he’s a great athlete, but these guys are a lot taller and . you can’t compete (with the) stride length.’ Pistorius has twice previously . complained about the rules on running blades to the International . Paralympic Committee, (IPC) the governing body. Officials said they . would sit down with Pistorius in the next few days in a ‘non emotional . environment’ to discuss his concerns and admitted the rules over the use . of blades would be reviewed as technology progresses. Close finish: Silver medalist Oscar Pistorius and 200m winner Alan Oliveira appeared to put the controversy behind them as they hugged at today's medal ceremony . Yesterday Pistorius, who could face a . £5,000 fine for his outburst, attempted to calm the outcry by . apologising for the timing of his comments, both in writing and . personally to the 20-year-old. He also applauded the Brazilian as the . pair received their medals in front of 80,000 spectators in the Olympic . Stadium, before giving each other a hug. But despite the mounting . criticism, Pistorius did not change his sentiments. ‘That was Alan’s moment and I would . like to put on record the respect I have for him,’ he said. ‘I want to . apologise for the timing of my comments.’ He added: ‘I do believe that there is . an issue here and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the IPC . but I accept that raising these concerns immediately as I stepped off . the track was wrong. ‘I am a proud Paralympian and believe in the fairness of sport. I am happy to work with the IPC who obviously share these aims.’ Close contest: Race winner Alan Oliveira (left) wore longer prosthetic blades than Oscar Pistorius (right), giving him a greater stride length . Disappointment: South Africa's Oscar Pistorius looks dejected after finishing second in the race .

Ironically, Pistorius had faced . similar opposition from those who claimed he should not be allowed to . compete against able-bodied athletes as he did last month in the . Olympics – because his blades could give him an advantage. Experts are still divided on whether . blades provide an advantage for runners and there are rules governing . the length of the blades that athletes can wear in proportion to their . height. The IPC’s Craig Spence said that the . length of the blades used by all eight athletes on Sunday night had been . measured and fully complied with the rules. Mr Spence revealed that Pistorius had . telephoned him personally to express concerns over the length of a rival . athlete’s blades six weeks ago although the athlete in question was not . Oliveira. Triumphant: Oliveira embarks on a victory lap after winning gold at the Paralympics . Handshake: Pistorius congratulated Alan Oliveira on his gold-winning performance, but claimed that athletes with longer blades had an unfair advantage . The restrictions on blade lengths are . worked out by taking two measurements from an athlete’s body and then . putting them into a formula that illustrates what that person’s height . would be if they were not disabled. What had so amazed Pistorius was that . Oliveira was losing by eight metres in the home straight but was able to . run him down. Stunned by the weight of criticism, Oliveira said he was . sad because Pistorius was his ‘idol’ and he said he believed he had . known his blades passed all the accepted tests. ‘He is not a bad loser,’ Oliveira . insisted. ‘He is a great athlete. I am just sad with the interview where . he said my blades were too big. 'He was bothered by my time in the . semi-finals and he wanted to get me with his polemic but it did not . work. For me he is a really great idol and to hear that from a great . idol is difficult.’ Head to head: Alan Oliveira's longer blades made him taller than Pistorius, which the South African said gave him an advantage in the race .

A blind man has died after being given the wrong prescription at a Boots pharmacy, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Douglas Lamond, 86, did not realise he had been handed someone else's medication after collecting the drugs at a branch of the chemist in May. After complaining of feeling unwell, the grandfather was taken to a hospital  accident and emergency department where he later died. Police have since launched an investigation into Mr Lamond's death after being called in by hospital staff. Boots, . which has sent a message of  condolence to his family, has refused to . reveal which branch mixed up the prescriptions or which drugs were . involved. Extra safeguards have been put in place at the pharmacist's branches to ensure the mistake is not repeated. It is believed Mr Lamond began to  feel ill on a weekend in May and was taken to A&E at Ipswich Hospital. However, his condition worsened and he died on Saturday, May 12. Following an inconclusive post-mortem examination, an inquest was opened  and adjourned after the coroner ordered toxicology tests. Police are treating the case as an  unexplained death, and cannot determine whether the wrong drugs were a factor. Mr Lamond's daughter, Dianne Moore,  a nurse, and her IT consultant husband  Thomas, both 58, who live about 18 miles away in Hintlesham, Ipswich, are said to be very distressed over his death. The couple, who have two children, Ben, 28, and 26-year-old Alissa, declined to  comment last week. A statement from Suffolk Police said:  'We were contacted by Ipswich Hospital  at around 6.15pm on Saturday, May 12 with a report that an 86-year-old man from the Felixstowe area had been admitted to  accident and emergency feeling unwell and had subsequently died. 'His next of kin had been informed. The gentleman's death, at this stage, is being treated as unexplained. A post-mortem examination took place on Monday, May 14. The cause of death was unascertained and further toxicology tests are ongoing. Pharmacist Boots has refused to reveal from which branch the mix up with the prescription happened . 'As well as awaiting the toxicology  results, officers are carrying out inquiries to try to establish the circumstances  surrounding the man's death. The matter has been referred to the coroner. 'Initial inquiries would suggest Mr Lamond had been given an incorrect prescription from his pharmacy. However, it has not been established whether the medication Mr Lamond took led to his death. 'This will not be established until the pathologist has received the full toxicology report. Corrective procedures have been introduced at the pharmacy concerned to ensure the correct prescriptions are given to the correct person.' A statement from Boots UK said: 'Our thoughts are with Douglas Lamond's  family. We are not in a position to comment as the police investigation is ongoing.' Mr Lamond was born in Scotland but lived for most of his life in Felixstowe,  Suffolk, where he worked as an import clerk at Britain's biggest container port. His first wife Jean died in 1982, and he remarried five years later. Second wife Cynthia died after a long illness in 2009. A . neighbour said of Mr Lamond – who was also known as 'Dougie': 'He was . always cheerful, even though he could see very little and always wore . dark glasses. 'Even at his . advanced age his death was a  shock, and the long gap between his death . and the cremation did make me think  something wasn't right.' Pharmacist Boots has refused to reveal from which branch the mix up with the prescription happened . A death announcement in a local  newspaper from his family described Mr Lamond as 'an endearing man who will be missed by all who knew him'. He is believed to have been a member of the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club, where refreshments were served after his funeral and cremation on July 27. A spokesman for Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust declined to comment. Steve Winyard, of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: 'While  we cannot comment on the particular  circumstances of this case, RNIB's Losing Patients campaign has been calling on  the NHS and other healthcare providers to end the practice of giving blind and  partially sighted people their health  information in ordinary print. 'Pharmacy systems should be improved to provide prescription labelling and dosage instructions automatically in large print or Braille. Everyone has the right to manage their own health affairs, whether they have a sight problem or not.'","Douglas Lamond did not realise he had been handed someone else's drugs .

A thug killed a member of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing production team with a single punch before boasting: 'I've just smashed someone up,’ a court heard today. Ben Worden attacked lighting expert Paul Gunner, who had been celebrating his 32nd birthday, outside a kebab shop after 'taking exception' when Mr Gunner knocked on the window, a jury was told. In an act of 'thuggish behaviour that had the most tragic consequences,' Mr Gunner died after cracking his head on the pavement when Worden delivered the fatal blow, the court heard. Lighting expert Paul Gunner had been celebrating his 32nd birthday when he was attacked outside a kebab shop in Bexley, south east London . The jury was told Worden, 33, and two pals then ran off leaving his victim for dead, and bragged to some girls: 'I've just beaten someone up. Look at my knuckles!' Mr Gunner, who also worked on BBC2 pop music quiz show Never Mind The Buzzcocks, never regained consciousness after the incident in Bexley, south east London, and was pronounced dead an hour later. Worden handed himself into a police station the next day, but claimed it was a friend who attacked Mr Gunner. Timothy Cray, prosecuting, told Inner London Crown Court: 'We suggest all the evidence will show that this defendant murdered a man he didn’t even know during an unnecessary attack. 'This wasn’t a fight, it was a beating, putting a man down who was effectively defenceless. 'Although he may regret it now, in the seconds that mattered, this defendant, in drink and anger, intended to hurt Paul Gunner and hurt him badly, and that is exactly what he did.' CCTV pictures in the Bexley Charcoal Grill kebab shop shop shortly before Paul Gunner was attacked . Mr Cray added: 'Shortly before 1am in the early hours of Sunday October 16, 2011, this defendant, Ben Worden, was coming to the end of a long night's drinking in Bexley Village. 'He was at the local kebab shop when, for the first and only time in his life, he came across Paul Gunner, a 32-year-old man who had also been out in Bexley. 'Saturday October 15 was Mr Gunner’s birthday and he had spent the evening with his brother Michael and a group of his friends celebrating. 'Up to that point there is no suggestion that Mr Gunner or anyone else in his group had caused any trouble or done anything to draw attention to themselves. The parents of Paul Gunner, Peter and Andrea, at Inner London Crown Court as they attended the trial of Ben Worden . 'Paul Gunner had already got his takeaway. He began to knock on the window of the restaurant to tell his brother where he was or to hurry up. The defendant decided to take exception to Mr Gunner and spoke to him about banging on the window. 'A brief argument then developed between them which almost unbelievably led to the defendant attacking and killing Paul Gunner, who was a complete stranger to him.' The prosecutor said witnesses saw Worden land 'heavy blows' on Mr Gunner at least twice outside Bexley Charcoal Grill kebab shop. He continued: 'The first punch knocked Mr Gunner to the ground. The defendant then walked away across the road and at that moment in time, he had more than taken care of himself. In fact he was telling Mr Gunner to sit down meaning, ""stay down"". 'Unfortunately Mr Gunner, who was now dazed, got himself up and started to follow the defendant. 'Rather than just ignore Mr Gunner or walk away and leave the scene, this defendant decided to hit him again. 'In the second part of the attack he delivered a punch that was hard enough to knock Mr Gunner out cold and cause terrible head injuries as he went back, his head cracking against the road surface. 'Despite emergency medical attention, Mr Gunner never came round and he was pronounced dead just over an hour later at 2.26am.' Mr Cray told the court Worden could have easily walked away rather than hitting Mr Gunner a second time. He said: 'Despite having laid out Mr Gunner, including seeing and hearing his head hit the pavement, he made no attempt to stay and help the injured man. Instead, he fled from the scene with two friends who he had been drinking with that evening. 'Far from showing concern or remorse, his attitude moments afterwards was to boast about what he had done. 'He was pleased with himself. Once he had got away from the immediate vicinity, he saw some girls and said something like, ""Alright girls, I've just smashed someone up- or beaten someone up- look at my knuckles"". 'He held up the hand he had used to kill Paul Gunner. 'In all, his actions amounted to thuggish behaviour, random street violence that had the most tragic consequences.' Worden, of Welling, south east London, denies murder. The trial continues.

Lord Lucan drowned himself in a small boat he scuppered in English Channel just a few hours after Sandra Rivett's grisly murder, his son has claimed today. George Bingham, 45, believes his father took his own life in the Channel's icy waters after guzzling whisky and sleeping pills because he wanted to 'vanish forever'. He is certain that his father was worried he was being framed for the nanny's brutal killing on November 7, 1974, and ended his life to protect his family. Haunted by his past: Lord Lucan's son George, . pictured a few years ago, left, and with his father before his . disappearance in 1974, has spoken for the first time about what he . thinks may have happened to him . Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord Lucan's children, was found dead in Belgravia, London, in November 1974 . Mr Bingham, who was seven at the time . of the murder, dismisses claims the 7th Earl of Lucan fled to Africa, . believing instead that his father committed suicide before dawn lifted . the following morning. 'If you’re going to find him anywhere, it’s going to be the bottom of the English Channel,' Mr Bingham told the Mirror. Lucan disappeared after 29-year-old . Miss Rivett, his children's nanny, was bludgeoned to death and his wife . Veronica battered around the head at their home in Belgravia, Central . London. Since the killing and the aristocrat's . disappearance, detectives have developed a theory that Lucan killed . Miss Rivett by mistake, believing she was his wife with whom he was . embroiled in divorce proceedings. After the nanny was killed and Lady Lucan attacked, Lucan fled in a Ford Corsair borrowed from one of his gambling friends. It was found abandoned at Newhaven on . the Sussex coast. There were bloodstains on the front seat and a length . of lead piping, wrapped in bandages, in the boot. That pipe matched a . similar weapon found at the murder scene. Friends and family of Lucan have said . the missing Earl probably jumped from a ferry of some cliffs. Others . have speculated that he fled the country and lived as a fugitive, with . many suggesting he chose to move to South Africa to avoid justice. But Mr Bingham has a different version of events which he claims to know is true. Vanished: Police believed Lord Lucan, left, killed Sandra Rivett, right, after mistaking her for his wife Veronica . Mystery: Lord Lucan, is believed to have killed the family nanny, and attacked his then-wife, Veronica, pictured . On his way to the coast, Lucan had . stopped in the dead of night at Susan Maxwell-Scott's house, to ask his . friend for some sleeping pills. Mr Bingham believes his father, a keen . sailor, would have then made for a small motor boat somewhere in . Newhaven harbour to which he had access. 'He would have got on board with a . bottle of whisky and some pills and taken it out to the 50 metre mark, . the point where if you go down you’re not going to come back up again, . but not so far out that you are in the shipping lane,' Mr Bingham told . the Mirror. 'As the pills kicked in, he would have opened up the bottom of the boat and let the water in.' Mr Bingham believes his father would . have been unconscious by the time the boat began to sink. He believes . hypothermia would have overcome the aristocrat before water even reached . his lungs. A coroner, in the absence of the prime . suspect, declared in 1975 that Lucan had indeed killed Miss Rivett. Mr . Bingham believes his father did not murder the pretty nanny, but added . that he hoped he was partly culpable because it would make his . disappearance easier to cope with. Lady Veronica Lucan, left, pictured in London 1994 and right, at the coroner's inquest in 1975 . Mr Bingham believes that his father would . not have absconded, leaving his children (which included sisters . Camilla and Frances) behind without real reason. And that's why he hopes . his father did have some part to play in that tragic night's events. The graphic nature of the killing and . in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene, leads . Bingham to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder, . yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them. He does, however, disagree with the . version of events according to his mother, with whom he no longer has . contact with, believing that the state of her relationship with Lucan at . the time clouded her details of fact. Lucan left two letters behind . addressed to his brother in law William Shand Kydd, written on the night . of the murder. In these letters the tone is clear that he was not to . return, giving details of his banking details and estate. The second letter, in particular, is . most interesting. In it, he refers to a 'fight' he broke up at the . property, and that a man left following the assaults. Mr Bingham told the Mirror he hopes . that what his father wrote in the second letter was actually false and . that his father was, in some way, involved. No matter what his father's . involvement, Mr Bingham says it is beyond doubt that his father killed . himself and tells of his frustration that some still suggest he is alive . and in Africa.","George Bingham says he is certain his father killed himself just hours after the death of his nanny Sandra Rivett at the family home in Belgravia, London .

A furious member of O J Simpson's legal team has reacted angrily to claims that the lead defence attorney in his murder trial case tampered with a key piece of evidence, a glove, helping him to walk away a free man. Alan Dershowitz responded with outrage to the allegations made by former assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden on Thursday, when he accused the late Johnnie Cochran of 'manipulating' one of the infamous gloves that the prosecution claimed linked him to murder. On Friday, Dershowitz called the claim 'a total fabrication' adding that the defence would never have had access to a piece of evidence outside of the courtroom. 'Having made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th century,' Dershowitz said of Darden, speaking to NBC News. 'He's trying to blame it on the dead man.' Scroll down for videos . Alan Dershowitz (left) responded with outrage to the allegations made by former assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden (right) Trial run: In the sensational 1995 murder trial, O.J. Simpson tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Darden's shock at the allegations was echoed by fellow attorney Shawn Holley in an email to the Los Angeles Times. 'As members of the defense team, Carl . Douglas and I were present in court on the day that Chris Darden asked . O.J. Simpson to try on the glove,' she wrote. 'Mr Darden's self-serving assertion that Johnnie Cochran tampered with the glove or any piece of evidence is false, malicious and slanderous,' said Shawn Holley (pictured) 'Mr Darden's self-serving assertion . that Johnnie Cochran tampered with the glove or any piece of evidence is . false, malicious and slanderous. 'Almost 20 years later, it seems Mr . Darden is still trying to exculpate himself from one of the biggest . blunders in the history of jurisprudence.' Nearly seventeen years ago, former NFL star and actor O.J. Simpson was shockingly acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. After 'The Juice' struggled to fit . the gloves on his hands – in one of the defining moments of the racially . charged trial that captivated the nation – Cochran famously admonished . the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.' On Thursday Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden made his allegations of tampering during a panel discussion about the trial at Pace Law School in New York City. 'I think Johnnie tore the lining,' he declared. 'There were some additional tears in the lining so that O.J.'s fingers couldn't go all the way up into the glove.' Darden said in a follow-up interview . on Friday that he noticed that when Simpson was trying on a glove for . the jury its structure appeared to have changed. 'A bailiff told me the defence had it during the lunch hour.' He said . he wasn't specifically accusing anyone, adding: 'It's been my suspicion . for a long time that the lining has been manipulated.' He said he had previously voiced similar concerns in TV interviews, but could not recall the details.Darden's incendiary charge surprised key participants in the trial and related legal action. Evidence: The glove that was found at OJ Simpson's home, left, and right, the first page of a four-page letter written by Simpson concerning charges against him . Bucking bronco: In 1994, Simpson led police officers on a 90-minute slow-speed chase in his white Ford Bronco, driven by Al Cowlings . Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a member of Simpson's . defence team, and Paul Callan, who represented Nicole Brown Simpson's . estate in a successful civil trial against Simpson, said it was the . first time they had ever heard the allegation. On . Friday, Dershowitz called the claim that the defence had an opportunity . to tamper with the gloves 'a total fabrication' and said 'the defence . doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.' 'Having . made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th Century,' Dershowitz said . of Darden, 'he's trying to blame it on the dead man.' Darden's remarks came after . Dershowitz, a fellow panellist, called Darden's decision to have Simpson . try on the glove for the first time before the jury 'the most stupid . thing' a prosecutor could have done. Dershowitz . said that if Darden had evidence that there had been tampering, he . would have had an ethical obligation to report the alleged misconduct. He also questioned why Darden hadn't filed a grievance with the state bar association. Darden . responded by saying that this would have been a 'whiny-little-snitch . approach to life' and that was not what he believed in because it didn't . change anything.

Cochran died in 2005 from a brain tumour at age 67. Simpson was acquitted in the double murder case despite what prosecutors described as a 'mountain of evidence' against him. The evidence included a blood-soaked glove found on Simpson's estate and a matching one found at the scene of the murder. Questions about the lining of the gloves emerged during the 1995 trial, but they did not involve allegations of tampering by defence lawyers. Two other members of Simpson's defence team, Robert Shapiro and Barry Scheck, did not return calls for comment. Robert Kardashian and F. Lee Bailey, who also represented Simpson, are both deceased. A civil jury in 1997 found Simpson liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5million in damages to the murder victims' families.

Futuristic technology inspired by the Tom Cruise hit film Minority Report is to be used by one police force to predict where future crimes will take place. West Midlands Police is the first in the UK to use the ‘predictive policing’ method to stop house or flat burglaries before they happen in Birmingham. Their new software system maps crimes and calculates where the next burglary will probably happen, allowing them to send officers to that area of the city. Scroll down for video . Film-inspired: West Midlands Police will use a high-tech computer programme to predict crime - a theory tested in the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report . Theory: Police staff at their Birmingham HQ, pictured, are using the system, which looks at where crimes have happened and predicts what streets officers should patrol . Official statistics reveal if a property is burgled once there is a . 30 per cent chance it will be raided again within the next week. Neighbouring . properties are also at an increased risk of being struck within seven . days of a house burglary as criminals view the area as a 'weak spot'. Using this theory the force says it can stop crime before it happens - just like in the thriller Minority Report which saw a team of futuristic cops chasing and punishing offenders before they committed a crime. Expert: Officer Alex Murray says this software mixed with every day policing will prevent crimes happening . Prof Shane Johnson, who helped design . the software, said: 'We run it through our software and this generates . predictions and a map showing the exact locations where crimes are most . likely to take place in the next few days. 'They can be used by the police to deploy the resources as efficiently as possible.' Supt Alex Murray, the officer in . charge of Operation Swordfish, added: 'I think the majority of our . successes will be around hunch, intuition and offender management. 'But we still need to get out there and try to deter crime taking place in the first place. 'We think probably this is the best . way of doing that, but the whole thing with an experiment is you don’t . know until you analyse it afterwards.' The trial of the software, called Operation Swordfish, has been designed to identify and interpret crime patterns in order to prevent further similar offences. Police patrols will be stepped up in areas of Birmingham which are highlighted by the programme in a bid to catch repeat offenders. Businesses and properties which have been burgled will also be fitted with additional security alarms and cameras. Officers say nearly 30 per cent of the 8,000 burglaries in Birmingham in 2011 were repeat offences which were committed in close proximity to earlier break-ins. In order to test ‘predictive policing’, half the city will be policed in the traditional way while the other half will use the computer programme. Plot: Tom Cruise's pre-crime department in Minority Report uses a system that allows them to see into the future and see crime happen in advance . Idea: Pre-cogs like this one, played by Samantha Morton, see into the future but the system turns out to be flawed . The force is working alongside the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science at UCL in London. Crime stats will be fed into the computer at Stechford Police station in Birmingham where the teams can add data and decide where resources are concentrated. West Midlands Police is in the process of cutting 2,000 staff as a result of budget cuts. The six-month pilot in the West Midlands is most extensive trial of predictive policing to date and is being part-funded by the Home Office. Previous trials have taken place in the suburbs of Los Angeles in the US, where early results have been described as 'promising'.","West Midlands Police will use software that plots crime and predicts probability of it happening again .

Six years after entering the NFL as the third player taken in the draft, Vince Young finds himself without a team and with just a fraction of the money he received from a contract that guaranteed him $26million. The question is, where did it all go? In an increasingly caustic war of words, attorneys have been arguing for months over whether Young is an out-of-control spender who put himself deeply in the hole or simply a victim of inexperienced advisers, one of whom was his own uncle. Fall from grace: After entering the NFL in 2006 as a top draft pick, Vince Young finds himself without a team and with only a fraction of the money he received from a $26million contract . Either way, the quarterback whose future seemed unlimited after he led Texas to a Rose Bowl victory in 2006 is now back home in Houston and in a tenuous financial condition. 'I would just say that Vince needs a job,' said Trey Dolezal, Young's attorney, when asked to give a general assessment of his client's finances. Young was cut by the Buffalo Bills, his third NFL team, in August. He was trying to make the Bills as a backup, the same role he filled with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011. The fall has been a dizzying one for the player who twice made the Pro Bowl with the Tennessee Titans. Standout: Young was the third pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, when he latched on with the Tennessee Titans . Out of cash: Young is broke, despite a contract that guaranteed him $26million . Young sent out a tweet thanking the Bills and their fans after he was released but hasn't spoken to the media since. He declined a request to be interviewed for this story. Even in pro sports, where tales of squandered wealth abound, Young's plight is 'pretty dramatic,' said Kenneth Shropshire, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who has written and lectured extensively on the business of sports. 'You'd think it would be hard to blow that much money,' Shropshire said. Young is suing his former agent, Major . Adams, and a North Carolina financial planner, Ronnie Peoples, alleging . that they misappropriated $5.5million. Cut: Young was trying out for a back-up quarterback job with the Buffalo Bills, but he was released in August . In some instances, the pair forged his signature or impersonated him on the phone or in emails, according to the lawsuit, filed in Houston in June. The suit was filed five days after a New York lender notified Young that a loan of nearly $1.9million obtained in his name during the NFL lockout in 2011 was in default. Young is now seeking to stop the lender, Pro Player Funding LLC, from enforcing a judgment of nearly $1.7million, claiming he wasn't involved in obtaining the loan and that the proceeds went to Adams and Peoples. 'They conspired to take Vince's money,' Dolezal said. 'It's that simple.' Young was the first client of a company, (hash)1 Next Level Sports and Entertainment Inc., formed by Adams, a Houston criminal defense attorney, and the quarterback's uncle, Keith Young, a former middle school teacher. Young's problem was 'he was just very young ... and allowing these people to have too much control over his life and his name,' Dolezal said. That notion is vigorously disputed by attorneys for Adams and Peoples, who say Young has nobody to blame but himself. 'This is a person scrambling helplessly and pointing in all directions to blame others to get out of debt,' said Charles Peckham, Adams' attorney. Adams twice wrote checks to himself from Young's accounts, but both times were out of necessity, including once when the agent was required to use personal funds to charter a plane for the quarterback after he missed a team flight, Peckham said. Peoples has filed a countersuit in which he castigates Young for allowing his uncle to serve as his business manager despite having no expertise in that field. Peoples claims in the countersuit that every decision he made was approved by Keith Young. Disappointment: It is not known whether Young lost his funding with frivolous spending, or whether he fell victim to inexperienced advisers - one of whom was his own uncle . And he calls Vince Young's unwillingness to accept responsibility 'a common occurrence ... as (former Titans coach) Jeff Fisher, (Texas coach) Mack Brown, numerous NFL executives, coaches, teammates, scouts, girlfriends and illegitimate children will attest.' Peoples' attorney, David Chaumette, said he has documents to support the strongly-worded filing. 'You'll find there was a lot of money being spent in a bunch of different directions,' Chaumette said. A working phone number for Keith Young could not be located. Court records do not show that he has an attorney. According to public records, Vince Young was one of at least 10 NFL players who turned to Pro Player Funding for cash during the lockout. Second-in-command: Young served as a back-up quarterback to Michael Vick in the 2011 season with the Philadelphia Eagles . Loan documents show he borrowed the $1.9million at 20 per cent interest, with $619,122 in interest paid up front, and agreed that a judgment could be entered if he missed a payment. Young authorized $1million in payments to Pro Player directly from his Eagles salary during the 2011 season, and his accountant was working this year to have a similar arrangement with the Bills, according to court records. However, when a payment due in May was never made, the loan went into default. In challenging the loan's validity, Young claims he didn't 'knowingly execute' any of the loan documents. Anything he signed was 'without the corresponding documents attached and without knowledge as to what the signatures pages referred,' one of his court filings states. Pro Player says its case is supported by the fact that Young's signatures were notarized and that emails show he was involved in making sure the lender received repayment directly from the Eagles. 'Call me if this is not 100 per cent clear,' Young's accountant wrote him in August 2011 in an email explaining the arrangement. 'We want to make certain you know exactly what is going on at all times, especially when you're signing your name to something.' Young also contends that Pro Player's efforts to serve him and the Bills with legal papers during training camp, which included a threat to contact the local sheriff, 'played a role' in the Bills' decision to release him. 'I wasn't in the room when they [the Bills] made a decision, but what would you think? It certainly wouldn't help me if I'm the owner or the head coach knowing all this is going on with Vince and then he goes out and plays poorly,' Dolezal said. Bills coach Chan Gailey declined comment when asked if Young's off-the-field issues had anything to do with his release.","Was the third player picked in 2006 NFL Draft .

"By . James Slack and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:39 EST, 19 September 2012 . New Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy . Life will be made harder for criminals . in and out of prison to rebuild shattered public confidence in the . justice system, Chris Grayling pledges today. In his first newspaper interview as . the new Justice Secretary, he issues an extraordinary indictment of his . predecessor Kenneth Clarke’s record, admitting voters do not believe . justice is being done in many cases. He said he would make sure jails – . dubbed ‘holiday camps’ by critics – are no longer seen as places which . convicts ‘enjoy’, while toughening up community punishments to help . rehabilitate less serious offenders. Mr Grayling, whose appointment in . David Cameron’s Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month has cheered the . Tory Right, echoed former Tory Home Secretary Michael Howard’s famous . declaration that ‘prison works’. In a deliberate break from Mr Clarke’s liberal stance, he declared: ‘I want to be a tough Justice Secretary.’ In a wide-ranging interview, he signalled: . Mr Grayling, who replaced Mr Clarke . two weeks ago, was brutal in his assessment of the state of the criminal . justice system, suggesting it should always operate as it did following . last summer’s riots – when offenders were dealt with in record time and . punished severely. Ken Clarke had promised to cut prison numbers when he was Justice Secretary . The minister distanced himself from a . number of Mr Clarke’s policies, which aimed to slash the number of . inmates, as the justice department struggles to make savings of . £2billion. Mr Grayling said: ‘I’m bringing a . fresh pair of eyes to the job. I’m very mindful of the need to have a . criminal justice system in which people have confidence. I think they . very often don’t have confidence in it.’ However, he was unflinching in his . commitment to Mr Clarke’s ‘rehabilitation revolution’, saying inmates . should be both educated and employed while inside. He said far too many freed criminals . were ending up reoffending, and suggested paying private firms ‘by . results’ to help them find jobs. But he delivered a clear statement that ‘prison works’ – something Mr Clarke stubbornly refused to do. Mr Grayling, a former Shadow Home . Secretary, said: ‘Prison is really important. People who commit serious . offences should go to prison. But I think prison shouldn’t just be about . deterrent. Prison should also turn people round so they don’t keep . offending again and again. ‘In very many cases, yes, prison does . work. I don’t think it works well enough. It provides public protection. It’s important to take serious criminals off the street.’ He said he wanted a tougher regime for . those in custody amid complaints that jails have become too soft, with . some convicts even having satellite TV in their cells. Mr Grayling warned: ‘Prison is not . meant to be a place that people enjoy being in. I don’t [want to] see . prisoners in this country sitting in cells watching the Sunday afternoon . match on Sky Sports.’ He added: ‘Am I planning to reduce the . number of prison places? No I’m not. I do not want to set a target to . reduce the prison population. What I do want to do is bring down the . cost of prison. The whole philosophy I will bring to the department is . getting more for less.’ Prisoners on a recreation period at Aylesbury Young Offenders Institution: Mr Grayling says he would make sure jails are no longer places prisoners 'enjoy' He also vowed to tackle the use of mobile phones, which are banned inside prison but widely used, with 800 seized every month. Mr Grayling said it was vital to bring . an end to what he called social media stalking of victims, adding: . ‘It’s completely unacceptable. I’ve talked to victims of crime who are . effectively being stalked by the person who attacked them. ‘It is the case that mobile phones are . smuggled into prisons. We have powers to take tough action on that . front, blocking signals, other ways of clamping down on it.’ Mr Grayling also addressed repeated . criticism that community punishments are too soft. He said: ‘I want to . make sure sentences in the community have bite to them. I am not opposed . to punishments taking place outside of prison, but I want to make sure . they really are punishment and not a diversion. ‘It needs to incorporate a  punitive element.’ We can no longer duck making a decision over giving prisoners the vote, Mr Grayling  warned. The minister said he was ‘profoundly unhappy’ that Strasbourg judges had ordered the UK to let convicts take part in elections on human rights grounds. He also criticised the way human rights law had moved ‘way, way away’ from the original intentions of those who drafted the European Convention on Human Rights. But he conceded no significant change was likely while the pro-Europe Lib Dems remained part of the Government. Successive governments have delayed implementing the prisoner votes ruling, which dates back seven years. The Lib Dems are in favour of criminals voting while Tory MPs are ferociously opposed. Mr Grayling indicated there are likely to be heated discussions over the issue. But he said: ‘We are going to have to take some decisions. I’m not aware of any means of delaying.’ His job is to produce concrete proposals for the next Tory manifesto. This could include replacing Labour’s Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights. Teenage knife thugs could face mandatory jail terms after Mr Grayling ordered an immediate review of the law. And he could further strengthen homeowners’ rights to defend themselves against burglars. Both moves will be welcomed by Tory MPs, who have clamoured for tougher sentencing, but would face Lib Dem opposition. The Conservatives were elected on a manifesto promise that anybody guilty of a knife crime should expect a prison sentence. But, in a controversial move, then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke watered down the commitment. Currently, four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to prison. Mr Grayling said: ‘This is an  area where I continue to have concerns. I am prepared to take action if I need to.’ He also pledged to look again at how best to protect those who come face-to-face with an intruder. Mr Grayling said: ‘I have been very clear in saying that I believe householders need to be properly protected by the law if they are defending their homes against intruders.’","Chris Grayling seeks to distance himself from unpopular predecessor Kenneth Clarke .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 09:51 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:44 EST, 20 September 2012 . A footballer who posted a homophobic message about Tom Daley and his Olympic diving partner Peter Waterfield will not face the courts. The message sent by Daniel Thomas, who plays for Port Talbot in Wales, was 'not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought', Keir Starmer the Director of Public Prosecutions said today. The offensive tweet, which was deleted, appeared online after Daley, 18, and Waterfield, finished fourth in the 10m synchronised dive this summer. Troll: Great Britain's medal winner Tom Daley was abused by a Welsh Premier League footballer - but he will not face any charges . Investigation: No charges were brought because the tweet was not 'grossly offensive' and Tom Daley (pictured) was not meant to see it . It came as a man, 22, was arrested for . setting up an offensive Facebook page relating to the murder of two . Manchester policewomen on Tuesday, where he called suspect Dale Cregan a . 'legend'. Mr Starmer said that Thomas had expressed . remorse and taken 'reasonably swift action' to remove the message and . that because human rights law also gave people the right to 'offend, . shock and disturb' others prosecution was not appropriate. Policy: Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, announced the decision and also new guidelines to frame social media prosecutions . It was only meant to be seen by the Port Talbot Town's friends and family, and was not sent directly to the divers. Mr Starmer added: 'This was, in essence, a one-off offensive Twitter message, intended for family and friends, which made its way into the public domain. 'It was not intended to reach Mr Daley or Mr Waterfield, it was not part of a campaign, it was not intended to incite others and Mr Thomas removed it reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse. Against that background,  it was not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought.' Thomas was suspended by Port Talbot Town but is now playing for them again. The announcement — which is likely to be welcomed by civil liberties campaigners — came as Mr Starmer announced new legal guidelines are to be drawn up over when charges will be brought over abuse on Twitter and other social media sites. He said he planned to set a 'high threshold' for launching criminal action against people who post offensive tweets in recognition of the 'spontaneous' way in which people used social media. Mr Starmer said he wanted to consult the public before drawing up the  guidelines, which were needed because of the 'clear difference' between the way that people used social media sites and other forms of communication and because of the vast number of messages posted 'instantaneously' that reached millions of people when they were only intended to be read by a few. The DPP warned that criminal action would still be needed to 'prosecute serious wrongdoing' in any future cases involving “sustained harassment” or the posting of 'grossly offensive or threatening remarks' on Twitter or other social media sites. But he wanted to ensure that the 'fundamental right to free speech' was respected. Shocking: Diving star Tom Daley reacts angrily after he was sent an abusive tweet following his disappointment at missing out on a medal . Abuse: This shows the original Tweet which was sent to Tom Daley by Reece Messer . He added: 'The CPS has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis. That often involves very difficult judgment calls. Reece Messer pictured at 14: His family say he needs help . 'In some cases it is clear that a criminal prosecution is the appropriate response to conduct which is complained about. 'But in many other cases a criminal prosecution will not be the appropriate response. If the fundamental right to free speech is to be respected, the threshold for criminal prosecution has to be a high one.' The DPP said he would now draw up interim guidelines for prosecutors on when charges should, or should not, be brought before holding a 'wide public consultation' ahead of the publication of finalised rules. Police have admitted they are being dragged into too many Twitter disputes as a row raged over the decision to arrest a different youth who abused Olympic diving star Tom Daley. Officers swooped on the home of Reece Messer, 17, at 2.45am last month hours after he told the sports star he had ‘let down’  his late father in the London 2012 synchronised ten metre final. Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the 18-year-old but backtracked and apologised when his messages provoked an online storm. Dorset police handed the troubled teenager a formal harassment warning, police leaders claimed forces are being dragged into too many petty social media rows. Inspiration: Daley's father Rob, left, died in May last year following a long battle with cancer and was a major driving force behind the teenager's success . Officers were asked to look at content 14,000 times on Facebook alone last year and Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers,  said forces do not have the resources to monitor the internet. He said: ‘There is legislation which concerns causing harassment, alarm or distress. But can we police the internet when someone upsets someone else? ‘I don’t think we have the resources to do that. We can’t have a free-for-all online but we cannot involve the police every time something unpleasant is said.’ Since Twitter's huge boom in popularity in Britain there have been a number of cases that have tested the boundaries of the current Communications Act, which polices the online world. No case sums up the flaws in the system more than the now infamous Twitter joke trial where the High Court ruled that telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime. And now just two months on Keir Starmer has moved to try to clarify the law which has left some victims of trolls unprotected and others unfairly targeted by the police and the courts. In the landmark ruling in late July, Lord Judge overturned the conviction of a . frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the . airport. Paul Chambers, 28, . had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he . broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at Robin Hood Airport in . Doncaster took it seriously. The . Crown Prosecution Service took him to court under the 2003 . Communications Act, and Doncaster magistrates told him to pay £600 . costs, a £385 fine and £15 victim surcharge. The conviction in May 2010 . was later upheld by a Crown Court judge. Bu the Lord Chief Justice said a joke could not by definition be . menacing: ‘If the persons who receive and read it, or may reasonably be . expected to receive it, or read it, would brush it aside as a silly . joke, or a joke in bad taste... it would be a contradiction in terms to . describe it as a message of a menacing character.’ The ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers. Mr . Chambers, from Corby, Northamptonshire, lost his job as an . administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become . unemployable because of the prosecution. He . sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in January 2010. It said: . ‘Robin Hood Airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your . s*** together otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’ He . said after the ruling: ‘It’s a very big decision for people doing what . human beings do – telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.’ The . judges noted there was no evidence before the Crown Court to suggest . any of the followers of the 'tweet', or anyone else who may have seen it . posted on Mr Chambers’ timeline, found it to be of a menacing character . or, at a time when the threat of terrorism was real, even minimally . alarming.","Daniel Thomas' message on Twitter was not grossly offensive, CPS boss Keir Starmer said today .

For drivers planning to embark on a journey across snowy terrain, this quirky looking vehicle might seem an unlikely mode of transport. But back in 1925, this Model T Ford with a crude set of bright blue skis and chains attached was at the forefront of winter travel. It was in 1913 that madcap U.S. inventor Virgil D White hit upon the idea of the 'Snow Flyer' kits, which - when attached to a Model T - transformed the popular motor car into the world's first snowmobile. Crude but effective: A Ford Model T motor car fitted with the 'Snow Flyer' kit - a forerunner of modern snowmobiles . The inventor sold his kits for around $400 almost a century ago, and now this 1925 example is expected to fetch upwards of £10,000 when it goes under the hammer in Pennsylvania, U.S., next month. At the time the kits - which consisted of skis made of metal and wood and rear-mounted chain link tracks -were particularly popular with country doctors, who used them to battle the elements when visiting patients in rural areas in winter months. Relics of winter travel: The chain links were fitted over the wheels of Model T cars . Engine power: Makers of the Snow Flyer kit claimed they enabled vehicles to travel over unbroken snow at a speed of 18mph . Today the souped-up cars are equally in demand among collectors, and there is even a Ford T snowmobile owners' club. A spokesman from the club said: 'The . snowmobile became an indispensable convenience for the person requiring . rapid, dependable transport in all kinds of weather. 'Country doctors and rural mail carriers were the largest users of this type of vehicle.' The spokesman said other customers . included public utility companies, lumber firms, travelling salesmen, . fire departments, taxi drivers, grocers, milkmen and undertakers. 'When the father of President Calvin . Coolidge died on March 18, 1926, a Model T Snowmobile led the Coolidge . funeral procession over the snow-covered hills of Vermont,' he added. Despite their popularity, demand for Virgil D White's kits faded with the introduction of the snowplough, and the inventor eventually sold his firm. The kits remained in production up until World War II. 'Makers of the attachment . claimed the ability to travel over two and a half feet of unbroken snow . at an average speed of 18 miles per hour,' the club spokesman said. 'Those who had a snowmobile certainly used it with great satisfaction.'

And that's exactly what Twiglet the Shetland pony is doing after his owner decided to give him free run of the flowerbeds and luscious lawns of Forde Abbey, near Chard in Somerset. The 46-year-old animal - who is thought to be the oldest Shetland pony in Britain - was feared to be on his last legs before his owner Alice Kennard decided to let him to stretch his legs in the grounds of the historic former monastery. Veteran: Twiglet (pictured here in the grounds of Forde Abbey, Somerset, with owner Alice Kennard's seven-year-old daughter Marcia) could be the oldest Shetland pony in Britain . Loved: The pony (pictured here being ridden by Marcia and led by four-year-old Amelie, right) was born in 1966 - the year England won the football World Cup. He has been used to teach dozens of children to ride since then . Loved: Twiglet has become a popular figure with visitors to Forde Abbey, in Somerset (pictured here again with Amelie, left, and Marcia, right) Twiglet, who was born in 1966 - the year England won the football World Cup - has rallied after being given the run of . the estate. The 46-year-old - who is way past the average life expectancy for his breed - was literally wasting away as age took its toll and was losing weight so fast owner Mrs . Kennard feared he would not live to see another autumn. But the pony has flourished since Ms Kennard decided to allow him to feast on the lush grass and choice border . flowers in the Abbey's grounds and gardens. Thriving: The pony (again pictured here with Amelie, front, and Marcia, riding him) has flourished since his owners allowed him to roam free in the Abbey's grounds . Since making a recovery and putting back on the lost pounds he has become a firm favourite with visitors to the 12th Century monastery which was once lived in by monks. Mrs Kennard, whose family have owned the estate for the last 70 years, said: 'We pride ourselves on our gardens and normally they would be sacrosanct but we had to do something for Twiglet. 'We felt a few hoof prints on the grass or a few nibbled plants would be worth it for his sake,' she said. 'He’s been such a big part of our lives since we took him in when his former owner died.' Mrs Kennard said all of her children have learned to ride on Twiglet who she said is 'gorgeous, like a big dog really.' 'At first, we had some well meaning visitors who kept reporting there was an escaped pony in the gardens,' she said. 'We reassured them he had deliberately been turned out and why. 'Now, we’ve attached a little notice to a tree stump explaining who he is, how old he is and why he is there.' Mrs Kennard said Twiglet had proved very popular and that people have come back to visit the Abbey and check on his progress. 'I . knew he wouldn’t be able to escape or at least not get far if he did . because he had severe laminitis a few years ago and it’s agonising for . him to put his feet onto the hard drive or road,' she said. 'Grass is just the thing.' New life: Twiglet, pictured here being fed by Amelie, was losing weight before being allowed to stretch his legs in the Abbey's grounds . Affection: The Kennards say that sacrificing the odd flowerbed for Twiglet's happiness has been well worth it (Marcia Kennard is pictured hugging Twiglet in front of the Abbey) Mrs Kennard said the family do not fence Twiglet in, allowing him instead to wander . at will. 'Sometimes there is the odd pile of something for us to clear up,' she said, . ' but it’s a small price to pay and we put it on the flower beds. 'The roses looked particularly good this year.'

Death: Bodies of climbers killed in an avalanche at Mount Manaslu lie covered with numbers at the Tribhuvan University Teaching hospital in Katmandu, Nepal, Monday, Sept. 24, 2012 . Three French climbers and two Germans were transported to hospitals in Katmandu on Sunday. Two Italians were flown there on Monday — Italian climber Silvio Mondinelli, who has climbed the world's 14 highest peaks, and fellow mountaineer Christian Gobbi. Mondinelli said a third Italian climber and their Sherpa guide were sleeping in another tent and both were buried by the avalanche and died. Gobbi said they could not see at first when they looked out of their torn tent because it was pitch dark and they had no light. 'We found someone's boots and put them on,' he said. When . the sun rose an hour later, they saw parts of tents scattered across . the snow, along with people who had been killed or injured. They . said they were able to assist the injured with the help of Sherpa . guides who came up from lower mountain camps. Those who could walk made . their way down to the base camp while those who were injured were picked . up by helicopters.

Airlifted: An unidentified tourist is rescued from the mountain by helicopter after the avalanche in northern Nepal . At least three of the victims were from the French Alps town of Chamonix, a hub for climbers on Mont Blanc and nearby peaks. An avalanche on a route to the summit of Mont Blanc in July killed nine experienced climbers. Two French climbers were still unaccounted for as of Monday afternoon, the French Foreign Ministry said. The rescue effort was called off 'at least for today, probably definitively,' Christian Trommsdorff, president of the French Mountain Guides Syndicate, said on BFM television. 'We all went to sleep with avalanche . transceivers on so I punched my way out of the tent and started . searching. I searched for 10 minutes before I realized I was barefoot in . the snow.

A total of 231 climbers and guides were on the mountain, but not all were at the higher camps hit by the avalanche. Nepal Mountaineering Department chief Balkrishan Ghimire identified the eight recovered bodies as Fabrice Priez, Philippe Lucien Bos, Catherine Marie Andree Richard and Ludovic Paul Nicolas Challeat of France; German Christian Mittermeyer; Italian Alberto Magliano; Spaniard Marti Roirg Gasull; and Nepali Dawa Dorji. Sunday's avalanche came at the start . of Nepal's autumn climbing season, when the end of the monsoon rains . makes weather in the high Himalayas unpredictable. Spring is a more . popular mountaineering season, when hundreds of climbers crowd the . peaks. Mount Manaslu, which . is 8,156 meters (26,760 feet) high, has attracted more climbers recently . because it is considered one of the easier peaks to climb among the . world's tallest mountains. Saved: French survivors Claude Belmas (left) and . Armand Manel (right) were rescued from the mountain and taken to a . clinic in Katmandu in wheelchairs . Survivors: Frenchmen Claude Belmas and Armand Manel give their details at the clinic in Katmandu, Nepal . Nepal has eight of the 14 highest peaks in the world. Climbers have said in recent years that conditions on the mountains have deteriorated and risks of accidents have increased, with some blaming global warming. Avalanches are not very frequent on Mount Manaslu, but in 1972 one struck a team of climbers and killed six Koreans and 10 Nepalese guides. Ang Tshering of the Asian Trekking agency in Katmandu, who has equipped hundreds of expeditions, said low snow levels and the increased number of climbers on Manaslu have made climbing conditions difficult. 'It used to be a low-risk mountain in the past but now that has all changed,' Tshering said, adding that conditions have become more unpredictable.","Disaster happened on Mount Manaslu in the Himalayas of northern Nepal .

The University of California, Davis has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by students who were pepper-sprayed by campus police during a 'Occupy UC Davis' protest at the school last year. 21 current and former students from the Sacramento-area school will receive $30,000 each, according to details of the settlement disclosed on Wednesday. The cash payout comes after a university task force investigated the incident and concluded in April that UC Davis police had violated policy and found that the administration had mishandled their response to the protest. Scroll down for footage of the November 18 protest. Demonstration: Students on November 18, 2011 protested a tuition hike at the public university . Settlement: 21 current and former students from the Sacramento-area school will receive $30,000 each . The payout will settle the suit, filed in February, by students who participated in a demonstration on November 18, 2011 to protest a tuition hike at the public university. Footage of the event, distributed by the school's Aggie TV station, shows students huddled together on a sidewalk and police spraying directly down on the protesters. The gathered press and witnesses chanted 'Shame on you,' as officers sprayed the students. The event was one among many protests nationwide that were staged after the launch of the Occupy Wall Street movement, that kicked off in New York last September. The settlement, totaling $1 million, was approved on September 13, at a closed meeting of the University of California Regents in San Francisco, according to The Sacramento Bee. As part of the agreement, UCD . Chancellor Linda Katehi will also be required to draft a personal, . written apology to each individual impacted by the incident. The students who were hit with the pepper spray will also be eligible to receive support and counseling for 'academic performance issues that allegedly arose' from the clash. A total of $630,000 will be paid directly to the plaintiffs. An additional $100,000 will be paid out to other individuals who were impacted by the pepper spraying incident. A committee will be set up to distribute those funds, with a maximum amount of $20,000 to be distributed per person. The University of California will also cover legal fees for the plaintiffs, totaling $250,000, with an additional $20,000 to be paid to the American Civil Liberties Union, who spearheaded the lawsuit and who will advise the school on policies for handling future protests. 'The university still needs to work to rebuild students’ trust and this settlement is a step in the right direction' 'What we’re trying to achieve for this case is to make sure that the university improves its policies, training and its procedures to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again and that [UC Davis] is an institution that doesn’t just tolerate free speech but realizes the importance of free speech to a university environment and to our political system,' Michael Risher, an attorney for a plaintiff in the suit, told The California Aggie school newspaper in August. UC Davis Police Department (UCDPD) has been undergoing personnel changes in the aftermath of the incident and the findings from the task force, that was headed by former state Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso. A new police chief has since been appointed to oversee the campus force. One plaintiff, Fatima Sbeih, said the incident has provoked fear among the students. 'Since Nov. 18, students have been afraid of the police. The university still needs to work to rebuild students’ trust and this settlement is a step in the right direction,' Sbeih, who has since graduated from the school, said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.

Convicted D.C. sniper Lee Boyd Malvo says in a newspaper interview that seeing the reaction of a victim's husband made him feel like 'scum.' Malvo expresses remorse in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday. The interview is timed with Tuesday's 10th anniversary of the beginning of the deadly spree in the Washington area carried by Malvo and John Allen Muhammad. The pair has been linked to 27 shootings across the country, including 13 attacks in the greater Washington area which left 10 dead. Teen on trial: Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 19 in this picture at the 2003 trial, spoke in a rare public interview in the lead up to the 10th anniversary of the shootings . Malvo tells the Post that the devastated reaction from victim Linda Franklin's husband as he stood next to his wife when she was shot. The image of Ted Franklin's eyes remains seared in Malvo's memory. Lasting impression: Malvo said that he felt like 'scum' after he shot Linda Franklin (pictured) and he saw her husband's reaction . Describing how he felt when he saw the man's face right after the shooting, Malvo says: 'You feel like the worst piece of scum on the planet.' 'Words do not possess the depth in which to fully convey that emotion and what I felt when I saw it,' he told The Washington Post. Mrs Franklin was 47-years-old when she was killed outside a Home Depot in northern Virginia. She was the 11th shooting victim. The sniper-style attacks all but . paralyzed the nation's capital, as people were shot at random while . going about their everyday life - pumping gas, buying groceries, and for . one young boy, as he went to school. The . shooters used a high-powered rifle, firing from the trunk of a modified . Chevy Caprice until they were tracked down at a Maryland rest stop. Malvo . is serving six consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole in . Red Onion state prison in Virginia. Muhammed was killed via lethal . injection in 2009 for his crimes. The shootings were details, . meticulously planned, and far more widespread than initially predicted . as Muhammed and Malvo later admitted that they also had victims in . Louisiana, California, and Texas. 'There . is no feeling. At that point in time, I had been desensitized. I’d been . killing people for months, if not a whole year, day in and day out,' Malvo said in the interview with The Post's Josh White. Impressionable: Malvo said that he has spent the past 10 years distancing himself from the teachings of John Allen Muhammed and reflecting on the way he got involved in the shooting spree . Partners in crime: Malvo (left) said that he was an impressionable, troubled teen when he was taken under the wing of John Allen Muhammed (right) and he claims he was brainwashed . Life in solitary: Malvo spoke at length with the paper, telling of his remorse a decade after the crimes . 'It . got to a point where I’d get in a zone. There was nothing else but . whoever is before me, and anything that comes between me and, as you . would say, the target, I’m either going to destroy, or if it’s too big, . find a way around it. Nothing is going to stop me but death to get that . done.' Now 27-years-old, Malvo's defiant attitude that he showed during initial interviews and the trial have all but disappeared as he reflects on his role in the events. 'I was a monster. If you look up the definition, that’s what a monster is. I was a ghoul. I was a thief. I stole people’s lives. I did someone else’s bidding just because they said so. . . . There is no rhyme or reason or sense.' When asked by the Post what he would say to victims' families, the remorseful Malvo said there's no way to properly convey an apology. Fatal vehicle: The shooters used a high-powered rifle, firing from the trunk of a modified Chevy Caprice until they were tracked down at a Maryland rest stop . Punishments: Muhammed (left) was put to death via lethal injection in 2009 and, because the jury felt that Malvo (right) was brainwashed, he was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences . 'We can never change what happened,' Malvo said. 'There's nothing that I can say except don't allow me and my actions to continue to victimize you for the rest of your life.' He added: 'Don't allow myself or Muhammad to continue to make you a victim for the rest of your life. It isn't worth it.'","Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammed terrorized the greater Washington D.C. area during a three-week shooting spree in 2002 .

A father has defended his 14-year-old daughter after she was suspended for taking ecstasy and swilling vodka in the playground - saying it was the school’s fault for 'not having enough teachers.' Stuart Whincup, 37, vowed to stand by his young daughter Jamie-Leigh who was rushed to hospital on Monday after taking the dangerous cocktail of drugs and alcohol. The unemployed dad-of-five complained that 'somebody must have laced her vodka' after paramedics were called to University Academy Holbeach, in Spalding, Lincolnshire, following reports Jamie-Leigh was hallucinating, and vomiting in the school’s medical room. Defiant: Jamie-Leigh Whincup (left) was rushed to hospital after consuming vodka and ecstasy at school. Her father Stuart Whincup (right) said the school is mainly to blame for having 'too few teachers' to keep an eye on pupils . She was rushed to Boston’s Pilgrim Hospital where tests showed she had alcohol as well as the lethal party drug in her system. Jamie-Leigh - who has since been suspended by the school - admitted drinking alcohol from a Volvic water bottle given to her by a friend, but said her vodka must have been laced with ecstasy. Shockingly, Mr Whincup has defended her actions and pulled his young daughter out of lessons - claiming it is not safe for her to return to the school because of 'peer-pressure.' Mr Whincup, from Whaplode St Catherine, Lincs, said yesterday: 'It’s only partly her fault - since the school merged with another there’s not enough teachers to monitor all the pupils. 'They can’t keep an eye on them all,' he said, 'girls will be girls won’t they? She’s at that age. Blame: The teenager admitted she had been drinking vodka at her school, University Academy Holbeach, Lincolnshire (pictured) 'Its scared her, so hopefully she won’t do it again - but there’s no way we’re sending her back to school after this because we don’t feel she’s safe there any more. 'It’s all down to peer pressure. 'She has been accused of having cannabis before - but never anything like this.' He described what happened to his daughter as 'disgraceful' and claimed the vodka 'must have been spiked.' Mr Whincup and his wife Shirley, 36, were called by concerned teachers at lunchtime on Monday and told that Jamie-Leigh was in the medical room 'off her face on drink and drugs,' he revealed. They were told that another pupil had reported to a teacher that Jamie-Leigh was collapsing everywhere and 'throwing up.' 'She was really out of it,' he said, 'she thought she was in America at one point.' Hospital: Jamie-Leigh (pictured) needed medical treatment after consuming the drink and drugs. She has been suspended by the school following the incident . 'She had been given a water bottle. 'Her other friend said it tasted like alcohol and it was admitted it was - so Jamie tried to show off by drinking some more.' Mr Whincup said it appears the drink had been spiked with ecstasy. 'She was a real mess when we arrived at the hospital,' he said, 'she was hallucinating, babbling, her eyes were rolling, she was shaking and being sick everywhere. She’s OK now though.' University Academy headteacher Steve Baragwanath said Jamie-Lee is currently serving a five-day fixed-term exclusion while he carries out a full investigation. He said: 'The school has a zero tolerance policy on drink and drugs and I will be speaking to the pupils involved to get to the bottom of what happened and will then deal with it appropriately. 'This girl consumed alcohol at lunchtime. She claimed someone had given her a tablet, but although there was evidence of alcohol and, I believe, cannabis, the evidence was inconclusive on other drugs.' Police confirmed they were called to the school on Monday afternoon and said the incident remains open while they speak with the school and Jamie-Leigh to establish the circumstances. A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said: 'If it comes to light that any criminal offences have taken place, the police will progress accordingly. 'Otherwise the incident will be a matter for the school and parents to deal with.'","Stuart Whincup has defended his daughter Jamie-Leigh after she consumed drink and drugs at her school .

Bitter victory: Ruth Pearce got her car back from the clampers, but found an unwelcome surprise in the boot . A woman who won a six-month legal battle against a clamping firm says her car was returned to her - with a dead rat in the boot. Ruth Pearce has accused the company Midway Parks of leaving the animal corpse in her vehicle as an act of revenge after she took the firm to court in a private prosecution. The mother-of-two was so incensed her Volkswagen Golf was towed away from a car park in Moseley, Birmingham, that she refused to pay the £390 fine to release it. Instead, the university lecturer pursued company boss Walton Wilkins, 48, through the criminal courts in a rare private prosecution. The clamper, of Bordesley, Birmingham, appeared before Birmingham magistrates charged with theft of a vehicle and failing to disclose the address of Midway Parks to Mrs Pearce. The charges were eventually dropped following out-of-court negotiations when Wilkins agreed to hand back the car and pay the single mum £200 compensation. However Mrs Pearce, 44, of Kings Heath, made a horrifying discovery when the Volkswagen was returned to her six months after it was towed away. She said: 'My car was beginning to smell and initially I thought someone may have urinated on the back seats, but I finally tracked the smell down to a dead rat under my spare tyre. 'There’s no way a rat could get in there as it is an enclosed space, so I can only assume someone left me a little present.' Mrs Pearce believes the rat (pictured), which was found under her spare tyre, was place there deliebrately. However, this has been denied by the owner of the clamping company . Nasty surprise: Mrs Pearce said she found the rat after noticing a bad smell coming from her car . Wilkins has vehemently denied the allegations, saying: 'The car was in a compound for over six months, right next to the railway bank where there’s always a lot of rats. 'I did not put the rat there but I’m not surprised it was there as we have had quite a few cars where rats have worked their way inside and eaten through all the wires and seats.' Despite her encounter with the rodent, Mrs Pearce said she was 'over the moon' at her legal victory. In normal circumstances, people are charged and prosecute by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. However, every citizen has the right to bring a private case through criminal courts, thanks to the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Anyone who wants to take private action must initially apply through magistrates courts, which is what Mrs Pearce did. A magistrate would need to hear the reasons behind the prosecution, before signing a summons to start the legal process. The case is then treated like any other prosecution. Despite her encounter with the rodent, Mrs Pearce said she was 'over the moon' with her legal victory - and getting her car back . Mrs Pearce said of her legal action: 'I’m delighted, I feel like it is a moral victory. 'All I ever wanted was my car back, the compensation was irrelevant. 'It was about getting justice and getting my car back, which I felt had effectively been stolen from me.' The episode began back in March this year when Mrs Pearce inadvertently parked on private land. She took her daughters, aged 10 and 13, to their piano exams, only to return an hour later to see her car on a tow truck. She . said: 'I flagged the truck down and asked what was going on, but they . refused to tell me anything other than to phone the number on the sign. 'They . pointed to a sign way up high on a wall, which said cars would be . clamped if parked there. It was the first time I’d seen the sign as it . was so high up. 'My daughters were in floods of tears.' Mrs . Pearce then phoned Midway Parks, where her car had been taken to a . compound, only to be told she would have to pay £390 to free the . vehicle. It was from this location in Birmingham - which she later discovered was private property - that Mrs Pearce's car was towed away . She was also warned she would be charged an extra £40 for each day it was left there. She added: 'I was told I would have to pay cash, but I couldn’t afford it. 'I asked if I could pay on credit card but they refused to allow me to. 'I was not going to give in that easily - I knew that I had to take legal action. 'Not having a car for six months has been a huge inconvenience, but I was determined to get it back.' Wilkins defended the decision to tow away Mrs Pearce’s car. He said: 'At the end of the day she was parked illegally on private land. I decided to return her car and pay her the money for it [the charges] to go away. 'I am innocent but I don’t want the hassle or legal costs involved.' The clamper sparked outrage earlier this year when he boasted to the media that he had earned more than £10million by clamping city drivers. However, he later dismissed his own claims, saying the statement was meant as 'a joke'. Wilkins is well-known to Birmingham City Council’s Trading Standards team, who have received complaints from motorists about Midway Parks. A number of clamping victims, including 20-year-old Walsall student Lydia Dykes, have sued the firm in civil courts to win back their fines. Vir Ahluwalia, Trading Standards operations manager, said: 'We are aware of Midway Parks clamping and towing vehicles from their sites. This includes where motorists are just a few minutes late.'","Ruth Pearce's car was towed away while she took her daughters to an after-school club .

Whoops: Boris said that the PM got his Letterman question wrong to look less clever before making a glaring error himself . Boris Johnson today accused David Cameron of pretending not to know what Magna Carta meant before embarrassingly getting an easy question wrong himself. The London Mayor said the Prime Minister was trying to hide how clever he was just before he failed to name who scored a hat-trick for England in the 1966 World Cup final. Mr Johnson should have answered Geoff Hurst, but was miles off when he said it was centre back and captain Bobby Moore. Tellingly his claim the Tory leader feigned ignorance exposes the growing rift between the Prime Minister and the outspoken London Mayor, seen as his main rival to lead the Conservatives. Mr Cameron was widely mocked for his appearance on American television’s The Late Show with David Letterman earlier this week after the US host quizzed him on British history. The grilling included being asked what Magna Carta meant and who composed Rule Britannia. The Prime Minister fluffed both questions, but his fellow Old Etonian and Oxford University contemporary Mr Johnson today claimed Mr Cameron really knew Magna Carta meant Great Charter and faked the apparent knowledge gap to appear more down-to-earth. Classics scholar Mr Johnson said: 'I think he was only pretending. I think he knew full well what Magna Carta means. 'It was a brilliant move in order to show his demotic credentials and that he didn’t have Latin bursting out of every orifice.' Terrible mistake: Boris plumped for captain Bobby Moore, centre, rather than the man to his right, hat trick hero Geoff Hurst . Was it over? Geoff Hurst (out of picture) famously scored three in the World Cup Final on July 30, 1966 at Wembley - including this one where the ball hit the bar and bounced down . Quizzed on more modern British history during an appearance on LBC 97.3 radio, Mr Johnson failed to correctly identify Geoff Hurst as the scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup final victory over West Germany, the only time England have ever been world champions. Mr Johnson claimed defender Bobby Moore netted three. In fact, Moore was the captain who held aloft the Jules Rimet trophy at Wembley. Perhaps realising the revelation could damage his dreams of claiming the keys to No 10 Downing Street, the 48-year-old mayor protested: 'I was only two!' Interview: David Cameron's appearance on Letterman was overshadowed by his failure to get a few questions about Britain right - but Boris says he did it to look less clever . Rivals: Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson could soon be fighting for leadership of the Tory party . In a wide-ranging interview and phone-in with presenter Nick Ferrari, Mr Johnson faced the anger of London taxi drivers frustrated by transport arrangements during the Olympics. He apologised to businesses whose trade was hit by the summer spectacle, but denied claims the capital became a 'ghost town'. Mr Johnson said: 'I’m not going to pretend it was a bonanza for everybody and for those that feel hard done by, I’m sorry for the losses or low takings they had. 'But the overall economic benefit to London of people around the world seeing a city that can deliver an amazing event like that so successfully was incredibly positive.' The mayor admitted trade was 'patchy', but claimed the Games were “overwhelmingly for the benefit of the city'. He added: 'If you look at the spend by tourists in the city, it was up overall. 'The economic impact of the Games is estimated to be massively positive.'","The Mayor of London answered Bobby Moore then blamed his age for getting it wrong .

A year-old fawn was dramatically rescued from a manhole by police after it fell down the 10-foot concrete pipe. Sheriff’s deputies for Davis County in Utah were able to rescue the terrified deer by putting a climbing rope around its neck and hoisting it up. The rescue was recorded by another one of the sheriffs. Scroll down for video . Rescue effort: Davis County deputies used a climbing rope to pull a deer to safety from a concrete manhole . Stuck on you: The deer was stuck nearly 10 feet down; authorities lowered an orange rope around its neck to pull it back out to safety . According to ABC 4, several teenagers alerted authorities that the deer was stuck in a manhole at Nicolas Park in Davis County, Utah. It was unclear how long the creature had been stuck, but police officers saw the animal had no access to food or water. ‘We knew the deer wasn’t going to last long in the hole,’ Sgt Todd Taylor told the station. The video shows a sheriff’s deputy fashioning a lasso out of bright orange rope. After several attempts to get the rope around its body, they were successful. While they were pulling the animal up to safety, the deer let out a frightened bellow. Outing: A deputy said that while he didn't like to see animals suffer, pulling the deer out by the neck was the most humane thing to do .

However, the law enforcement officials told ABC 4 that it was better that the fawn experience a few moments of discomfort rather than starving to death. ‘We would always rather see an animal get released back into the wild,’ Sgt Susan Poulsen said. As fate would have it, the most difficult job the sheriffs had was just that. The spooked deer managed to get to its feet within a matter of seconds and immediately tried running off into the woods, with the orange rope still around its neck. After a failed attempt, a sheriff managed to untangle the deer, and he bolted off into the nearby woods. ‘The deer was happy when it was released, so I guess it was a good, happy ending,’ Sgt Pouslen said.","Teenagers reported deer that had fallen down concrete pipe .

'It's a shame when a celebrity like that can use her publicist to tar a kid who has done nothing wrong.' But Lohan's publicist told the New York Daily News about his denials: 'That's a crock of s*** and you can quote me on that.' LaBella will not face any criminal . charges despite being accused of doing a number of things to the . actress, including punching, scratching and choking her after she . demanded he delete cellphone photos of her. The initial charges of misdemeanor assault were dropped within hours. His uncle Peter Jessop told the Daily News: 'He is pretty stunned by all of this. He was just out having fun, and Lindsay Lohan picked him out of a crowd . at bar and said, ""You're coming with us"". 'I guess they had a friend in . common. He didn't do anything to invite this.

Connections: LaBella, pictured with Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, works for Illinois congressman John Shimkus . LaBella has his own connections to the famous and powerful - his aunt is comedian Heather McDonald, and he is employed as a staffer for Illinois GOP congressman John Shimkus. On his Facebook page, he has posted images of himself posing with high-profile figures such as Mitt Romney's running mate Paul Ryan and former presidential candidate Herman Cain. He has also met reality superstar Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner in another encounter pictured on his Facebook profile. According to his YouTube page, LaBella ran for president of his business fraternity at the University of San Diego and was a child actor. Lohan reportedly met the suspect at Manhattan's popular 1OAK nightclub in the city's Chelsea district. She is said to have later taken him to her room on the 15th floor of the nearby W Hotel. Starry: LaBella posing with reality star Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner . According to NBC New York, the . actress saw approximately 50 photos of herself on LaBella's phone at approximately 4.30am . and confronted him about the images. The website, citing police sources, reports: 'LaBella then threw her on the bed causing scratches on her hands.' Lohan is believed to have run out of the room before returning a short time later, at which point she told police he choked her, threw her to the ground and climbed on top of her. A friend of the actress is believed to have pulled LaBella off Lohan, who then pulled the fire alarm for help, according to NBC. LaBella, originally from Woodlands Hill, California, but now based in Washington DC, took off down the stairs, but police arrived before he was able to leave the hotel, took him into custody and filed a report on the alleged assault. Lohan refused medical attention and did not go to a hospital. LaBella was initially charged Sunday afternoon with assault and harassment, but after further investigation police dropped the assault charge. LaBella has since filed a harassment complaint against Lohan. Scene: The incident, believed to have stemmed over a cell phone photo, allegedly occurred at the W Hotel in Manhattan's Union Square, where the actress was staying . According to TMZ, Lohan claims he had taken over 50 photos and video of her before the incident. Mr Shimkus confirmed that LaBella worked for him, but condemned the alleged assault. A spokesman said: 'Obviously, the Congressman does not condone his actions.' Lohan's mother Dina told the Daily . News that her daughter was 'very shaken up' after the encounter, adding: . 'Thank God he didn't have a weapon.' The star's publicist Steve Honig expressed the star's anger at learning her alleged attacker had not been charged, saying: 'We think it's both distressing and . outrageous.

Slow process: The current excavation, which started in 2009, is the third at the Chinese site following two previous digs which were carried out in 1974 and 1985 . The artefacts in western China were buried with the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC. The latest discoveries include . never-before-seen items, including war drums and a dramatic painted shield. In total, more than 310 small pieces have been newly excavated as well as 12 clay horses. The third excavation covers about 200 square metres in pit number one - the largest and the . most visited of the Terracotta Warriors And Horses Museum. Some of the other unusual finds in the latest dig include a tool box for chariots, a crossbow, painted drum and items dyed a unique Chinese purple colouring. The dig is expected to be finished within three years. Once . uncovered, the statues are taken to a dedicated museum to have their . colours restored, before joining their fellows soldiers in the world . famous exhibition.

More . than 1,000 of the life-size statues, each with unique facial . expressions and hair styles, have already been discovered at the site. They were originally put in place to guard the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. The fierce figures are among the best-known images of China. Reproductions in sizes ranging from miniature to full size are sold in gift shops around the country and an exhibition of 20 figures and dozens of artefacts from the tomb broke ticket sale records when it travelled in 2008 to London, California, Houston and Washington. Cao Wei, director of the mausoleum museum site, said preserving the figures would be far more challenging than the relatively simple task of excavating them. One archaeologist said the museum has been co-operating with a cultural relic department at a university in Germany for years trying to find a satisfactory technology to preserve the colour of the terracotta, and has 'made some headway'. The warriors guarded the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of China . In all, the tomb's three pits are . thought to hold 8,000 life-sized figures of archers, infantry soldiers, . horse-drawn chariots, officers and acrobats, plus 130 chariots with 520 . horses and 150 cavalry horses. It is believed they were created to protect the emperor in the afterlife. The statues stand between 6ft and 6ft 5in tall and weigh about 400lb. They are intricately detailed and no two figures are alike – craftsmen are believed to have modelled them after a real army. The tomb was looted less than five . years after Emperor Qin Shihuang's death by a rival army. They set a . fire that destroyed the wooden structures housing the warriors, damaging . most of them.

A fourth pit at the tomb was . apparently left empty by its builders, while Qin's actual burial chamber . at the centre of the complex has yet to be excavated. Qin, who died in 210BC at the age of 50, created China's first unitary state by conquering rival kingdoms.

Dr Debbie Van Pelt, a vet from Englewood, Colorado, where the drug is legal, told CBS: 'They basically have lost a lot of their fine motor control, they have a wide-based stance and they are not sure on their feet.' Most dogs survive despite becoming sick from being around the product but if it is ingested in a product like brownies or cookies, it can be fatal. Vets said two dogs have died after eating food containing marijuana butter which seems to be more toxic. Labradors are most at risk, according to animal experts, because 'they'll eat anything'. Symptoms in animals include staggering, acting sleepy, vomiting and being overly sensitive to sound and light.

Time on Earth is 'counted' by a network of 400 atomic clocks and . sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night, due to . fluctuations in earth's rotation.

The planet takes just over 86,400 seconds for a 360 degree revolution. But it wobbles on its axis and is affected by the pull of the Sun, Moon and tides meaning it gets out of step with International Atomic Time (TAI). To avoid solar time and TAI moving too far apart, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is adjusted to give us the odd 86,401 - second day. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has, . since the Seventies, been the agreed universal standard which dictates . what time it is in every time zone on the planet. The speed of the . Earth's rotation varies, however, meaning that while one rotation is one . day, some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others. Scientists . allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every . year-and-a-half to keep UTC synchronised with our traditional, sun-based . concept of time. They are . added once the International Earth Rotation Service, which monitors the . planet's activity, finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart . by 0.9 seconds. Under threat: The U.S. wants to move to a new man-made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky, rendering sundials useless . Leap-second: It won't mean much of a lie in but Saturday night will be a second longer than usual . 'Today, time is constructed defined and measured with atomic clocks' said Noel Dimarcq, director of the SYRTE time-space reference system at the Paris Observatory. 'This allows us to ensure that everyone on Earth is on the exact same time.'","Adjustment so Earth keeps pace with 'space time'

The billionaire founder of Megaupload.com, which allowed users to swap large files across the internet before it was shut down on the orders of the FBI, said U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ordered the ultimately illegal raids on the company. Kim DotCom, speaking to the website TorrentFreak, which follows the popular but legally-murky world of file sharing, said he believed Biden told attorney Neil MacBride to target the site. Citing evidence on the White House website, DotCom says that in one meeting, Biden met with the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, which crusades against movie piracy, 'all studio bosses', and an extradition expert. He alleged this meeting was to plot his arrest and to arrange Megaupload's demise. Kim DotCom (right) accuses Joe Biden (right) of personally ordering the closure of file-sharing site Megaupload . Megaupload as it looked before the closure, alongside the FBI Anti-Piracy campaign . Seventy officers raided the New . Zealand mansion of Dotcom - also known as Kim . Schmitz - in January as part of an investigation of his website . spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S. DotCom was one of four men arrested during the operation, accused of being the ringleader of a group that . netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films . and other copyrighted content without authorisation. Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage. Many observers expressed surprise at the speed with which the US government acted against DotCom. DotCom tweeted this image of Biden and Dodd, who is the head of the Motion Picture Association of America . But DotCom gave a potential explanation: 'I do know from a credible source that it was Joe Biden, the best . friend of former Senator and Motion Picture Association of America . (MPAA) boss Chris Dodd, who ordered his former lawyer and now state . attorney Neil MacBride to take Mega down. 'After we received information from an insider we scanned the White . House visitor logs for all meetings of Chris Dodd and studio bosses with . Joe Biden and Obama. They are publicly available on the White House . website. 'It is interesting that a man by the name of Mike Ellis of MPA Asia, . an extradition expert and former superintendent of the Hong Kong . police, was also at a meeting with Dodd, all studio bosses and Joe .

Torrent Freak added: 'The information above does indeed suggest that the Megaupload case was discussed at the highest political levels last year. 'Noteworthy is also the MPAA’s lobbying disclosure statement of last year which includes money spent on lobbying the office of Vice President Joe Biden. 'What exactly Biden’s role has been, and whether that’s problematic, remains to be seen. However, Dotcom is convinced that corrupt elements in the U.S. Government brought Mega down. More on this will be made public in the near future.' Dotcom said he had more evidence about the investigation, and added: 'At the appropriate time we will release what we know. The whole Mega case is quite the political thriller.' Big operation: Seventy police raided Dotcom's mansion near Auckland in January .

Before . it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most . popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free . or by paying for premium service. Authorities say Megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500million.

A disabled boy fell to his death because care home workers were too afraid to restrain him over 'health and safety' fears. James Dean Brotherhood, 18, had brain . damage and was susceptible to blood clots following treatment for a . brain tumour, which was removed when he was eight. But . despite his medical history and the evident danger, carers at a specialist unit stood by and . watched as James pulled himself up onto a windowsill with his wheelchair . still strapped to his back. The teenager fell and hit his head - and within hours was dead. His family have now received a four-figure payout. James, seen here before his surgery to remove a tumour and left, aged 16 after his treatment, died after he knocked his head whilst carers watched him climb on to a windowsill . Seen here at Christmas in 1999, James' life changed dramatically when doctors found a tumour on his brain stem . When asked by a coroner why he did not intervene in the moments before the tragedy, one of his carers wrongly stated the home had a 'no restraint policy' due to health and safety rules. Following the out of court settlement, James’s mother Suzanne said: 'If a toddler ran out into the road, would they have stood by and let them get run over by a car? 'His carers said they didn’t want to move him or stop him because they were scared they might get hurt, but one of them was a 6ft bouncer - it was simply ridiculous. 'After the accident, I was told that he had suffered a slight knock but in the inquest I discovered he had received a severe blow to the head. 'There were three carers in the room at the time and they just stood next to him and watched him for several minutes before he fell. 'They should have just grabbed him and stopped him from doing it, then my little boy would still be here.' A coroner recorded that James, seen here aged 7 drawing with sister Katie 11, died from bleeding on the brain after the fall . James, seen here at his sister Katie's 18th birthday with his aunt Berna was 'loved by everyone' Mrs Brotherhood added: 'If he had died from the cancer I might have been able to live with that, but knowing his death was preventable has made it impossible for me to move on.' After his death, bosses at the Aarons Specialist Unit, in Loughborough, sent his family a £12 cheque for James’s funeral flowers after the inquest in May. Now, the home’s owners Rushcliffe Care have agreed to pay Mrs Brotherhood and her ex-husband Dean, 46, an undisclosed sum, although they continue to deny any responsibility for James’s untimely death. James was diagnosed with medullablastoma - a tumour on his brain stem - at the age of eight. He underwent surgery and two years of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to treat the tumour. James was left with balance issues and over time his behaviour changed and he would keep his family awake at night, getting out of bed to lie in the middle of the road. He also suffered a number of health problems including blood clots. By October 2008 his behaviour was becoming increasingly difficult for Suzanne and Dean, who also have two daughters, Katy, 26, and Amy, 17, to look after. By this time, James was using a wheelchair and following a bout of encephalitis, James’s parents made the decision to place him in the Aarons Specialist Unit in the hope the intensive therapy offered there would give him the opportunity to walk again. James, pictured aged 17 with his mother Suzanne, was allowed to climb on to a windowsill while staff watched, the inquest heard . Suzanne, who now lives in Hinckley, . Leicestershire, with her partner store depot worker Phil Blackburn, 47, . said: 'I didn’t want to put him in the unit. 'But . the services they offered seemed perfect for James and he was so . desperate to learn to walk again that I allowed him to go. 'The managers reassured me that they would keep him safe and I visited him every day.' On . May 28, 2009, Suzanne claims she received a call to say he had received . 'a slight knock' but that he seemed fine and had not been sick. The . next morning, Suzanne was preparing to visit her son when she received . another call to say that staff at the centre had called a doctor to . check on James 'just in case' and that he had said to monitor him for . the next 24 hours. A short while later, she received another call to say James had been sent to hospital in an ambulance. As he was taken into A&E at Leicester Infirmary, James suffered a massive heart attack and died in his mother’s arms. Since . then, Suzanne has been searching for answers as to how her son could . have been allowed to hurt himself while under the supervision of three . carers. The room in which three care workers watched as the brain-damaged teenager climbed on to the windowsill . She said: 'He was . strapped into his wheelchair so I don’t know how someone who couldn’t . walk could have pulled himself up onto a windowsill like they said he . did. 'I don’t care about the money, all I’ve ever wanted from Rushcliffe Care is an explanation and an apology.' An . inquest in May this year heard how three members of staff were with . James when he pulled himself up on a window frame to try to see a . motorbike outside. He was . still strapped into his wheelchair and the hearing at Loughborough . Coroner’s Court heard his carers tried to persuade James to climb down . but at no point did they physically intervene. In evidence, they said there was a 'no restraint' policy and that health and safety regulations prevented them from stepping in. Senior . care assistant Dale Watret told the inquest that he was in the room . with James when he climbed on the windowsill, but he could not . physically step in to get him down because of a health and safety . policy. Mr Watret said . carers were told to talk to patients and distract them from behaving in . ways that might cause them to harm themselves. His mother Suzanne is devastated at the death of her only son, and has accepted an out-of-court settlement from the care home owners . He . told the inquest: 'I would stand and observe - maybe a couple of feet . away. He happened to hear a motorbike starting up. James made his way to . the window and proceeded to climb up. He was kneeling on the windowsill . and he was looking out. 'I said ""Look, you need to come down because it’s dangerous"", but he was distracted by the motorbike.' Mr Watret, who is no longer employed by Rushcliffe Care, said he shouted for help. Coroner Robert Chapman asked Mr Watret: 'Why didn’t you grab him?' Mr Watret replied: 'Health and safety policy states you don’t catch anyone to break their fall.' Mr . Chapman asked if that was the firm’s policy. Mr Watret replied: 'It’s . health and safety policy all over the country, I am led to believe.' He told the inquest he was concerned about being injured himself. Mr . Watret said: 'I was asking him to come down. The back of his head hit . the floor. It happened so fast. Everything after that is a bit of a . blur.' Coroner Robert Chapman recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by bleeding on the brain. At . the time, he said: 'The issue I find the most difficult to deal with is . that for one or two minutes James was holding on to the window frame . with his wheelchair strapped to his back. 'The staff realised it was dangerous. No attempt seems to have been made to take simple action to intervene.' James was being cared for at the Aarons Specialist Unit in Loughborough when he died . Darren Carnwell, a senior manager with Rushcliffe Care, which owns the unit, said staff should have been trained to physically intervene 'as a last resort'. Mr Chapman also said James’s care plan meant he should only have been in his wheelchair when being moved around the home, but staff members with him when he fell did not know that. He said he was further concerned James was not always made to wear a protective helmet, as his care plan suggested. Following the payout, Neil Clayton, a specialist in medical negligence and care home neglect with Harvey Ingram Shakespeares solicitors said: 'This was a tragic accident that would have been avoided if Rushcliffe Care’s staff had used basic common sense. 'There were several opportunities that were missed to prevent James climbing on the window and to get him down safely once he had done so. I hope that lessons have been learned and that an awful event like this will never happen again.' Since the accident, Suzanne has struggled to cope with the grief of losing her only son. She said: 'James went through so much in his life and his death has left the whole family traumatised. 'I miss him every day. He might have had brain damage but he was still smart, he passed a science GCSE not long before he died. When Mail Online contacted Rushcliffe Care a man, who refused to give his name or his position in the company, said they would not be giving any comment on the case and hung up.","Carers watched as James Brotherhood climbed on to the windowsill with a wheelchair strapped to him .

When Nasa's Curiosity rover landed on the surface of Mars on monday morning, it almost immediately began transferring back to Earth the first images of the Martian surface. But for its reported $2.5 billion price tag, the images have a little less clarity than you might expect. Curiosity's cameras have a maximum resolution of two megapixels. For perspective's sake, modern smartphones typically are 8MP or more. The result will be images that are sharper than those of Martian rovers past, yet lack the clarity that would be expected from a snap you take in your local pub. One of the first images from the Curiosity rover is taken after it successfully landed on Mars . Today's smartphones can take photos that exceed the quality of the Mars rover cameras . So why does Curiosity have such a low-tech camera on board? It's sceintsits have explained there are two main reasons. These are the rover's long developmental period and limitations on the transmission of interplanetary data, according to camera project manager Mike Ravine of Malin Space Science Systems. In an interview this week with Digital Photography Review, Ravine notes that his company had been working on Curiosity's cameras as early as 2004. The specifications called for 8GB of on-board flash memory, which may sound like a lot but is actually not much considering the rover's planned two year mission on the planet's surface. A higher resolution version of one of the first views that was taken through a ""fisheye"" wide-angle lens on one of the rover's Hazard-Avoidance cameras . This photo was taken with a Right Navigation Camera showing a part of the Mars rover Curiosity and distant hills on the horizon . A 360-degree panorama in color of the Gale Crater landing site. The panorama was made from thumbnail versions of images taken by the Mast Camera . A two-megapixel camera will obviously produce images that are small enough in size to permit thousands of images to be stored in Curiosity's on-board memory. Additionally in 2004 terms, 2MP wasn't so low-tech as it is now. That's when the design for the camera was proposed, and Ravine notes that his company couldn't develop something else once NASA approved its proposal. An even bigger consideration for both NASA and Ravine's team is bandwidth. As it stands now, interplanetary data transmission is a slow and tedious process. Curiosity sends data to two satellites currently orbiting Mars -- the former Mars Reconnaissance and Mars Odyssey orbiters -- which then transmit data back to Earth. But at a speed of only 128Kbps, it's still quite slow in modern terms. This is not a lot of bandwidth given the scope of the Curiosity mission. While pictures are what most of us . are going to associate with the Curiosity mission, the rover has far . more data that it must send back. With only about 250 megabytes of data . able to be transmitted back to Earth daily according to Ravine, . bandwidth is at a premium. Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory nicknamed Curiosity, a nuclear powered rover vehicle . According to one expert, the key to future missions is to set up an intergalactic internet. At last year's TEDxMidAtlantic event in Washington, D.C., Google chief evangelist and 'Father of the Internet' Vint Cerf talked about the need for an interplanetary Internet. The beginnings of such a system already exists in how NASA and other space agencies are repurposing orbiting spacecraft to become communications relays. But what happens when spacecraft begin to travel longer distances in their missions, say to distant stars like Alpha Centauri? Our modern point-to-point radio link system will be far less reliable, and the delays will be immense. It will soon be time to re-imagine how our spacecraft 'phone home', or face an ever more difficult time in leveraging our modern technologies to advance the pace of space research.","Smartphones have cameras with up to 8MP .

Apple has been accused of having major lapses in its online security after a writer had his 'entire digital life' destroyed by hackers in less than an hour . Apple has told its support staff to stop changing user passwords over the phone after a reporter lost his digital life, it was claimed today. Mat Honan, a reporter for Wired magazine, lost control of his Google, GMail and Twitter accounts after a hacker rang Apple's support and managed to change his Apple ID password. He was also locked out of his iPhone, and then the hacker wiped his laptop, meaning Honan lost all his images of his one-year-old daughter. The story became a viral hit after Honan wrote about it. Reacting to the scandal, Apple has now suspended all password changes over the phone for the next 24 hours, according to an Apple employee who spoke to Wired. Apple were apparently allowing . password changes on the phone yesterday - if users had their iPhone to . hand and could read the serial number of the device to Apple. The employee told Wired he believed . the freeze was in place 'to give Apple more time to determine what . security policies needed to be changed, if any'. Amazon have also closed a security . hole which allowed anyone to take control of an Amazon account if they . knew a customer's name, e-mail address and home address. It is still possible to change your Apple password online by visiting iforgot.apple.com. Apple has yet to comment on whether they are permanently changing their security passwords. In a disturbing article on Wired.com, Honan reveals how he actually spoke to the hacker who carried out the attack. After telling him how he did it Honan was then able to repeat the same steps - and carry out his very own mock hack. In the story Honan writes that on August 3 he realised something was wrong when all of a sudden his iPhone powered down. When . he tried to connect it to his computer he was asked for a four digit . pin - which the hackers had already put on the machine to stop him from . accessing it. During . the hour-and-a-half long phone call with Applecare - during which they . initially got his name wrong and looked at the wrong account - the full . story emerged. Between . 4.33pm and 5.12pm the hackers had gone from having no information to . taking over his whole digital life - and posting a message on his . Twitter page claiming credit for doing it. Honan . writes: ‘It turns out, a billing address and the last four digits of a . credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs . to get into your iCloud account. ‘Once supplied, Apple will issue a temporary password, and that password grants access to iCloud.’ Writer Matt Honen had his iPad wiped by hackers who exploited a loophole in Apple's security ptotocols . From there the hackers were able to . access his other accounts as they were all linked to one another - they . went to his Gmail account and asked for the recovery password to be sent . to his mac.com email, which they already had access to. Once they had access to his Gmail account, they were able to get control of his Twitter page too. After . accepting what had happened Honan set up a temporary Twitter account - . and was shocked when one of the hackers messaged him. Identifying himself as Phobia, he explained how he hacked Honan just because he ‘liked his username’ and claimed that ‘you honestly can get into any email associated with apple’. Honan discovered that the hack began when Phobia got his billing address by searching his web domain on Spokeo or WhitePages, which includes details of where a person lives. His credit card number was obtained by taking advantage of another security breach - this time on Amazon. Honan writes: ‘First you call Amazon and tell them you are the account holder, and want to add a credit card number to the account. Most people should be aware of the importance of keeping passwords and logins secure, to regularly change passwords, and to watch out for 'social engineering', where hackers can gain access to your accounts by fooling people into revealing confidential information. Additionally, users should remember: . ‘All you need is the name on the account, an associated e-mail address, and the billing address. ‘Amazon then allows you to input a new credit card. (Wired used a bogus credit card number from a website that generates fake card numbers that conform with the industry’s published self-check algorithm.) Then you hang up. ‘Next you call back, and tell Amazon that you’ve lost access to your account. Upon providing a name, billing address, and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call, Amazon will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account. ‘From here, you go to the Amazon website, and send a password reset to the new e-mail account. 'This allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account — not the complete numbers, just the last four digits. But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits.’ Honan admits that he only has himself to blame for being hacked and wishes he had taken better security steps, such as not ‘daisy chaining’ his accounts together. He wishes he had not set up ‘Find my Mac’, which allowed the hackers to set up a pin and freeze him out of his computer. But he also believes that it is still too easy to hack into an Apple account, and claims that anyone could repeat what Phobia did. Honan said: ‘My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures. ‘Password-based security mechanisms - which can be cracked, reset, and socially engineered - no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing.’ In a statement to Wired, Apple spokesman Natalie Kerris said: ‘Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password. ‘In this particular case, the customer’s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer. ‘In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. 'We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers’ data is protected.’","Apple believed to have suspended password changes over the phone for 24 hours while it reviews policies .

A sheep in a knitted jumper may not, at first glance, seem the biggest advance in animation ever seen. However, experts say the image could usher in a new era of characters wearing ultra-realistic clothes. The images are the first time researchers have managed the incredibly complex feat of recreated knitting inside a computer. The images of a sheep in a knitted jumper is the first time researchers have been able to 'virtually knit' an outfit, and could lead to far more realistic animated characters . To put clothes on their characters, . computer graphic artists usually simulate cloth by creating a thin . sheet, then adding some sort of texture. However, this doesn't work for knitted garments, as they are simply too complex. To make the image realistic, the computer has to simulate the surface right down to the intricate intertwining of yarn. So computer scientists are in effect teaching the computer to knit. The research, from Cornell University, was unveiled at a computer graphics conference. 'We are actually changing the shape of the yarn loops that make up the stitches,' Professor Steve Marschner from cornell, who led the research, explained, 'simulating how they wrap around other loops.' The result is a simulation with detail down to the yarn level. The trickiest part, Marschner said, is to make sure the images of yarn loops don't slide through each other like ghosts. That would cause the simulation to ""unravel"" like a dropped stitch in real knitting. The team has also revealed far more natural looking knitted outfits for human. Funded by Pixar, the research could be seen on a cinema screen soon. The . Cornell innovation is to create a 3-D model of a single stitch and then . combine multiple copies into a mesh, like tiles in a mosaic. The . computer projects the mesh onto a model of the desired shape of the . garment, treating each stitch as a tiny flat polygon that stretches and . bends to fit the 3-D surface. Then it ""relaxes"" the graphic image of . each stitch to fit the shape of its polygon, just as real yarn would . stretch and bend to fit the shape of the wearer. In knitting, a single stitch is formed by pulling yarn through a loop. Rows of stitches, built on the loops formed by previous rows, make up . the finished garment. The yarn can be pulled through in a variety of . ways or multiple times, creating various shapes and textures. To . simulate this realistically, a computer graphic artist would have to . painstakingly model the 3-D structure of every stitch. The researchers tested their method with several patterns from knitting . books and created images of dresses, sweaters, a shawl and a tea cozy. The simulations are highly realistic, but the researchers noted that the . results of knitting a particular pattern depend on the yarn and needles . used, as well as the style of the individual knitter. The method has . some parameters that can even be adjusted to simulate the effects of . different needles or yarn, or different yarn tension used by the . knitter, they said. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation, the . Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial . Foundation and Pixar. A range of different knitting techniques can now be virtually created and wrapped around a character's body.","Pixar-backed research has managed to virtually recreate knitted fabric for the first time .

Microsoft has admitted a bug in its Internet Explorer web browser could leave millions of users vulnerable to hackers. The firm today issued a fix and urged customers to upgrade their software. The German government led calls for people to switch their browser in light of the problem. Scroll down for video . Hackers could exploit to bug to gain access to a user's PC, and read all of their personal information. The security flaw affects hundreds of millions of Internet Explorer browser users. The bug affects the latest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft said attackers can exploit the bug to infect the PC of somebody who visits a malicious website and then take control of the victim's computer. The software maker advised customers on its website late on Monday to install the security software as an interim measure, buying it time to fix the bug and release a new, more secure version of Internet Explorer. The company did not say how long that will take, but several security researchers said they expect the update within a week. The free security tool, which is known as the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, or EMET, is available through Microsoft's website. Some security experts said it would be too cumbersome for many PC users to implement the measures suggested by Microsoft. Instead they advised Windows users to temporarily switch from Internet Explorer to rival browsers such as Google Inc's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox or Opera Software ASA's Opera . The German government agency overseeing IT safety is also recommending people use other browsers until the problem is fixed. The browser's ""weak point is already being used for targeted attacks,"" the Federal Office for Information Security warned, adding that the code behind the attack is freely available online and might therefore spread rapidly. A spokesman for Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday the company is aware of the issue and is working on soon rolling out a software update, a so-called patch, to fix the browser's security features. 'This is not a massive problem. 'There have been only a small number of targeted attacks,' said spokesman Thomas Baumgaertner. However, he could not provide a figure of the number of attacks recorded so far. Attackers lure users to an infected website, for example through an emailed link. Visiting the website then allows hackers to introduce codes to take control of the user's computer, the BSI agency said. Baumgaertner noted that people should always be vigilant when clicking on links from unknown sources. He also added that many antivirus programs might already be updated to protect their users against attacks through the browser loophole.","Software giant urges all users to update their software immediately to avoid hacker attacks .

Surf's up: Hanzo, a four-year-old German boxer, catches a wave during the annual Surf City Surf Dog competition at Huntington Beach in California . Making a splash: Hanzo, who learned to balance on a board when he was only 10 weeks old, was one of 48 competitors who took part in the surfing contest . Perfect: Dogs were awarded five points by the judges if they managed to ride a wave on all fours . Is this a good idea? Another dog, called Sir Hollywood, looks a little unsure as he takes part in the competition at Huntington Beach, California . The Surf City Surf Dog competition, watched by 1,500 spectators, was the highlight of a three-day festival of events promising 'doggone fun for all'. Forty-eight dogs of all sizes took part in the contest, all seeking to impress a panel of judges with their ability on a surfboard. Competitors - called 'surFURS' - got two points for lying on the board, three for sitting and five for standing on all fours. Extra points were awarded to dogs who pulled off a manoeuvre, such as a 180-degree or 360-degree spin or riding backwards.

Police, who are calling it the biggest bust of its kind for 15 years, say the ring had been selling drugs at Drexel University in Philadelphia, for more than a year. Two of the five suspects are students from the university and have not been named. They led police to ring leaders Raphael Zappala, Joseph Dassay, and Wesley Crawford, who were arrested in an overnight raid on Monday. Scroll down for video . Busted: Raphael Zappala, left, and Wesley Crawford, right, were among the five to be arrested in what police are calling the biggest bust of its kind in 15 years . Ringleader: Joseph Dassay, who is wanted in nine states, was also arrested after allegedly selling acid for $10 to $30 a hit mostly to Drexel University students . During the raid at an address on Florence Street, police seized 9,500 hits of acid worth $28,000 hidden in a Spongebob Squarepants book and $10,000 in cash. Police . say Zappala, 33, Crawford, 34, and Dassay, 31, who is wanted in nine states, sold acid for $10 to $30 a hit mostly to Drexel University students. It is estimated the defendants were making $5,000 to $15,000 a week. 'It's sad this was taking place . on a campus of higher learning,' said  Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. 'I hope the actions of a . few don't tarnish the image of educational excellence that we associate . with Drexel University.' Investigators got wind of the ring back in January when a man, arrested by Upper Moreland Police  for suspected marijuana possession, informed them of the suspected ring at Drexel. 'The first informant that we spoke to from Upper Moreland put us in contact with the Drexel student who was the supplier for the Upper Moreland individual,' Brian Grady, head of the Dangerous Drug Offender Unit in the DA’s office told CBS Philadelphia. 'That Drexel student immediately began to cooperate with us as well, and led us into his source of supply, which was another Drexel student. He led us to his suppliers.'

He has transported holidaymakers along Great Yarmouth seafront for 25 years, but now a horse-drawn carriage owner faces losing his business because he doesn't have a driving licence. Fred England, 43, has operated on the historic beachfront in Norfolk since 1987 as part of a family tradition. But Mr England is now set to lose his licence as council officials have suddenly realised . they should not be authorising him to drive his four-wheel . carriage because he does not have a car licence. Local legacy: Fred England, 43, has proudly carried excited visitors along the historic seafront in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, since 1987 . Mr England, whose horse is called Sam, went to Great Yarmouth Borough Council last week to submit a licence renewal application, as he has done regularly for a quarter of a century. But he was told he needed a motor vehicle driving licence, which he has never had. He now faces an agonising wait over his working future with the final decision being taken by the council's licensing committee later this week. Jeopardy: Council officials have suddenly realised they should not be authorising him to drive his pretty four-wheel carriage because he does not have a car licence . The horseman said his grandfather, father and three brothers have all pulled tourists in carriages along the seafront since the Second World War. Mr England of Great Yarmouth, said: 'They reckon I am not covered on the insurance. 'I have been doing this safely for 25 years - why all this all of a sudden now? 'In Blackpool there are eight guys who have been given special Grandfather Rights. 'They can ride without a licence as their family have been doing it for so long. 'Where are my Grandfather Rights?' Defiant: The horseman said his grandfather, father and three brothers have all pulled thrilled tourists in carriages along the seafront since the Second World War . A Court of Appeal case in 1998 ruled that a person-drawn vehicle was within the definition of a 'Hackney Carriage' ' a black cab. As a result it became law that both horse-drawn and person-drawn vehicles were licensable under Hackney Carriage legislation. That means a landau rider must hold both a Hackney Carriage driver's licence and DVLA licence. Linda Mockford, licensing manager at Great Yarmouth Borough Council, said: 'It just recently came to light that it's a matter of law, whereas before we did not require it. 'It was just a case of officers not being aware it was the law. 'It came to light because somebody else was trying to apply for a licence. 'We made it policy for brand new applications a few years ago. 'Now I know I have to rectify it. We have checked and found that we were potentially in breach.' She insisted: 'We cannot do anything but refuse it - we are getting legal advice and I have advised him to do the same. 'If there was something I could do for him I would,' she added. 'I will speak to him face to face - he deserves that after having been a landau driver for 25 years.' But defiant Mr England retorted: 'As far as I am concerned this is their mistake, not mine.'","Fred England, 43, has proudly carried visitors along the historic seafront in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, since 1987 as part of a family tradition .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 03:36 EST, 21 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:36 EST, 21 September 2012 . Early man: Without an adaptation which allowed us to process vegetables, modern man's brain may have remained under-developed . Modern humans were able to emerge from Africa after a genetic mutation allowed them to become vegetarian, a new study claims. The change meant humans were able to move away from water sources and spread across the continent. Geneticists have compared DNA sequences from numerous people around the world to determine how different populations relate to one another and when they might have gone their separate ways. Now three teams of American scientists have found that a key genetic variant was the ability to convert fats from plants into necessary nutrients for the brain. The development would have allowed early humans to leave the waters of central Africa, where they ate fish, according to the study published online on the Public Library of Science (PLOS). Researchers from the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in North Carolina, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, analysed the genes of 1,092 individuals from 15 different human populations. They claim homo sapiens first appeared 180,000 years ago, but stayed in one location around bodies of water in central Africa for almost 100,000 years. Senior author Doctor Floyd Chilton, professor of physiology and pharmacology and director of the Centre for Botanical Lipids and Inflammatory Disease Prevention at Wake Forest Baptist, said the location was critical as the ready supply of fish and shellfish provided the fatty acid Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was necessary for brain development. 'This may have kept early humans tethered to the water in central Africa where there was a constant food source of DHA,' he said. 'There has been considerable debate on how early humans were able to obtain sufficient DHA necessary to maintain brain size and complexity. 'It's amazing to think we may have uncovered the region of genetic variation that arose about the time that early humans moved out of this central region in what has been called the 'great expansion.' Varied diet: Two members of the Mardi tribe use bows in East Sudan to fish, following the tradition of their ancestors . This conversion meant that early humans didn't have to rely on just one food source, fish, for brain growth and development. According to Joshua Akey, lead scientist at the University of Washington, the development was particularly important because the genetic variant arose before organised hunting and fishing could have provided more reliable sources of the necessary fats. 'The power of genetics continually impresses me, and I find it remarkable that we can make inferences about things that happened tens of thousands of years ago by studying patterns of genetic variation that exist in contemporary populations,' he added. The researchers said the findings added to a study in 2011 which found people of African descent have a much higher frequency of the gene that converts plant-based fatty acids to polyunsaturated fats that cause inflammation. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans in the United States have much higher rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer. 'The current observation provides another important clue as to why diverse racial and ethnic populations likely respond differently to the modern western diet,' Dr Chilton said.","Adapting to a part-vegetarian diet helped early humans lose their dependence on fish .

Coalition relations hit an all-time low yesterday after Liberal Democrats refused to back Jeremy Hunt as he was  branded a ‘liar’ in Parliament. Tory MPs called their partners ‘traitors’ and vowed revenge – promising to vote against Nick Clegg’s plans to reform the Lords and to withdraw support for Lib Dem ministers in difficulty. But there was uproar as Speaker John Bercow allowed Labour to accuse the beleaguered Culture Secretary of lying to MPs over his handling of Rupert Murdoch’s take-over bid for BSkyB. Scroll down for video . 'Politics': David Cameron and Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude during Prime Minister's Questions . Commons Leader Sir George Young protested that such remarks – normally ruled out of order – did  nothing to enhance the reputation of Parliament. The Culture Secretary, who is widely expected to be moved from his job in a forthcoming reshuffle, told MPs the accusation was ‘disgraceful’. But he admitted he may have ‘inadvertently’ provided incorrect information when he claimed in the Commons to have released all his correspondence relating to the deal. A Labour motion calling for Mr Hunt to be referred for investigation by Sir Alex Allan, the independent adviser on the Ministerial Code, was defeated by 290 to 252 votes. This was despite Mr Clegg ordering his Lib Dem MPs to abstain, a move seen as an unprecedented slap in the face for David Cameron. On his bike: Jeremy Hunt leaves his London home yesterday . One Tory MP, Justin Tomlinson, had to return from his honeymoon in Mauritius to take part in the vote, while another, Conor Burns, was forced to leave his hospital bed. Mr Cameron decided less than half an hour after Mr Hunt concluded his evidence to the Leveson Inquiry a fortnight ago that he would not order a further investigation into whether ministerial rules had been broken. It emerged at the inquiry that hundreds of texts and phone calls were exchanged between Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith and News Corp. Opposition MPs also allege Mr Hunt misled Parliament when he said he made no intervention in the bid while Business Secretary Vince Cable was handling it, since it has now emerged that he sent Mr Cameron a memo effusively backing the Murdochs. The Culture Secretary suggested that he had not lied, but may have ‘inadvertently’ misled Parliament by failing to disclose the note, in which he said that failing to agree to the bid for the broadcaster would set Britain’s media sector back a decade. Shadow minister Chris Bryant said Mr Hunt had told MPs that it would be too expensive to detail all of his exchanges on the subject. ‘How much would it have cost to reveal he sent a letter to the Prime Minister? He has lied to Parliament!’ Mr Bryant shouted, prompting angry protests from Tory MPs. Mr Hunt said there was a ‘huge difference between misleading Parliament inadvertently and lying’. The Prime Minister told MPs that he ‘understood’ the motives of the Lib Dems in not backing Mr Hunt, saying it was ‘politics’. Mr Clegg told his Lib Dem MPs to stay away from yesterday’s vote, but caused confusion when he then backed Mr Hunt’s handling of the bid during his own evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. Rowdy: Commons Speaker John Bercow intervenes during the debate for Labour's motion calling for Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt to face an inquiry of his handling of the BSkyB bid by News Corp . He said the Culture Secretary had given a ‘full, good and convincing account of himself’. Lib Dem aides said Mr Clegg believed Sir Alex should investigate a potential breach of the Ministerial Code, nonetheless, given that ministers are meant to take responsibility for the actions of their special advisers. Tory party bosses asked MPs not to attack Lib Dems publicly for their failure to back Mr Hunt. But several ignored the edict. Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: ‘Everyone is furious on our side. Jeremy is a good man and the questions about him have all been covered. Split: The decision by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is said to have angered his partner in Coalition, David Cameron . ‘I think it will hit home to a lot of people that they are traitors, that they are not proper members of this Government.’ Louise Mensch, a Tory member of the culture select committee, said the Lib Dems were ‘being silly’. Another senior MP said privately: ‘On our side we’ve fought for Lib Dems who got into trouble, like David Laws. ‘This is a fundamental breach of faith and a turning point in the Coalition. ‘It has actually had the effect of rallying our benches behind Jeremy Hunt and ensuring that very many people will be less willing to go along with Liberal Democrat hobby horses like Lords reform.’ By .

David Cameron was accused of a ‘smokescreen’ last night after insisting he had the support of the ministerial sleaze watchdog for his decision not to refer Jeremy Hunt for investigation over his handling of Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid for BSkyB. The Prime Minister yesterday brandished a letter in which Sir Alex Allan, suggested that because the Leveson Inquiry into media standards was ongoing and taking evidence under oath, it would not be appropriate for him to hold a further fact-finding probe. ‘I do not believe I could usefully add to the facts in this case, though I remain available should circumstances change or new evidence emerge,’ Sir Alex, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, wrote. Debate: Mr Cameron said Mr Hunt, top left of the picture, had handled himself well and needn't be probed over the issue . Labour critics accused Downing Street of a ‘stunt’ designed to take the heat off Mr Hunt ahead of the Commons vote and Mr Cameron as he prepared for his own appearance before the Leveson Inquiry today. They said that Sir Alex was not being asked to establish the facts, but whether the Culture Secretary broke the Ministerial Code in his handling of the £8billion takeover application. The full exchanges, published by the Cabinet Office during Prime Minister’s Questions, made it clear that Sir Alex had not been asked to make any judgment on whether the code had been broken. Given that both letters bore yesterday’s date, Downing Street also faced questions over the startling speed with which the watchdog replied, raising suspicions that the exchange had been pre-planned. Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, a victim of phone hacking, said it was ‘suspicious’ that the Prime Minister and Sir Alex had exchanged letters yesterday morning, given that two weeks have passed since Mr Hunt gave evidence.","Tory MPs have called Lib Dem abstention from vote an 'act of war'

Paula Radcliffe's hopes of ever winning an Olympic medal evaporated today as she was forced to withdraw from the London 2012 marathon because of injury. Speculation had been rife the 38-year-old world record-holder would pull out after a foot problem flared up again and today the news was confirmed. It was the latest - and possibly most frustrating - setback in a long list of Olympic disappointments for Radcliffe, one of the best female distance runners ever who holds the marathon world record but has failed to win a medal in four previous games . In a statement released this afternoon, Radcliffe said: 'However hard today is, finally closing the door on that dream, at least I can know that I truly have tried absolutely everything.' Anguish: Paula Radcliffe, right, breaks down and is comforted by Liz Yelling, left, at the end of the Marathon after finishing 23rd at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 . 'I have been through the mill . emotionally and physically the past three weeks, cried more tears than . ever, vented more frustration and at the same time calmly tried every . direction and avenue available to heal myself,' Radcliffe said in a statement. ""As . desperate as I was to be part of the amazing experience of the London . Olympics, I don't want to be there below my best.' The 38-year-old Radcliffe failed to . finish the 2004 Athens Olympics marathon and was 23rd in Beijing four . years later after deciding to race while still recovering from a stress . fracture in her thigh. She finished fourth in the 10,000 metres in Sydney in 2000 and was fifth in the 5,000 in Atlanta. She is a three-time winner of the London Marathon, and had hoped for one more big victory in the capital. 'From the day when it was announced . that London had won the bid, taking part and performing well in the . London Olympic Games has been a major goal in my life,' Radcliffe said. 'The goal of a fifth Olympics in my home country, what better? The . chance to make amends to myself for bitter disappointments at the . previous two Olympics.' She said the joint in her injured foot is 'degenerative and badly damaged' but not the end of her career. 'I don't believe now that it can't recover and be carefully managed to . allow me to still do what I love to do,' she said. 'Unfortunately . though, that isn't going to happen in one week.' 'However hard today is, finally closing the door on that dream, at least . I can know that I truly have tried absolutely everything. Not one day . was wasted in getting treatment, scans or interventions that might . help,' she said. 'I cross trained as hard as I could whenever I was . unable to run to give myself every chance should the pain settle.' A statement on the UK Athletics . website read: 'The British Olympic Association and UK Athletics . announced this afternoon that marathon athlete Paula Radcliffe is being . withdrawn from Team GB due to medical reasons. 'Radcliffe . has been suffering with a foot problem and after a fitness test on . Sunday it was concluded that she would not be able to race competitively . to the best of her abilities.' Radcliffe . has been struggling for fitness since  a degenerative foot injury . flared up three weeks ago and now her battle is over. Sources close to Radcliffe had speculated last night that she would make the heart-breaking decision today. Speaking yesterday, one said: ‘The time to make a decision has arrived and there’s only one decision to make,’ said the source. ‘Paula is not fit to run at the moment. There will be an announcement shortly.’ Radcliffe recently flew to Munich to seek help from renowned sports doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt for osteoarthritis in her left foot in a desperate bid to get fit for the Games. World class: Paula Radcliffe has won both the London and New York marathons three times . The possibility of her withdrawal was floated as far back as April by Radcliffe’s lifelong friend and former Team GB marathon colleague Liz Yelling. ‘If she’s injured she won’t put herself through that [an Olympic marathon] again,’ said Yelling in the build-up to the London Marathon. Pulling out of what would be her fifth Games will be agony for Radcliffe who, despite winning both the London and New York marathons three times and Golds at the European and World Championships, has yet to  win an Olympic medal. The closest she has come was when she finished fourth in the 10,000m in Sydney in 2000. Four years later in Athens her race fell apart through stomach cramps brought on by anti-inflammatory drugs she had taken for a leg injury. Radcliffe pulled out four miles from the finish and burst into tears. She was dogged by a stress-fracture to her leg four years ago in Beijing and trailed home in 23rd place.

Sabah Saleem and her brother Rayhan . were critically injured when they were hit by a car in the Hyde Park . area of Leeds, West Yorkshire. Today police confirmed they have arrested three Leeds men, aged 39, 36 and 26, in connection with the incident. Scroll down to hear from Sabah and Rayhan's aunt . Critical: Sabah Salem (left) is fighting for her life after she was hurt trying to save her brother Rayhan (right) The 36-year-old man is being . questioned by detectives on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to . stop after a collision and failing to report a collision. The 39-year-old man was arrested on . suspicion of dangerous driving and the 26-year-old was held on suspicion . of assisting an offender. The 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender was later released on bail pending further inquiries. The two other men remain in custody, West Yorkshire Police said. At the scene today, the children's aunt, Saima Rafique, said she had just returned from the hospital where her niece remains in a critical condition. But she said Rayhan is much better and walking around on the ward. Mrs Rafique said: 'Most likely what happened is that Sabah tried protecting her brother and she took the brunt of the accident. 'She's just a little hero, isn't she? 'It just shows you how a big sister would react with a younger brother.' Investigation: West Yorkshire Police have released this CCTV image of a car involved in the hit-and-run on Saturday in Leeds . Appeal: Detectives believe this woman may well have witnessed what took place and seen the car in detail . Mrs Rafique, who is a nurse, said the children's parents, Tazeem Noor and Mohamed Saleem, remain at their daughter's bedside. 'It's been very upsetting for all the family,' she said. 'Rayhan has made some improvements, which is very good for us.' Mrs Rafique said the police investigation appeared to be very thorough and she thanked officers for their efforts. She also thanked the public for the support the family has received. 'We all appreciate this so much - the . public, everyone's input towards this. We can't thank you all enough. It's just been so touching and we appreciate this so much.' Mrs Rafique said the family were ""very, very concerned"" about the dangers posed by the road. 'It's a very, very busy road which leads into the centre of Leeds,' she said. 'It's a main road that everybody uses - a lot of turnings, a lot of lorries. 'A lot of accidents have occurred in . this road. We're just wishing and hoping that something can be put in . place, that something can be done about this road. 'Either we would like some speed . cameras, some double yellow lines, even give the residents some parking . permits so no other people can park on this road.' Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, . leading the investigation, said Sabah may have tried to push Rayhan . from the path of the car. He added: ‘We have heard from Sabah’s . family that she was like a little mother to Rayhan, so it’s very . possible that she tried to get him out of the way.’ Police officers document evidence at the scene of the incident which saw a Vauxhall Astra hit the two children and speed off . Scene: The siblings were hit by the car near to the Makkah Masjid Mosque in Leeds' Hyde Park area . They had been on their way home after . buying onions for their mother before the family’s Eid celebrations . when they were hit by a silver Vauxhall Astra on Brudenell Road at about 5.20pm on Saturday. Officers said the driver slowed down to see . what had happened, then sped away. The children’s uncle, Aroon Rafique, . said: ‘How anybody could leave two children in the street is beyond me.

The Ecuadorean government is battling to keep WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange safe from extradition to America, and fears that the U.S. Government has hatched secret plans to thwart them. Ecuador has become Mr Assange's unlikely defender, providing him with diplomatic protection at their embassy in Knightsbridge, London, for the past five weeks. Mr Assange sought refuge in the embassy after he failed in his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning about alleged sex offences. Avoiding extradition: Some believe the US government have secret plans to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to face a possible conspiracy to commit espionage which holds a sentence of life in prison . An Ecuadorean political adviser labelled the suspected U.S. secret plans as 'evil'. He was quoted in a report in The Guardian as saying: ‘In . legal terms…the evil that Ecuador wishes to prevent is the extradition [of Mr Assange] to the US. ‘Now if there are ways and means of that being tied down, I think that would be a just solution.’ Ecuadorean diplomats have been . seeking guarantees from the UK and Sweden that Mr Assange would not be . extradited to the U.S. but is yet to hear a formal response from either . country. Mr Assange's lawyers believe there are secret plans to send him from Sweden to America to face trial, possibly for conspiracy to commit espionage, a charge which could see him face life imprisonment. The WikiLeaks website published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses. A Foreign Office spokesman said that the UK had a binding legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden for questioning. He said: ‘The UK courts, including the supreme court, have confirmed that Mr Assange’s extradition to Sweden complies with all the requirements of the UK’s Extradition Act, including as regards the protection of his human rights.’ Seeking sanctuary: Assange has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge, London and would be immediately arrested if he steps outside . Mr Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture. The Ecuadorean diplomats said Ecuador would formally ask the U.S. if they intended to take legal action against Mr Assange or ‘an investigation which has identified him as a target and which may result in a later extradition request’. Mr Assange has been at the embassy since June 19, citing the UN declaration on human rights. Under the diplomatic protection of the embassy, Mr Assange has been living in a small square room, believe to be just 15 feet wide, with small windows and no outdoor access. He has been given gym equipment as the embassy has no courtyard. Outside: Protestors showed their support for Assange outside the embassy in June where he is living in a room, 15 feet wide . The Australian is currently on £200,000 bail after losing his last supreme court appeal against extradition to Sweden, but he cannot be arrested by police unless he steps outside the building where two Metropolitan officers are stationed. On Wednesday, Ecuador formally invited the Swedish prosecutor to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy but so far Sweden has not responded. An Ecuadorean political adviser said the country was ‘deeply concerned’ by the possible extradition to America where the death penalty is still practised. He said: ‘Ecuador has also raised the point and is very much concerned about life sentence. ‘According to our law, life sentence may be equally inhumane in the sense that any person that has no prospect of leaving confinement is, in fact, condemned to a death sentence (for) life. ‘For us that is equally inhumane.’ Secret plans: Assange's American lawyer Michael Ratner is convinced of secret plans and said the death penalty is a real possibility . In June, Assange made a public statement, refusing to comply with a police request to surrender himself. The statement read outside the embassy by Susan Benn from the Julian Assange Defence Fund said: 'The issues faced by Mr Assange are serious. His life and liberty and the life and liberty of his organisation and those associated with it are at stake. 'The US Government has instigated a grand jury against Julian Assange and other “founders or managers” of WikiLeaks. Australian diplomats have described this investigation as being of ‘unprecedented scale and nature’. His American lawyer, Michael Ratner is convinced that Assange has been secretly indicted by a grand jury in Washington or face extradition to face prosecution. He said the death penalty is still a real possibility but that it was highly unlikely that the US Government would confirm their plans to prosecute Assange to the Ecuadorean government or any other party. The Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Since Mr Assange first entered the Ecuadorean embassy five weeks ago, we have repeatedly made clear to the Ecuadorean government that the UK has a binding legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences. ‘We have been seeking a diplomatic solution and expect Ecuador to resolve this issue in accordance with its international obligations. ‘We have gone to great lengths to explain to Ecuador the human rights protections inherent in our law.’","Assange has been under diplomatic protection at the Ecuadorean embassy in London for five weeks .

A senior Liberal Democrat councillor who punched his frail 87-year-old mother and told her she would 'suffer in the afterlife' has been jailed. Simon Arthur, 44, treated his mother Isabelle 'like a dog' and told her he hoped she would 'have an awful death', a court heard. Mrs Arthur, a widow who uses a walking stick to get around, would even sleep in her car at times to avoid her violent son, magistrates were told. The councillor, who was chosen to contest a seat for the Lib Dems in the 2010 General Election, was today sentenced to four months in prison after admitting attacking Mrs Arthur. Arthur was arrested after a neighbour saw him assaulting his mother on the driveway of their home in Newton, near Swansea, South Wales, on July 21. Prosecutor Sharon Anderson told Swansea Magistrates' Court: 'Mrs Arthur had been out for the day but said she was too scared to return home, choosing to wait in a car park. 'She regularly went to the car park to avoid going home and had even slept there overnight previously. 'Around 8pm she did go home and parked in the driveway but her son had locked all the doors to their home. 'At around 11.30pm he came out of the house and began the attack.' Mrs Arthur gave details of the attack in a witness statement. It read: 'He came over, opened the driver’s side door, grabbed hold of my hair and tried to pull me out of the car. It was like he was possessed.' 'He tried to grab me a second time shouting: “You’ll burn, you’ll suffer in the afterlife.”' Magistrates heard that Mrs Arthur tried to make her way down the driveway to get help but her son grabbed her walking stick to block her path. Ms Anderson said: 'Mrs Arthur fell to the ground and dragged herself along the floor. 'She crawled out of the drive and her son followed, eventually trying to pick her up but she told him to leave her alone.' When police arrived and took Arthur into his kitchen, he opened a drawer and grabbed a knife, the court heard. Justice: Arthur was sentenced at Swansea Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to assault charges . He lunged at Pc Greg Bowen, who avoided the blade and managed to disarm the councillor. Mrs Arthur was opposed to criminal proceedings being brought against her son and asked police and social services to help him instead. Her statement read: 'I now realise he will hurt me if he carries on - I don’t know what I have done to deserve this. 'I want him out of my house. I want him to get the help he needs.' Mrs Arthur told police her son treated her like a dog, adding that she was terrified of him and 'living on eggshells'. In her statement she said Arthur had never had a proper job and had always relied on her for financial support. 'He has a nasty temper and has got more controlling since my husband died 22 years ago,' she said. 'Simon’s behaviour escalated last year after my twin brother Peter died. 'He told me: “It should be you that’s gone, not Peter. I hope you have an awful death”.' Mrs Arthur added: 'I try and let it go over my head but when it’s physical, I can’t excuse it.' Magistrates were told Mrs Arthur was advised by social services to write a letter to her son, asking him to leave their home. But he responded by laughing and throwing it away, the court heard. Arthur admitted to police that he had punched his mother on a number of previous occasions. Politician: Arthur, who has been jailed for four months, was elected as a Liberal Democrat councillor in the picturesque Mumbles area of South Wales . When officers asked him to indicate the force he had used on a scale of one to ten, he replied: 'Two.' Arthur, a councillor for the Newton ward on Mumbles Community Council, admitted common assault and assault by beating. Magistrates imposed a restraining order on Arthur after hearing his mother no longer wants to share her home with him. He was ordered to move out and only to visit on her instructions. Eliot Griffiths JP told him: 'Your mother is now very much in charge and you have to do what she tells you to.' The local branch of the Liberal Democrats has suspended Arthur and is expected to expel him permanently.","Simon Arthur, 44, admitted attacking his mother Isabelle outside their South Wales home .

Peter Foster, who was jailed for life after admitting to the murder of his partner, Heather Cooper, was found hanged in his cell in the early hours of this morning at HMP Lewis . A former police detective jailed for life for murdering his partner in front of their two young children was found hanged in his cell today. Peter Foster, 36, who was found guilty of murder last month was discovered by staff at Lewes Prison in the early hours of this morning. Foster stabbed Detective Constable Heather Cooper, 33, before dumping her body in Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall, West Sussex, in October last year. His death comes after Nathan Vaughan-Jones, who stabbed his stepfather to death after a long-running family feud boiled over, was found hanged at the same prison on Friday night. The 34-year-old had been jailed for 11 years in March after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of 63-year-old Nigel Ross on the grounds of diminished responsibility. A Prison Service spokesman said Foster was discovered by prison staff in the early hours of this morning: 'Prison staff tried to resuscitate him and paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at 3.25am. 'As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.' It is understood Foster was on suicide watch in prison, after the former police officer had attempted to commit suicide whilst on remand before his trial. The former Detective Constable killed Miss Cooper at the couple’s home in Haslemere, Surrey, while she was on maternity leave with her second child, who was born just weeks prior to her death. The hearing was told he hit her over the head 10 times with a baseball bat before stabbing her in the throat. Foster's death in the early hours of this morning comes just days after another prisoner was found hanged at HMP Lewes, pictured . Miss Cooper, who grew up in York, joined . Surrey Police in 2003 and worked in the Public Protection Investigation . Unit based at Guildford police station. During her career she received several letters of praise from senior officers for her work on various crimes and in 2009 was given a commendation by the force for her “'professionalism, dedication and commitment.' Sentencing Foster, Judge Richard Brown described him as an 'extremely dangerous individual' who may never be safe to be let out of prison. He said: 'This was a wicked, savage and senseless attack on a young mother in her own home. Heather Cooper, left, was murdered by her partner at the home the couple shared in Haslemere, Surrey, right . 'Not only have you taken her life, you have also deprived Joshua and Isabel of a loving mother and, no doubt, devastated her family and friends.' The judge added that aggravating factors were that the attack was carried out in front of the couple’s children, that the defendant was trained in martial arts, and the ferocity of the attack, which involved two weapons. Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, told the court Foster carried out the attack in front of the couple’s two young children, Joshua, now three, and Isabel, who was only three months old at the time. Foster took time to clean up the blood-soaked crime scene and took Miss Cooper’s body to the woodland, where he covered it with bracken, Mr Aina said. He also told his cousin, David Foster, some of the details about what happened, leading him to alert the police. The court heard that Foster then led officers to where he had hidden Miss Cooper’s body after telling them they should arrest him for murder.","Peter Foster, 36, found hanged in his cell at HMP Lewes Prison in the early hours of this morning .

A children's play centre has barred fathers from attending with their children and is now facing an investigation by equality watchdogs. Kids Go Wild is believed to be the first such play centre in the country to introduce a ‘women only’ policy – which also bans boys over the age of nine. Bosses at the centre, which opened less than a fortnight ago, claim the policy was instigated for ‘cultural reasons’ and was in the interests of the ‘predominantly Asian’ local community. The Sparkhill centre's website describes how Kids Go Wild is the 'UK's first ladies and children's only soft play centre' Even so, yesterday Muslims in the . Sparkhill suburb of Birmingham were among those who condemned the . restrictions, which were advertised on a poster outside the centre. It reads: ‘Ladies and children only. No boys over nine allowed.’ Councillor Habib Rehman, a Muslim . father-of-four, said it was a ‘worrying situation’. He added: ‘There’s . something wrong when a dad can’t take his kids to a play centre.’ Ruksana Ayub, a Muslim mother-of-one, said while Muslim women may feel . ‘more able to relax’ in a setting where they don’t ‘feel they have to . cover up’, she thought it ‘quite shocking in this day and age that men . aren’t allowed in’. Another resident, who only gave her . name as Gemma, said: ‘I have four boys, luckily all under the age of . nine, but if one of them was older, I wouldn’t be able to take any of . them. 'It’s not fair to leave one of them out.’ The children's play group has sparked a row after it banned fathers from attending with their youngsters . According to the 2001 census, Muslims . make up 54 per cent of the 30,000 population of Sparkhill – more than . double the number of Christians. The Equality and Human Rights . Commission yesterday said that under the Equality Act 2010, single sex . rules should be ‘the exception not the norm’. The manager of Kids Go Wild, who would . not give her name, said: ‘It’s a predominantly Asian community here and . we’re catering for that. 'It’s not that men are an issue, ladies are . more comfortable around women. Ladies have not questioned [the ban]. They’ve been asking for it.’ Women and children only: No father have been allowed in the centre, according to their claims (picture posed by models) Emma Cross, of Manchester-based law . firm Pannone and a specialist in discrimination law, said: ‘Under the . Equality Act it can be lawful to limit your services to one gender or . religious group, but you must be able to “objectively justify” what you . have done. ‘To my mind it would be difficult for . the centre to show it has met this test when it could have offered . women-only sessions or days of the week instead.’ An Equality and Human Rights . Commission spokesman said: ‘The Equality Act does allow for some . services to be just for women or men-only, but this is the exception not . the norm and must pass a strict test to be justifiable. ‘We will look into why Kids Go Wild is . a women-only service.’ If the commission’s lawyer considered the play . centre’s policy to be discriminatory, it would ask Kids Go Wild to . change it, the spokesman added.","Branded 'disgusting and sexist' for 'no men rule'

Her father Michael tragically died in a skiing accident in Aspen, Colorado in 1997. Conor is Kyle’s first cousin, and according to Victoria, was invited to the nuptials with Liam Kerr, a director for education reform. However, Conor never bothered to RSVP. According to the Herald, Swift and Conor showed up in the lobby of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, where fans eagerly asked the star for her autograph. The luxurious hotel, located in Boston's historic Back Bay neighbourhood, was built in 1912, and has been host to countless society events.

Family ties: Michael Kennedy, pictured in 1992 with his with wife Victoria, her father, former football pro Frank Gifford and his wife, Kathie Lee Gifford; Michael tragically died in 1997 . The mother of the bride said that the young couple left the hotel during the dinner at the reception, but returned to dance. She added that she didn’t want Swift to attend because it would take the focus off of her daughter and new son-in-law. The day after Saturday's wedding, the 22-year-old Grammy winner accompanied her boyfriend, along with his other siblings, on a sombre visit to his mother’s grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery. The New York Daily News, which obtained exclusive pictures of the visit, reported that Swift and Kennedy walked hand-in-hand to the Hyannis, Massachusetts cemetery. Exclusive video by ET shows that the couple rarely let go of each others' hands. Connor was wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts, with Swift looking summery in a red floral print A-line dress, Ray Ban sunglasses, and leather shoes. Resting place: Religious statues and American flags adorn the grave site of Mary Richardson Kennedy in Saint Francis Xavier Cemetery; at one point, Conor cleared away overgrown grass from her grave . The couple, who was seen caressing at the ceremony just a day before, appeared solemn at his mother’s grave, and at one point appeared to bow their heads in prayer, as did Kennedy’s siblings. According to the Daily News, Kennedy also reached down to clear some brambles and overgrown grass from his mother’s yet-unmarked grave. Mary Kennedy, 52, hanged herself on May 16 in a barn behind the couple’s home in Bedford, New York, amid bitter divorce proceedings and a battle with depression and addiction. Swift, who is said to be worth as much as $80million, reportedly purchased a $5million Cape Cod mansion next to the Kennedy’s sprawling estate. Before the sombre visit, the young couple attended mass together. The two have been sighted around Cape Cod and Nantucket throughout the summer, walking hand-in-hand on the Cape’s pristine beaches, and even stealing a kiss or two on the docks.

'Offended': Gary Tole, the former leader of the Glenn Miller Orchestra, claims he was criticised by his management for hiring two black players . A former bandleader of the world-famous Glenn Miller Orchestra claims he was criticised by his management for hiring two musicians because they were black. Gary Tole made the allegations in a lawsuit in which he is claiming $600,000 in damages over his dismissal in December. In papers filed to Manhattan Federal Court, Mr Tole says the band's manager Charles DeStefano questioned his decision to recruit the black musicians in June 2011. He claims Mr DeStefano told him: 'This is the Glenn Miller Orchestra, not the Count Basie Orchestra.' William 'Count' Basie was a black pianist and composer who formed and led a jazz orchestra for nearly 50 years. Glenn Miller, who set up his eponymous band in 1938, was white. Offended by the remark, Mr Tole claims he told the manager he 'intended to continue hiring the best musicians without regard to their race', according to the charges. Court battle: The Glenn Miller Orchestra in concert. Mr Tole is suing the band's management for $600,000 for breach of contract and employment discrimination over his dismissal in December . Mr DeStefano later claimed that he 'never said that', it was reported in the New York Daily News. The lawsuit says Mr Tole was fired partly because he gave seven members of the band a public dressing down at a club in Japan. Mr Tole apparently told them they 'played poorly, cursed loudly and acted in an obnoxious manner'. The players said they would quit if Mr Tole wasn't dismissed. Influential figures: The manager of the orchestra, formed by Glenn Miller (left) in 1938, allegedly made reference to famous band leader Count Basie (right) when he apparently criticised Mr Tole for hiring two black players, the lawsuit claims . Mr Tole is suing Glenn Miller Productions for breach of contract and employment discrimination. The Glenn Miller Orchestra was formed by American big band musician Glenn Miller in 1938 and became extremely popular with a number of chart hits such as In The Mood, Tuxedo Junction and Chattanooga Choo Choo. The group also found fame in Hollywood with the release of The Glenn Miller Story in 1953. Glenn Miller's death remains a mystery after he disappeared in bad weather while flying over the English Channel from London to Paris in December 1944.","Gary Tole suing band's management for $600,000 .

A university has announced it will begin urgent legal action after it was stripped of its right to admit foreign students. London Metropolitan University said it would challenge the UK Border Agency's (UKBA) decision to revoke its licence to sponsor international students. UKBA made the move last week after it found more than a quarter of a sample of the university's students did not have permission to stay in the country. Up to 2,600 foreign students have . been affected by UKBA's decision, and have until December 1 to find an . alternative course or arrange to leave the UK. Some reacted by staging protests outside Downing Street. Scroll down for video . Forced out? A foreign student at London Metropolitan University demonstrating outside Downing Street last week. The university is to take legal action to challenge the UK Border Agency's decision to revoke its licence . The university was condemned as 'very seriously deficient' at ensuring its students do not become illegal immigrants, but last night it promised it would 'defend its reputation'. In a statement, the university said: 'London Metropolitan University has tonight instructed its lawyers Penningtons Solicitors LLP to commence urgent legal action to challenge the revocation of its highly trusted status for sponsoring international students, so that its students can return to study as a matter of urgency. 'Following the leak of the UK Border agency's decision eight days ago which ""announced"" the revocation, the university has now had the opportunity to read the report. 'Working with its advisers, the university has conducted a thorough review of UKBA's ""evidence"", and in the strongest possible terms challenges the outcome.' The move to revoke London Met of its licence could cost the institution up to £30million a year, it said. The university indicated that it would announce more details of the legal action later this week. Uncertain future: Up to 2,600 foreign students are affected by the UK Border Agency's decision, which their university is to challenge . But it said that there was 'no evidence of systemic failings' at the university, and that the evidence it had given to UKBA showed it was taking every reasonable measure to be compliant with their rules. London Met also said it had been conducting checks on its international students, specifically in relation to English language and their educational ability and to check that they are legally entitled to do study at the institution. The university accused UKBA officers of 'ignoring information that was made available to them when they conducted their audit'. The statement added: 'UKBA's requirements have changed substantially at least 14 times in the last three years. 'We believe the university's approach to complying with this multitude of changes is of a standard that not only equates with practices adopted by the majority of other universities in the sector but in a number of key areas exceeds sector-wide practice.' Costly: London Metropolitan University could lose £30million a year as a result of the revocation of its licence . It continued: 'The UK has a long-standing reputation of educational excellence and for attracting genuine students from a diverse international market. 'It is not in anyone's interests for there to be a system in place which constantly changes and which forces universities, their management and their staff automatically to treat students with suspicion until proven otherwise. 'London Met is concerned that the current immigration policy is creating confusion across universities in the country and irrevocable damage to the UK's globally-recognised education sector. 'London Met appreciates that as the first UK University to be placed in this position it has a duty to the sector to try and bring an end to the damage arising from UKBA's decision. 'London Met's community will defend its reputation and along with the wider Higher Education community, the reputation of the sector at large.' London Met vice-chancellor Professor Malcolm Gillies, said: 'London Met will fight this revocation, which is based on a highly flawed report by the UKBA. 'The University will continue to give top priority to the interests of our international students who have been so distressed by this precipitate action.'

The harrowing images of dead and emaciated concentration camp victims have long stood as testament to the appalling cruelty off the Nazi regime. But now an Estonian newspaper has provoked worldwide outrage by publishing an advert for diet pills mocking the gaunt victims of Germany's largest death camp. The astonishing picture of dozens of starving men is accompanied by the strapline: 'One, Two, Three… Dr Mengele slimming pills work wonders for you! There were no thickset people in Buchenwald!' Outrage: The advert carries the strapline: 'One, Two, Three… Dr Mengele slimming pills work wonders for you! There were no thickset people in Buchenwald!' Jewish organizations have denounced Eesti Ekspress for publishing the image which ran in the paper's humor section. Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem called the mock advert in the Eesti Ekspress weekly a 'perverted attempt at humor at the expense of the Nazis' millions of victims'. Alla Jakobson, spokeswoman for Estonia's Jewish community, said in newspaper Postimees that the incident shows Estonian society is experiencing 'major problems with moral and ethical values'. More than 56,000 people are thought to have been killed in Buchenwald concentration camp, built by the Nazis near Weimar, Germany, in 1937. Sulev Vedler, deputy editor of Eesti Ekspress, said the mock advert was poking fun at an Estonian gas company that recently used an image of Auschwitz to promote its services.

A hospital in Norway has sacked a Polish cleaner after she was overheard speaking in her mother tongue during work lunch breaks. Johanna Renclawowicz received a letter saying she was fired from Sykehuset Telemark hospital because 'you have been given information that only Norwegian shall be spoken during working time'. It continued: 'Your colleagues and hospital users have repeatedly complained that Polish is spoken in the eating area, cleaning department and corridors etc.' Fired: Cleaner Johanna Renclawowicz was fired for speaking Polish during her lunch break at Sykehuset Telemark hospital (pictured) Mrs Renclawowicz was hired as temporary extra help at the hospital in Skien in August last year. The mother-of-one was one of five Polish cleaners at the hospital and soon after starting was told by a fellow Pole that speaking Polish was banned in the workplace. She said: 'It was just strange that we were expected to speak Norwegian to each other on our breaks when we’re not that fluent. 'We always tried to speak Norwegian with the Norwegian employees. 'But every time the boss heard one of us speaking Polish, she said, ""Speak Norwegian!"" She mainly complained if it happened during lunch breaks.' In January, the hospital’s unit manager began hanging up posters which read: 'At work we talk NORWEGIAN', it is claimed. Last month, Mrs Renclawowicz received a letter from her unit manager titled 'The use of language in the workplace' in which she was berated for speaking Polish. The letter added that by not speaking in Norwegian she had created a 'bad working environment'. Mrs Renclawowicz  was warned that if she continued she would be fired. She said: 'I contacted the Labour Inspectorate which told me that one cannot be dismissed because they speak in their mother tongue during non-paid meal breaks. 'But when I told this to my unit manager, she said that it was ""bulls***"" and that she could kick me out when she wanted. 'I have never been treated this way before.' Picturesque: The town of Skien is a well-known historical port . The college-educated 34-year-old from Warsaw said she and her husband had moved to Norway four years ago to find a better life and now have a three-year-old daughter. She said: 'We have a child and a mortgage, so I was devastated when I got the sack. My child is just about to start kindergarten too. Their timing was very bad.' Mrs Renclawowicz said she will now sue the hospital for discrimination and unfair dismissal. 'I will not proceed with the case because of the money, but because it is a matter of principle. I do not want anyone else to be subjected to the same thing. 'It was bad enough to lose my job, but to lose it under such circumstances was particularly stressful. 'In other hospital jobs, and in many other countries, both doctors and nurses talk together in their mother tongue during breaks in the cafeteria.' She added: 'I worked hard. One of the fellow Polish workers is a good friend of mine. It is normal we speak Polish with each other but when working we always spoke Norwegian as was requested. Just in our lunch breaks people would speak in their mother tongue.' Her lawyer, Sebastian Garstecki, confirmed she has now taken legal action against Sykehuset Telemark hospital. She said: 'The hospital has received notification about our case and has two weeks to respond. 'If they don’t we will see them in court. First and foremost, this is a matter of principle. 'The fact is that an employee speaking Polish at work in an unpaid meal break cannot be seen as a gross breach of duty. 'Her dismissal therefore is unlawful.' Mr Garstecki added that he had also reported the hospital to the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, noting that the government agency had previously deemed language directives of this kind to constitute discrimination.","Johanna Renclawowicz received a letter saying she was fired from Sykehuset Telemark hospital .

Sir Richard Branson last night launched a dramatic court bid to prevent the Government stripping him of his lucrative  rail franchise. The Virgin boss is seeking a judicial review of the decision to hand a 13-year franchise to run the West Coast Main Line to rival First Group, which bid £2billion more. His move came just hours before Transport Secretary Justine Greening was due to formally sign off the deal with FirstGroup. Scroll down for video . Blow: Sir Richard Branson's train company has lost its West Coast franchise but vowed yesterday to run it for free if Labour manages to halt the contract being signed by FirstGroup tomorrow . Miss Greening last night indicated the court action was likely to delay the signing, at least temporarily. Sir Richard branded the Government’s . decision this month ‘insane’, claiming First Group bid too much and will . either pull out of the franchise early or go bust. The billionaire entrepreneur appealed . to David Cameron to intervene, and called for the contract to be . examined by MPs. Miss Greening yesterday insisted the process had been . ‘fair’. Yesterday Virgin Trains, which has operated the West Coast line since 1997,  said the procurement process had ‘ignored substantial risks to taxpayers’. On the legal challenge, FirstGroup . said: ‘There has been no complaint about the process, which was . carefully described in advance, until Virgin Rail Group had lost.’ Following the West Coast decision by the Department for Transport (DfT), Transport Secretary Justine Greening had been due to sign off the contract this week. Virgin is now hoping that its legal challenge will delay the signing. In the past few days, Labour and members of the House of Commons Transport Committee said they hoped the final signing could be deferred until the matter could be debated in Parliament. FirstGroup Chief Executive Tim O'Toole insists the company will deliver on its winning bid . The business magnate has repeatedly expressed concerns that FirstGroup would not be able to live up to its financial and service-providing targets for West Coast. The tycoon said: 'We had hoped that Parliament or an external review would be able to scrutinise this badly-flawed process before the franchise was signed.' In a statement, Virgin said yesterday: 'Virgin Trains Limited (VTL) has yesterday commenced court proceedings in respect of the decision to award the West Coast Main Line franchise to FirstGroup. 'We have tried for three weeks to get clarity over the DfT’s decision and to have a number of key questions answered. On each occasion we have been refused information. 'We are left with no choice but to commence court proceedings as we believe the procurement process has ignored the substantial risks to taxpayers and customers of delivering FirstGroup’s bid over the course of the franchise.' Virgin went on: 'In addition it (the process) has ignored the DfT’s own assessment that VTL’s bid was more deliverable and a lower risk. We question whether FirstGroup’s bid has been correctly risk adjusted by the department given all of its supposed incremental value is delivered after 2022. 'The current process is geared to selecting the highest risk bid and needs to be independently audited to prevent a repeat of former franchise failures.' The billionaire said hopes of a Parliamentary or external review would be denied 'if the DfT follows through with its determination to rush through the process before Parliament returns next week'. He added that signing off the franchise now 'ignores the wishes of more than 150,000 people who signed the Downing Street e-petition in 10 days, the Labour Opposition, two important Commons committees and many backbench Conservative MPs who wanted a debate before the decision is taken, not a post-mortem afterwards'. Sir Richard said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the only course now available to try to unravel this sorry process.' Virgin Rail has lost its West Coast main line franchise to transport company FirstGroup, in a bidding war which Sir Richard branded 'insane' Such is his desperation for the . decision to be reviewed, the Virgin boss made an offer to run the West . Coast Main Line for free, allowing Parliament time to scrutinise the . decision, which the Virgin boss calls 'outrageous', to award the . franchise to rival FirstGroup. He has claimed that FirstGroup's bid . will lead to 'almost certain bankruptcy' and made the last-ditch appeal . to the Government to delay signing the 13-year contract on Tuesday. He said Virgin Trains and Stagecoach . would operate the joint venture on a not-for-profit basis or donate . profits to charity if the franchise needed to be extended beyond . December for a few months to allow Parliament to investigate the . decision. Transport Secretary Justine Greening had been due to sign off the contract this week . Responding to news of the legal challenge, FirstGroup said yesterday: 'We have every confidence in the DfT’s process which is rigorous, detailed and fair and in which bids are thoroughly tested. There has been no complaint about the process, which was carefully described in advance, until Virgin Rail Group had lost commercially.' FirstGroup went on: 'Our plans for the new InterCity West Coast franchise include faster journeys, new trains, more seats and more direct services from London than currently on offer. 'There will be improved wifi, better catering, refurbished stations and standard anytime fares will be reduced by 15% on average within the first two years. We look forward to welcoming passengers to their new and exciting InterCity West Coast service in December and creating a better railway for all. 'Our focus is to ensure a smooth transition with continuity for staff and passengers alike. We want to get on with delivering the many benefits and improvements we are offering without delay or disruption. We will continue to prepare for a successful start up of the new franchise on December 9.' The new West Coast franchise will last for 13 years and four months, with an option to extend to a total of 15 years. Last year, Virgin, which more than doubled annual passenger numbers during its 15-year stewardship of the line, paid a £168 million premium to the Government on West Coast. The FirstGroup bid is worth £5.5 billion at net present value, with Virgin believed to have bid £4.8 billion. FirstGroup’s annual premiums will grow steadily over the course of its franchise. Sir Richard fears that FirstGroup will run into financial difficulties in the same way that two former operators of the East Coast main line - GNER and National Express - did. He said that for Virgin to have bid more on West Coast 'would have involved dramatic cuts to customer quality and considerable fare rises which we were unwilling to entertain'.

His 62-year-old wife, Linda, was . convicted of two money-laundering charges and one of evading a liability . by deception after a six-week trial at Bradford Crown Court. Last . night, as a judge said their crimes were of the ‘utmost gravity’, fresh . details began to emerge of their extraordinary spending sprees. They splashed out £270,000 renovating . their Spanish villa, a further £160,000 on holidays,  £75,000 on a . series of luxury cruises and £25,000 on jewellery, the court heard. They . even bought a home for Hirst’s unwitting ex-wife and daughter. But it was the couple’s own wedding that was the most extravagant purchase of all. Wedding planner Julie Bussell said she . had been contacted by the couple in 2006 and was asked to throw the . ‘most expensive party ever’. Big spenders: The couple held a huge £100,000 wedding event and party at this luxury hotel in Majorca for friends and family . She set about arranging a £100,000 . weekend-long wedding reception in Majorca after the couple had already . spent £90,000 tying the knot in Las Vegas. Guests enjoyed a golf . competition, a ladies’ pampering session and a barbecue as well as the . wedding itself.

Exclusive: John and Linda Hirst stayed at the Burj-al-Arab Hotel in Dubai, centre, on their way to their honeymoon . The wedding planner who organised a £100,000 celebration for convicted Ponzi fraudster John Hirst and his wife Linda said it was the most expensive party she had ever thrown. The now-estranged couple and their adviser Richard Pollett would rub shoulders with their victims on golf courses and at Rotary Club dinners, all the while siphoning off money. After the case, wedding planner Julie Bussell, who gave evidence during the trial, told how she arranged the Hirsts' £100,000-pound wedding celebration in Majorca after they had already tied the knot in Las Vegas at a cost of more than £90,000. The court heard that during the weekend in June 2006 guests enjoyed a golf competition, a ladies' pampering session and a barbecue as well as the wedding party itself. John Hirst had also paid for some family members to fly in for the celebration. Speaking from Majorca, she said: 'They had a really fabulous venue in a five-star hotel. It was a really luxury wedding with everything they wanted. 'They paid for their family and friends to stay in the hotel. Linda hired a Rolls-Royce that she wanted to take to the church. There was a golf tournament for the men and spa treatments for the ladies, on the Sunday there was a big barbecue at the hotel with a jazz band. 'I didn't know anything about how John Hirst operated his business, he paid the contractors himself directly. He seemed a charming sort of guy.'’ But while the couple enjoyed all the . material benefits of their newfound fortune, their victims were . beginning to count the cost. Simon Bourne-Arton QC, prosecuting, . said Hirst and his accountant, Richard Pollett, 70, had defrauded . investors through the company, Gilher Inc, which was registered in . Panama and the Seychelles. Victims were promised high rates of interest in return for capital investment with their money guaranteed. In reality, the money was going to . offshore accounts controlled by Hirst, with only small amounts going . back to investors every month – but enough to persuade them the scheme . was working. Of the £10million they handed over between 2001 and 2009 the investors received only £4.6million back. The scam began to unravel in 2009 when . a series of delayed payments to investors sparked an investigation by . the Serious Fraud Office. The case finally ended on Monday when . Pollett, from Poole, Dorset, was convicted of fraud. Linda Hirst, of . Woking, Surrey, and her husband, from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, have . since split up. The pair will be sentenced on August 31 along with . Pollett. Expat Janet Corbin, originally from Manchester, lost 200,000 euros in the swindle. She said: ‘I’m delighted British justice has prevailed.’ Victim Charles Dewey, 52, lost an . estimated £200,000 and suffered a nervous breakdown as a result. He . said: ‘It is the cruelty of the fact that he preyed on people, the . majority of whom were retired.’ Hirst’s solicitor son Daniel Hirst, . 36, of Leeds, and step-daughter Zoe Waite, 36, of Send, Surrey, who had . denied money-laundering charges, were cleared by the jury.

Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay will soon be facing new competition in the kitchen - from his estranged father-in-law. Chris Hutcheson and his son Adam are launching a chain of healthy ­fast-food restaurants called Scoffs. The eateries will reportedly serve 'British tapas' for diet-conscious office workers and the first one will be opened in central London. At war: Chris Hutcheson, left, got a £2million payoff after he was dismissed by his son-in-law Gordon Ramsay . Hutcheson and Adam, who used to be head of pubs at Ramsay’s restaurant group, expects the chain to grow to 20 to 30 restaurants within 18 months. His adviser David Rawlinson said: 'Chris and Adam have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and plan to roll out the concept.' Hutcheson was dismissed in October 2010 after Kitchen Nightmares star Ramsay accused him  of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising. Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself. Glamour couple Ramsay and his wife Tana: She was one of the last to know her father had a secret family . Feud: Hutcheson and his wife Greta. His gagging order revealing details of his life was lifted in the High Court . Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. Kitchen king: Chef Gordon Ramsay . Their feud was settled after Ramsay,  married to Hutcheson’s daughter Tana, reportedly paid £2million in February to buy his father-in-law’s 30 per cent stake in the business. Ramsay previously wrote an open letter criticising Hutcheson, who hit back claiming the cook was a monster and he knew where Gordon’s 'bodies are buried'. It was not until May last year that the astonishing story behind Ramsay's decision to sack his business partner emerged when the High Court lifted a gagging order Hutcheson had taken out to hush up his double life. Tana Ramsay was among the last in her family to learn that for more than three decades Hutcheson had had a second, secret family after fathering two children by his mistress Frances Collins.

The parents of four-year-old Dylan Cecil today said they were 'completely elated' after police searching for the boy found a body. Rachel McCollum, 27, and Darren Cecil, 30, said the discovery would bring them 'closure' after days of looking for their son, who slipped into the sea off a jetty while on holiday with his family in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. The body was discovered at 12.30pm today under a floating jetty at the mouth of the River Brue, near Burnham-on-Sea Yacht Club - half a mile from where Dylan went missing. Ms McCollum said: 'As daft as it seems we feel elated - completely elated. We've got our boy back and he's not out there anymore - he's not lost at sea. 'We can put a closure on it now, move on and carry on with what we need to do. 'I know I look like I'm smiling but inside I am devastated.' Mr Cecil said: 'The thing we were worried about was him never coming back. Now we've found him we can get closure. 'Hopefully, we can get to see him again one last time.' Dylan was dragged beneath the waves after toppling off a slipway in the resort at 6pm on Sunday evening. Superintendent Keith McCoubrey, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'I can confirm today at approximately 12.30pm we recovered the body of a small boy from the banks of the estuary.

Medals and world records may be the goal for all athletes, but a Brazilian sprinter has reminded the world that sometimes just finishing the race is a courageous achievement. Yohannson Nascimento provided the Paralympics with one of its most poignant moments when after injuring himself during the men's T46 100m final he got up and hobbled over the finish line. The runner was in the lead when he pulled up with a searing pain in his leg mid-way down the track and had to look on helplessly as his rivals raced away. Scroll down for video . A devastated Yohansson Nascimento, second from right, pulls up with a leg injury in the Men's 100m T46 final and his rivals race away from him . He collapsed to the floor, but Nascimento was not going to be beaten by a cruel injury at the worst possible moment. Demonstrating the courage and determination of a true Paralympian he got up and limped slowly towards the finish. He eventually crossed the line in 1.30.79 while Xu Zhao of China won the T46 race in 11.05 seconds. The devastated athlete then sank to the ground and broke down in tears as the crowd of 80,000 cheered on his Herculean effort. His desire to finish evoked memories of British 400m runner Derek Redmond's determination to complete the final in Barcelona after he pulled a hamstring after just 150m. Wiping tears from his eyes the Brazilian sprinter rises from the floor to courageously hobble on to the finish line . The devastated athlete collapses to the floor on the track as his competitors race away from him. He eventually crossed the line in 1.30.79 while Xu Zhao of China won the T46 race in 11.05 seconds . Finally Nascimento is helped into a wheelchair by staff at the Olympic stadium before proud teammates drape the Brazilian flag around him . Redmond's will to cross the line after his father had fought past over-zealous officials to help him, is perhaps the most memorable moment of the Barcelona Games in 1992. Earlier this summer in the London Olympics 110m hurdler Liu Xiang, the poster boy of the Chinese team, had given the Games its own enduring image after he collided with the first hurdle in a qualifying heat only to carry on and finish the race. The injury agony was a sad echo of four years ago when Liu, who won gold in Athens in 2004, was denied the opportunity to repeat the feat in his home Games in Beijing four years later. Derek Redmond is helped by his father in Barcelona after tearing a hamstring in the final of the 400m in what became one of the most enduring images of the Games . In the film Cool Runnings, based on a true story, the Jamaican bobsleigh team came from nowhere to compete at the Winter Olympics in Calgary in 1988. For the first half of the final day's race it looked as though they would break the world bobsled speed record, but unfortunately their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flipped on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them metres short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish to rousing applause from spectators. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states they returned to Jamaica as heroes and at the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. In the same games Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards made the headlines as a gallant loser who overcame a series of injuries to take part in the ski jump despite having no chance of coming anywhere but last. To the sounds of cheers the Jamaican bobsleigh team carry their sled across the finish line in the film Cool Runnings, based on the story of the 1988 Winter Olympics team .

King Harold, William the Conqueror and Norwegian king Harold Hardrada may not have all spoken in a Welsh accent... but that hasn't stopped one creative teacher from bringing them to life for the sake of education. David Perkins is giving history lessons by dressing up as famous characters from the past - and filming them on YouTube for his pupils. The 28-year-old turned to fancy dress as he feared his students were bored by studying through traditional books and the blackboard. Mr Perkins, who is head of history at Duffryn High School in Newport, South Wales, bought a box of wigs and made some colourful costumes to film himself acting out the lives of the great historical figures. Scroll down for video . David Perkins, head of history at Duffryn High School in Newport, South Wales, has become a YouTube hit after posting videos of himself as historical characters to teach his pupils . One costume change later, and he is transformed into William The Conqueror as he gives a lesson on the contenders to the English throne in 1066 . Mr Perkins gets into the character of Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (who bears more than a passing resemblance to Roy Wood from Wizzard singing I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day) And he told his class of 11 to 13-year-olds: 'Go home and log onto YouTube.' His one-man historical dramas have become so popular on the internet site they are getting thousands of hits. Mr Perkins said: 'I just wanted to try a new way of presenting history and what better than YouTube? 'The kids love to see teachers making fun of themselves and they just seem more receptive - it’s had a really good reaction.' He begins by having three contenders for the English throne sit down and, in the style of a job interview, explain why they should by king in 1066. The teacher started off dressing up as William the Conqueror for the Battle of Hastings. The head of history plans to bring Elizabeth I - the Virgin Queen - to life in later videos and pathologists who examined the victims of Jack The Ripper . He also disguised himself as the last Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, who died after an arrow pierced his eye in the battle. And he also played Norwegian King Harald Hardrada, who was involved in the same year in a struggle for the English crown. Dressed in a red cape and white beard, the 'Scandinavian' proclaims to his pupils: 'When I fight wars I win wars, I am a brilliant leader.' Mr Perkins also filmed himself as medieval priest Martin Luther and a mythical monk by the name of Friar Perkins.

And he plans to bring Elizabeth I - the Virgin Queen - to life in later videosand pathologists who examined the victims of Jack The Ripper . He admits his performances are not up to the standards of Cate Blanchett or Glenda Jackson. But pupils at Duffryn High School said he has brought history lessons alive. Mr Perkins added: 'The children love using computers and mobile phones so I thought I’d try and reach them that way. 'You need to change things you are doing with the kids - if you don’t keep it fresh, it’s like everything - it becomes old and boring. 'We need to change the rules of how we deliver.' Mr Perkins and a friend used his mobile phone and a simple app to film and edit the five-minutes clips at his home in Newport. Costumes were made by his freelance fashion designer girlfriend Carley Jones, along with a few cheap wigs brought from supermarkets and second-hand shops. David said: 'I don’t have a script - I just go in front of the camera and wing it - although we’ve had to stop filming a couple of times because I am prone to get the giggles.'

The rest of the top ten are all in the U.S. Harvard University, which held the top spot for six years between 2004 and 2009, is ranked third in the list. The QS World University Rankings are compiled using six indicators: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty/student ratio, citations per faculty, international faculty ration and international student ratio. The results are based on surveys of over 46,000 academics and 28,000 employers. The proportion of international students at an institution are viewed as an indicator of the university's diversity and international attractiveness. John O'Leary, the editor of the Times Good University Guide, told the Times newspaper: 'It is vital that British universities maintain their positions among the leaders in the world both for research and the recruitment of international students. 'Their own finances depend on it and both contribute large sums to the national economy.' Last week London Metropolitan University announced it would take urgent legal action after it was stripped of its rights to admit foreign students. The UK Border Agency revoked the institution's licence to sponsor international students after it found more than a quarter of a sample of London Metropolitan students did not have permission to stay in the country. Around 2,600 foreign students at the university now have until December 1 to find an alternative course or arrange to leave the UK. London Metropolitan said it had reviewed the evidence compiled by UKBA and that it challenged the outcome in the 'strongest possible terms'.

Mr Noakes said his ‘gruelling’ year following the Queen around the world ‘nearly killed him’. He . said: 'It was a very interesting and fascinating year but it was also . very gruelling and exhausting and all the travelling nearly killed me. 'I . had with me a pad and pencils and ink and sometimes I would be two or . three feet from her while other times I was stood well back with the . crowds.

'I . had very few days off because of her extremely busy itinerary and on . average I produced more than one drawing a day. There were lots of . pictures that didn’t make it into the book.'

He also praised Prince Phillip for often stepping in when he noticed the Queen flagging slightly. He . said: 'Prince Phillip would latch on to this and take over and he would . say that he would have people laughing in 15 seconds.'Mr Noakes said he was beginning to downsize his huge collection of art work which was the reason for the sale. He . said: 'The time is going to come when my children are going to have to . sort all my art work out, it will be overwhelming for them and they . might just dump items like these in the bin.' Mr Noakes, who has previously painted the Queen, Margaret Thatcher and Bill Clinton, used various mediums for his work including pencil, pen and ink, watercolour and oil.

'No other artist has been given that sort of access to the Queen before and so works of art like these very rarely come on to the market. 'From looking at the pictures you do get the sense that the Queen leads an incredibly full life.

The name of a 10-year-old girl, accused of killing a three-month old baby has been released as she is formally charged with the infant's death. Kelli Murphy is facing reckless or criminally negligent manslaughter juvenile offence charges following the death of Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway in July. No photographs have been released of the alleged killer, as she becomes the youngest person to face the charge in the state of Maine in at least 25 years. Tragic: 10-year-old Kelli Murphy has been charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway (pictured) An autopsy on baby Brooklyn found . large quantities of prescription medication in her system, the same used . by Murphy to control her ADHD. The juvenile petition against Murphy . contains no details about the case, including Brooklyn's cause of death, . although the baby's mother, Nicki Greenaway, claims to have been told . she was suffocated. When Greenaway saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks, she said. Greenaway dropped the child off at . Murphy's mother, Amanda Huard's home on July 7, for an overnight stay. She was found dead early the following morning. Huard . is not facing charges herself, though Ms Greenaway says she holds her . responsible and the Department of Health and Human services said an . agency review showed she . had neglected the three-month-old child. 'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said the notice. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.' Deputy Attorney General William . Stokes told the Portland Press Herald that prosecutors are not pushing . for Murphy to be tried as an adult, so she will not get a jury trial. If the case goes to trial a ruling will be made by a judge who deals with juveniles. 'The whole focus of the juvenile justice system and juvenile code is to provide treatment and care and be able to deal with the conduct recognizing the juvenile is a child,' Stokes said. 'The system is designed not to look at the punitive side of things.' He added that Murphy is not . alleged to have deliberately killed the child - an act which would . typically result in a murder charge. Her initial court appearance, which may be open to the public, is scheduled for 8.30 am October 22. Tragic: Baby Brooklyn died while in the care of Murphy and her mother . Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system . Murphy had already been labeled as a . danger to children, according to documents from the DHHS which detail . that she suffers behavioral problems, including oppositional defiant . disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and attachment . disorder. Former tenants of Huard's house have claimed Murphy also harmed their baby. Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have . named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's . hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures. Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. Tenney and Hopkins were living with Amanda Huard, mother of the accused, in the basement of their home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported. They say the girl was alone with . their daughter on June 19, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and . Tenney was out at work. The . couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy . interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with . diaper changes and bathing. When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating. 'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.' As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 'She . was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she . rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 . seconds.' The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on. Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed. Shock: Ashley Tenney (left) claims Murphy was also responsible for her daughter Jaylynn's (right) hospitalisation in June . 'If her head went to the left her arm . went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high . and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.' In . Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's . house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity . disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system. So . much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been . dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the . medication on her own. In . the days following the scare Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new . place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had . deliberately hurt their own. She . said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's . bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, . others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them. The . couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and . Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four . were told that the girl should not be given care of young children. But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight. On July 9 Tenney said she was woken at 1.30am to the sound of crying, pounding footsteps and the word 'dead'. Brooklyn died during the course of that night, the ADHD drug present in her system. Speaking at the time of the charge against Murphy being brought, Greenaway told the Bangor Daily News: 'I’m definitely glad they’re finally doing something. 'I just didn’t know when they were . going to do it. [The last couple of days have been] pretty . overwhelming.' Greenaway, who reportedly has three . other children, ages 2, 15 and 16, said the last two months have been . full of 'a lot of heartache and a lot of patience.'","10-year-old Kelli Murphy has been charged in the death of three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway on July 8 .

Accused: Sheron Mancini was discovered with bars of gold in her bra, a jury was told . A woman told police she stashed two gold bars in her bra because she panicked when detectives hunting a £1million bullion heist gang arrested her, a court was told. Sheron Mancini, 53, claimed she only found the two iphone size bars each weighing up to 1kg in her coat pocket after she and her boyfriend David Gale, 55, were stopped by Belgian police and arrested. The court heard she told detectives that she had no knowledge of the bars despite being briefly frisked on her arrest earlier by motorcycle officers . She claimed it was only after being quizzed about a £1million bullion robbery and led to the cells that she discovered the bars in her coat. The jury heard how she then panicked and hid them in her underwear but when stripped searched by an officer tried to conceal them in her folded up bra placed in an examination box. It was only when the officer picked up the bra to examine it that the bars fell out, it was claimed. The Old Bailey previously heard that her partner Gale admitted being part of a gang who planned the heist of gold and silver bullion worth £1million from the back of a lorry in Belgium driven by gang member Brian Mulcahay. TV’s The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers stepdad David Chatwood, 58, Mulcahay, 46, Matthew Middleton, 42, Gary Cummings, 51, and Stanley Rose, 75, have also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.

Trial: The Old Bailey heard how the trio were part of a plot to steal bullion worth £1million from a lorry and smuggle it into the UK . Mancini is accused of trying to smuggle . the gold into the UK after the robbery which had been staged by the gang . on October 4 of last year. A week after the robbery of the British registered lorry on a Belgian motorway, Mancini and Gale were pulled over by traffic police as they headed for a Channel port. Facing jail: David Chatwood (above) has admitted his part in a plot to steal £1.1million in gold and silver bullion in Belgium . The Old Bailey jury had earlier heard . the plot was 'doomed to failure' because some of the gang were being . watched by British police and they were all soon rounded up. The jury heard in interview with Belgian police, Mancini said: 'As I put my coat on, I felt there were two unidentified objects in my coat pocket. 'I immediately realised it was not right and immediately put these objects in my bra. 'I did not even look to see what they were.' But she said she realised the gravity of the contents when she was searched, adding: 'It was then that I knew these items were in fact gold bars. 'I had to take off my bra and put it in a box. 'I had folded the bra in such a way that the items were not visible. 'As a female police officer picked up the bra, the gold bars fell out.' But the Belgian police dismissed her story as 'implausible' with an inspector saying they thought the bars had been sitting in her bra from the beginning. Mancini maintains she was telling the truth. She is standing trial along with John Corley, 53, and father and son Andreas and Kayracos Nicolas, 50 and 30. The trial continues.

Tourists at the campsite where Saad Al-Hilli and his family were staying say they saw a suspicious eastern European man hanging around days before the family were shot dead. A Dutch couple staying at the the three-star Village Camping Europa site in the village of St Jorioz said they noticed the smartly dressed man there at the same time as the Al-Hillis. They added that they did not see anyone visit the family, but noticed the unusual man because he was dressed in a smart jacket while others at the site were wearing typical tourist clothes. Scroll down for video . Switch: A Dutch couple said the massacre family had . intended to stay for a week at the three-star Village Camping Europa . site in the village of St Jorioz, but they switched sites two days before they . were gunned down . The family left Europa after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy . The couple described the man as of . ‘eastern European appearance like someone from the Balkans’. The . Al-Hillis left that site after two nights and moved to the La Solitude . du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy. The revelation prompted speculation . that Mr Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and mother-in-law . Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, may have had a disagreement with someone at the . first site. Saad al-Hilli, 50: Shot in the head . All three were shot in the head in last Wednesday’s massacre in the mountains. The Al-Hillis’ eldest daughter, . Zainab, seven, survived after being pistol-whipped and shot in the . shoulder while her four-year-old sister, Zeena, lay undiscovered under . her dead mother’s skirt in the family’s BMW for eight hours. A source close to the investigation . confirmed detectives were in the process of identifying several people . who met the family during their brief stay at the Village Camping Europa . site. According to witnesses, Mr Al-Hilli, . an aeronautical engineer, was seen regularly leaving the campsite alone – . while a mystery man was seen wandering around during the time the . family was there. Dutch campers Jan Janssen and . Anne-Marie Souderman said the Al-Hilli family checked in on Saturday, . September 1 and left two days later. They did not book in advance and . used a discount voucher to claim a reduction on the 30 euros (£24) a . night charge. They were given a prime spot close to the swimming pool. Mr Janssen said: ‘We were told they . planned to stay all week but they left suddenly.  The father left the . site in his car alone four or five times each day. He went out for 20 or . 30 minutes each time. ‘The first time we thought he was . going to the shops, but it was very odd to go out so often. We saw the . grandmother and the older girl. They only had the caravan and we thought . it looked cramped for five people.’ It also emerged yesterday that a single weapon was used to carry out the murders. Detailed ballistic analysis of 25 . spent cartridges found at the murder scene close to Lake Annecy has . shown they all came from one 7.65mm sub-machine gun, probably a . Czech-made Skorpion. There would have been virtually no sound if, as seems likely, the gun was fitted with a silencer. Murder weapon?

The revelation prompted fresh . speculation that just one person – a highly-trained contract killer – . was responsible for the frenzied shootings. Saad Al-Hilli had blocked his late . father’s will just four weeks before he was murdered, it was revealed . last night. Documents reveal how Mr Al-Hilli had taken out a caveat . effectively to stop his brother Zaid, 53, from receiving part of their . father Kadhem’s fortune. It was put in place on August 8. The formal legal notice reveals the . bitter dispute at the heart of the Iraqi refugee family. Wealthy Kadhem, . a retired factory owner, had been missing from his home in Malaga, . Spain, for six days before he was found dead in August last year. He is understood to have owned a . multi-million-pound portfolio covering properties in Spain, France and . Switzerland, together with a £1million mock-Tudor home in Claygate, . Surrey, where Saad lived with his family. 'Suspicious items': Police and bomb disposal experts at the Al-Hilli home yesterday .

Neighbours living close to the property in the affluent village of Claygate were prevented from returning to their houses as detectives examined the house for clues . Emergency: Reports suggest the investigation is focused around a shed in the property . French prosecutors have previously . revealed that British police have said they are investigating a . ‘conflict about money’ between the Al-Hilli brothers. Details of their . relationship came to light over the weekend when it emerged that Saad . had written a letter last year describing his older brother as a . ‘control freak’ who he wanted to ‘wipe’ out of his life. Zaid, a former public relations . executive, has strenuously denied there had been any feud and is said to . be ‘devastated’ by the deaths. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also shot dead after apparently stumbling on the bloodbath. In her first haunting words since she was brought out of her coma, the girl of seven who survived the French Alps massacre told detectives: ‘I was so scared. What is happening?’ Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was ‘still frightened’ by what she saw. The Surrey schoolgirl was pistol-whipped around the head and shot in the shoulder by whoever killed her parents and grandmother. Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was 'still frightened' by what she saw after coming out of her coma at the CHU hospital in Grenoble . One theory is that her life was spared because the killer ran out of bullets. But her memory does not appear to have been damaged and detectives are confident she will be able to provide vital clues about Wednesday’s atrocity. A respected French radio station yesterday reported Zainab’s first distressing words after emerging from her medically-induced coma in hospital. Her maternal aunt, Fadwa Al-Saffar, a pharmacist who recently finished a PhD at the University of Reading, was at Zainab’s bedside when she woke. It is thought Mrs Al-Saffar may now take custody of Zainab and her four-year-old sister Zeena, who lay hidden for eight hours under her dead mother’s skirt in the family’s BMW. Delayed reaction: Several hours after police arrived on scene, Mr Al-Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena was found alive huddling under her mother's legs inside the car . Eric Maillaud, the chief prosecutor leading the inquiry, said: ‘Zainab has been in a coma and is under sedatives and cannot be questioned for now. ‘The members of her family who came are by her side. Without doubt, it is their responsibility to inform her of the death of her family. We hope that the age of seven is the age of reason and that she will be able to provide descriptions about the number of people, whether men or women, the colour of their clothes, and who could have committed this.’ He added: ‘We hope she will provide lots of information, but the interview will be an extremely delicate one.’ Security remains tight around the Grenoble University Hospital where Zainab is being kept under police guard.","Dutch couple said family had .

First aiders who came to the rescue of Joe Compton found him  unconscious, face down in the mud outside Dorcan Academy in Swindon, Wiltshire. The year seven pupil suffered severe burns and went into cardiac arrest after he was struck by the bolt at 3.10pm yesterday afternoon. Lightning strike victim: This is the first picture of year-seven pupil Joe Compton, 11, who was struck by lightning as he left school in Swindon yesterday afternoon . Stuart Arthur, 37, who was standing in the reception at Dorcan Recreation Centre when the storm hit, arrived first on the scene to administer CPR. 'I heard a horrendous crack and there was a bright white light - I knew then that something was wrong,' said Mr Arthur, who is operations manager at the leisure centre. 'I ran outside and found the young lad face-down and unconscious. Luckily the training kicked in and we were able to perform emergency procedures on him. 'We assessed whether he was breathing and it was apparent that he was not so I started CPR. 'While I was performing CPR we got no immediate response but we were not really expecting any, you don't tend to get a response straight away.' Emergency treatment: Stuart Arthur, left, was first to administer CPR on Joe. His colleague Stephanie Woodman grabbed a defibrillator and rushed to help . Mr Arthur continued CPR while other staff members ushered on cars and comforted Joe's sister, who had witnessed the incident. His colleague Stephanie Woodman, 38, who was also in reception when the bolt struck, grabbed a defibrillator and rushed to help. The assistant manager said: 'We heard this amazing sound and just as a lightning bolt struck, it sounded like a big explosion. 'I didn't know what it was, I just grabbed the emergency kit and went running out. It could have been a car crash, an explosion or anything, it was so loud. 'Then I just saw him lay on the floor and I began to clean him up and put on the defibrillator.' Ms Woodman used the defibrillator to monitor Joe's heartbeat but did not use it properly before paramedics arrived to take over. Home time horror: The Dorcan Academy in Swindon where Joe is a pupil . Paramedics arrived at the scene in six . minutes and managed to revive the youngster before taking him to Great . Western Hospital in Swindon, where he was treated before being . transferred to the specialist major trauma centre at Frenchay Hospital, . in Bristol. He was . 'conscious and breathing' when he arrived at Great Western but medics . there last night said he suffered 'potentially life threatening . injuries'. Pippa Smith, 24, a teacher at the school said the clash of thunder had made her and a fellow teacher scream in shock. She . said: 'It was very loud and sounded like it was right over head, when . the thunder came myself and another teacher just screamed. 'It was very loud and very scary. There was a really bright light and then the bang. It only struck once.' The .

The . large school, which specialises in technology for pupils aged 11-16 is . situated next to a busy sports centre, but none of the users had . witnessed the lightning strike. Injuries: Joe suffered severe burns and went into cardiac arrest after the strike . A . spokesman for Great Western Ambulance Service said: 'We received a 999 . call from the school regarding a pupil, believed to be an 11-year-old . boy, reportedly being struck by lightning. 'We had a paramedic on the scene at 3.16pm, backed up by an ambulance crew a few minutes later. 'There were first aiders from the school performing CPR as the boy had gone into a cardiac arrest.

How best after the ‘plebs’ crisis for ministers to demonstrate solidarity with hard-pressed Britons? The answer, according to George Osborne and two Cabinet colleagues, is apparently to down tools early and go to the opera. The Chancellor, along with Education Secretary Michael Gove and Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, took prime seats for a near-six-hour performance at the Royal Opera House on Wednesday afternoon. Despite the economic crisis, they all managed to knock off early to attend the 4pm start for the second instalment of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen. Chancellor George Osborne (left) along with Culture Minister Ed Vaizey (centre) and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) enjoyed prime seats for a performance at the Royal Opera House on Wednesday afternoon . It is sung entirely in German and lasted five hours and 50 minutes. Yesterday, the ministerial trio risked being dubbed the ‘three tenors of Whitehall’ for placing their opera treat ahead of all other priorities. And nor could they claim to be doing their bit for the economy after it emerged they paid nothing for their seats. Each was a freebie, gifted by the Royal Opera House which sent out lavish invitations to VIPs for the sought-after performance. While ordinary punters had to shell out . up to £250 for tickets - most of which sold out within an hour - the . minsters were given some of the best seats in the house. Tory Chief whip Andrew Mitchell has been accused of branding Police officers 'plebs' The Chancellor - who famously vowed to the 2009 Conservative Party conference: ‘We’re all in this together’ - and his comrades were spotted in the sumptuous box of the Royal Opera House’s chief executive, Tony Hall. They would have been offered complimentary fine wines and other refreshments to sustain them during the afternoon and evening. While his two Cabinet colleagues took front row seats in the box, Mr Osborne seemed less keen to be spotted, taking a seat behind them. Mr Hall, a former senior executive at the BBC, invited the ministers because they had a ‘particular interest’ in the rare Wagner performance, said a Royal Opera House spokesman. He said: ‘It was an invitation from the chief executive to sit in his box. ‘We invite not just members of Parliament but people from different walks of life to tell them about what we do here.’ The government is still reeling from another elitism crisis after Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of swearing at policemen in Downing Street and calling them ‘plebs’. David Cameron and Mr Osborne, who were both members of the infamous Bullingdon dining club at Oxford University, have long struggled to shake off the impression they are out of touch with ordinary working Britons. Outspoken Tory MP Nadine Dorries recently branded them both ‘arrogant posh boys’. Yesterday Mr Vaizey added to the impression of being a ‘minister for fun’ by complaining he was not allowed to have a computer games console in his office. In an interview with the Independent newspaper, he blamed the ‘powers that be’ for refusing his request as inappropriate. ‘I . was encouraged not to, in case it looked frivolous,’ said. ‘But I think . I will renew my campaign. I have a television so why can’t I have a . games console?’ Mr . Vaizey, 44, who says he plays the popular Angry Birds game on his iPhone . and Monopoly on his iPad, maintains that he needs the console because . the gaming industry is an important sector of the British economy. Last . night, neither the Treasury nor the Department for Education responded . to requests for comment on Mr Osborne and Mr Gove’s trip to the opera. David Cameron and Mr Osborne, who were both members of the infamous Bullingdon dining club at Oxford University, have long struggled to shake off the impression they are out of touch with ordinary working Britons . Mr Vaizey’s spokesman said: ‘The performance ran for 5hrs 50mins including intervals, hence the earlier-than-normal start.’ He said that as Culture Minister, Mr Vaizey was ‘expected’ to support the publicly-funded Royal Opera House by attending performances ‘from time to time, as his diary allows’. ‘He greatly enjoyed the production which he believes will, in time, be judged an artistic triumph and become a big earner for the company,’ said the spokesman. He added: ‘I wouldn’t take the comments about having a games console in his office too seriously. He is minister responsible for the UK video games industry, which is one of our really big economic success stories in recent times, so it’s not too surprising that he would like to be able to show off the best amongst them to visitors to his office, but having a console is not his highest priority at the moment and he would most certainly not expect public money to be spent providing one.’","The Chancellor, Education .

People lurking behind a wall - or buried after an earthquake - can clearly be seen in 3D using the camera, which fires ultrafast laser pulses at walls 'behind' the area that can't be seen, to capture a ghostly 3D reflection. Scroll down for video . The camera 'bounces' ultrafast laser pulses off a wall behind a hidden subject - and computers inside 'rebuild' the information into a 3D image of what's hidden . The technique is similar to using a mirror to see round a corner - but instead of a mirror, the 'reflection' is reconstructed from laser light that scatters back off a wall. The camera 'times' the beams of light as . they bounce back to its sensors, and builds an image, which is slightly . wobbly, but precise to ranges of just one centimetre. Ramesh Raskar and colleagues used ultrafast pulsed lasers in the research published in Nature Communications - the incredibly rapid laser bursts allow them to time the light as it 'returns' to the camera, building a 3D model. The system performs the procedure several times, bouncing light off several different spots on the wall, so that it enters the room at several different angles. The detector, too, measures the returning light at different angles. By comparing the times at which returning light strikes different parts of the detector, the system can piece together a picture of the room. 'Four years ago, when I talked to people in ultrafast optics about using femtosecond lasers for room-sized scenes, they said it was totally ridiculous,' says Ramesh Raskar, an associate professor at the MIT Media Lab, who led the new research. The team use repeated laser bursts to build a 3D image of the 'hidden areas' of rooms . Raska hopes that a future version of the system could be used by emergency responders - firefighters looking for people in burning buildings or police determining whether rooms are safe to enter - or by vehicle navigation systems, which could bounce light off the ground to look around blind corners.","Could be used for car navigation systems that 'see' round blind corners .

Airlines are on course to nose-dive into the red as the number of first and business class passengers are slashed across Europe because of economic turbulence, high taxes and cost-cutting, air industry bosses revealed today. European carriers are expected to be worst affected and post combined losses of around £750million in 2012, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted today. The drop in lucrative First Class and Business Class travel mirrors the poor economic climate as firms cut costs by sending their executives in economy, or fly with low-cost budget airlines. Cutbacks: Hard-pressed businesses are making more and more executives travel in economy class or with low cost airlines . Continental European countries hit by the eurozone debt and currency crisis are among the worst affected. The forecast has intensified calls by British airlines to reduce or scrap completely UK’s controversial  Air Passenger Duty (APD) airport departure tax – dubbed the ‘poll-tax of the skies - which has increased steadily since its introduction in 1994. IATA also hinted at the lack of a controversial Third runway at Heathrow which is bursting at the seams and operating at 99 per cent capacity as it noted: 'Not only is the economy weak with the eurozone crisis, Europe has some very unfriendly conditions for doing business—onerous regulations, high taxes, insufficient capacity at many key airports and an air traffic management system badly in need of modernization.’ IATA said  airlines in some countries were facing an ‘uphill struggle with high taxes, onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure’. It noted that in July, on the lucrative North Atlantic routes to and from the USA, first class and business class travel - known as premium travel - was 2.4% down on the same time last year. But within Europe in July 2012 premium travel was down even more – by  3.5%. 'Poll-tax of the skies': The poor results will intensify calls for a reduction in UK Air Passenger Duty . IATA said: ‘European airlines are expected to post the largest loss of any region. While governments and the European Central Bank have taken measures to shore up confidence in the euro, these have been fraught with political difficulties. ‘Additionally, the region is plagued by high taxes, inefficient air traffic management infrastructure and an onerous regulatory environment.’ Overall, IATA predicted that world airline profits will reach around £2.56 billion in 2012 - a dip on the 2011 figure of around £5.25 billion in 2011 but higher than IATA’s forecast for this year made in June 2012. Capacity: The report's criticisms will be siezed on by supporters of a third runway at Heathrow . Speaking in Singapore today, IATA director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: ‘Aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles. Growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that - linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets. ‘Aviation connectivity spurs growth at both ends. That is why it is important for governments to ensure aviation’s ability to be a catalyst for growth is not constrained. ‘Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, it is an uphill struggle with high taxes, onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure. All of this stunts industry growth to the detriment of the world economy.’ On a knife-edge: The airline industry has struggled to adapt to rising oil prices . He added:’Europe is among the regions most in need of the economic growth that aviation can provide. Yet we still see high taxes, cumbersome regulation and capacity constraints. There are lessons for Europe to learn from other parts of the world.’ Mr Tyler said that airlines were nevertheless doing well to cope with  the difficult economic times: ‘Even six years ago, generating a profit with oil at $110/barrel (Brent) would have been unthinkable. The industry has re-shaped itself to cope by investing in new fleets, adopting more efficient processes, carefully managing capacity and consolidating. But despite these efforts, the industry’s profitability still balances on a knife-edge, with profit margins that do not cover the cost of capital.’ He added:‘Aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles. Growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that—linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets. Mixed fortunes: British Airways parent IAG says demand demand for premium leisure travel is up, but is heading towards a 'small operating loss' for 2012 . British Airways’ parent company IAG, which also oversees Spain’s  Iberia,  said it did not  make specific  predictions on future premium traffic by region. But it admitted it is heading towards ‘a small operating loss’ for this year. It said it had bucked the trend in August and seen its global premium traffic rise by 12.6 per cent compared with last year. This, it said,  reflected British Airways’ successful commercial strategy to stimulate demand for first and business class leisure travel. But in its trading outlook  disclosed on August  3  for its second quarter results, IAG reported: ‘We were previously targeting a break-even operating result this year, after the impact of restructuring costs and the short term earnings drag from the bmi acquisition.  However, in the light of the Spanish macro headwind, we now expect to make a small operating loss in 2012. ‘ . Last month IAG added: ‘Underlying market conditions remain unchanged from guidance given at Quarter Two results. Trading conditions at our London hub remain firm. Performance at Madrid continues to be impacted by weak economic conditions, with short haul traffic particularly affected.’","International Air Transport Association predicts combined loss of £750million for European carriers in 2012 .

David Cameron’s new Minister for Women called yesterday for a change in the abortion laws to reduce the deadline for terminations. Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also in charge of women’s issues and equalities policy, said the legal limit for abortions should be cut from 24 weeks to 20. She said advances in medical science mean many very premature babies can now be saved. The Tory MP, a mother of three, first voted for the change in 2008 when it was put forward in a backbench Bill by Tory MP Nadine Dorries. Asked yesterday whether she still believed the reduction was necessary, she replied: ‘Absolutely. You have got to look at these matters in a commonsense way. ‘I looked at it from the really important stance of the impact on women and children.’ Mrs Miller, who described herself as ‘a very modern feminist’, said she was ‘driven by the very practical impact that late-term abortion has on women’. She added: ‘What we are trying to do here is not to put obstacles in people’s way but to reflect the way medical science has moved on.’ Pro-abortion campaigners argue that few terminations are carried out after 20 weeks, usually on medical grounds. They see the drive to lower the deadline as an attack on wider abortion rights. They are already angry at the appointment as Health Secretary last month of Jeremy Hunt, who has voted for the abortion limit to be reduced to 12 weeks in the past. Support: The proposal is supported by backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries, pictured, who is pushing for a fresh review of abortion limits this autumn . Darinka Aleksic, of Abortion Rights, said: ‘The fact that the minister responsible for women and equalities wants to restrict access to abortion, one of the most important women’s health services, is really alarming. ‘Her appointment, alongside Jeremy Hunt at the Department of Health, who would like to see abortion severely restricted, does nothing to inspire confidence in the government’s commitment to women’s right to choose.’ In an interview before the last election, Mr Cameron also backed calls for the abortion limit to be lowered to 22 weeks or 20 to take account of medical advances. The Department of Health stressed yesterday that it had ‘no plans’ to review the abortion laws, which are traditionally decided by votes of conscience in the Commons. 'We are trying to reflect the way medical science has moved on.’- Culture Secretary Maria Miller . An aide to Mrs Miller also said she was not pressing for action on abortion within government, but merely restating her ‘strongly held view’. But Mrs Dorries, who has led a series of attempts to change the abortion laws in recent years, said she would press for a fresh review this autumn. She praised Mrs Miller for speaking out on the issue despite her ministerial position. ‘Maria Miller is very strong and very brave to speak out in this way. ‘Many ministers do not like to talk about the issue for fear of being targeted by pro-abortion campaigners, so I am delighted that she has made her views  very clear. Mrs Dorries said the 24-week limit was ‘unsustainable’ now that babies born earlier than this can sometimes be saved. ‘The facts have not changed since the 2008 vote – the problem is that Parliament has so many socially liberal MPs that it has become completely out of touch with public opinion.’","Women's Minister Maria Miller said medical advances means premature babies can be saved .

Camilla decided to adopt the adorable puppy, now nine weeks old, from world-famous rescue centre Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, who nursed Bluebell back to health. New addition: Bluebell the Jack Russell who was abandoned in a public park at four weeks old . It is the second time that Prince Charles's wife has stepped in to offer a home to an unwanted dog. Last year the Mail revealed that she had taken on another Battersea rescue pup called Beth, also a Jack Russell. The pairing was such a success that after the recent loss of her two eldest dogs, Tosca and Rosie, the Duchess couldn't resist when the charity contacted her about another waif. A spokesman for the Duchess - who has owned several generations of Jack Russell puppies - explained that Bluebell, who was named by staff at the rescue centre, had a 'really awful' start in life. The Duchess of Cornwall pictured with former pet Tosca, a nine-year-old Jack Russell . 'She was just four weeks old when she was found by a member of the public in quite a bad way,' they said.

A source close to Camilla, who picked up her new dog last week, added: 'Beth is a delightful dog and has been wonderful with the Duchess's five young grand-children - Bluebell is a very welcome addition to the family.' Like Beth, Bluebell will have the run of several palatial residences including Ray Mill, the Duchess's Wiltshire home, Prince Charles's country residence Highgrove as well as Clarence House and Birkhall, his Scottish estate. Camilla was treated like any other potential owners, however, and had to pay a £105 rehoming fee which covers the charity's costs as well as microchipping, initital vaccinations, flea and worming treatments and a new collar, identification tag and lead. Battersea does not receive any government funding and is totally reliant on publication bequests and donations. Claire Horton, chief executive of the home, said: 'Once again the Duchess of Cornwall ahs given a second chance in life to a Battersea dog in need. Bluebell arrived at Battersea having had such an awful start in life, so we couldn't be happier that she caught the eye of the Duchess and now has such a wonderful home.

Eye of the storm: The drill bit on the Curiosity was screwed in to place in an unsterile environment - sparking fears we may end up 'seeding Mars with life' When the Curiosity finally extends its drill and bites into the dusty surface of the Red Planet, Nasa scientists will be quietly hoping that the Mars rover will not find ice beneath the surface. For if it does, it will blow open a scandal that has been 'simmering' inside Nasa for the last year: the fact that the drill bits may well be infected with Earth bacteria - bacteria which could survive on Mars. The possible contamination occurred six months ago, when engineers peeked inside the drill mechanism without permission in order to attach one more piece. If the drill touches water, there is every chance the bacteria could live. This would be a crisis for Nasa: to meddle with the biological make-up of planet which, for all we know so far, may still have native microbes of its own kind. According to the LA Times, Nasa does . not expect to find water - the space agency chose the dry equatorial . landing site in Mars' Gale Crater to study the planet's geology, not in a . bid to find water or ice. But, . the paper adds: 'If by chance the rover Curiosity does find H2O, a . controversy that has simmered at NASA for nearly a year will burst into . the open.' The potential . contamination occurred on November 26 last year, after the drill bits . had been sterilised and placed in a box, which would not be opened again . until a successful touchdown on Mars. But . engineers were worried that a rough landing could damage the drill bits . - and opened the box to add one more drill bit and increase their . chances of success. According . to the LA Times, the engineers screwed the drill bit directly into the . drill - so that if the loading mechanism failed, Curiosity at least had . one shot of a successful dig. Untampered with: Curiosity is returning stunning images of an untouched Martian landscape - unless we have sent microbes to the planet . The . paper adds that under Nasa's procedures, the box should not have been . opened without 'the knowledge of a NASA scientist who is responsible for . guarding Mars against contamination from Earth' But . Planetary protection officer Catharine Conley told the paper: 'They . shouldn't have done it without telling me - it is not responsible for us . not to follow our own rules.' The . blunder was apparently spotted before launch, but - as it was too close . to launch - Nasa officials took a 'calculated risk' to send Curiosity . onwards. David Lavery, . program executive for solar system exploration, said: 'Water or ice near . the surface in Gale Crater was not a significant probability. 'We weighed that against the risks of not having a bit mounted in the drill prior to launch, and the specter of not being able to drill any holes at all on Mars. 'Of course, there is always a possibility that Mars will surprise us.' He added that the box was unsealed in a near-sterile environment, and Nasa later altered the mission scenario to say that Curiosity could interact with the surface of Mars 'as long as there is no ice or water'. Lastly, the LA Times spoke to John D. Rummel, a professor of biology at East Carolina University, who said: 'It will be a sad day for NASA if they do detect ice or water. 'That's because the Curiosity project will most likely be told, ""Gee, that's nice. Now turn around"".' Many microbes have proven - both through controlled tests and accidental exposure - that they can survive the vacuum and cosmic radiation of space, and at least one species has survived Martian-like conditions in the laboratory.

Today should see the opening shots fired as the billion-dollar Apple v Samsung patent case gets underway in a San Jose courtroom. The two bitter rivals are arguing over a cluster of phone patents, each alleging that the other is infringing on intellectual property as they vie for top place in the smartphone wars. Both companies are seeking potentially billions of pounds from each other in royalties - and whatever decision the 10 people on the jury takes, it is likely to will change the industry forever. Opening arguments are expected today to . decide the merits of Apple claims that Samsung smartphones and computer . tablets are 'illegal knockoffs' of the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S II: Apple claims Samsung ripped off their phone with the Galaxy range . If the case goes Apple's way, Samsung may be forced to pay out $2.5billion, and experts say the Android community may find itself mired in lawsuits - with Google itself dragged into the fight. If the case goes Samsung's way, Apple may need to pay out on patents owned by Samsung - and this may mean iPhone prices will increase. Opening arguments in federal court will be followed by Apple calling its first witness, a company designer. The witness lists of both sides are . long on experts, engineers and designers and short on familiar names. Apple CEO Tim Cook, for example, is not scheduled to testify. Apple filed a lawsuit against the . South Korean company last year alleging smartphones and computer tablets . made by the world's largest technology company are illegal knockoffs of . Apple's popular iPhone and iPad products. To the consumers, they are . arch-rivals, with the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone competing directly . with the iPhone and being the runaway success of Android handsets. In the courts the fighting is even . more fierce, with Apple repeatedly trying to stop Samsung selling phones and tablets around . the world. But in business, Samsung is one of . Apple's top suppliers - and Apple will spend an estimated £7billion on Samsung . parts for their products, including iPhones and iPads, this year. The . amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current . terms of their contract, according to a deal reported earlier this year. The Korea Times said that Apple . bought around £4.9billion worth of parts from Samsung in 2011 including . displays, mobile application processors, NAND flash chips and mobile . memory. You will find Samsung processors, displays and memory chips inside the new iPad. Apple's much-admired 'Retina' displays are also manufactured by Samsung. Apple is demanding $2.5 billion in damages, an award that would dwarf the largest patent-related verdict to date. Samsung countered that Apple is doing . the stealing and that some of the technology at issue - such as the . rounded rectangular designs of smartphones and tablets - has been . industry standards for years. The case is just the latest skirmish . between the companies over product designs. A similar trial began last . week, and the two companies have been fighting in courts in the United . Kingdom and Germany. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh last . month ordered Samsung to pull its Galaxy 10.1 computer tablet from the . U.S. market pending the outcome of the upcoming trial, though she barred . Apple attorneys from telling the jurors about the ban. 'That's a pretty strong statement . from the judge and shows you what she thinks about some of Apple's . claims,' said Brian Love, a Santa Clara University law professor and . patent expert. He said that even though the case . will be decided by 10 jurors, the judge has the authority to overrule . their decision if she thinks they got it wrong.

Scientists have taken an  important step towards helping visually impaired people lead independent lives after a bionic eye gave a blind Australian woman partial sight. Dianne Ashworth, who has severe vision loss due to the inherited condition retinitis pigmentosa, was fitted with a prototype bionic eye in May at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. It was switched on a month later, and today researchers revealed the results. Scroll down for video . A prototype of the bionic eye created by Bionic Vision Australia (BVA), who said today they had successfully implanted the 'world first' bionic eye prototype . 'It was really funny when it switched on I was waiting, waiting,' she said. 'I had these goggles on and I didn't know what to expect, and I don't know if anyone did know what I was going to see. 'Then all of a sudden I went 'yep' I could see a little flash and it was like a little, I suppose, a splinter. 'There were different shapes and dark black, lines of dark black and white lines together. 'Then that turned into splotches of black with white around them and cloud-like images. 'I can remember when the first bigger image came I just went ""Wow"", because I just didn't expect it at all but it was amazing.' The bionic eye, designed, built and tested by the Bionic Vision Australia, a consortium of researchers partially funded by the Australian government, is equipped with 24 electrodes with a small wire that extends from the back of the eye to a receptor attached behind the ear. It is inserted into the choroidal space, the space next to the retina within the eye. 'The device electrically stimulates the retina,' said Dr Penny Allen, a specialist surgeon who implanted the prototype. 'Electrical impulses are passed through the device, which then stimulate the retina. Those impulses then pass back to the brain, creating the image.' Surgeon Dr Penny Allen (R) performing an eye examination on Ms Dianne Ashworth (L), who has become the first recipient of a radical 'bionic eye' The device restores mild vision, where patients are able to pick up major contrasts and edges such as light and dark objects. Researchers hope to develop it so blind patients can achieve independent mobility. 'Di is the first patient of three with this prototype device, the next step is analyzing the visual information that we are getting from the stimulation,' Allen said. The operation itself was made simple so it can be readily taught to eye surgeons worldwide. 'We didn't want to have a device that was too complex in a surgical approach that was very difficult to learn,' Allen. Similar research has been conducted at Cornell University in New York by researchers who have deciphered the neural code, which are the pulses that transfer information to the brain, in mice. How it works - the bionic eye implant uses special glasses to send data to an implant in the brain. It has already been implanted successfully . There, researchers have developed a prosthetic device that has succeeded in restoring near-normal sight to blind mice. According to the World Health Organization, 39 million people around the world are blind and 246 million have low vision. 'What we're going to be doing is restoring a type of vision which is probably going to be black and white, but what we're hoping to do for these patients who are severely visually impaired is to give them mobility,' Allen said. Earlier this year, a British team implanted a similar implant for the first time, and have already placed it in two other patients who are waiting for their devices to 'bed in' before they are switched on.","Australian woman was first to receive radical implant .

The 39-year-old, who did not want to be named, said he and his family returned to their home after a vacation and noticed nothing untoward until pictures began to surface online. ‘I'm looking at them like, “Wait, this is my house!” They are running around doing lewd things with funnels, throwing up in the sink, passed out on the kitchen floor,’ the man told WCNC news.

The man recognised the teenagers in the photographs as one of his children’s classmates. He added that the uninvited guests told his son that the party happened around July 4 – when the family were away on a trip to New York. After seeing the photos on the social networking site, the family spotted that a screen to an unlocked window appeared to have been wrenched up. But none of them spotted any damage to the house in Tega Cay, South Carolina, and only became aware of the party three months after their return when the pictures appeared online. In the pictures posted on Facebook, one man is seen parading round the house with a funnel. In another photograph, the group of revellers are posing with drinks in the living room. The party didn't look to have been limited to just the living area either. There is a picture of a topless teenage boy giving a thumbs up while perched on the edge of one of the beds.

Last laugh: Nick Buckles has kept his job as Chief Executive of Olympics blunder security firm G4S . The head of bungling security firm G4S will keep his job despite an independent review finding the company guilty of ‘mishandling’ its Olympic contract. Embattled Nick Buckles, whose pay and benefits package was worth £5.3million last year, had been widely expected to lose his lucrative post over the fiasco. But instead, two of his deputies will pay the price for the group’s failures during the Games. The company’s UK boss David Taylor-Smith and events chief Ian Horseman Sewell have both resigned. G4S signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 Games security guards, but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted . shifts and could not deliver and the army was drafted in. A damning report by accountancy firm Pricewaterhouse- Coopers found the company’s handling of the deal was ‘ineffectual’. It said the group was ‘capable of fulfilling the contract’ but ‘did not recognise’ the scale of the work, and listed a catalogue of errors, including bad management. Controversially, however, PwC said it was not ‘in the best interests of the company’ for Mr Buckles to leave, despite the fact he was twice dragged in front of MPs to explain the fiasco. G4S said in a statement: 'Whilst . the CEO has ultimate responsibility for the company's performance, the . review did not identify significant shortcomings in his performance or . serious failings attributable to him in connection with the Olympic . contract.' Labour MP Keith Vaz, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee and led the hearings into the G4S blunders, said the decision to keep Mr Buckles was ‘not closure’. But G4S chairman John Connolly said: ‘[Mr Buckles] couldn’t be expected to in detail be responsible for every large contract.’ Chief operating officer David Taylor-Smith, pictured left, is one of two senior directors to have resigned after the G4S Olympics security fiasco . The report said the contract problems . were largely specific to the Olympics, with the company not planning . sufficiently for the scale and complexity of what was needed. Taylor-Smith was responsible for the contract and for ensuring it was delivered on budget and on time, while Sewell was the account director who said just before the Games that the company could have delivered two events of that scale at the same time. However, Buckles, who has been with the world's biggest security group for 27 years, has been the face of the Olympic failure, taking to television and radio to apologise to the British public and twice being hauled in front of a Parliamentary Committee to explain what had happened. London Mayor Boris Johnson told LBC 97.3 radio it was right the G4S bosses quit over the Olympics fiasco. He said: 'The rank and file, the troops on the ground, did a wonderful job, but when you look at what happened in the management of those hordes of G4S employees who did a great job, I'm not going to try and persuade them to stay this morning.' G4S fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts at the Games, but failed to provide the required 10,400 contracted security guards . Police have issued a photograph of a prisoner who escaped from custody by climbing out of a window at a court. Michael Davidson, 27, absconded from Tain Sheriff Court in the Highlands on Tuesday afternoon. Northern Constabulary said that while he is not dangerous, he should not be approached. They urged anyone who sees him to contact police immediately. The force said that the man was the responsibility of security firm G4S at the time. It is believed the prisoner escaped through a window in the building. G4S said they are carrying out a full investigation into the incident and will be working closely with the Scottish Prison Service and relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances. G4S has largely prospered under . Buckles, who has presided over a share price rise of some 76 percent . since being elevated to group CEO in July 2005. But . investors have worried that the Olympics affair could jeopardise G4S's . relationship with the government, a core customer, at a time when . Britain wants to heavily involve the private sector in running public . services. Government deals account for over half of G4S's £1.8billion of British revenue and make up more than 20 per cent of its pipeline of potential UK work, which includes prison management deals and electronic tagging contracts. G4S, which has estimated its loss on the Olympics contract at around £50 million, is the world's biggest private security company with more than 650,000 staff worldwide. The review said the large numbers of people being taken through each stage of the recruitment process gave a sense of comfort that all was well, but failed to identify the extent to which individuals were actually deployable. G4S is the world's biggest private security company with more than 650,000 staff worldwide . It said the problem was not the result of a failure in any of the company's IT systems, but one of inadequate marshalling and interpretation of data. The project management team reported that the required workforce numbers would be met and it was only at the time of the significant 'ramp-up' in staff needed from July 1 that the inaccuracy in the information was identified. The PwC report also highlighted G4S's failure to appreciate the scale and nature of the project, in particular to properly incorporate and act upon feasibility assessments.","Chief operating officer and head of global sales to go after Olympics blunder .

The Russian orthodox Church said they should be pardoned on the condition they repented for 'desecrating a holy place'. Fights broke out between Pussy Riot supporters and pro-Church activists as around 150 people gathered outside the Moscow courthouse for the start of the appeal hearing today.

'The church sincerely wishes for the repentance of those who desecrated a holy place, certainly it would benefit their souls,' Legoida said in a speech. 'If any words of the convicts indicate repentance ... we would wish that they are not left unnoticed and those who violated the law get a chance to mend their ways.' 'If they (the church) mean repentance in the sense of a crime ... it definitely won't happen. Our clients won't admit guilt.

'The sentence is predetermined; their repentance will not affect it in any way,' Stanislav Samutsevich, father of one of the jailed women, told Reuters. 'The fact the church is calling for that is nothing but a public relations move to sustain their reputation in the eyes of the public, as the church says it is separate from the state.' Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has called Putin's 12-year rule a 'miracle of God' and backed his presidential election campaign earlier this year.

Some people hate them, some people fear them, and the rest of us probably don't enjoy them that much. But needle injections could finally become medical history, after scientists found a way to use lasers to take the 'ouch!' out of a medicine jab. The process, developed at Seoul National University in South Korea, could revolutionise how we receive annual flu shots, childhood immunisations, and other treatments that involve piercing the skin with a needle. The laser-based system blasts microscopic jets of drugs directly into the skin, and the creators say it is as gentle and painless as 'being hit with a puff of air'. The system uses an 'yttrium aluminum . garnet' laser to propel a tiny, precise stream of medicine with just the . right amount of force. This type of laser is commonly used by dermatologists, particularly for facial esthetic treatments. Now . Jack Yoh, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, has . combined the laser with a small adaptor that contains the drug to be . delivered, in liquid form, plus a chamber containing water that acts as a . 'driving' fluid. Each laser pulse, which lasts just 250 millionths of a second, generates a vapor bubble inside the driving fluid. The . pressure of that bubble puts elastic strain on the membrane between the . water and drug, causing the drug to be forcefully ejected from a . miniature nozzle in a narrow jet. The jet is a mere 150 millionths of a meter (micrometers) in diameter, just a little larger than the width of a human hair. The beam entrance view of the laser injector: The technology could end the jab forever . Yoh said: 'The impacting jet pressure is higher than the skin tensile strength and thus causes the jet to smoothly penetrate into the targeted depth underneath the skin, without any splashback of the drug.' Tests on guinea pig skin show that the drug-laden jet can penetrate up to several millimeters beneath the skin surface, with no damage to the tissue. Because of the narrowness and quickness of the jet, it should cause little or no pain, Yoh said - 'However, our aim is the epidermal layer,' which is located closer to the skin surface, at a depth of only about 500 micrometers. Tested in gel: The laser creates a hole in the gel (the black line) before the drug is injected . This region of the skin has no nerve endings, so the method 'will be completely pain-free'. In previous studies, the researchers used a laser wavelength that was not well absorbed by the water of the driving liquid, causing the formation of tiny shock waves that dissipated energy and hampered the formation of the vapor bubble. In the new work, Yoh and colleagues use a laser with a wavelength of 2,940 nanometers, which is readily absorbed by water. This allows the formation of a larger and more stable vapor bubble ""which then induces higher pressure on the membrane,"" he said. 'This is ideal for creating the jet and significantly improves skin penetration.' Although other research groups have developed similar injectors, 'they are mechanically driven', using piston-like devices to force drugs into the skin, which gives less control over the jet strength and the drug dosage. 'The laser-driven microjet injector can precisely control dose and the depth of drug penetration underneath the skin. 'Control via laser power is the major advancement over other devices, I believe.' Yoh is now working with a company to produce low-cost replaceable injectors for clinical use.","South Korea team creates laser that uses 'just the right amount of force' to inject medicine .

Affairs at the University of Leicester and one of the prime researchers behind the project, said: 'What we have uncovered is truly remarkable . and today we will be announcing to the world that the search for King . Richard III has taken a dramatic new turn.' Over the past fortnight, the team has made several major discoveries - which have helped lead them to the monarch’s possible burial spot. First they determined the area underneath the car park was the site of the medieval Franciscan friary known as Grey Friars. Experts also found the site of the church within the friary - which also lead them to uncovering the lost garden of Robert Herrick. The archaeologists, dubbed the Time Tomb Team, have now excavated the choir of the church - which is believed to be where King Richard III was buried. The University of Leicester is leading the archaeological search for the burial place - with Leicester City Council, in association with the Richard III Society. Leicester’s City Mayor Peter Soulsby said: 'This discovery adds a whole new dimension to a search which has already far exceeded our expectations. 'This is exciting news and I know that people across the world will be waiting to hear more about the university’s find.' Philippa Langley from the Richard III Society added: 'We came with a dream and if the dream becomes reality it will be nothing short of miraculous.' Is it him? Human remains have been found in the dig for the Plantagenet king, Richard III. The find comes after a three-week search of a Leicester car park. Last week archaeologists from the University of Leicester, who are leading the search for the lost grave of King Richard III, announced that they have made a new advance in their quest. They have uncovered evidence of the lost garden of Robert Herrick - where, historically, it is recorded there was a memorial to Richard III. The team discovered paving stones which they believe belong to the garden. In 1485 King Richard III was defeated at the battle of Bosworth. His body, stripped and despoiled, was brought to Leicester where he was buried in the church of the Franciscan Friary, known as the Grey Friars. Over time the exact whereabouts of the Grey Friars became lost. he project, which began two weeks ago, has involved digging of two trenches at a council park - and this week a third trench was excavated. Earlier this week, the archaeologists confirmed they had found the church of the Grey Friars and now they have found the garden outside the church. Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, said: 'This is an astonishing discovery and a huge step forward in the search for King Richard's grave. 'Herrick is incredibly important in the story of Richard's grave, and in potentially helping us get that little bit closer to locating it.'

In the early 1600s, Alderman Robert Herrick, a mayor of Leicester, bought the land of the Grey Friars and built a large mansion house with a garden on the site. The earliest surviving portrait of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. In 1612, Christopher Wren, father of the famous architect, was visiting Herrick and recorded seeing a handsome three foot stone pillar in Herrick's garden. Inscribed on the pillar was: 'Here lies the body of Richard III sometime King of England'. This is the last known record of the . site of King Richard's grave. Richard is historically recorded as being . buried in the choir of the Church of Grey Friars. Thereafter, . in 1711, Herrick's descendants sold the mansion house and garden. After . passing through various owners the mansion house was eventually pulled . down sometime in the 1870s and the municipal buildings were built. However, Herrick's garden seems to have remained a garden, or wasteland, . up until the 1930s - 40s when it was tarmacked over to become a car . park. Mrs Langley added: “The discovery of Herrick's garden is a major step forward and I'm incredibly excited.

Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According . to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the . battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into . battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On . the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow . Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the . battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was . broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. 'In locating what looks like one of the garden's pathways and, potentially, its central area which could have once held the three foot stone pillar marking the location of King Richard's grave, we could be that bit closer to finding the resting place of Britain's last warrior king.” Mr Buckley, co-director of University of Leicester Archaeological Services, said the area of paving was found at its southern end, composed of re-used medieval tiles laid in a haphazard pattern. “The tiles were also extremely worn and of many different sizes. 'Although the date at which the paving was laid has yet to be confirmed, we suspect that it relates to the period of Herrick’s mansion. 'Interestingly, the 18th century map of Leicester shows a formal garden with a series of paths leading to a central point. “The paving we have found may relate to this garden, but it lies outside the church to the south. 'Inside the church in this third trench, further investigation has revealed some large fragments of window tracery which could well relate to the east window, behind the high altar. If so, this may show that we are in the extreme east end of the building –near the choir where Richard III is said to have been buried. “Having overcome the major hurdle of finding the church, I am now confident that we are within touching distance of finding the choir – a real turning point in the project and a stage which, at the outset, I never really thought we might reach.” Work at the site will stop for a public open day between 11- 2 on Saturday September 8 and will resume next week. The dig is being filmed by Darlow Smithson Productions for a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary to be aired later this year.

Tragedy: Charlotte Shaw, 14, drowned after trying to cross a swollen brook during the gruelling Ten Tors expedition in 2007 . A 'well-meaning' scoutmaster has been blamed for the death of a 14-year-old girl who was swept away and drowned while crossing a swollen Dartmoor brook. Charlotte Shaw was carried off to her death while trying to help a friend over the crossing during the gruelling Ten Tors outdoor expedition. A language teacher supervising the private school group had advised Charlotte and her friends not to attempt the swollen crossing around Walla Brook in Dartmoor, as the girls were battling against wind, rain, hail, and exhaustion. But a court heard yesterday that scoutmaster Trevor Wills countermanded the teacher's advice and told the shivering girls to cross, as he feared they were getting hypothermia. When Charlotte attempted to help friend Yasmin Moore across the brook, she was carried away and drowned, London's High Court heard. Her mother, Jennifer Wilkin-Shaw, blamed her private school at London's High Court, saying in a £350,000 damages claim that the language teacher supervising the teenagers was simply not up to the job. However, top judge, Mr Justice Owen, yesterday cleared the teacher, Christopher Fuller, and the school of all blame for the March 2007 tragedy. The judge instead ruled that responsibility lay with a kindly scout master Mr Wills, who has since died, who tried to help the exhausted youngsters. Mrs Wilkin-Shaw's barrister, Dr Michael Powers QC, had told the court Mr Fuller had no formal outdoor leadership qualifications and accused him of 'incompetence'. Dangerous: The Walla Brook on Dartmoor had become swollen during driving rain and hail on the trip, the court heard (file picture) But Mr Justice Owen said he had done . the right thing when he told the pupil who led the group, Charlotte . Kennedy, not to attempt a crossing of Walla Brook. Cleared: A High Court judge refused to lay any blame for the tragedy on teacher Christopher Fuller, who had told the students not to cross the swollen brook . That . instruction, given over a mobile phone, was countermanded by scout . master, Trevor Wills, who had encountered the bedraggled children at . Watern Tor. Mr Justice Owen said: 'This tragic accident was the consequence of the well meant, but ill-advised, intervention of Mr Wills.' Although it was foreseeable that the children might seek an adult's advice after failing to meet up with teachers at the Tor, the judge said it could not have been predicted that Mr Wills, who has since died, 'would give bad advice thereby putting the group at risk'. In foul conditions, the group of 11 children, all pupils at independent prepatory school, Edgehill College, since re-named Kingsley School, in Bideford, Devon, had set out alone on the gruelling leg of the Ten Tors route to Watern Tor unaccompanied. Two teachers, who had been told to meet the children there, lost their way en route, but the judge said their 'navigational error' did not mean they were incompetent. As the children waited shivering at the Tor for an adult to arrive, Mr Wills, came to their aid. Seeing the children in a distressed state, and fearing that hypothermia might set in, he advised them not to wait around and directed then across the brook. Exhausting: Charlotte was one of 11 students who had tackled the Ten Tors Expedition . Endurance: A High Court judge yesterday said the tough two-day Ten Tors expedition still has 'great social value' for youngsters . The judge said that 'bad advice' countermanded the instruction Mr Fuller had given to Charlotte Kennedy on her mobile phone that the party was not to attempt a crossing, but should make its way around the head of the brook to Hangingstone Hill. That instruction was 'entirely appropriate', said the judge, who added that, although the children were 'cold, wet and miserable', they would have been capable of continuing with their treck. Even had Mr Fuller, or the school, been found negligent, the judge said he would have found that Mr Wills' intervention 'unquestionably amounted to an independent supervening cause' of the tragedy. After the accident, the rest of the party was evacuated from the moor by helicopter. Dr Powers had earlier told the court: 'The rain was heavy and it was hailing. A number of the children fell into bogs and became drenched'. Whilst recognising the 'great social value' of the Ten Tors, and saying that Mrs Wilkin Shaw 'would be the last to see any step taken which would diminish the benefit to young people of this activity', he argued the children had been exposed to unacceptable risk. 'The expedition is supposed to be a challenge - not a survival exercise,' he said. However - after a case which is estimated to have run up lawyers' bills of at least £500,000 - Mr Justice Owen rejected claims that the children should have been accompanied, or at least 'shadowed', by a competent adult on their way to the Tor. Had Mrs Wilkin-Shaw won the case, she would have been entitled to £350,000 damages on behalf of her daughter's estate.","Charlotte Shaw died on tough two-day outdoor trip in 2007 .

A pensioner who battered his 74-year old wife to death with a garden statue after he went berserk at their seaside retirement home was today is facing jail. Fred Gilliard, 75, beat wife June with an Easter Island head they kept on the front lawn and also stabbed her whilst suffering 'a major depressive episode.' Police were called to the couple’s £150,000 seaside semi detached home in Blackpool, Lancs after it is believed they were called by Gilliard himself. Guilty: Fred Gilliard, left, beat wife June, right, with an Easter Island head they kept on the front lawn and also stabbed her whilst suffering 'a major depressive episode' His wife was lying dead inside and officers also recovered a knife from the scene. Gillliard was later led from the house in handcuffs. A post mortem examination established June died from multiple injuries, consistent with being stabbed repeatedly and struck to the head with a heavy object. The motive for the killing is not known. Today at Preston Crown Court Gilliard pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the prosecution. Scene: Police were called to the couple's £150,000 seaside semi detached home in Blackpool, Lancs after it is believed they were called by Gilliard himself . Statues: Police cordoned off the smart house where a grey Nissan Qashqai was parked in the drive. The front garden has a statue of a puppy and a buddha's head . Dressed smartly in a suit, he had to use headphones to listen to the proceedings. Stuart . Denney QC, prosecuting, said: 'A report has been received and it . concluded that he was suffering a major depressive episode which caused a . loss of control and, in the opinion of the doctor, his responsibility . got his acts was diminished. The weapon: Mr Gilliard beat his wife to death with a souvenir garden statuette in the shape of one of the monolithic stone statues on Easter Island, in the Pacific Ocean . 'Having . borne in mind the lack of previous history and having borne in mind the . nature of the attack, and what was said and done afterwards, we have . concluded with family and senior police officers we cannot properly ask . the jury to reject the medical evidence.' Gilliard will be sentenced next month following the preparation of further psychiatric reports. Judge Anthony Russell QC told him: 'The outcome is that you will be detained for some significant time but it is appropriate for me to consider whether that should be in hospital or in prison.' The tragedy occurred last February 10 years after the elderly couple, formerly of Yorkshire, moved to the property so they could enjoy their retirement by the seaside. Police cordoned off the smart house where a grey Nissan Qashqai was parked in the drive. The front garden has a statue of a puppy and a buddha’s head. At the time a neighbour said: 'They were quiet, reserved and very nice people. They kept themselves to themselves - they were very rarely out in the garden. The lady was quite large and also came from Yorkshire - we had something in common. 'Her husband was quieter and I think he used to drive an ambulance or used to be a paramedic. They went on holiday to Canada a lot.' 'I think it’s really sad. It must be an absolute tragedy for the family.' In a statement the Gilliard’s family said: 'As a family we are stunned and devastated by this tragic turn of events involving both of our parents. 'We are an extremely close family and both Mum and Dad are loving and cherished parents. We are struggling to come to terms with the tragedy of the situation.'","Fred Gilliard, 75, beat wife June with an Easter Island head garden statue .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 28 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:10 EST, 28 September 2012 . The mother of one of the Navy SEALs killed in the raid on a U.S. consulate in Libya has criticised the administration for its slow response to the massacre earlier this month. More than two weeks after the apparent terrorist attack in Benghazi which killed ambassador Chris Stevens along with three other officials, an FBI investigation team has yet to enter the city. Cheryl Croft Bennett, whose son Tyrone Woods died alongside his comrade Glen Doherty while trying to protect consulate staff, took to Facebook to denounce the lack of progress in uncovering the circumstances behind the raid. Hero: Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods died while protecting staff at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11 . Criticism: Cheryl Croft Bennett has hit out at the FBI's delay in investigating her son's death . The grieving mother has been posting regular online messages paying tribute to her son and describing her experiences with government officials in the aftermath of the tragedy. On Thursday Ms Bennett wrote: 'Don't want to ever politicize the loss of my son in Libya, but it has been 16 days and the FBI has yet to get to Benghazi to begin their investigation. 'Apparently they have made it to Tripoli but haven't been allowed to enter Benghazi. Meanwhile, the diplomatic outpost where Tyrone and Glen died, was not and is not secured. Absolutely unacceptable.' The stinging criticism came as it emerged that federal agents who were sent to Libya in the aftermath of the attack on September 11 have not yet arrived in Benghazi. The delay in sending the FBI into the city where four Americans were killed has been blamed on security worries. Officials . have said that the bureau is unwilling to put agents in harm's way and . that Benghazi must be made safe before the investigators can enter. At . FBI headquarters on Friday, a spokesman said 'we are moving forward . with our investigation', but would not reveal the current location of . the agents in Libya. Separately, the State Department is further reducing the U.S. Embassy staff in Tripoli for security reasons. Ms Bennett's criticism of the FBI investigation is all the more striking given her earlier praise for the way top officials reacted after the death of Mr Woods and the three others. Dangerous mission: The security force rushed to the burning consulate and guided diplomats . to safety . Repatriation: U.S. Marines carry the caskets during the transfer . of remains ceremony . Writing about the repatriation of her son's body, she said: 'The entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal. 'Little did I know that I would find myself in a reception room being comforted, hugged, and, yes, even kissed by the President of the United States. Along with the President, there was Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and General and Mrs Colin Powell. 'They were all wonderful. They held my hand, offered condolences, gave warm hugs, and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss, as I fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my SEAL son. 'Each of them commended Tyrone for his courage, his bravery, and his ultimate sacrifice for his country.' Tribute: Libyan president Mohammed el-Megarif speaking in front of a portrait of ambassador Chris Stevens . Slow? The Obama administration has not yet allowed FBI agents to enter Benghazi on security grounds . Mr Woods and Mr Doherty were staying in a secure annex elsewhere in Benghazi when they heard about the attack on the consulate, thought to have been inspired by a U.S.-made YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad. They rushed to the compound, helped a number of diplomats evacuate, and recovered the body of Sean Smith, a computer expert who had earlier died of smoke inhalation. After most of the officials had been moved to safety, the SEALs faced a renewed assault using rocket-propelled grenades, which reached their targets and killed the two young men. Hillary Clinton told Ms Bennett that her son had been responsible for saving the lives of 30 people.","Tyrone Woods died on September 11 while defending Benghazi consulate .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 13 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:47 EST, 13 September 2012 . Glaciers in the eastern and central regions of the Himalayas appear to be retreating at accelerating rates, similar to those in other areas of the world - while glaciers in the western Himalayas are more stable and could be growing, according to a new report. The report examines how changes to glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region, which covers eight countries across Asia, could affect the area's river systems, water supplies, and the South Asian population. The mountains in the region form the headwaters of several major river systems - including the Ganges, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers - which serve as sources of drinking water and irrigation supplies for roughly 1.5 billion people. Mount Dunagiri, seen from India's Curzon Trail, is in the range where glaciers are both shrinking and growing . The entire Himalayan climate is changing, but how climate change will impact specific places remains unclear, said the committee. The eastern Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau are warming, and the trend is more pronounced at higher elevations. Models suggest that desert dust and black carbon, a component of soot, could contribute to the rapid atmospheric warming, accelerated snowpack melting, and glacier retreat. While glacier melt contributes water to the region's rivers and streams, retreating glaciers over the next several decades are unlikely to cause significant change in water availability at lower elevations, which depend primarily on monsoon precipitation and snowmelt, the committee said. Variations in water supplies in those areas are more likely to come from extensive extraction of groundwater resources, population growth, and shifts in water-use patterns. However, if the current rate of retreat continues, high elevation areas could have altered seasonal and temporal water flow in some river basins. The effects of glacier retreat would become evident during the dry season, particularly in the west where glacial melt is more important to the river systems. Nevertheless, shifts in the location, intensity, and variability of both rain and snow will likely have a greater impact on regional water supplies than glacier retreat will. The Ganges River is part of a river system that supplies water to more than 1.5 billion people . Melting of glacial ice could play an important role in maintaining water security during times of drought or similar climate extremes, the committee noted. During the 2003 European drought, glacial melt contributions to the Danube River in August were about three times greater than the 100-year average. Water stored as glacial ice could serve as the Himalayan region's hydrologic ""insurance,"" adding to streams and rivers when it is most needed. Although retreating glaciers would provide more meltwater in the short term, the loss of glacier ""insurance"" could become problematic over the long term. Water resources management and provision of clean water and sanitation are already a challenge in the region, and the changes in climate and water availability warrant small-scale adaptations with effective, flexible management that can adjust to the conditions, the committee concluded. Current efforts that focus on natural hazard and disaster reduction in the region could offer useful lessons when considering and addressing the potential for impacts resulting from glacial retreat and changes in snowmelt processes in the region. Many basins in the region are ""water-stressed"" due to both social changes and environmental factors, and this stress is projected to intensify with large forecasted population growth, the committee concluded. Climate change could exacerbate this stress in the future. Although the history of international river disputes suggests that cooperation is a more likely outcome than violent conflict in this region, social conditions could change. Therefore, modifications in water supplies could play an increasing role in political tensions, especially if existing water management institutions do not evolve to take better account of the region's social, economic, and ecological complexities, the committee said.","The entire Himalayan climate is changing, but how climate change will impact specific places 'remains unclear'"

Four civilians, three hotel guards and a policeman were killed in the battle. All five attackers were also killed. The attack, quickly claimed by the Afghan Taliban, again showed the ability of insurgents to stage high-profile raids.

NATO attack helicopters could be seen over the single-storey hotel building and a balcony popular with guests for its sunset views, while a pall of smoke rose into air. The Taliban complained wealthy Afghans and foreigners used the hotel, about six miles from the centre of Kabul, for 'prostitution' and 'wild parties' ahead of today's religious day holiday. Launching their annual offensive this spring, the Taliban threatened to attack more government officials and rich Afghans. Bullet holes pepper the hotel's brickwork, along with smashed windows . But the hotel assault was one of few in which multiple hostages were taken since the start of the war, now in its 11th year. General Mohammad Zahir, head of the Kabul police investigation unit, said: 'This is a crime against humanity because they targeted children, women and civilians picnicking at the lake. 'There wasn't even a single soldier around there.' Television pictures showed several people wading out of the lake onto a balcony and clambering over a wall to safety.

Soldiers and police fanned out around the hotel at dawn, arriving in cars and armoured Humvee vehicles and taking cover behind trees flanking the lake and a nearby golf course. Police said they wanted to stage a rescue without resorting to a frontal attack that could kill the hotel guests who had been taken hostage. Qargha Lake is one of Kabul's few options for weekend getaways. Restaurants and hotels that dot the shore are popular with Afghan government officials and businessmen, particularly on Thursday nights. Guests at the Spozhmai must pass through security checks before entering the hotel, where tables with umbrellas overlook the water, but security is relatively light for a city vulnerable to militant attacks. Violence across Afghanistan has surged in recent days, with three U.S. soldiers and more than a dozen civilians killed in successive attacks, mostly in the country's east where NATO-led forces have focused their efforts during the summer fighting months. Fears: Afghan security officials stand guard on a road leading to the hotel . NATO commanders, halfway into the process of transferring security responsibility to Afghan forces, are racing through training for the Afghan army and police, including holding basic literacy classes for recruits. Several well-planned assaults in Kabul in the past year have raised questions about whether the Taliban and their al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network allies have shifted tactics to embrace high-profile attacks targeting landmarks, foreigners and Afghanistan's elite, extending a guerrilla war once primarily waged in the countryside. Afghan insurgents attacked Kabul's heavily protected diplomatic and government district on April 15 in an assault, eventually quelled by Afghan special forces guided by Western mentors, similar to one in September 2011. Militants also killed eight people in an attack on the upscale Intercontinental hotel in Kabul in June 2011.

De Jesus' crying at one point led Judge Jeffrey Levenson to briefly halt the trial. Among the items of evidence displayed were was photo . of Josiah's bloodied body on a mattress inside a motor home after he . had been stabbed multiple times by his father. The name of the younger son is being withheld at the request of the state Department of Children & Families, which has placed him in foster care. Prosecutors claim De Jesus had an obligation as a parent to safeguard her children. Victims: Jeshiah De Jesus, nine, who was autistic and could not speak, . was fatally stabbed eight times. Oliva Plante, 76, was shot in the . abdomen and head . Siege scene: A Swat team surrounded this trailer in Deerfield Beach, Florida, as De Jesus barricaded himself inside with his family and an elderly hostage . They blame her for failing to act as a protector and failing to stop her husband from stabbing Josiah to death and trying to kill their other son at Highland Woods RV Park in Deerfield Beach. Moons blames the killings on his client's husband, saying his rampage was uncontrollable and that nobody could have foreseen what happened. Moons has said his client suffered wounds, including a punctured lung, that limited her ability to protect her children. Deanna Beauchamp De Jesus (pictured right), who is accused of aggravated manslaughter and child neglect, has cried repeatedly during two days of court . Deanna Beauchamp De Jesus is on trial in Broward, Fort Lauderdale, accused of aggravated manslaughter and child neglect for not stopping her husband kill Jonah . As authorities investigated the attack, they considered the mother as less of a victim and more of a criminally responsible participant. At the time of his death, Josiah still required diapers and didn't speak, prosecutors said. The other son managed to survive by fighting back in a way his older brother could not, they said. The younger son's interview was recorded with the Broward Sheriff's Office on February 10 at Broward Health Medical Center, the Sun Sentinel reported. Detectives waited around a half-hour to speak to him, because doctors were treating the boy's stab wounds and gauging whether he required surgery. The boy told detectives the day had begun in a normal way: He and his family were at their Port Orange home when their father insisted on driving them all to South Florida, where William De Jesus' cousin lives. The boy recalled making several stops in South Florida before he and his family randomly wound up at the Highland Woods RV park. They visited his father's cousin, who ran an errand to buy diapers for Josiah. The family also went to a McDonald's restaurant and checked in at a motel before his father erratically forced his family back on the road. 'He was crazy. I think he was crazy,' the boy said. He said he recalled his father saying that he thought they all would be killed on the road. At the RV park, the boy said, he took his father's knife after his father had stabbed him. The boy said he tried to discard it, but his father seized the knife again. 'I said, 'No more,' ' the boy said in the recording. 'I had the knife and I wanted to throw it away out the window. Then he grabbed it again, and he stabbed me like three times again. Then he fell on the floor.' Jurors also heard two recorded interviews that Deanna De Jesus had with authorities. She described herself feeling helpless and unable to intervene the night her husband went on his rampage. 'He stabbed me in my lungs, and I wasn't able to do anything,' De Jesus told an officer March 2, the day she was taken into custody in Central Florida on criminal charges. When Levenson asked Moons at the end of Thursday's hearing whether De Jesus planned to take the stand in her defence, Moons replied it still was too early to say. Moons said he planned to ask the judge this afternoon to dismiss the case. If the case isn't dismissed, the jury is expected to hear closing arguments on Monday.","Tape detailing what son of killer William De Jesus saw played in court .

Tributes have been paid to one of the Labour party's 'great thinkers' following the death of former minister Malcolm Wicks at the age of 65. Ex-Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were joined by Ed Miliband and a string of politicians from across the political divide in mourning the 65-year-old's death from cancer. Mr Blair praised his 'wonderful colleague' who was 'immensely popular across he political divide'. Former minister Malcolm Wicks died of cancer at the age of 65. Tributes have flooded in for him . He added that Mr Wicks 'had a very basic principle that guided his life: to do what he could for others, to serve, to be committed and to work hard for causes that were always about helping those who needed it most'. 'He had complete integrity in all he did and both as an MP for Croydon and a minister was immensely popular across the political divide. He will be greatly missed.' The Croydon North MP, who served as a minister for nine years in the Labour government, was described by Mr Brown as 'a great thinker, writer, campaigner and parliamentarian'. Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, said he was a 'thoroughly decent, intelligent and compassionate man' whose death yesterday left a 'huge hole' in the party. 'He was a brilliant energy minister, he was a deep thinker about welfare and pensions, and Labour to his core,' Mr Miliband said. 'Malcolm was also a dedicated constituency MP, always putting the needs of his Croydon constituents first. He was a brilliant campaigner. 'The way he handled his illness tells you everything about the man. He showed huge dignity and also kept on thinking, writing and advising right to the end. Ed Miliband, the leader of opposition Labour Party, paid tribute to Mr Wicks . Malcolm Wicks, MP for North Croydon, served as a minister in a variety of briefs, including education, pensions and science . 'I have lost a wise confidant and most importantly a dear friend and the Labour Party has lost one of its sharpest thinkers. Our thoughts go to Malcolm's wife, Margaret, and his family.' Mr Wicks, a former chairman of the education select committee, served as a minister in a variety of briefs, including education, pensions and science. But he will be best remembered for his two stints as energy minister, and after leaving government was appointed by Mr Brown as the Prime Minister's special representative on energy issues. The married father and grandfather stepped down from the government in 2008 and was re-elected with an increased majority of nearly 16,500 at the 2010 general election. Mr Brown said last night: 'Tonight we mourn the passing of Malcolm Wicks, who was a great thinker, writer, campaigner and parliamentarian. 'He was a passionate advocate of social justice, a conscientious constituency MP and a great minister in the Labour government. 'I talked to him during his long period of ill-health and I marvelled at his courage and tenacity in fighting his illness. He will be sorely missed and our thoughts are with his family.' And there were tributes to from across the political spectrum. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, said: 'As well as being a respected parliamentarian, Malcolm's knowledge and passion on energy issues commanded huge respect, and we are all the poorer for his passing.' Eric Pickles, the Conservative Communities Secretary, said on Twitter that he was 'very sad to learn of the death of Malcolm Wicks, he was a man of great wit and humanity.' Tory Welsh Secretary David Jones hailed Mr Wicks as 'a gentleman in every sense'. Gavin Barwell, Conservative MP for neighbouring Croydon Central, said: 'A great MP for Croydon North and good friend. Drive home from SW1 won't be the same without him.'","Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband lead the tributes .

The statistic is the most shocking in a survey that reveals a bewildering level of consumer ignorance on fruit and vegetables.

The study found the hardest vegetable to cook was asparagus, followed by the swede. Caroline Evans added: 'Potatoes are one of the most versatile foods - they can be used to create so many tasty dishes and being naturally fat free, they’re a nutritious base for lots of meals too. 'To get great results you need to pick the right type.

What do Scottsdale, Arizona, Syracuse in upstate New York and the San Juan Islands off Washington have in common? They are all home to some of the most architecturally inspiring addresses in the United States. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) has handed out the 2012 Housing Awards to projects at the pinnacle of design, creativity and sustainability. The jury recognized projects in four categories - custom-built homes for one family, large structures which sleep many individuals in their own apartments and specialized buildings such as community centers. The ten homes selected were: The Nakahouse, a space-age home in the Hollywood Hills; Relic Rock, a luxury home in Scottsdale, Arizona; The Pierre, a strange stone inspired home in the San Juan Islands off Washington state; The Camelview Village, a futuristic condo complex in Scottsdale, Arizona;  Hampden Lane House in Bethesda, Maryland; The Live Work Home in Syracuse, New York; the luxury Carmel residence in Carmel-by-Sea, California; a new Jesuit Community centre in Fairfield, Connecticut; new low-budget homes in San Francisco and new college halls of residence in Houston, Texas. Otherwordly homestead: Optima Camelview Village is a 700-unit condominium development comprised of eleven buildings linked by bridges in Scottsdale, Arizona . Spiritual setting: The Arizona complex draws inspiration from the surrounding mountains and Native American desert communities . Sit back and relax in your surroundings: A lounge area in the Optima Camelview Village in Scottsdale . The American Institute of Architects was established 150 years ago and has more then 79,000 members. The One and Two Family Custom Residences award focus on remodelling of homes for individual clients. The Carmel Residence in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California was completed by Dirk Denison Architects. The owners wanted to marry a space that worked with the beauty of the natural surroundings and the nearby Pacific Ocean. All rooms flow from a central courtyard with nooks for the kitchen and office spaces. Areas are separated by screens of solid mahogany and steel which move to allow air and light to circulate throughout the home. The Hampden Lane House in Bethesda, Maryland by architect Robert M. Gurney is a simple cube where all spaces are utilized. It stands out from others in the neighbor for its style - but nevertheless is an environmentally conscious project. Nakahouse in Los Angeles, by XTEN Architecture, is an abstract remodel of a 1960s hillside house with fluid indoor - outdoor spaces. Its cantilevered terraces and stark monochrome interior - white steel, plaster and concrete along with deep black plaster walls - give it a futuristic look despite its glamorous location under the Hollywood sign. Inspired by its surroundings: Located in Carmel Bay, California, the Carmel Residence was conceived around one central room . California dream: The home by the coast has niche spaces that hide the kitchen and bedrooms around a central area paneled in solid mahogany and glass sliding doors . The art of zen: The open plan nature of the Carmel property allows air and natural light to flow through the entire home . The Pierre on the San Juan Islands, Washington was created by Olson Kundig Architects. The owner's desire to use stone throughout the home led to its name (pierre is stone in French). It was conceived as a bunker and is almost camouflaged by the nature which surrounds it. Rock extrudes into the home, sitting at odds with more luxurious furnishings and fabrics used. Interior and exterior hearths are carved out of existing stone and  the master bathroom sink and the powder room are fully carved out of the rock. Relic Rock, another property in Scottsdale, Arizona was designed by DCHGlobal Inc. It is almost entirely sustainable - with the structure made of 99 per cent recycled steel. 'Floating' floor plans mean that the rocks around and under the property have been untouched. Cook + Fox Architects designed the Live Work Home in Syracuse, New York. The home was created as a small, modern loft - an ecologically sound space in response to America's future housing needs that appeal directly to the environment in which they are built. As Syracuse often has long, dark winters, the home is filled with skylight tubes and perforated screens that allow light to bounce. Tranquil: Optima Camelview Village in Scottdale, Arizona uses greenery and water features to combat the desert heat . Room with a view: Nakahouse in Los Angeles is an abstract remodel of a 1960s hillside house . Spaceage: Nakahouse is an abstract remodel of a 1960's hillside house . Go with the flow: The LA home is made from white steel, plaster and concrete with contrasting black plaster walls . 'Multifamily housing' recognizes apartment and condominium design - for both public and private clients that include open and recreational space. David Baker + Partners designed the Drs. Julian and Raye Richardson Apartments in San Francisco - 120 permanent, supportive studio apartments for low-income formerly homeless residents, many with mental and physical disabilities. The site of the project is a demolished freeway that has been transformed with plenty of green space and local shops. The eclectic style also gives the homes a sense of common identity and place in the neighborhood.

The special housing award by AIA is for the design of housing that fits a specific purpose - homes for the disabled, rehabilitation centers or domestic violence shelters. Rice University in Houston, Texas . enlisted Hanbury Evans Wright Vlattas + Company with Hopkins Architects . to build McMurtry & Duncan Colleges. The two buildings are home to 650 students and faculty, weaving squares and tree-lined paths with innovative design that blends with the more traditional buildings on campus. Also outstanding in this category was the Jesuit Community Center in Fairfield, Connecticut by Gray Organschi Architecture.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:36 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:00 EST, 19 October 2012 . Angry: Mike Harding says all he has done is spend 15 years boosting listener numbers while stars have done bad things and kept their jobs . Mike Harding hit out at BBC bosses yesterday after he was sacked from his popular Radio 2 folk music show after 15 years. The 67-year-old musician and comedian will be replaced on Wednesday evenings by Mark Radcliffe, 54. Harding said he ‘could not understand’ why he had been axed and drew comparisons with disgraced BBC stars who had previously kept their jobs. He said: ‘Jimmy Savile interfered with kids on the BBC’s premises and got away with it. Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand joked about having sex with Andrew Sachs’s grandaughter on the BBC and got away with it. ‘I present a folk show for 15 years, build the audience from 70,000 to 860,000, and get the sack – and it’s me that’s supposed to be the comedian. ‘They have sold the folk world down the river.’ The presenter said his boss, Bob Shennan, had refused to explain the decision to him. He said: ‘He [Mr Shennan] said I wasn’t “live” – I wasn’t aware I was dead. I am not bitter, I just don’t understand it. It’s a specialist folk music show and I am a  specialist in folk music.’ Harding said he would continue to ‘present the music I love’ until December 26. On Twitter he added: ‘That’s me gone – but remember, I didn’t jump, I was pushed.’ Harding said: 'I'm in the dark and . have no idea why they have done it. Shame: Harding also cited claims Sir Jimmy Savile abused people on BBC premises but worked for the corporation for decades . 'You get sacked from the BBC for two . reasons. One, financial - and it can't be that because I've not had a . rise in 15 years. And two, declining audience figures - and mine . haven't. They have sold the folk world down the river.' Mr . Shennan said: 'I'd like to thank Mike Harding, who has spent 15 years . at the top of his game, delighting fans with his expertise and rooting . out the very best folk music. 'On his watch, folk has enjoyed a huge . surge in popularity and Mike has been key in supporting the genre and . introducing Radio 2 listeners to a broad range of new artists. 'We very . much hope to work with him again in the future.'
