"Colombia international David Ospina has warned he is not about to give up the Arsenal jersey without a fight having yet to concede a goal in the Barclays Premier League. Ospina was signed in the summer from Nice to provide competition for Wojciech Szczesny following the departure of Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea, and made two appearances earlier in the season before being hampered by a thigh problem left over from the World Cup. After recovering full fitness, the 26-year-old started the FA Cup third-round tie against Hull and has retained his place in the league matches since, helping record clean sheets against Stoke, Manchester City and Aston Villa. David Ospina, pictured celebrating against Aston Villa, has replaced Wojciech Szczesny in goal for Arsenal . Szczesny played against Brighton in the FA Cup but conceded twice against the Championship side . Gunners boss Arsene Wenger says Szczesny - who was reported to have been smoking in the showers after the defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, where the Pole was culpable for the goals in a 2-0 defeat - is the Arsenal 'number one', but accepts Ospina has impressed with his performances. It remains to be seen whether Szczesny, who let in two in the FA Cup win at Brighton on January 25, is back between the posts for Saturday's north-London derby at Tottenham. Ospina, though, intends to do all he can to stake his claim. 'I see it as a big responsibility to come to a great club like Arsenal - it is a dream come true. Now it is my job to make the most of this opportunity that has come my way,' Ospina said on Arsenal Player. 'We have very good goalkeepers in the shape of Wojciech Szczesny and Emiliano Martinez.' Ospina, pictured in training, wants to make the most of the opportunity given to him by Arsene Wenger . Szczesny was dropped after making two errors in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day . Arsenal will be hoping Chile forward Alexis Sanchez recovers from the hamstring problem which forced him to miss the 5-0 victory over Villa. England striker Danny Welbeck is expected to be in contention for the first time since December 28 after recovering from a thigh injury. In a welcome change from recent seasons, Arsenal conducted their transfer business early, with the signing of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal and promising 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik from Legia Warsaw. Gabriel, 24, watched from the bench against Villa, and hopes to be able to go on to make a major impact for the Gunners, like fellow Brazilian Gilberto before him. New signing Gabriel wants to emulate his compatriot and former Arsenal midfielder Gilberto . 'I could see that Gilberto was a major element here. He really helped the team, he really is a player I want to emulate because of his type of work and his will to help his team-mates, his will to win as a true Brazilian,' the defender said to the club website. 'To me he is a mirror, so I will always take many good things I saw in him and take it to the pitch, and off the pitch as well, because I think he was an excellent professional who did many good things. 'I want to be like him, to be able to do the most I can to help everyone.'","David Ospina is yet to concede a goal in the Premier League this season .

"Arnis Zalkalns is the latest in a long, terrifying list of killers, rapists and other serious criminals able to slip into Britain using EU free movement rules. The authorities here had no idea he had a conviction for murder when he used his Latvian passport to enter the country in 2007. This is because while demanding EU citizens should have the right to free movement – except in the most extreme circumstances – Brussels does not compel member states to share information on known criminals who might be planning to travel. Scroll down for video . Arnis Zalkans killed his wife, Rudite, in Latvia three years after they married. He is now the prime suspect in the hunt for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross, 14 . Some do: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and, most recently, Poland flag up potential dangermen to the UK so they can be put on a watch list and turned away at the port or airport. But Whitehall officials say most of the Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004 do not bother and some do not even keep the information for their own internal use. Home Secretary Theresa May is trying to put pressure on other EU countries to cooperate, particularly in relation to child sex offences. But, ultimately, other countries know that they have countless free movement directives on their side – and there is zero chance of a blanket travel ban being implemented on their citizens if they do not cooperate. Indeed, they may even take the view that they would rather have their murderers and rapists living in Britain than claiming new victims at home. Equally disturbing is that even if the Latvians had cooperated Zalkalns would probably still have been free to waltz into the country. Kajus Scuka (left) served 11 years in prison in the Czech Republic for murdering his wife before moving to the UK, where he was jailed for 12 years for attacking four women. Victor Akulic (right) was jailed for nine years for raping a seven-year-old in Lithuania. He then raped a woman in the UK and was jailed for life . Mobster Mariusz Florowski (left) was wanted for a string of offences in Poland when fled to Britain, where he killed a man with a blowtorch and was jailed for 30 years. Rimvydas Liorancas (right) was a convicted armed robber when he moved to the UK. He was accused of murdering a couple when he was found hanged in his prison cell . Normally, a person can be excluded from the UK only if they pose ‘a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat’ to society and the public. They key here is ‘present’, which means it is not enough for an EU citizen to have a serious criminal conviction. The Home Office must prove they are likely to strike again which, given Zalkalns was convicted of murder in 1998, might have fallen foul of EU edicts. The same is true when the authorities are trying to boot out an offender from elsewhere in Europe who has committed an offence here. Had the police known about Zalkalns’s past, they might have begun proceedings to remove him in 2009, when he was accused of indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Ealing, west London. But given no case was brought, they again might again have struggled to prove he was a ‘present’ danger. Indeed, officers might have concluded the chances of success were so low that it wasn’t worth the trouble – particularly since Zalkalns would probably just head straight back to the UK through our still lax borders.","Authorities were unaware when murderer Arnis Zalkalns moved to the UK .

"Two talented students, a doctor and a junior doctor were ‘swept away’ by a devastating avalanche that left four dead and another critically injured, it was revealed last night. A survivor of the tragedy said they were all experienced winter walkers who were engulfed as they headed back down a mountain in Glencoe, in the Scottish Highlands. The victims fell about 1,000ft and were buried in up to 6ft of snow, said one of the Glencoe mountain rescue team. Victims: Una Finnegan and Christopher Bell died in the avalanche in the Scottish Highlands yesterday afternoon . Police named PhD students Christopher . Bell, 24, of Lancashire, Tom Chesters, 28, who lived in Leeds, and . junior doctor Una Finnegan, 25, of County Antrim, as three of the . victims. The fourth victim, Rachel Majumdar, 29, was a doctor working at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire. A 24-year-old woman from Durham . survived and was said to be in a critical condition in a Glasgow . hospital with serious head injuries. The other survivor, a male climber . from Liverpool, is believed to have jumped clear of the collapsing snow . and anchored an ice axe into firmer ground. He said in a statement: ‘Five of my . friends and I were descending a mountain in Glencoe in an area known as . Church Door Buttress when the party was swept away by a snow avalanche. Tom Chesters, 28, (left) who was living in Leeds, was also killed in an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe.  Andy Nelson, of Glencoe Mountain Rescue, (right) said an avalanche was 'a brutal experience' ‘It is with much sadness and deep . regret that some of my friends have died as a result. All in the group . loved the mountains and are experienced winter walkers. My sincere . thanks go to members of the public, mountain rescue teams and other . emergency services who assisted.’ Police identified the three other victims yesterday but Dr Majumdar’s name was withheld until today to allow her family members to inform other relatives. The avalanche happened at about 2pm on Saturday as the group began descending the 3,722ft Bidean Nam Bian mountain. The slope they were walking down is believed to have broken away. The alarm was raised immediately by . two climbers, who were not part of the group, who found one of the . casualties lying in the snow. The man who survived also contacted . the emergency services and a mountain rescue team was taken by . helicopter straight to the scene. Andy Nelson, of the Glencoe mountain rescue team, said they acted ‘very, very quickly’ as a Royal Navy helicopter was nearby. He added: ‘The priority was to start probing in the snow and start digging as soon as possible to try and extricate the bodies.’ He said when he got to the scene four climbers were looking for survivors. He added: ‘There was a lot of . avalanche debris. Snow had slid down from the top and gathered in a . fairly smallish area and quite deep, with some signs of equipment lying . around. ‘We started probing the snow to find the people buried underneath. Four climbers were killed yesterday following an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe . Tragedy: The avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian claimed four lives yesterday . ‘It was a typical Scottish winter day, with strong winds, which isn’t unusual, and light snow falling. ‘The people were on a ridge walk, not climbing per se but walking, and then they chose to descend on the area that avalanched. ‘It was a reasonable route to take, but unfortunately the snow beneath them was very unstable. ‘Being in an avalanche is literally like standing on a carpet and having it pulled out from underneath you. ‘Any thoughts of trying to swim out from it is futile. ‘You are on steep ground, essentially standing on a raft of snow that is sliding downhill at speeds of maybe 40mph to 50mph. ‘It would have unfolded in a split . second, they would have felt the snow moving and then they would have . been travelling at a speed that was impossible to stop. The avalanche struck on Saturday afternoon on Bidean Nam Bian, Glencoe . ‘It’s a brutal experience. There are enormous forces at work and you are being twisted about at high speed.’ Close friends today described how Tom Chesters and Dr Majumdar had been an item since they met at university in Leeds. Sam Morris, 35, said the only consolation in the tragedy was that the couple died side-by-side doing something they both loved. 'They were in love since they met in their first year of university,' he said. 'They were just so soft and sweet with each other - two people so at ease together. They were having fun making plans. 'They had dreams of doing voluntary work oversees together. 'Some of the comfort we have drawn is . that these guys had been together to the end. At least they were doing . what they liked doing.' Mr Morris, who worked with Mr . Chesters and Mr Bell when they were mountain bike tour guides in the . Alps, added: 'All four of them were people with a bright future and all . of them were committed to making a difference. It’s such a loss.' A colleague of Dr Majumdar described her as one of the finest doctors she had worked with. The medic, a doctor at Harrogate . District Hospital in North Yorkshire, was originally from Merseyside but . had recently been living in Leeds. Rebecca Leigh, who works at the . Harrogate hospital, said: 'Rachel was a gifted and dedicated doctor who . was in the middle of her training. 'A very promising medical career has been cut tragically short. She was one of the finest doctors I have ever worked with. 'All the staff and patients who knew . Rachel will remember her for her caring nature, with a smile and a . friendly word for everyone.' Mr Chesters, said to have been one of . Britain’s leading competitive orienteerers, had also been living in . Leeds and was working towards a PhD qualification in medical engineering . at Hull University. The university said Mr Chesters had a promising career ahead of him. Michael Fagan, professor of medical . and biological engineering, and Catherine Dobson, Mr Chesters’ PhD . supervisor, said in a statement: 'Tom was a fantastic colleague and . friend with so much energy and enthusiasm for everything he did. 'He was a real asset to our research . group and was making great progress with his PhD research into . osteoporosis. He had a very promising career ahead of him. We will all . miss him enormously.' Una Finnegan, 25, from Coleraine in Northern Ireland, had a great zest for life and wanted to make a difference, her former schoolteacher said. Nicola Madden, vice-principal of Dalriada School in Ballymoney, said the former pupil, who had been working in Edinburgh as a junior doctor, would be badly missed. 'She was bright, bubbly, talented, an amazing student, and academically she was brilliant, one of the top students,' she said. Ms Finnegan, who secured nine A*s and one A in her GCSEs in 2004, was involved in the Duke of Edinburgh scheme at the school, along with her twin sister, and that led to a love of the mountains and outdoors, Ms Madden added. She was inspired to become a doctor after attending a humanitarian mission to Moldova in eastern Europe and meeting medics there, the senior teacher said, and also sat on the interview panel which appointed Northern Ireland's first Children's Commissioner. 'She just had a great zest for life and did actually want to make a difference,' Ms Madden said. Ms Finnegan's father Dr Owen Finnegan was a well-respected heart and chest consultant at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Following in her father's footsteps she studied medicine at Newcastle University and took her masters in anthropology of health and illness in Edinburgh, where she continued to live. Ms Finnegan won a shield for debating at school and was deeply interested in politics, with a Rotary Club award taking her to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Ms Madden added. She also obtained an outdoor challenge scholarship to the Lake District in England, where she gained more experience in difficult terrain. She had a twin sister, who also studied at the school, as well as other siblings. She left in 2006 but maintained strong links with Dalriada. Police said Mr Bell was studying for a . PhD in Ocean Mapping in Oban, Argyll. Mr Bell's parents were reported to be too upset to comment from their home in Osbaldeston, near Blackburn, but a tribute was issued on the Facebook page of his father's decking business, Evabel. The statement read: 'We are so sad to let everyone know that Simon and Alison's son Chris was one of the people who were killed in the avalanche in Glencoe. 'Chris was a wonderful son, friend and human being. Our thoughts and prayers are with Simon, Alison and (brother) Ed at this awful time.' Mr Chesters lived in Leeds and was studying . for a PhD at Hull University. Prayers: A special service was held for the avalanche victims at St Mundaís Church . The avalanche warning for Glencoe was ‘considerable’ – two levels down from the most serious. The investigation into the tragedy will look at whether the group had assessed the risks properly. Northern Constabulary chief inspector Derek Paterson said: ‘The evidence suggests this was a group of experienced walkers.’ He added: ‘There is no shortage of . information out there from the mountain rescue service website to the . information service which gives practical tips and safety skills. We . would appeal to everyone to use this information.’ Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond called it an ‘appalling tragedy’. He added: ‘Our immediate thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been lost.’ Fellow climbers and locals came to pay their respects at St Munda's church at the special service . Remembrance and thanks: The service paid tribute to those who lost their lives and credited the rescuers for their efforts .","Christopher Bell, Una Finnegan and Tom Chesters named as the victims .

"Four of Australia's most wanted criminal suspects have been caught in just one week since police released a shame file of fugitive mug shots and appealed for help from the public. On 8 September, NSW Police Force's Operation Roam published details of 20 renegades they say are the most dangerous in the country - including photos of 18 of them - and have fled the state where the crimes they are wanted for occurred. Rewards of up to $1 million are being offered for information that leads to the capture of some of the suspects. Images of 18 out of 20 of Australia's most wanted fugitives were released by Crime Stoppers as part of Operation Roam . The publicity worked. Tip-offs from members of the public calling in of reporting online led to the first arrest within 24 hours of the campaign being launched and three more since, said Peter Price, the Deputy Chairman of Crime Stoppers Australia. 'It varies from state to state, but our call ratio is up by around 20 per cent across the country because of this appeal for information,' he said. 'It obviously works. Everybody has a next door neighbour. Because of this campaign there is literally nowhere to hide. There is 20 million sets of eyes looking for them.' Alleged fraudster Andrew John Bell (left), Nathan Glover (centre), suspected in a sexual assault, and alleged robber Matthew Leslie Tune (right) are three of four me arrested in the first week of a police crackdown . The massive publicity initiative was used for the operation due to the nature of the offenders, who have each fled the states where a warrant has been issued for their arrest. 'All of these people basically have extradition warrants out against them which is why they are expected to be in a state other than where they were charged,' Mr Price said. 'This operation is targeting people who are roaming around Australia who are trying to evade the law.' Those captured include Matthew Leslie Tune, 32, wanted in New South Wales in connection to an assault and robbery in the country town of Tamworth in March 2012. Tune was found at a half-way house in Melbourne. The three other men who have been arrested are Andrew John Bell, Nathan Glover and Scott John Heron. Five of Australia's most wanted men named by police in Operation Roam . Bell, 64, was allegedly involved in deceptions worth more than $100,000, assaults and thefts in Maryborough, Victoria, according to Crime Stoppers fugitive list. Glover, 20, is wanted for his alleged involvement in a serious assault in Wollongong, south of Sydney, in July 2013. Heron, also 20, is wanted over an alleged sexual assault in Shepparton, Victoria. Western Australia police are now focusing their efforts on Bern Neumann who is on the run  after escaping from prison during a release activity in February this year. He was jailed for  serious drug offences and still has 11 years and 10 months to serve. South Australian man Stuart Pearce is wanted for questioning in the killing of his wife and three children in 1991. This graphic show the projected ageing of Pierce since he disappeared . 'The smallest piece of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can be the missing piece of a puzzle to solving a crime or locating a wanted person,' Mr  Price said. The 16 remaining men are wanted for charges including murder, attempted murder, sexual assault, drug trafficking and robbery. One such fugitive is South Australian man Stuart Pearce, who is wanted for questioning in the slaying of his wife and three children in 1991. The chief executive officer of Crime Stoppers Victoria, Sam Hunter, warned that  the mobile nature of modern society enables suspects to move more fluidly through the nation. 'They may now be living in your neighbourhood,' Ms. Hunter said. 'They could be your neighbour or mechanic and have assumed another identity. They might catch the train in the morning.' Police recommend that members of the public should not approach any suspected wanted persons, but call Triple Zero immediately. Crime Stoppers can be contacted at 1800 333 000 or visited at their website.","The first arrest was made within 24 hours of the campaign being launched .

"Britain could be hit by power cuts next winter because the electricity supply is already ‘close to its limits’, experts warn. Capacity . is so stretched that a cold spell, combined with routine problems at . one or more plants, could overwhelm the system and see blackouts in . 2014-15, their damning report claims. A . major pressure on the National Grid is the forced closure of coal-fired . power stations to meet European green directives, the Royal Academy of . Engineering says. Candle power: Blackouts and power cuts were a familiar feature during the 1970s . But the drive to . low-carbon power from wind farms and new nuclear power stations ‘will . come at a cost’ and the authors call for politicians to be honest with . the public about it. Ed . Miliband has promised to freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour . wins the 2015 General Election but the report, commissioned by the Prime . Minister’s Council for Science and Technology, says the major power . firms already lack the certainty about prices to invest in . desperately-needed new capacity, and will find it difficult to secure . supply in future while trying to keep bills low. Two . of the Big Six energy firms have already announced inflation-busting . price increases this winter, with British Gas’s 9.2 per cent rise . yesterday following SSE’s 8 per cent rise last week. Ed Miliband has promised to freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 General Election . For the report, engineers looked at . capacity in the power network this year, in 2015 and in 2019, and how . the system would cope during a peak in demand such as that seen during . the freezing winter of two years ago. They . concluded that a combination of adverse conditions is ‘likely to . stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of . 2014-15, increasing the chance of power outages’. Dr . John Roberts, chairman of the working group, said these were ‘real sets . of challenging conditions that have happened before and can be expected . again in the future’. However, . coal and gas-fired power stations are being forced to close as they do . not meet EU regulations on pollution, while four nuclear plants are . scheduled to be phased out by 2019. Dr . Roberts said this ‘would reduce the flexibility of the system and . increase the chances that otherwise manageable failures could jeopardise . the country’s power supply’. But . Business Minister Michael Fallon insisted: ‘The lights are not going to . go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but . stuff is being done. ‘We’ve . opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You’re going . to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations.’ The RAE experts interviewed staff at the National Grid, the regulator Ofgem, the Government and the big power firms. They . call on ministers to build more gas plants in the coming years, but say . they must urge operators not to close them before 2015, and pay them to . generate more capacity. Ageing gas plants are being closed or mothballed because the high price of gas make them unprofitable. And . while coal prices have plummeted, undercut as a result of the shale gas . boom in the US, around a dozen coal plants will close by 2015 because . of green directives. Dame Sue Ion, fellow of the RAE, who . worked on the report, said: ‘We’re saying that when everything is going . well there is enough capacity in the system, but if there is a bit of a . problem such as one or two major stations going down for whatever reason . and an anticyclone comes from over the Atlantic, then at peak, demand . will potentially exceed supply. ‘We . have quite a lot of renewable energy being installed but it is . intermittent, so unless you have gas to back it up it’s a problem. Whether . the turbines are onshore or offshore, if it’s a cold winter that is not . windy then only a very small amount of energy will be generated.’ Possible closures: Dr John Roberts, chairman of the reports's working group, said several coal and oil-fired power stations could be closed in the next decade if there is no investment . Major investment is . needed in the electricity network, she said, but the new wave of nuclear . power stations announced today will not come online until at least 2020 . – leaving a looming gap. ‘In . the long term we will need a lot more power’, she said. ‘The important . thing is before any statements are made about fixing prices there have . to be decisions made about how much investment is needed and how the . costs of that investment – which do not come from taxation, they come . out of electricity bills – will be paid for.’ Most . of the network was built in the 1960s. Since then the population has . risen by more than 10million – and the use of electricity in transport . systems and to heat homes has soared. Dr . Roberts said: ‘Major investment is needed in the UK’s electricity . system to achieve a modern, sustainable and secure service that will be . the foundation of economic growth. At risk: Leading engineers have warned the country is at a high risk of blackouts over the next five years as the ageing electrical system comes under pressure . ‘Government will set the market conditions but it is private industry that will invest the necessary money. Most . of the energy companies operating in this country are international . organisations that will invest in the UK only if it proves to be an . attractive market. ‘Modernising . and decarbonising the system will come at a cost, with likely rises in . the unit price of electricity and difficult decisions will need to be . made. It is vital that . government and industry work together to foster a constructive dialogue . with the public about the challenges we face.’ By Jason Groves chief political correspondent . George Osborne has signed a deal with China which opens the doors for investors to take control of British nuclear power plants . China will be allowed to own . and operate a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain . despite warnings the move is a ‘serious error’ that could undermine . national security. Chancellor . George Osborne said yesterday he was happy for nuclear firms owned by . the Chinese state to take a ‘majority stake’ in British power plants. Billions . of pounds of investment is  likely to follow, with Chinese firms . expected to take a major stake in the £14billion Hinkley C reactor . planned for construction in Somerset. But . some experts have warned against giving China a controlling stake in . the critical industry on national security grounds, arguing that it . would leave Britain at the mercy of the Communist regime. There . are also concerns that the move could give China access to details . about pressure points in Britain’s energy supplies and other sensitive . information. Mark . Pritchard, a Tory member of Parliament’s national security strategy . committee, said: ‘Investment is needed, but not at any cost, . particularly when there are national security implications. ‘I . don’t have a big problem with Chinese involvement in designing and . building nuclear power stations but they should not be allowed to . operate them. ‘It . would be a serious error to let them have operational control of our . electricity supply.’ The Chancellor has also faced  criticism from human . rights groups after failing to raise China’s appalling human rights . record with officials during a week-long visit. Pictured: Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station. Britain aims to renew ageing nuclear power plants but needs foreign investment to pay the huge upfront costs . China’s . state-controlled People’s Daily yesterday said a British admission that . it had ‘mishandled’ the issue of Tibet had paved the way for a week . that has seen Mr Osborne announce a string of Chinese investments in the . UK. Chinese companies have been criticised for their lack of transparency in a survey released by an anti-corruption watchdog. China got the lowest rating of the five major emerging economies, behind India, South Africa, Russia and Brazil. ‘Companies from China lag behind in every dimension with an overall score of 20 per cent,’ Berlin-based Transparency International says. ‘Given their growing influence in world markets, this is of concern.’ Firms were marked on how transparently they present anti-corruption measures and disclose data. The . claim was dismissed by Downing Street, which said Britain’s approach to . Tibet and its spiritual leader the Dalai Lama had ‘not changed’. Mr Osborne defended the . planned investment by China, saying: ‘There are many countries in the . world who wouldn’t want other countries involved in their civil nuclear . programme – I do, because by the way, if it wasn’t Chinese investment or . French investment, it would have to be British taxpayers, and I’d . rather British taxpayers were spending their money on our schools and . hospitals and those things, and let’s get the rest of the world . investing in our energy.’ Officials insist the national security implications of extending China’s reach in the UK have been fully considered. French . energy firm EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants . on the Hinkley C project. Initially Chinese companies are likely to hold . a minority stake in any project, but this could rise over time to a . majority.","Royal Academy of Engineering warns of risk as old plants begin to close .

"Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont quit last night, with a bitter attack aimed at Ed Miliband. After weeks of infighting, with the Scottish party in ‘meltdown’, Miss Lamont stood down with a shock denouncement of the Labour leadership. She accused colleagues of trying to run Scotland ‘like a branch office from London’, saying she had been left no choice but to resign. Scroll down for video . Johann Lamont is understood to be angry with Mr Miliband for failing to support her following the referendum . The 57-year-old had faced weeks of pressure to quit following her disappointing referendum performance and is understood to be angry with Mr Miliband for failing to support her. Sources say she has grown sick of internal party sniping and believes she has become a ‘scapegoat’ for party failures in Scotland. Rumours had been circulating that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Blairite Jim Murphy were being lined up to take over. But the final straw was said to be a row over the UK party’s decision to axe Scots Labour General Secretary Ian Price. Her resignation is a double blow for Mr Miliband, as it leaves Labour without a Scottish leader only six months from the General Election and with no obvious successor. Following the announcement, incoming First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish Labour was ‘in meltdown’. Miss Lamont told the Daily Record: ‘Scotland’s place is in the UK and I do not believe in powers for power’s sake. For example, I think power should be devolved from Holyrood to communities. ‘But colleagues need to realise the focus of Scottish politics is now Holyrood, not Westminster.’ Miss Lamont described some Labour MPs as ‘dinosaurs’ who failed to recognise that ‘Scotland has changed forever after the referendum . She added: ‘Any leader whose general secretary can be removed by London without any consultation is in an untenable position. ‘That has to change. The Scottish Labour Party must be a more autonomous party which works in partnership with the UK party. ‘We must be allowed to make our own decisions and control our own resources. ‘I believe the Scottish Labour Party is a family – it is my family. And I hope it is led by someone who knows how to treat family members properly.’ She said she was forced to quit after her attempts to reform the Scottish party were thwarted by Labour’s Westminster leadership. Miss Lamont described some Labour MPs as ‘dinosaurs’ who failed to recognise that ‘Scotland has changed forever after the referendum’. She had faced pressure to step down following the referendum. The Yes campaign triumphed in Labour’s heartlands of Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire and won in her own seat of Glasgow Pollok. Miss Lamont was elected as party leader in 2011, having acted as its deputy leader and having represented her constituency since 1999. Her official resignation announcement is expected today, with immediate effect, and her deputy, Anas Sarwar MP, will become acting leader. Earlier this week, former Labour First Ministers Lord McConnell and Henry McLeish suggested the party needed to be renewed. Lord McConnell said the party must ‘rediscover our sense of purpose, our vision for Scotland’. His predecessor, Mr McLeish, said: ‘Labour has to realise every vote has got to be fought for.’ Miss Lamont’s resignation will be a blow to Mr Miliband, who faces losing Scottish Labour votes over proposals to resolve the West Lothian Question. After losing ground to the SNP, the Scottish Labour Party has been torn between those who want it to move to the Left and centrists such as Mr Murphy, who is believed to have fallen out of favour with Mr Miliband. Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran, on the Left of the party, has said it must return to its ‘socialist principles’. There had been suggestions Mr Murphy could become Scottish leader. But he has resisted the call, with Mr Brown also refusing entreaties to become ‘father of the nation’. Rumours had been circulating that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown (right) and Blairite Jim Murphy (left) were being lined up to take over from Miss Lamont as leader of the Labour party in Scotland . Criticising bosses in the Labour Party for failing to allow Scotland more autonomy, Miss Lamont told the newspaper some in Labour circles in Westminster ‘do not understand the politics they are facing’.

Harry Needs tweeted the picture of the four-time Olympic medalist in a tight blue dress . One comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin while Twitter trolls attacked her about her weight and her nose. Earlier this year, Miss Adlington underwent surgery to have her nose reduced and bump removed. She told the Mail earlier this year: 'Obviously, being a swimmer, you never think you’re going to get any sort of profile, so I didn’t know what fame was. I didn’t expect it. 'The thing that I found very difficult when it all started happening after Beijing was that people were commenting on something that I just didn’t understand – on the way I look – and I thought, “What’s that got to do with swimming?” So that hit me.

"Former Prime Minister Tony Blair helped set up a deal which could allow the Qatari Royal Family to own 50 per cent of a landmark London hotel group, a court heard today. It was claimed Mr Blair had asked a Government minister in 2010 to lobby on behalf of Irish investor Patrick McKillen in his bid to stop Irish company Coroin's £660million debt falling into the hands of the Irish government's agency for toxic debt, Nama. Blair personally persuaded the ruler of Qatar to contact Irish investor Patrick McKillen and his bid to gain control of the £1billion hotel company, which owns Claridge's, the Berkeley and the Connaught. Honest broker: Irish investor Patrick McKillen says Tony Blair and his company's representatives lobbied on his behalf and acted as a go-between in a potential deal to own three top London hotels . Shortly after the two 'great friends' met in Doha, the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad asked his son Sheikh Jassim to contact Mr McKillen in London to arrange the deal, the High Court was told. Mr Blair acted as something of a peace broker after Mr McKillen and the Qataris fell out over a failed deal to buy the hotels a year ago. Mr Blair and his company Tony Blair Associates then acted as an 'honest broker' between the McKillen camp and the Qataris in a £70million deal to take a controlling stake in Coroin. The deal will come to fruition if Mr McKillen wins his High Court battle with billionaire twins the Barclay brothers. Mr McKillen claims the brothers unlawfully prevented him buying a crucial stake in the company. Partnership: Qatari royal Sheikh Jassim contacted Mr McKillen over a bid for the exclusive hotels . Exclusive: Claridge's the world-famous five-star hotel in Mayfair . No budget rooms: The Connaught hotel in London, also situated in pricey Mayfair . Style: The Berkeley in Knightsbridge, another of the trio of hotels being fought over . Property . developer Patrick McKillen  admitted deleting hundreds of messages . which could have related to an on-going court case. Mr McKillen and billionaire twins the . Barclay brothers are locked in a legal battle at London's High Court . over the ownership of a landmark £1billion hotel group. The property developer admitted wiping . his outbox earlier this year of hundreds of messages, but he denied the . messages had any relation to the trial. Kenneth Maclean QC, for the Barclay . brothers' company, claimed the developer had deleted the messages to . keep a £70 million deal he had made with the Qatari royal family to buy . back shares in the hotel company. And Mr McKillen told the court he had 'concerns' the Barclays or their agents were hacking his Irish mobile phone. Mr McKillen claimed the brothers had . hired private detectives to follow him out of restaurants and had . attempted to find his American social security number. However, he admitted he had no . evidence Barclay's or their interests had hacked his phone but said he . was 'very concerned' because they would 'stop at nothing'. Mr McKillen claims the Barclays acted . unlawfully when they denied him an opportunity to buy a stake in Coroin . owned by financier Derek Quinlan. Giving evidence to Justice David . Richards, Mr McKillen claimed he would have done anything in 'his power' to increase his 36 per cent stake in the company and stop the Barclay . brothers from completing their 'hostile takeover'. The Barclay brothers and their associated companies deny the allegations. The case continues. The High Court in London was told investor Mr McKillen first met Mr Blair at an economic meeting in Davos while he was still Prime Minister. The pair re-kindled their relationship through PR guru Matthew Freud in early 2010 when Mr McKillen and hotel company Coroin, in which he was an investor, was about to be tied into the Irish government agency for bad debt. Mr Blair was enlisted to 'give advice' to stop the company's debt falling into the Irish government's agency. But in an email sent by Tony Blair Associates executive Varun Chandra in January 2010, Mr Blair suggested sitting government City Minister Lord Paul Myners lobby influential people in Ireland to stop the debt falling into Nama. The relationship with Tony Blair Associates continued throughout 2011 and Mr McKillen would meet consultants for 'ongoing chats, every week or so we had a coffee.' But it was Mr Blair himself, who during a business meeting in Doha with Sheikh Hamad, suggested the groups should form a partnership. Giving evidence today, Mr McKillen said Sheikh Jassim contacted him out of the blue in February 14 suggesting they met in the lobby in Claridge's to discuss a deal. Mr McKillen said: 'During the meeting Sheik Jassim said that Tony Blair and his father had been doing business in Doha and the issue of Maybourne came up. 'Tony Blair had suggested that they should make contact with Paddy McKillen. Tony understood that there was no progress and Sheik Hamad contacted his son who was in London and suggested contact with me should be made.' Mr McKillen denied the Qatari deal was done by Mr Blair acting as his agent. He said: 'No, it came purely from a discussion in Doha between an ex head of state and head of state. I'm not sure what business they were doing but the two gentlemen are very close. I felt that Mr Blair's office would smooth any issues.' Barrister for the Barclay brothers Kenneth Maclean questioned if Mr Blair or his office had sought payment for his role in the deal. But Mr McKillen said he had never thought about paying Mr Blair or his office and agreed Mr Blair was acting out of the 'goodness of his heart'. Mr McKillen said: 'Maybe he was playing the bigger picture with the Qataris but Tony Blair genuinely wanted a resolution for the hotel group he had a personal anxiety to get a resolution for the hotels.' The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",Irish investor insists Blair helped broker deal 'out of goodness of his heart'
"A 100,000-signature petition demanding that Welsh cancer sufferers get the same access to treatment as English patients was handed over by campaigners yesterday. They called on the Welsh government – which is run by Labour – to create a special fund to pay for advanced but expensive new drugs. Cancer victims in Wales have been forced to use their own savings or move to England to get cutting-edge medication recommended by their doctors. Professor John Wagstaff, from the South West Wales Cancer Institute in Swansea, pictured, said the lack of a Cancer Drugs Fund in Wales was a ‘serious issue . If they do try to get the treatment in their own country, they must make bureaucratic ‘individual patient funding requests’ – which are frequently rejected. By contrast, English sufferers have access to 71 types of pioneering cancer treatment for free on the NHS. They are available through the £200million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund, which was set up in 2010. The petition of 98,230 names was handed to Conservative members of the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff yesterday. It was started by Julie McGowan after her friend Ann Wilkinson, a 76-year-old bowel cancer sufferer from Monmouthshire, was initially denied funding for the life-extending drug Avastin. Mrs McGowan said: ‘We are all part of the National Health Service and I believe Welsh patients should have the same access to these drugs.’ Professor John Wagstaff, from the South West Wales Cancer Institute in Swansea, said the lack of a Cancer Drugs Fund in Wales was a ‘serious issue’. He added that his own success rate for getting drugs approved through the independent request scheme was just 15 per cent. By contrast, English sufferers have access to 71 types of pioneering cancer treatment for free on the NHS . In 2011 the Rarer Cancers Foundation estimated that setting up a Cancer Drugs Fund for Wales would cost around £3.3million a year, depending on which treatments it included. The charity’s chief executive Andrew Wilson described the inequality in access to treatment as ‘devastating’ for patients. Stephen Crabb, the Tory Welsh Secretary, added: ‘Welsh Labour’s continued refusal to adopt the scheme is pure politicking. The Labour Government in Cardiff need to start putting the needs of Welsh people above desire to save face on their own poor policy choices.’ But a spokesman for the Welsh government said: ‘We are proud in Wales that patients have access to proven and cost-effective treatments for all conditions, not just cancer. ‘We will not be replacing our system with a cancer drugs fund – the chair of the Cancer Drugs Fund in England has admitted it provides funding for drugs which have “no impact on survival” and “uncertainty” about whether quality of life is improved or not. ‘Research published in the British Journal of Cancer earlier this year concluded that Wales had a faster uptake of medicines most recently launched and subsequently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence than England. ‘We spend more per head on cancer care than in England and we do not agree with spending millions of pounds on non-approved medicines.’","Petition calls for a special fund to pay for advanced but expensive drugs .

"Ronald Koeman welcomes three former Southampton players back to St Mary's after warning his current squad to think twice before leaving the south coast. England midfielder Adam Lallana will face the team he spent 12 years with for the first time since his £25million summer move to Liverpool. But while Lallana has become a key part of Brendan Rodgers' Champions League push, fellow ex-Saints Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert have endured frustrating starts to their Anfield careers. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman welcomes back former Saints players to St Mary's . England international Adam Lallana is set for his first return to St Mary's since his £25million summer switch . Dejan Lovren only spent a season at Southampton but impressed in the centre of defence . Rickie Lambert has had to make do with a spot on the bench and came close to joining Aston Villa last month . Rodgers is preferring to use midfielder Emre Chan as a makeshift centre back despite paying Southampton £20m for Croatian international Lovren. Saints legend Lambert is likely to have to watch Sunday's game from the substitutes' bench after finding starts hard to come by since joining his boyhood heroes. Koeman has also cited Calum Chambers' struggles at Arsenal as a reason for sought-after trio Morgan Schneiderlin, Nathaniel Clyne and Jay Rodriguez to consider rejecting the advances of Premier League big-guns. Former Barcelona star Koeman said: 'It is not always for football reasons players' move, maybe it is about money. We cannot pay salaries like the big teams play. 'If you stay you stay for different reasons, because you are sure you will play regularly in the first-team. It is about the age of the players and the experience of the player. It is normal you will lose players if you do not play every season in the Champions League. Lambert, Lallana and Lovren (pictured with Daniel Fox, second left) helped Southampton to eighth last year . 'I said to Calum Chambers: ""I don't think this is a good moment to go to Arsenal because you need to develop yourself and you will play much more here than you will at Arsenal.""' While Lambert is assured of a heroes' reception from the Southampton supporters, Lallana can expect a much more frosty welcome. Many supporters are angry with the way Lallana forced through his switch to Anfield, with suggestions from club insiders he refused to play for Southampton again. Lallana has refuted those claims and former teammate Schneiderlin is baffled by the animosity directed towards his former captain. Schneiderlin said: 'I know it was hard for Adam to leave the club. He was very emotional about it and I don't know why the fans are so angry with him. 'He gave everything to this football club from the first moment he wore the shirt when he was in the youth team. 'People come and people go. That is part of your career. Adam is a good guy and people should not forget what he did for the club.'","Ronald Koeman has warned his current squad to think twice before leaving .

"'Lone killer': Police believe Tyler Holder, 17, acted alone when he abducted, raped and smothered 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher in July . A Texas coroner has determined that the 6-year-old girl who was found dead under a tarp in July was raped and then smothered with plastic bags. Police believe 17-year-old Tyler . Holder acted alone when he abducted Alanna Gallagher, sexually assaulted and killed her, dumping the child's body in the Forth Worth suburb of Saginaw July 1. Holder was shot in the throat July 23 when he . opened fire on police officers as they tried to arrest him, wounding one of them in the groin. The teenage suspect had survived his injuries and now faces charges of capital murder and attempted capital murder in connection to the shooting of a police officer. Holder remains in jail on $1million bail and is due back in court Thursday. According to a report recently released by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office, Alanna's official cause of death determined to be was asphyxiation from the four plastic shopping bags wrapped around her head. New documents made public in the case and cited by Dallas Morning News show that police believe Holder acted alone, but may have used his mother's car to abduct the child and then dispose of her body. The documents also state that Holder bought a new cell phone two days after Alanna's murder. The teen gave his old phone to a friend, who told police after Holder’s arrest July 23 that he had discovered a YouTube search for 'Good kid porn websites' on the device, as well as images of male genitals and pictures of the suspect dressed as a woman. Brutal death: Alanna's official cause of death has been determined to be asphyxiation from plastic shopping bags placed over her head . Anti-social: Holder, who has been described as a trouble-maker, lived opposite Alanna in Saginaw. A street view picture of his home shows two people making obscene gestures at the Google camera . The 17-year-old accused of brutally . raping and murdering his 6-year-old neighbor left a note for his mother . that read: 'I love you, I'm sorry,' according to FBI documents. Duct . tape, used condoms and blood-stained toilet paper were also listed as . items found by officers when they searched Tyler Holder's home. However, the first item listed on a receipt of 153 items seized by the FBI, according to KHOU, was a 'sealed letter addressed to Mom with 'I . love you, I'm sorry', and a crumpled up piece of paper with the . words 'Mom I' on it. Holder's . neighbors had described him as a trouble maker who had been involved in . 'criminal mischief', the arrest warrant showed. Classmates . have also described the 17-year-old as 'socially awkward' and in a . Google picture of the suspect's home, two obscured people can be seen . making obscene hand gestures at the Google car camera. It has not been . confirmed if Holder was in the picture. According . to the warrant, Alanna was sexually assaulted and suffocated, before . her wrists and ankles were bound with red duct tape, and her body was . dumped in a tarp less than a mile from her home July 1. When investigators later searched Holder's home, they discovered a . purple Timex watch with pink and green flowers on it, which matched the description of the timepiece Alanna's parents had given her so the girl would know when to come home while playing outside. Girls' necklaces . and jewelry, latex gloves, computers, digital . cameras and a journal were also seized. 'The three of us': A Facebook image shows Alanna's parents, Laura . and Karl (left) Gallagher with Miles McDaniel (right), who are in a . polyamorous relationship . Boyfriend: Patricia Hustede banned Holder from her home after he started dating her daughter, Cassie . Officers were able to trace a roll of toilet paper found with Alanna's body to Costco, which Holder's mother was a member of. Originally, Saginaw Police had said . they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was . under suspicion almost immediately, according to 8 News. Within . hours of Alanna’s body being found, officers reported seeing Tyler . Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says. Residents . informed police Holder had told them it was Alanna’s body that had . been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of . the victim. The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching. Holder . was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of . Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to . apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic. The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,' Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. Weapons: Holder was said to have carried knives and pulled one on a teenage boy after destroying his snowman, according to one source . Tragic: Six-year-old Alanna Gallagher was found . bound and gagged. The youngster had been raped. Right, Charles Lodotto, . who Holder allegedly opened fire, on hitting the officer in the groin . But . video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling . Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had . said. When they analyzed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position. During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men. Belt: A DNA sample taken by police of Holder matched DNA found on Alanna's body and on a belt found at the scene . On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were later notified that it matched evidence found on Alanna's body. Four days later, officers arrived at . Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbors heard them pounding on the . door shortly before multiple shots rang out. Charles Lodatto, an officer who was . wounded during the confrontation, was shot in the groin and the bullet . hit an artery and broke into pieces. The . probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest offered gruesome details about the suffering inflicted upon . Alanna, who went missing July 1. The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped. Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen . Whiddon bound and wrapped in a . gray tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home . later in the day of her disappearance. Genetic . evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder . voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say. His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna’s body in the tarp. Four Walmart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck. Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy found her body . Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid. Police . later found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in . rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two . doors from where Alanna lived with her family. Alanna lived with her siblings, their . parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles McDaniel, who . was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents. Police . have said that the Gallaghers and McDaniel were home while Alanna . played outside alone. They are not sure when she was abducted from the . neighborhood.

"The three children who died after their canoe overturned were not wearing life jackets, it emerged yesterday. Grace Mackay, five, also known as Gracie, Ewen Beaton, five, and his brother Jamie, two, all died after their Canadian canoe sank at Loch Gairloch, off the Scottish Highlands. Grace's eight-year-old sister Callie survived – managing to swim to shore with her father Garry, 35, after the accident on Sunday. She was only told yesterday that her younger sister had drowned in the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragic brothers: New pictures of Ewen Beaton, left, and his younger sibling Jamie were released by police and are believed to be taken not long before their deaths this week . Loss: Five-year-old Grace Mackay (right), pictured with her sister Callie, was rescued from the water but died in hospital . Police are still looking for the boys' father Ewen Fraser Beaton, 32, who was still missing yesterday despite extensive searches, and is feared dead. Grace was found floating face down in the water and later died in hospital. Callie's grandfather John Mackay told The Daily Telegraph that the grief-stricken family had gathered at her parents home in Muir of Ord, outside Inverness, yesterday to break the news to Callie. Still missing: Ewen Fraser Beaton, 32, has not been found since the incident and sadly is presumed dead . He said the family wanted to be together to tell her that her sister - who she was inseparable from - had passed away. Mr Mackay said the whole family were 'in a hell of a state' after learning the news that Grace, despite being raced to hospital after she was found face down in the water, had not survived. He was at her bedside with his son and Grace's mother Wendy Macdonald when they learned the news. 'We had a fair idea when we arrived at the hospital that she was in trouble but we held on to a little bit of hope that she would pull through,' he told The Daily Telegraph. He said that the two men - who were reported to be great friends and had been on numerous fishing trips - knew what they were doing and the family outing had turned into a tragedy, the Daily Telegraph reported. In a statement, Grace's family said . yesterday: 'Grace was a funny, caring, thoughtful daughter and . granddaughter, full of life who loved animals and being outdoors. 'She . adored her family and was our beautiful angel. We are devastated by the . loss of our best friend.' The Beatons, from near Beauly, and the . Mackays, from Muir of Ord, near Inverness, were on a day trip and had . been camping in a wigwam before going out in a canoe they had brought . with them. After the craft overturned, Callie and Garry Mackay, 35, managed to alert the coastguard when they reached the shore. Stornoway Coastguard yesterday . confirmed that Mr Mackay and Mr Beaton were not wearing any kind of . protective clothing when the boat sank. Mr Mackay was found by a local . resident, Jim Aaron, on the shore with his shirt in his hand. The children had all been wearing . buoyancy aids. Similar to a waistcoat but with foam inside, they are . designed to help keep the wearer afloat. But, unlike life jackets, they . will not keep the wearer's head above water if they fall unconscious. Family tragedy: Brothers Ewen and Jamie Beaton drowned after their canoe capsized in the Scottish Highlands. They are pictured with their father, Ewen Fraser Beaton, who is still missing . The RNLI said yesterday that while . buoyancy aids might be enough in certain circumstances, such as in . supervised situations or calm waters, life jackets offer the best chance . of survival. A spokesman said: 'The tragic events . in Scotland at the weekend have deeply saddened everyone in the RNLI and . our thoughts go out to the family and friends of those whose lives were . lost. 'The sea can be very unpredictable at . times and there will always be an element of risk in going afloat, but . in our view a life jacket, or some form of personal flotation device . appropriate to the activity, offers the best chance of survival in the . event of difficulties.' 'Beautiful angel': Grace's family released a statement expressing their sorrow over the loss of their 'best friend'. Tracy Sinclair, head of Tarradale . Primary School, Muir of Ord, where both Grace and Callie were pupils, . said yesterday: 'Gracie was a happy, thoughtful little girl who was . popular and well liked by everybody. 'This has come as a shock to the whole school community and we are all deeply saddened.' It is understood the two adults were not wearing lifejackets and that Mr Beaton failed to surface after the boat capsized. The cause of the catastrophe was also under investigation. A friend spoke of how the distraught . father came to pick up his mother, JulieAnn Mackay, and sister Michelle . from their home in Inverness to drive to Gracie’s bedside at the Royal . Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. The friend said: ‘Garry was very . upset and I asked him what happened. He said he didn’t know. One minute . they were in the canoe, the next minute it had capsized. 'Within seconds, the kids had floated away from him and he couldn’t reach them. ‘Callie was closest to him and he . managed to reach her and they both swam ashore to get help. 'We just . can’t believe how a pleasant Sunday afternoon can go so badly wrong. It . was only a couple of days ago that the kids were playing in my garden.’ Two weeks ago, Gracie had started at Tarradale Primary School where Callie is also a pupil. Local resident, Jim Aaron, 70, relived . the moment a terrified Mr Mackay raced into his back garden around . 4.15pm on Sunday and screamed for help to save his younger daughter. Search: A rescue team out on Loch Gairloch looking for Mr Beaton, who was thrown into the water when the canoe capsized . On the look out: Two coastguard workers on the beach at Loch Gairloch search the rocky coastline for the missing man . ‘He just appeared out of nowhere in a frantic state, panicking, in tears,’ said Mr Aaron. ‘He said he needed help, people had gone into the water. He was on his knees on the ground with his head in his hands. ‘He told me he was in the canoe when . it tipped over and he saw his friend go under. The children were holding . onto the other man when he just went under.’ Mr Mackay and Callie . appear to have become separated after reaching the shore when Mr Mackay . went for help. Mr Aaron described how he searched increasingly frantic . Mr Mackay until Callie was found – in shock and shivering after swimming . in the freezing water. James Cameron, 34, who co-runs the Big Sands campsite, discovered Gracie face down in the water and unconscious. ‘She had her buoyancy aid on,’ he said. ‘It was keeping her afloat but it wasn’t keeping her head out the water.’ Callie’s step-grandmother, Pennie . Macdonald, of Dingwall, said: ‘Callie is a very keen and strong swimmer. She took lessons at the school and I’m not surprised she managed to . swim to shore. ‘The girls were like twins, they were inseparable and Callie will be lost without her sister.’ Hopes fading: The search for Mr Beaton was called off for the night late on Monday . Grim hunt: A rescue lifeboat trawls Loch Gairloch looking for the missing canoeist . Camping site: The co-owner of the Sands Caravan Park found the five-year-old girl face down in the water . Peter Godding, coastguard sector . manager, said of Callie: ‘It’s amazing really, she swam quite a long way . in the sea. It’s pretty incredible that she did survive. ‘She is very courageous and very resourceful to be able to complete a 500metre swim to shore. Speaking about the type of canoe the . group had been in, he said: ‘They are quite cheap vessels to purchase . and unfortunately it’s quite difficult to maintain the stability if you . stand up in them.’ He described the search for Mr Beaton, which was stood down yesterday, as ‘extensive’. Mr Godding said: ‘He has been in the . water a very long time, if he is still in the water. We have extensively . completed a set of criteria which terminates the search.’ The Beaton family lived in Beauly, ten . miles west of Inverness. Five-year-old Ewen Beaton attended Teanassie . Primary School, near Beauly. His brother was due to start nursery at the 61-pupil school at the end of the year. James Martin, chairman of the school’s parent council, said: ‘The school community is devastated by this tragic news. ‘The Beatons are a well-known and highly respected family and the impact of their loss will be felt throughout the community.’ Tragedy: The three rescued children were taken to Raigmore hospital (pictured) in Inverness and Broadford Hospital in Skye .","Brothers Ewen, five, and Jamie Beaton, two, died after canoe capsized .

Emory was preparing on Wednesday to receive its fourth Ebola . patient, Texas nurse, Amber Vinson, who helped treat Liberian patient Thomas . Eric Duncan, who died of Ebola and was the first person . diagnosed with the virus in the United States. Two other Americans who contracted Ebola in Liberia were . treated in Emory's isolation unit and released in August.

Dr Kent Brantly and missionary aid worker Nancy Writebol both recovered from the virus after receiving the experimental serum, Z-Mapp, during their care at Emory in Atlanta . Dr Brantly then donated blood to Dr Rick Sacra, who was treated at Nebraska Medical and recovered, along with NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who was still being cared for in Omaha. The doctor offered to donate blood to Thomas Duncan but their blood types did not match. Incredibly, Dr Brantly also matched with the first nurse struck down with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham. She is said to be in a good condition today. The second nurse to contract Ebola from 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital was being transferred to Emory University Hospital on Wednesday. Miss Vinson, 29, from Akron, Ohio, was the second nurse in a matter of days to be diagnosed with the deadly virus in Dallas and was described as 'ill but clinically stable' after going to Texas Health on Tuesday with a low-grade fever. She is set to be flown to Emory in Atlanta, Georgia in quarantine units with staff specially-trained in infectious diseases. Both patients recovered. Miss Vinson's stepfather, Ronald Schuler, told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'Right now she's doing OK. Her temperature is going down. We don't want to do a lot of talking about it now. She's OK. The main concern is for her to get better.' It also emerged on Wednesday that the nurse had traveled on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 from Cleveland, Ohio to Dallas-Fort Worth, the day before she was diagnosed, after spending five days in her home state to plan her wedding. The CDC said the 29-year-old had a temperature of 99.5F - just below the threshold of 100.4F when she boarded the flight. The CDC has asked all 132 passengers to get in touch as an extreme precaution.

"It was certainly a day for wrapping up in something warm at the Cheltenham races. But few went as far Shirley Overbury – who spent £2,400 on a mink fur coat when she found she had underdressed. The property developer was one of hundreds of women proudly sporting real fur amid the freezing weather on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival yesterday. No fur-ther questions: Property developer Shirley Overbury who spent £2,400 on a mink coat to keep the cold out at Cheltenham . Stalls at the course reported record sales of coats and hats made of fox, beaver and rabbit – with punters and shopkeepers declaring that animal pelts had ‘lost their stigma’. Certainly Mrs Overbury, who said she bought the coat to look ‘glamorous’, was unapologetic. She said critics of real fur ‘do not know what they are missing’. Animal charities, however, were ‘appalled’ that race organisers were hosting at least 12 retailers selling both new and vintage fur clothing. David Bowles, the RSPCA’s head of campaigns, said: ‘Whilst it is legal to sell fur, the RSPCA believes this is a trade that should not be taking place in the UK. 'Animals farmed for their fur are often confined to tiny, barren cages and denied opportunities to perform much natural behaviour.’ Colour splash: These two race fans went for orange, pink, blue and natural hues to stay warm . Prefur-ed outerwear: Retailers reported record sales of fur on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival . Wild thing: This woman's cossack hat nearly engulfed her head as she used her binoculars to get a closer look . Heads or tails: This racegoer left no doubt as to what her hat and collar was made of . Racegoers, though, insisted real fur was more eco-friendly than fake fur and ensured the pelt of animals killed for food did not go to waste. Mrs Overbury, from Cheltenham, bought her tan and brown-striped mink knee-length coat from a stall inside the course grounds called Devon Clothing. She said: ‘Ladies like to look glamorous at Cheltenham but it is often cold here, so the furs keep out the wind.’ Events co-ordinator Sarah-Jayne Townend, 27, also had no reservations about wearing fur. She wore a £495 racoon-fur hat that she was bought as a birthday present. She said: ‘Real fur is the way forward. It keeps you warm and it looks amazing.’ Real fur, fur real: Two ladies  flash their warm headgear as they watch their chosen horse on the track . Prepared fur a long day: Female visitors wrapped up in coats and hats made from everything from fox to mink . Birds of a feather: A blonde race fan sported a fur collar and a feathery fascinator on the first day of the Cheltenham races . It's a bit nippy outside: Others were less worried about the cold . Alison Mossop, 43, who owns her own . helicopter business, browsed the fur shops while wearing a brown hat . made of beaver pelt and a mink and sable coat. She said real fur was more ‘eco-friendly’, adding: ‘It takes ten barrels of oil to make a fake fur coat.’ Roxanna Dent, 33, runs Dent Fine Art stall at Cheltenham Races. As well as selling art, they also sell furs. Mrs Dent, originally from Siberia, said she had seen a huge change in British attitudes towards fur in the last couple of years. She said: ‘When I first came to this country eight years ago, people were scared to wear fur. 'Now, people in Britain are friendly towards fur, and we have sold more in the last two years than we did in the six years before that.’ The opening day of the festival was delayed by 35 minutes after a severe overnight frost affected the track. Temperatures plummeted to -4C in the night, but rose to 3C by the time race-goers arrived at midday. Yesterday was the best day for punters – and worst day for bookmakers’ – in Cheltenham’s history. David Williams from Ladbrokes estimated British bookies lost a staggering £15million, after the race favourites enjoyed a series of wins.","The ladies of Cheltenham kept the cold out with real fur this year .

"Emails cache: Stevie Deans, the union official at the heart of the Grangemouth oil refinery crisis, quit his job before he could be sacked after he was accused of using company time to conduct Labour party business . The union official at the heart of the Grangemouth oil refinery crisis quit his job last night, piling more pressure on Ed Miliband to re-open an investigation into his conduct. Stevie Deans was Unite’s convenor at the plant and was facing the sack from bosses Ineos after they discovered he used company time to conduct Labour party business. Around 1,000 emails – now in the hands of police – appeared to link Mr Deans and other Unite associates to Labour’s selection of its candidate in Falkirk. Last night Mr Deans quit before he could be fired – but he remains chairman of the local party and is Unite’s convenor in Scotland. Sources at Ineos said Mr Deans spent up to a quarter of his work time on party business, while sending and receiving more than 1,000 emails from his work laptop. The damning findings follow accusations that Mr Deans tried to rig the selection of a candidate to replace disgraced Falkirk MP Eric Joyce by signing up new union members to the Labour Party without their knowledge. A Labour inquiry and a police probe were dropped after  witnesses withdrew statements. However emails from Mr Deans and other Unite officials suggest that solicitors for the union drafted the retractions, which were then approved by Mr Deans. These and other emails are being scrutinised by Scotland’s police economic crime unit, heaping pressure on Mr Miliband. It is the latest blow to the Labour leader who has been trying to fight accusations he is too close to Unite, the party’s biggest donor which has given £8.4million since he became party chief. Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey has also tried to flex his muscle over party policy and candidates. He and other Unite figures threatened to boycott Labour’s conference unless Mr Deans and the Left-wing candidate Karie Murphy were reinstated to the party. Unite also threatened a strike over Ineos’ decision to investigate Mr Deans. This was blamed for a stand-off which saw Grangemouth almost close its petrochemical plant, with the loss of 800 jobs, last week. Sources at Ineos said Mr Deans spent up to a quarter of his work time on party business, while sending and receiving more than 1,000 emails from his work laptop . Conservative . Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Stevie Deans’ resignation is yet . another reason why Ed Miliband must finally act. He must publish the . internal Labour inquiry into Falkirk. ‘Ed Miliband should also open a . new inquiry, to investigate properly the initial allegations of . selection rigging and Unite’s attempt to subvert the internal inquiry. If Ed Miliband backs down to Len McCluskey yet again, how can he . possibly stand up for hard-working people?’ A spokesman for Mr . Miliband signalled the Labour Party investigation would only be reopened . once police had finished their inquiries. He said: ‘Information has . been handed to the police. It is right to let that police process take . its course. After that process is complete we will decide whether . further action is necessary.’ Dispute: His suspension had previously triggered a dramatic stand-off, culminating in the shock closure of the petrochemical plant (pictured). This was only reversed at the 11th hour after the union backed down . Mr Deans’ resignation was announced in . a statement from Ineos, which said: ‘Mr Stephen Deans has today . resigned from the company with immediate effect.’ The convener, a former welder who has worked at Grangemouth for 24 years, declined to comment on his resignation. Answering . the door to his smart bungalow on an executive estate near Falkirk, he . appeared tired and said: ‘Sorry, I’m not interested.’ He has vigorously . denied that he and others tried to rig the Falkirk selection process. Mr . Joyce, still an independent MP for Falkirk, said yesterday: ‘Ineos have . got Mr Deans bang to rights and these emails are entirely damning.’ Pressure: Ed Miliband is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote-rigging .","Stevie Deans investigated for spending company time on Labour business .

"Katie Maytum is suing NHS Wales for £750,000 after she discovered a lump in her breast but was told it was not 'urgent' A young mother dying from breast cancer says a long delay before seeing a consultant has left her too ill to be cured. Katie Maytum, 35, is suing an under-fire Welsh NHS health board for £750,000 over her five-and-a-half month wait to be diagnosed, despite her GP’s urgent referral. She went to her family doctor in July 2010 after finding a lump in her left breast, and was fast-tracked for an appointment with a cancer specialist. But Vummiti Muralikrishnan, a consultant surgeon at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, downgraded her to a ‘routine’ case. Miss Maytum, from Maesteg, should have been seen by a specialist within a fortnight of her GP’s urgent referral under guidelines drawn up by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Instead, she had to wait until January 2011 for her appointment. On that day, an ultrasound scan revealed she had cancer. The terminally ill mother, who was training as a mental health nurse, had surgery and chemotherapy. But in April this year she was told she has only 18 months to live. She has a daughter, Megan, and a son, Zac, and is due to marry her partner this month. Her lawyers will argue at a High Court hearing in Cardiff today that the delay in her diagnosis and treatment contributed to her developing advanced cancer. They will claim that Mr Muralikrishnan was negligent in downgrading her case so it was not treated as ‘urgent suspected cancer’. He says his decision was reasonable. Miss Maytum’s grandmother and several great-aunts also suffered from breast cancer, but her family history of the disease was not noted on the referral form from the GP, it is claimed. In court documents, her lawyers allege that ‘as a result of the negligence (of the health board) she has been deprived of a cure for her cancer. 'Alternatively she has or is likely to suffer a loss of years of life which... is in the region of 44 years.’ NHS Wales admits that, under the hospital’s own rules, Miss Maytum should have been given an appointment within three months. But it argues that instead of following the Nice guidelines, it used its own alternative set of rules that allow urgent referrals to be downgraded and do not require patients with suspected cancer to be seen within a fortnight. A consultant at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales (pictured), downgraded her to a ‘routine’ case. NHS Wales admits Miss Maytum should've been given an appointment within three months . The Princess of Wales Hospital, run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, is at the heart of an police investigation into alleged neglect of vulnerable patients. The board could not be reached for response yesterday. The British Medical Association says the under-fire Labour-run NHS is facing ‘imminent meltdown’, but the Welsh Government said yesterday the latest figures showed that 85.1 per cent of cancer patients in Wales were treated within 62 days, compared with 83.5 per cent in England. A spokesman added: ‘We are determined to ensure every person in Wales gets the best quality care they need.'","Katie Maytum, 35, noticed lump in left breast in July 2010 and visited GP .

"Need for Speed games can be hit and miss. For every Hot Pursuit, there’s a wrong turn such as The Run. It seems that every time they start to over complicate and stray away from their core gameplay, they lose a huge chunk of what makes them appealing to race fans. That being fast, frenetic, no-holds-barred racing. Fast and the furious: if rivals start giving you a hard time, use your Evasion Tech to stop them in their tracks . And that’s exactly what Need for Speed Rivals promises to offer in spades. Developed by EA’s newest studio, Ghost Games, and powered by the Frostbite™ 3 game engine, Rivals is set in the fictional Redview County. In Rivals, gamers play as either a cop or racer, where each side of the law has its own set of high stakes challenges, rewards and consequences. As a racer, the goal is to become infamous for taking risks behind the wheel and capturing your most intense escapes on video for the world to see. Chase is on: some of the world's most powerful supercars feature in the game - and all have their own strengths and weaknesses . The more cops players evade, the more Speed Points they collect, enabling them to unlock new cars and items. As a cop, players work together as part of a team in pursuit of racers, earning prominence and rising in the ranks of the Police Force with every bust. Achieving higher ranks unlocks new police only cars and more powerful Pursuit Tech. Thankfully, there’s more customisation than ever before – with paintjobs, custom licence plates, decals, rims and performance upgrades all available. Plus, with 11 upgradeable Pursuit and Evasion Tech items – such as turbo boosts, jammers, EMPs and roadblocks, expect plenty of brutal vehicular warfare. Dodge this: the Charger, famed for its brutal, uncompromising nature, is sure to be a favourite with fans . You can even save certain configurations to ensure you have the best tools for each scenario. Ferrari also makes its long-awaited return to the Need for Speed franchise, notably the stunning F13 berlinetta. At the heart of Need for Speed Rivals is AllDrive, an innovative new online feature that allows a  seamless transition from playing alone, to playing with friends. There’s also an improved Autolog system that lets you compare stats and challenges with friends. It’s set for release on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC on November 19, and is penned for next-gen later this year. Agree with Talal?

"It is one of the most iconic beat-em-ups ever created. And now, after laying dormant for years, Killer Instinct is ready to explode on to the next-generation Xbox One. But why did we have to wait so long? MailOnline talks to Torin Rettig, a producer at Microsoft Studios. What efforts have been made to ensure this version of Killer Instinct remains faithful to the original? TR: From the very beginning staying faithful to the original games has been a top priority in development. It's tricky, especially after almost two decades to bring a franchise back. You need to stay true to the original, but you also need to update it into a modern title. Killer Instinct was a definitive fighting game back in the 1990's. It's style, visuals and gameplay were very unique. Brutal: With a classic cast, huge combos and an awesome soundtrack, KI is shaping nicely . Things such as the wild, diverse cast of characters, massive combos, combo breakers and the iconic announcer were unique to KI and made it a blast to play. It was key to us to bring all of those elements back and judging by the response we've been pretty successful so far. We've got the classic cast, incredible combos, combo breakers, an awesome soundtrack and we even brought back the original announcer from the previous games. However, while the visual style and other aesthetics were very much associated with that time, fighting game mechanics have come a long way in the intervening years. We also knew it was really important to update Killer Instinct as a modern fighting game for a next gen console. We updated the visuals and style and expanded upon the unique combat system. In addition to combo breakers, we've added counter breakers, which break combo breakers, shadow counters, combo lockouts and more. A host of new features and systems that not only make it a singular fighting game experience, but also really hype and exciting one. Are there any new characters you can talk about? TR: We've been steadily announcing characters since our E3 announcement. The latest two are Sadira and the classic character, Orchid. Sadira is a whole new addition to the Killer Instinct franchise. We thought it was really important if we were going to create a new game that we expand the Killer Instinct universe and add a new character in our initial release. We worked really hard to make sure she fit thematically within KI, but also that she offered something new in terms of gameplay that was different from any characters in our opening roster, and also different from any other KI character in the original titles as well. Thematically we definitely think Sadira fits within the Killer Instinct universe. She's got a very cool spider motif and abilities. This is reflected in her arena as well, with the spiders, webs, captured items and other elements. We'll be revealing more about her story later, but she's the leader of a clan of assassins and they're targeting other Killer Instinct characters. This will tie into the overall story in a cool way. Ambitious: Microsoft hopes that KI's matchmaking will be super-fast and as seamless as possible . In terms of gameplay she's unique in that she has great control of space, high mobility and really excels in the air combat. She has a double jump, which she can use to modulate her attack and defense, air daggers with special properties and a fast wall bound that she can use to confuse and set up cool attack patterns. She's unique in the roster in terms of these kinds of abilities and she's tons of fun to play. As for Orchid we'll be revealing more info about her soon. We were super excited to announce such an iconic character and can't wait to show more. Will there be any extra downloadable content aside from the characters themselves? TR: Yes definitely! And that's a big part of how we're launching the game and updating it. In addition to characters players can also download alternate costumes for each character and accessories for each character's base costume and their alternate costumes. The cool thing about the accessories is that they're freely interchangeable with each other, so you can mix and match to create unique looks for characters. In addition to these types of downloadable content we will also be updating the game and releasing new features for the game post launch. We're envisioning the Killer Instinct as more like a service where we want to continually update the game and engage with the community to help guide what those updates will be. We want to keep releasing content as long as players keep playing. How has development benefited from being an Xbox One title? Was there ever consideration to make this a 360 title? TR: Xbox One has several new features that enhance the experience for games on the console in really compelling ways. Outside of enhanced next gen graphics, in Killer Instinct we're using the Xbox One's capabilities for enhanced matchmaking. Our goal is to make matchmaking as fast, seamless and ubiquitous as possible. We want players to be able to find matches throughout the experience in the game, not just when they're in online mode. When a match is found we want players to be able to jump into the match from wherever they are, whether they're in practice mode, training mode or any single player mode. We also want players to be able to search for matches even during an active multiplayer match. Where ever you are we want you to be able to get some online competition going. Worth the wait: but sadly PS4 owners and those opting to stay with current gen won't be able to play it . Another very cool feature unique to Xbox One is how it can map controllers and settings to individual players. It will remember the controller button mapping and settings for an individual as soon as they pick up the controller. For a fighting game this is really cool. You often have several friends over playing at the same time and swapping controllers back and forth. Automatically switching button mapping when a new player picks up the controller makes the hot swap way faster and seamless. This is great for any game, but especially a fighting game where players have their favourite button settings. In terms of the target console, Killer Instinct is definitely an Xbox One title. We have no plans for other versions to announce. Follow us on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games. .","Next-generation graphics and upgraded combat system .

"What better way to kick off the next generation of videogames than with one of gaming’s best-loved characters. British developers System 3 have announced that Putty Squad is making a return on all major consoles – and will be a launch title for the PlayStation 4. Great fun: it may not boast eye-popping visuals, but Putty Squad oozes character . Regarded by many as one of the best games of its time, you play an unlikely hero called Putty – out to rescue his kidnapped friends. Thankfully, Putty has a variety of abilities to help him along the way.  He can stretch to reach items and drop to areas below him. He can also lie flat to avoid enemies and absorb items that can be used at a later date. Then there's the attack move, where Putty makes a fist to bash enemies, and if it all gets too much, he can inflate and soar to previously out-of-reach areas. Gameplay is incredibly addictive and takes you back to the golden age of gaming. It's a welcome change from the Call Of Dutys and Grand Theft Autos - oozing character, and boasting a charm seldom found in contemporary video games. Even the menu screens bring a smile to your face. Whether it's watching a band of enemies play music, or traversing the Mario Galaxy-style level map, every inch of Putty Squad has been given the love and attention that made the original such a success. It’s helped by some vibrant visuals, too. Although its side-scrolling nature puts a limit on all-out graphical quality – it’s still incredibly pleasing on the eye. Environments are varied enough to stave off monotony – ranging from Egyptian-esque tombs to scary laboratories. Best of British: Renowned developers System 3 are behind the game - one of Britain's last great developers . The game will also feature on mobile devices. Although many details are being kept under wraps for the iPhone and iPad versions - users will be able to tap to move Putty to a desired location and also to absorb items. PlayStation 3 and next-gen offerings will feature crisp 1080p visuals. All in all, it’s set to make a wonderful trip down memory lane. For more information see: www.system3.com . Agree with Talal?

"For many of us, playing the air guitar is the closest you'll get to strumming your favourite tunes. But now, thanks to a new videogame called Rocksmith, even the most musically challenged can learn how to play... and it only takes a few sessions. The software, now in its second year, is developed for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. It works by allowing users to plug their electric guitar into their consoles via a 'Hercules' adapter - a USB cable that connects the guitar's output jack. Acoustic guitars can also be used, but may require additional hardware. Scroll down for video . Strum's the word: The game, now in its second year, has proven a hit with audiences worldwide . The game monitors how you play, dynamically adjusting the skill levels to suit your level of expertise. Over time, more notes and phrases are introduced before you're playing your favourite songs note for note. On screen there is a virtual fretboard with coloured notes housed in coloured lanes that indicate what you should play on the guitar. To help track your progress, difficulty, previous scores and lyrics are all shown at the top of the screen. And it's proving to be a successful method, with a Toluna Consumer Survey finding that 95 per cent of players improved at playing the guitar. Similarly, Research Strategy group Inc claimed that 'it was the fastest way to learn guitar'. A growing number of players, too, are turning to YouTube to show off their achievements - with some videos scoring hundreds of thousands of hits. The idea comes from the 2008 game, Guitar Rising - developed by small start-up business, Game Tank. Rising was more technology demo than game proper, showing off the ability to link a guitar to a console via a USB cable. But is it any good? Expansive DLC Founder, Ray Wilmott, gives us his verdict . Rocksmith 2014 is all a sequel should be. It takes the core foundations set out in the original game and expands on them in every conceivable way. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine how much more Ubisoft could add in further instalments. This is the total package. Rocksmith 2014 wants you to bring real, compatible guitars, plug them into your console and start strumming away to the songs you’ve always dreamed of playing. Whether it’s ‘Everlong’ by the Foo Fighters, ‘Every Breath You Take’ by The Police or ‘Pour Some Sugar On Me’ by Def Leopard, the game offers incredible diversity with its 55 song tracklist. Inventive: it's not just boring music lessons - there are games, too, to make things more exciting . Each song is broken down to its most basic form, providing just the key notes that make up the tune, but as you start to get more comfortable playing, Rocksmith throws in extra chords. Before long, you’re playing the song in full, trying to master it to 100 per cent. Each time you play a song, the game is observing and will make recommendations for how you can improve. Sometimes it suggests slowing down a section of the song to practice a set of chords, or it might refer you to the Guitarcade. However, if the game can’t offer you further input with the current set of notes, it asks you to reach a certain standard before it will give additional advice. To accompany this, the game offers a series of video tutorials, some of them asking you to provide an interactive demonstration of what you’ve learned. However, while many lessons are easily played through, several are extremely persistent and demanding. Even if you’re doing exactly what’s shown on screen, certain lessons expect you to play in a particular way or you won’t be able to progress. Steady does it: the learning curve adjusts with your ability and is suitable for nearly all ages . Still, unlike a grouchy, over 50’s failed rockstar-turned-teacher, the game doesn’t give off a patronising tone or irritable vibe while you’re trying to learn. Rocksmith 2014’s education style is calm, easy to get to grips with, encourages engagement and even comments on where you’re going wrong. And while the game certainly makes you sound better than you actually are, the satisfaction of being able to hear familiar traits from a song coming from your own play cannot be described in words. While you’re not going to come away from Rocksmith the next Brian May, the game can take a complete novice and turn them into a confident, competent player. Then, once you’ve got down the basics, there’s still this excellent platform available for you to learn the greatest rock songs of all time. What might surprise you, however, is the best way to get used to your shiny new six-string is by tackling the Guitarcade. Through a series of 8-bit Arcade Games, you can become even more familiar with the different guitar techniques while improving reaction times. Ninja Slide N sees you controlling a ninja by sliding up and down frets. The aim is to swiftly move between towers before being engulfed by a screen-sized, live, electric fence. Clever: although games such as Guitar Hero have been around for a while, Rocksmith actually teaches you to play - rather than just hammer buttons to correspond to on-screen button prompts . Ducks ReDux has you shooting at ducks by playing different chords. In contrast, Gone Wailin’ is a high score bonanza that puts you in control of a man tied to balloons. Collect coins in the sky by ascending (making lots of noise on the Guitar) or descending (playing softly). Before you realise it, a huge chunk of your Rocksmith 2014 gametime will be soaked up by Guitarcade; maybe even more than you spend playing actual songs. The good news is that these games can be more beneficial than the lessons in teaching you how to become comfortable with a guitar. After a few hours, my overall competency definitely improved. Rocksmith 2014 is an astonishing piece of software. So many critics claim games are only capable of violence and encourage acts of ill-will, but this educational tool proves that gamers are capable of harnessing hidden talents and converting them into a universally desirable skill. Rocksmith 2014 is the most fun you’ll ever have learning. Four and a half stars out of five.

"Three furry critters with a voracious sexual appetite have been discovered in Queenland.

Australian scientists discovered the new species, which are about the same size as a mouse and enjoys - or endures - a mating season that lasts for several weeks.

'It’s a very exciting time to be a mammalogist,' said Andrew Baker, head of the Queensland University of Technology team who made the discoveries.'Typically there’s only a couple of new species of mammals found worldwide each year. So to find three new species of this marsupial, all in South-East Queensland is really exciting,' he told The Guardian. One of the creatures, named the black-tailed antechinus, has been found in the high-altitude, wet areas of far southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales. Scientists from the University of Queensland explained about the die-off of Antechinus when the species was discovered last year. It is presumed that the new black-tailed species behaves in a similar way. Researchers had imaged that the males were altruistic and died so that there was more food for their offspring, but biologist Diana Fisher showed the animals were over-doing it to promote their own genes over their competitors’. They try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down. Researchers found the huge rush of stress hormones, which have enabled the animals to keep at it over a mating period of a few weeks, also causes their body tissues to ‘disintegrate’. Their fur falls out, they stagger around, bleed internally and sometimes get painful gangrene infections as their immune system stops working - before dying. Caribbean reef squid, Pacific salmon and plenty of arachnids also engage in semelparous, or 'big-bang reproduction'. But it is rare for mammals to employ such desperate mating tactics. It is identifiable by a very shaggy, hairy coat with long guard hairs and an orangey-brown coloured rump, which ends with a black tail. But its incredible sexual appetite and strenuous mating sessions are arguably its most noteworthy feature. Sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time, with both the males and females romping from mate to mate. ‘It's frenetic, there's no courtship, the males will just grab the females and both will mate promiscuously,’ Dr Baker told Reuters. The mating season lasts for several weeks and the males will typically die from their exertions. Excessive stress hormones in the males that build up during the mating season degrade their body tissue, leading to death, whereas females have the ability to block the production of the hormone, according to the study, which was published in the journal Zootaxa. Scientists discovered the carnivorous antechinus last year, which is closely related to the newly discovered black-tailed antechinus and also dies from its stressful and marathon mating sessions. Dr Baker told ABC News that the black-tailed antechinus’ sex sessions ‘probably follow the typical pattern of antechinus, which is all males are dead before they turn one year old’. The creatures typically have their frenzied mating period when they are around 11 months old and ‘all males will die before the young are born,’ he said. The male Antechinus, which was discovered last year, die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time. They try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down . The black-tailed antechinus was found at the highest peak of the World-Heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests, in Springbrook National Park in Queensland, about 560 miles (900 km) north east of Sydney, but the researchers are unsure how many of the species exist. Dr Baker said: 'It’s been trapped there, at the very highest point of the rainforest at 1,000 metres, where you get fog dripping onto the plants. With its big shaggy coat, it probably likes the coldest and wettest environment possible. The rainforest habitat in which the strange animals live is dwindling and 'the animals who can’t fly or move very far become trapped and they become very different because they can no longer interbreed,' he added. Dr Baker ad his team have applied for the black-tailed antechinus to be listed as an endangered species.","The black-tailed antechinus has been found in the high-altitude, wet areas of far southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales .

"Tragic: Amanda Todd, 15, from Vancouver, was found hanged at her home on October 10 . A man who has become embroiled in the case of bullied Canadian teen Amanda Todd said in court that he was not responsible for her suicide - but said he knows the hacker who is. Fifteen-year-old Todd, from Vancouver was . found hanged in her home on October 10 - just weeks after she uploaded a . video to YouTube detailing her horrific treatment at the hands of cyber . bullies. When she was just 12, a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts, and a year later, he plastered a picture of the incident across Facebook. In a vigilante move, Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group, named the man allegedly responsible for the picture. The group claimed that he was a 32-year-old from British Columbia. MailOnline chose not to name him because of legal reasons. But a man replying to an Anonymous email said he was not the harasser and a man at the address posted by Anonymous said he was unaware of the claims. Local police appeared to support the man's story saying that claims about his involvement were 'unfounded'. Yet another man, 19, with a similar name has an outstanding file in Surrey Provincial Court, The Globe and Mail reported, and was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference of a person under 16 in a separate case. Outside court on Monday, he told CTV News that he did know Amanda Todd but that he was her friend; the online connections between them came after he had offered his help to find her tormentor. Scroll down for videos . Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying was a 32-year-old from British Columbia . He admitted that he had been in contact with Miss Todd online after he saw YouTube videos of her singing. The man said he was not her tormentor but instead she asked him to help her because he was a 'known hacker', according to the  Vancouver Sun. Miss . Todd's supporters have set up Facebook pages warning the man to 'sleep . with one eye open', the move by Anonymous sparks concerns over its . abilities to create a 'trial by internet' - bypassing the justice system . and casting guilt. In a video posted to YouTube by . Anonymous earlier this week, a figure claimed the group had tracked down the man and listed his personal information, . including his date of birth and address. It . explained that his username appears on websites where he 'blackmailed' and gave advice to young girls. The same username is also tied to a . website with a 'jailbait' photo gallery. '[He] is an abomination to our society, and will be punished,' the Anonymous figure says. Referring to the possibility they . might have the wrong man, they add: 'At the most this is the person who . did this to Amanda Todd, and at the least it's another pedophile that . enjoys taking advantage of children.' Haunting: Amanda posted a nine-minute video explaining her longstanding bullying on a series of notecards . Depressing: The story reveals that she previously tried to kill herself twice and is receiving help . Following . Anonymous' announcement, the web moved swiftly, with groups calling for . his death and warning him to 'sleep with one eye open' cropping up on Facebook. Police attended the address on Monday . after a neighbour, Chyne Simpson, said Anonymous named the wrong . address. He said he felt threatened by internet users and asked them to . stay away. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had . refused to confirm Anonymous have the right man but a spokesperson said they were . aware that someone had been named. 'We are aware of what’s being posted . online and certainly following up what we feel is important to follow . up,' Sergeant Peter Thiessen told The Globe and Mail, adding: '[Vigilantes] run the risk of . committing a criminal offence.' Todd's family members also said they . are not sure the Anonymous report is accurate and said police . have tracked down a person living in the U.S. whom they . believed was involved. The claims come weeks after Amanda posted a nearly nine-minute YouTube video detailing her . treatment on a stack of notecards held up to the camera, . Final message: The video was posted just over a month before she was found dead on Wednesday . Todd says that a . year after she flashed her breasts, the man tracked her down and demanded he put on a show for . him or he would expose her. When she refused, he created a Facebook . page with a list of her friends and used her naked chest as the profile . photo. The picture quickly spread across the internet and among her . classmates. It led to . relentless bullying online, she said, and she was diagnosed with . depression and started drinking. In the video, posted September 7, she admitted that she had previously tried to kill herself twice and has been hospitalised. After . moving to a different city and school, another instance of bullying . occurred after she started a romantic relationship with an older man who . had a girlfriend. Once that relationship soured, she was confronted and beaten up by the man's girlfriend. She was hit in front of a crowd of screaming people who encouraged her to be left in a ditch. Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday . Trouble: It came after she flashed on a webcam and the image of her topless was posted to Facebook . Amanda . does not speak in the video, and her face is not fully shown, but she . confirmed her identity with the last notecard which says her name. One of the final images is a jarring picture of her arm which had been cut repeatedly. Just under six weeks after posting the video, Todd could take the . bullying no longer, and took her own life. During a memorial for Todd on Monday, her friends said they have been aware of a man in his 30s 'stalking' their friend for years. 'There were multiple accounts with random names,' one friend told QMI Agency. 'There were Twitter accounts also used.' The Vancouver Sun reported that Amanda was a student in Grade 10 at the Coquitlam Basic Alternative Education school. Shock: Friends gather at a memorial honoring Todd in Maple Ridge, British Columbia earlier this week . Loss: Flowers and candles are left at the memorial, five days after Todd killed herself to escape the bullies . The principal of the school confirmed . her death and said that she had become connected with many since she . transferred to the school in the middle of last year. 'It is a very sad case,' Paul . McNaughton told the paper. 'I can tell you we feel we tried everything . we could to help her when she came to us.' Her death prompted a local politician to release a video of her own that pleads to put an end to bullying. 'I just heard about Amanda. I want to say to everyone who loved her, to all her family and friends, how sorry I am about her loss,' British Columbia premier Christy Clark said. 'No one deserves to be bullied. No one earns it. No one asks for it. It isn't a rite of passage. Bullying has to stop.' Anonymous is an umbrella term for an internet subculture – a collection of individuals, . or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom . of speech on the internet. While Anonymous is focused on freedom of speech, releasing names of internet harassers is new territory for the group, which is best known for hacking government and company websites. They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers. The group has connections with the lesser-known hacking group LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, an elite hacker group that has claimed responsibility for high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks. Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was still living and in New Zealand. The group aims to cause mayhem and manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. It is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies. It hit the headlines in March this year after Hector Xavier Monsegur, one of the group's ringleaders and an influential member of Anonymous, turned fellow hackers over to authorities. After his arrest in New York on hacking charges in June 2011, the 28-year-old reportedly began working with the FBI to bring down the groups' top members, and five were later arrested.

"Well, this is a far cry from the tawdry scenes we're used to seeing in porn films. In fact, without closer inspection you’d be forgiven for thinking that this incredible new video was just a nature documentary. In fact it's pornography filmed with a flying drone. As the camera pans out over rolling mountains and secluded seascapes you could blink and miss the couples who feature in the film, engaging in sexual acts in the most picturesque and remote of landscapes. Scroll down for video . Pornography filmed with a flying drone is being billed as female friendly porn . But having sex they are. Filmed in San Francisco and with locations spanning from a luscious green corn field to some deserted steps this is a style of pornography the likes of which we have never seen before. Fans claim that it is much more subtle in its nature and therefore far more female friendly. Brandon LaGanke, a filmmaker from Brooklyn and one of the people behind the video told Vice of his creation, ‘We wanted to explore the whole idea of drone privacy and strikes—this idea of 'make porn, not war. 'It started as a kind of funny commentary on privacy and voyeurism, but it quickly became a conceptual grounding.’ In two scenes from the film a lesbian couple enjoy themselves on top of a roof (left), whilst an amorous pair make a pit stop at the side of the road for some fun . Whilst the film is pornography it also captures a series of beautiful nature shoots, for example the forest covered mountains in San Fran . An example of the type of drone camera that Ghost+Cow would have used to film their 'Drone Boning' video. You can clearly see the camera attached to the front of the device . Brandon LaGanke and John Carlucci aka Ghost+Cow are the men behind 'Drone Boning' The film captures a variety of straight, gay and lesbian couples having sex. Brandon’s film-making partner John Carlucci said, ‘We wanted to see the artistic value of this perspective. 'It's an omniscient point of view, really. 'We did these shots in places where you couldn't see much from the ground, but then you put a drone in the air and you can see what's happening.’ The result is quite stunning, although the filmmakers ran into trouble when they were spotted by a woman who was walking her dog on the beach where they were filming. Brandon and John own a film company named Ghost+Cow and this is the first time either of the men have embarked on a project like this. Drones are essentially flying cameras. They are operated from the ground via remote control and are fitted with high quality lens to capture the views below. Buying a drone can set you back anything from £300 to £1500 and they are especially popular with those wishing to make nature films. Recently popular American band OK Go filmed their I Won't Let You down video using a drone, according to reports the band wanted to make something that was unconventional. In the film below a best man has persuaded the bride and groom at a wedding to have their wedding rings delivered by drone. It's a risky business! After meeting whilst working at a global advertising agency in New York the pair have worked largely on music projects including videos for several underground acts including Zebra Katz. Filming with a drone has become increasingly popular over the last few years, although not always for making porn films. The BBC even has its own in house drone team who work specifically on documentaries filmed with the flying cameras.

"Zafar Rushdie, 35, was more than twice the legal limit when he was discovered unconscious by officers in his car just yards from his flat. Salman Rushdie’s son has been convicted of drink-driving after police found him asleep at the wheel of his BMW at traffic lights. Zafar Rushdie, 35, was more than twice the legal limit when he was discovered unconscious by officers in his car just yards from his flat. The celebrity publicist, who announced his engagement to classical singer Natalie Coyle this summer, was suffering from ‘personal relation issues’ at the time, a court heard. Rushdie’s lawyer pleaded for leniency on the grounds that the conviction could affect his ability to visit the United States, where he was planning to marry his fiancée next year. Magistrates banned him from driving for 17 months as well as fining him £720 and ordering him to take a drink-driving course. The eldest child of the Booker Prize-winning author, Rushdie trades on his famous surname through his PR agency Rushdie Media. As a young boy he lived for 11 years under the shadow of the fatwah placed on his father’s head after the outcry in the Islamic world over his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. Rushdie was arrested on August 1 after police found his car stopped at traffic lights in upmarket Hampstead, north London. The officers became suspicious when the lights turned green twice and the vehicle made no attempt to move off and so knocked on the window, Highbury Corner Magistrate’s Court in London heard. Prosecutor Emily Maunders said: ‘They could see the defendant, he was described as either being asleep or having a medical episode. They banged on the window and there was no response. ‘They continued on four or five occasions to bang on the window. He then appeared to wake, and he appeared confused and under the influence.’ Rushdie was arrested and given a test, which found he had 182mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80mg. The Exeter University graduate, who pleaded guilty to drink driving, was caught just 100 yards from his front door in Hampstead, where he shares a garden flat with Coyle, 28, the court heard. His lawyer, Mark Haslam, who has previously represented Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and various sporting stars for driving offences, said Rushdie found his time in police custody a ‘salutary experience’. But he added: ‘The defendant does not accept that he was deeply asleep. The brake lights were on, he was in control of the vehicle. The officers exaggerated things. He clearly was distracted. In this case this is genuinely a person who has acted in a way that is out of character.’ He is the eldest child of the Booker Prize-winning author Salman Rushdie. He lived for 11 years under the shadow of the fatwah placed on his father’s head after the outcry over his novel The Satanic Verses . Rushdie was arrested two days before he was due to take part in the London Triathlon, as part of a year-long fundraising campaign to run 15 half-marathons and triathlons in support of children’s charity Kids Company. Mr Haslam said: ‘He works in public relations and he had personal relation issues of his own which were troubling him. He is a regular raiser of money for charity. He had been working very hard. He was tired. ‘He took a decision to drive back from work at Portland Place to stop with some friends and have a drink. That was a flawed decision in itself. It was not a sensible decision. ‘It was compounded by a further decision to drive the familiar mile home. It is perfectly clear that he was at least distracted by these issues.’ Appealing for a lenient sentence, the lawyer added: ‘There is a personal issue - travel to the US would be a trouble. He spends his time raising money for various charities and the way he raises that money is not the easiest way. ‘I ask you to take that into account. If anyone needed his previous good character to come to their rescue it is this defendant.’ But chairman of the bench Mark Beattie said the court had no discretion and had to disqualify Rushdie from driving. He said the ban would be reduced by 17 weeks if he successfully completed a drink driving course.","Zafar Rushdie, 35, was more than twice the legal limit when he was found .

Judge Rowlands added: 'The two of you took advantage of the victim on two occasions.' The prosecution had alleged that the couple liked to involve others in their sex lives. Ford was alleged to have encouraged other men to have sex with his partner who he met when she was 18. They denied being 'swingers.' Mason, left, a former chip shop worker, has been jailed for three years while Ford, right, will spend four-and-a-half years behind bars . Ford had pleaded not guilty to inciting sexual activity and she denied sexual activity with a child. But the judge, who described their behaviour as 'totally perverted', told them : 'A jury saw through your lies.' He also criticised Mason for becoming pregnant again with the case hanging over her, saying: 'Your behaviour in seeking to expand your family shows at best precious little judgement on your part.' Prosecuting counsel Myles Wilson outlined statements from the victim in which he stated he felt 'horrible' when he thought about what happened. It was his first sexual experience and 'something he will never forget.' Mr Wilson said the teen had been worried that he could be the father of one of Mason's two children. 'He's struggling to come to terms with it,' the barrister said. Andrew Green, barrister for Ford, said he had been trying to run a taxi business. Simon Rogers, defending Mason, said she was of previous good character and due to give birth in February. Mr Rogers said: 'An immediate custodial sentence of any length is going to have a profound effect upon her and her life.' The couple, both from Holyhead, must now register as sex offenders indefinitely and a sex offences prevention order was made.","Nicola Mason had sex with boy while partner John Ford watched, court told .

"Extraordinary claims: Labour MP Tom Watson, pictured, said he was told that the journalist was mistakenly copied in on top Tories' emails . Top Tories swapped emails discussing how to smear Labour MPs with paedophile allegations, it was claimed yesterday. A series of the messages between staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters were allegedly sent to a national newspaper journalist by accident. Labour MP Tom Watson made the extraordinary claim in an online blog. He said he was told that the journalist was mistakenly copied in on emails in which Tory officials speculated about which Labour MPs were paedophiles. The MP claimed the alleged messages meant that senior Conservative officers were either withholding ‘vital intelligence’ from the police or engaging in a ‘smear campaign’ against their opponents. Mr Watson, former Labour Party deputy chairman and general election co-ordinator, wrote to David Cameron about the alleged emails last month. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps replied to Mr Watson saying he had looked into the claims and found no evidence to back them up. Separately, a senior executive at the newspaper told Mr Watson the emails in fact related to well-established links between senior Labour politicians and notorious campaign group, the Paedophile Information Exchange. A Tory Party spokesman said last night that Mr Watson’s allegations were ‘completely false and without foundation’. Mr Watson wrote to David Cameron (right) about the alleged emails last month.

"A 19th-century steamer that was once used to smuggle weapons, transport cash and could still be filled with gold has been found off the coast of South Carolina. The SS Ozama was discovered beneath 40 feet of water off Cape Romain, around 30 miles northeast of Charleston, researcher Dr. E. Lee Spence revealed on Monday. Dr Spence first discovered the 1028-ton, 126-foot ship in  1979 while carrying out a magnetometer survey, but only positively identified it this year while carrying out research on other ships. The researcher and treasure hunter, who is officially recognized as its 'true and exclusive owner', is now hopeful that it will still contain stashes of gold after its history as a smuggling ship. Exciting discovery: Dr. E. Lee Spence holds artifacts found aboard the sunken SS Ozama in South Carolina . The vessel, originally named the Craigallion,  was made in Scotland in 1881 and in 1884, it towed a dredge used in the construction of the Panama Canal from New York to Central America. But the following year, it wrecked in the Bahamas and when it was salvaged and rebuilt, it was renamed the Ozama after a river in the Dominican Republic, where it often traveled. Dr Spence told Discovery News that the vessel was used for 'extensive gun and money smuggling to Haiti'. It was also used to carry money, including $300,000 in paper money to Haiti which was being used to replace a previous form of cash. Top team: He is pictured with dive team leader Rick Reely as they hold in tact plates found on the ship . Discovery: A sidescan sonar image shows the wreckage of the SS Ozama beneath the water . The vessel, originally named the Craigallion, . was made in Leith, Scotland in 1881 and, in 1884, it towed a dredge (the Nathan Appleton) used in the . construction of the Panama Canal from New York to Central America. But the following year, it wrecked in . the Bahamas after drifting on to the reefs. The ship was salvaged by an American steamer and towed to Norfolk. It was renamed the . Ozama after a river in the Dominican Republic, where it often traveled. Discovery News reported that the vessel was used for 'extensive gun and money smuggling to Haiti'. Newspaper articles from the time said that gunpowder guns, rifles and boxes of ammunition were seen on the docks. It was also used to carry money, . including $300,000 in paper money to Haiti which was being used to . replace a previous form of cash. In November 1894, it hit the shoals . of Cape Romain while traveling from Philadelphia to Charleston and . suffered a hole in the engine room compartment. The water filled the fire rooms, destroying the engines, and the vessel sank. The crew escaped on boats to the shore. When the ship headed on her last trip in . 1894, Haiti's president was believed to be near death, and the vessel . would have carried guns or funds for supporting his regime or for . fighting it, Discovery News reported.

The water filled the fire rooms, destroying the engines, and the vessel sank. The crew escaped on boats to the shore. 'We don't know that anyone searched for her,' Dr Spence said. 'Newspaper accounts said she was traveling in ballast, without cargo. This would have discouraged any attempts at salvage... 'Ships reporting themselves as traveling . in ballast, often carried money and even other cargo. When you are . smuggling, the smuggled cargo often isn't listed or is intentionally . miss-listed.' He positively identified the ship by its engine, size, type of decking and where it was found. He said that he is hopeful that whatever is on board the steamer is salvageable as the steamer is 'in surprisingly good condition with most of the ship relatively intact and sitting upright'. Found: The SS Ozama, a 19th-century steamer, has been found 40 feet beneath the water in Cape Romain and remains largely in tact. Researchers believe there could be gold on the ship . Hunt: The team will now fully map the vessel underwater to see how stable it is before digging into it . 'Whatever is still there, we have good . reason to believe at least some of it will be intact, as I have already . brought up some unbroken china,' Spence said. 'As you might guess, I am hoping to find gold, and gold should not only be intact, it should still be shiny.' Spence and his team, whose work is being funded . by United Gold Explorations Ltd., will map the wreck and try to determine how structurally sound it is before starting to retrieve it.

"She’s the business mogul who transformed Jimmy Choo from a cobbler in Hackney to a multimillion pound global brand adored by A-List celebrities. You’re no one unless you’ve a pair of ‘Choos,’ and the shoe empire would be nothing without Tamara Mellon. But with the designer name behind her and an own-brand collection going strong, Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12. Like mother, like daughter: Tamara Mellon, right, and Araminta Mellon, left, at a film premiere in June. Mellon says her daughter loves fashion and has great style . Businesswoman: Tamara Mellon pictured in London last year. The British-born designer and mogul is credited for making Jimmy Choo a household name and multimillion pound brand . Mellon, 46, who was awarded an OBE in 2010 for her services to the fashion industry, has been open about her very public battles with her mother (the two are still not on speaking terms) and her acrimonious spilt from Jimmy Choo - the brand she built with the designer – in 2007. In her memoir, In Her Shoes, published last September, Mellon said of her daughter, known as Minty; ‘I was in a very dark and dangerous place and I’m sure the only thing that saved me was Minty.’ And now, as the book is re-released in a paperback version, Mellon reveals the business and life lessons she will pass onto to her daughter. And despite not even reaching her teenage years yet, Araminta is wasting no time learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother’s own fabulous footsteps. ‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline. ‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’ Mellon . lives with her daughter in New York, where her business, Tamara Mellon, . is based – ‘a gorgeous little office on Madison Avenue next to . Barneys,’ Mellon gushes about her workspace. In her shoes: Mellon, pictured, says her daughter Araminta sits in on all her meetings. 'She's learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it,' she says . Fancy footwear: Jimmy Choo shoes, the brand that Tamara Mellon built from little and is most known for . Motherly love: Tamara Mellon with her young daughter Araminta at film premieres in 2004, L,  and 2005 . Born . in London in 1967, Tamara was raised between England and California, . attending two British boarding schools and a finishing school in . Switzerland. Travelling in the world is as much in her blood as fashion. She . continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, . together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings. ‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’ Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like. 'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it! Memoir: In My Shoes by Tamara Mellon is released in paperback on Thursday . ‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’ Mellon became Accessories Editor at British Vogue in her early 20s before decamping to set up the Jimmy Choo label. By the late Nineties, it had become stratospheric; Kate Winslet, Uma Thruman, Julianne Moore and Jennifer Lopez were just a handful of the early A-List supporters. It became a . household name after Carrie Bradshaw wore the shoes in Sex And The . City, and over the course of the series, the brand was mentioned 34 . times. By . the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3m a . year. There was a London boutique and the brand was represented at 450 . more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges. The . relationship between Mellon and Choo, however, was strained - and got worse over the years. Once the . business had been sold off to various equity companies, Tamara found the brand she grew from little, was being stretched and moulded into one . she couldn’t recognise. 'My huge regret was knowing that all the women at Jimmy Choo were underpaid. And not fighting more for that. ‘That’s when my involvement in Jimmy Choo started to dissolve, as it was turning into something I didn’t want it to be. I didn’t like the direction it was going in. It was difficult.’ Going out on her own, after finally leaving Jimmy Choo for good in 2011, was one of the hardest, bravest and most rewarding things Mellon says she has ever done. ‘I had the . decision: Do I leave now and start again and risk it, or stay, make a . ton more money and be very safe but not be doing the work I am proud of . and see my management team treated unfairly?' she says. ‘I just couldn’t do that. It’s about the people and team, not just making money. ‘That . ethos developed over time, certainly when I had my daughter and as I was . growing the business and dealing with financial difficulties and private . equity people. ‘I wanted to motivate and empower women as I went on. I wanted to create a different culture and build a business that really . supports women and I want Minty to go into a work environment like that . one day, whatever she decides to do.' Whilst Tamara Mellon is still in its 'early stages,' says Mellon, she has big plans. She says: 'My team have to hold the reigns on me! I have . visions for fragrance and makeup and homewear and swimwear and have . moodboards on every product category you can imagine. 'We’re still . building the core business but when I feel that it’s ready I can’t wait . to expand.' She adds: ‘When I left Jimmy Choo, I thought it would be very distressing and I’d morn it for a long time. ‘But once my focus was on creating something else, it’s amazing how quickly we move on – so much faster than I thought I would. ‘Jimmy Choo is another life it feels so distant. New focus, and once I’m focused on creating something else, if I’m creating a product then I’m really happy.

"Her nasty treatment, her explosive temper and her imperious attitude toward those assigned to her detail have earned former first lady Hillary Clinton the title of the most detested person under the protection of the Secret Service. And as a result, agents are all too happy to keep Hillary in the dark about Bill’s buxom blonde love and her secret visits to their Chappaqua home,  according to Ron Kessler in his explosive forthcoming book The First Family Detail, published by Crown Forum. ‘Agents say being on Hillary Clinton’s detail is the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service. Being assigned to her detail is a form of punishment.' Scroll down for video . Protect me not: If agents driving her went over a bump, she'd swear at them. She has a dual personality that changes when she¿s not making a public appearance, says author Kessler . And her nasty attitude goes all the way back to early days at the White House when Hillary and President Bill Clinton stepped out of Marine One . helicopter and crossed the lawn holding hands. But that was all for show. Once they were out of the public eye, it was a scream fest between the couple. In response to a cheerful ‘Good morning, ma’am’, by a former uniformed officer, Hillary’s response to him was ‘Fuck off’. ‘Hillary was so mistrustful and vengeful,’ a former agent told Kessler. ‘We . were basically told, the Clintons don’t want to see you, they don’t . want to hear you, get of the way’, according to a former Secret Service . agent. Hush hush: When the cat's away, Bill Clinton will play. Kessler says Clinton's mistress comes calling when Hillary leaves their Chappaqua home and the Secret Service agents keep Bill's secrets . That means hiding behind drapes – anything not to be seen – and . she was not to be spoken to as well when moving from one location to . another in the White House, according to former FBI agent Coy Copeland. She . jumped all over agents working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s . investigation of the couple’s involvement in the Whitewater real estate . development deal. And then . she attacked one agent personally and suggested his suit looked 'cheap.' Kessler maintains her mean spirited nature didn't end with agents. White . House deputy counsel Vince Foster, who committed suicide in June 1993,  was on the receiving end of a virulent verbal attack by Hillary.  She disagreed with a legal opinion . he made and humiliated him in a meeting, stating he would never be more . than a hick-town lawyer and wasn’t ready for the big time. ‘The . put-down that she gave him in that big meeting just pushed him over the . edge’, Copeland says. She blamed Foster for all of the Clinton's . problems and stated he had failed the couple. Right hand woman: Huma Abedin, married to disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner, was Hillary's close confidante. She was as rude as Hillary, says the author . Foster . was just one of many Hillary verbally attacked. She didn’t like law . enforcement officers or the military, former Secret Service agent Lloyd . Bulman stated. ‘She was just really rude to almost everybody. She’d act . like she didn’t want you around, like you were beneath her.' She went . years without speaking to some agents. While . publicly courting law enforcement organizations, privately she felt . disdain. She wanted state troopers and local police to wear suits and . drive unmarked cars. No military aides could wear their uniforms in the . White House.If agents . driving her went over a bump, she’d swear at them. Glad-handing on the road on her Senatorial campaign, when they arrived at a 4-F Club in the land of dairy cows in upstate New York, she saw cows and people in jeans. That enraged her and she asked a staffer, 'What the f*** did we come her for? There's no money here'. She has a dual . personality that changes when she’s not making a public appearance. Queen of mean: Kessler claims that White House deputy counsel Vince Foster committed suicide in June 1993 after a virulent verbal attack by Hillary.  She disagreed with a legal opinion he made and humiliated him in a meeting stating he would never be more than a hick-town lawyer and wasn¿t ready for the big time . Running . for Senate and on the campaign tour, she was appalled when they arrived . at locations where the populace was poor. ‘What the fuck did we come . her for’? she stated. While . Chelsea comes off as an angel, very cordial and sweet, Huma Abedin, . Hillary’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department and traveling . chief of staff during her campaign for the presidency, is considered as . vile and rude as Hillary. ‘Huma . looked down on the agents and treated them as second-class citizens’, a . former agent stated. If she wasn’t recognized, she would say, ‘Do you . know who I am’? In response to her rudeness, they let her carry her own . luggage – and the first lady’s luggage as well. ‘She’d have four bags, . and we’d stand there and watch her and say, ‘Oh, can we hold the door . for you’? When Hillary is out of their Chappaqua, New York home, writes Kessler, Bill’s lover makes secret visits to some thirty-five miles north of New York City. Dubbed 'Energizer' by the Secret Service on duty, the mistress has shown up within minutes after Hillary's departure. Someone made a phone call that Evergreen, Hillary’s code name, was now out and the coast was clear for Bill’s lover. Presidential secrets: Author Ronald Kessler rips the lid off the private lives of the the presidents in his new book . ‘Her figure looks great, but her bust doesn’t fit the rest of her figure; it is rather endowed’. Her breasts were ‘very perky and very new and full’. They appear enhanced and don’t match her face, according to the agents stationed at the guard gate who are instructed to just open the gate for her. ‘You don’t stop her, you don’t approach her, you just let her go in’. ‘I let her in many times at the front gate’, another agent confesses. Normally we held a driver’s license or other form of picture ID when visitors were in the residence. Not so in her case’. Sometimes she brought homemade cookies for the agents, wearing a low cut top and leaning over giving them a full view of her amplified cleavage. One agent sighted the former president and Energizer sitting on the swing at the back of the house sipping lemonade. ‘Wheels down’ is the forty-five minute warning for Energizer to make a quick getaway. Hillary’s plane has touched down at LaGuardia and she’ll be in Chappaqua directly. On one occasion, Hillary’s agent neglected to make the call to Old House Lane in time creating a scramble and a catastrophic near miss. No agent in the service wants to be sentenced to Hillary’s detail – considered the worst form of punishment. They lay down their life for hers and there’s no respect for that.

"An arrest has finally been made in the unsolved 2009 theft of a family caravan after an 11-year-old boy spotted a potential suspect on Google Street View. A picture taken by the street-level imaging site shows a mystery figure lurking on the family's driveway at about the time the white Abbey Aventura holiday vehicle vanished. Surveyor David Soanes, 47, and wife Rebecca, 42, hoped for a breakthrough after their son Reuben stumbled across the image in March 2010 while he and his schoolfriends surfed Street View to find pictures of their homes. In the frame: Google image captures suspicious figure lurking on driveway in Linton, Derbyshire . Hopeful: Rebecca and David Soanes and their children Reuben and Lauren are hoping this Google image will lead to a conviction in the unsolved theft of their caravan . They immediately informed police probing the theft in Linton, Derbyshire, but much to their frustration Google initially refused a request to un-blur the number plate on the suspect's 4x4 - making it far harder to trace him. The internet giant finally released the unblurred images in the beginning of 2011 - but by then the car had been sold on. This week officers finally arrested a man at Corley motorway services, on the M6 outside Coventry, using information gleaned from the Street View image. A spokesperson for Derbyshire Police . said: 'A man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and he has since . been released on police bail.' Refused: Google stalled on a request to un-blur a picture taken by a street-mapping car that police hoped would identify the culprit behind the theft of a caravan like the one pictured, right . The theft happened in June 2009 after Mr Soanes left the family home for just one hour. He said: 'It was alarmed, was wheelclamped and was positioned so that a number of people would have had to move it to get it off the drive - I thought it was secure.' The Soanes left the investigation in the hands of police but thought they would never hear about the stolen caravan again. Then, while Reuben, now 14, was searching the internet with friends at school and locating their houses on Google, he spotted the alleged thief. David said: 'Reuben came home and told us what he'd seen. We all had a look and you could tell it must have been the day that the theft happened - we had never seen that man or his car before. 'We passed the image on to the police who have since been looking for the man pictured.' Blurred out: Number plates on mystery man's 4x4 were fuzzed out in original Google images . Google's stance baffled the family . and left police struggling for leads as the thief left behind few . clues aside from the discarded wheel clamps that had been used to secure . the caravan. Pc . Adrian Mason, who was investigating the theft at the time, said: 'It was an amazing . coincidence that the Google Earth car was passing at that time. 'I’ve . made extensive inquiries since the image was discovered but because the . registration plate of the 4x4 is blanked out we have been unable to . trace the man through his car.' A . Google spokesman said: 'It’s very important to Google and our users . that we only provide information if valid process is followed, as laid . down by governments in law. 'We have a team specifically trained to evaluate and respond to requests when they are received, and we will of course co-operate with police requests as long as they are legally valid and follow the correct processes.' The Information Commissioner’s Office said it could not comment on individual cases but a spokeswoman added that the Data Protection Act did not prohibit a company passing on information if it was related to the investigation of a crime. The picture was taken by one of Google’s specially adapted cars that travel the world taking pictures. These are then uploaded to the internet, allowing users to see panoramic views of streets.

"Holidaymakers sunning themselves on the party island of Ibiza are being warned about a dangerous new drug which has been linked to disturbing acts of violence. Police are concerned that the experimental substance – which has been connected to a gruesome attack in Miami – has made its way into the famous clubs and nightspots of the Balearic island. Scroll down for video . Up all night: Police are worried that 'Cannibal' has infiltrated Ibiza's famous party scene . Detectives believe dealers in the party resort of San Antonio have been peddling the mind-bending narcotic to young revellers. Officers trying to clear the streets of the mystery drug, blamed for a recent attack in which a British tourist had to be handcuffed after biting a policeman, have branded it 'Cannibal'. Matilde Fernandez, a nurse at a health centre in San Antonio, says: ‘Fortunately he had gloves on and only suffered bruising. ‘Police had to call back up and we ended up with eight officers on the scene.' Ibiza’s chief anti-drugs officer Alberto Arean says: ‘Our hope is that it was just a small batch and has now been consumed.’ Bath salts, which contain a powerful stimulant called MDPV, were blamed for the horrific attack by Rudy Eugene on homeless Ronald Poppo, 65, in Miami in June 2012 – although subsequent tests only showed up traces of marijuana. Police shot Eugene, 31, dead after he chewed off three-quarters of his victim's face. Magnet: San Antonio, on the west coast of Ibiza, is a magnet for young holidaymakers from across Europe . Earlier this month, health chiefs in Ibiza warned that British holidaymakers were being used as guinea pigs in the trialling of dangerous new drugs. They claimed traffickers are playing with the lives of revellers by testing synthetic drugs on them – before peddling them around the rest of Europe. Raul Izquierdo, a health officer for the Balearic islands, has warned that such drugs are ‘especially dangerous’ because of their ‘unknown side effects.’ He added: ‘Ibiza is the gateway, and the experimental laboratory for the new drugs that appear.’ Lethal stimulants Methylone and PMMA are among the most common seizures of new designer drugs on Ibiza in recent years, although marijuana and cannabin resin still top the confiscation tables. Local authority figures shows that the number of drugs seizures in the Balearics Islands rose from 14,253 in 2012 to 18,640 last year.

"Friends of the Georgia man accused of killing his infant son earlier this month by leaving the boy in his hot car as he went to work say that before the child's death, Justin Ross Harris lived a happy life with his wife and his young son. Friends describe Harris - whose friends refer to as Ross - and his wife, Leanna, as being the 'most proud parents there ever could have been' when their son Cooper was born about two years ago. Other friends echo the praise for the young couple, who use words like 'nice' and 'friendly' to describe the man of intentionally killing his own son by leaving him in a scorching vehicle on a hot summer day. Suspicions are growing about what role Leanna Harris, the wife of Justin Ross Harris, may have played in the death of their 22-month-old son Cooper in the wake of her husband's preliminary hearing on Thursday .

Bryant of Houston, Texas wrote. 'He’s always the first to help when . tragedy strikes others, so I’m returning the favor to him.' Friend Matt Wiley had similar things to say about his longtime pal. 'I have known this man for years,' Wiley wrote. 'He is a great friend, a great . husband and a great father.' Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . Harris . has since pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty. It . was recently revealed that both he and his wife had done Google . searches pertaining to children killed in hot cars prior to their son's . death. Leanna Harris has not been charged with any crimes in the boy's . June 18, death. Justin . Harris has already told police that he used the internet to research . child deaths in vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for death . to occur, police said. ‘Justin stated that he was fearful that this could happen,’ a police affidavit released on Saturday said. The statement was written in order to gain permission . from the court to search Harris’ apartment in Marietta, Georgia. During a police search executed on Wednesday June 18 . officers seized a laptop computer, a computer tower, a Google Chromecast and other electronic devices. Harris’ white AT&T IPhone 5, was also seized by . cops. This comes after it was alleged the Home Depot web . developer also used his work computer to research how long it would take for a . dog to die inside a hot car. Suspicious: Police say Justin Ross Harris admitted to researching child death shortly before son Cooper Harris was declared dead in a shopping center parking lot . The . father is charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty in his . son's death, and remained in jail on Saturday as family members held a . funeral in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Leanna Harris' patched through a prison phone call from her husband during the moving . service  and with his voice breaking he was heard saying: 'I'm sorry... Thank you for everything you've done, I'm sorry, I love . you, thank you.' Justin Harris listened in to friends and family as they shared . memories with mourners in the stage. And in an emotional speech Harris' wife Leanna took . to the stage to defend her husband. She asked the congregation: 'Am I angry with Ross? Absolutely not. It never ever has crossed my mind. Ross is and always will be, . if we have more children, a wonderful daddy, a wonderful leader for our . children.' She added: 'Cooper meant the world to him, there was . not a day go by that we did not say how blessed we were to have him in our . lives.' Leanna said she had felt compelled to speak in . defense of her husband and remember Cooper. She told him as he listened in: 'Ross I love you, I . am doing this for you okay. 'I should be crumpled in a heap of snot and tears . into the dirt, but The Lord is holding me up...he is holding Ross up.' Forgiveness: Hearing Ross's words wife Leanna told the crowd she believed in her husband . Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look' Not welcome: Justin Ross Harris was banned from the funeral for Cooper held at the University Church of Christ . Leanna also recalled bringing 6lbs 8oz Cooper in to . the world. 'He was perfect,' she said, adding, 'He changed my . life and he changed Ross' life.' She also recalled how Cooper had struggled to sleep . in the two nights before his death and had spent the night sleeping in between . her and Ross in their bed. She remembers waking and looking at him. 'I will cherish that moment forever.' Earlier a family member had come on to the stage and . asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper. Saying Goodbye: Dozens gathered to mourn the short life of Cooper Harris on Saturday . Security: The church was closely gaurded as mourners shared their grief over Cooper's loss . After the claps slowed, the man said: 'Hey Ross that . sounded pretty good.' To which Ross responded: 'Yes it did.' Leanna's father Dock Taylor spoke of Cooper as a . 'wonderful little man'. 'He lived full for 22-months of his life. 'His family loved and adored and worshipped him and . we will for the rest of our days.' He added that 'nobody in this world' loved him more . than Ross and Leanna. He said Harris called him his 'handsome little . buddy'. Harris could be heard crying over the phone as Mr . Taylor spoke and the religious service progressed. Investigating: An updated arrest warrant shows Justin Harris took his 22-month-old son, Cooper, to breakfast shortly before the little boy was left to die in a hot SUV . Celebrating life: A family member came on to the stage and asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper . Harris, 33, was supposed to drop Cooper . at daycare around 9.30am on June 18 but instead went straight to work after . first stopping for breakfast at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant. He forget the boy was strapped in his car seat in the . back of the Hyundai Tuscon for seven hours - on a day when temperatures soared . into the 90s. Baby Cooper wasn’t discovered until 4.20 p.m. after . Harris has left work and suddenly pulled into a parking lot at Uncle Maddio’s . Pizza restaurant at a nearby shopping center. According to the search warrants Harris ‘quickly . exited the vehicle opened the driver side passenger door and pulled his child, . Cooper Harris out of the vehicle.’ It continued: ‘Justin was witnessed yelling 'Oh . my god what have I done.' He then began doing CPR on the child. When . someone came to assist Justin he stopped providing medical attention to the . child and started making calls on his cell phone. Memories: Mourners recalled Cooper as a happy boy who loved cars and trucks . Friends had previously described Harris and his wife as being the 'most proud parents there ever could have been' over their son Cooper . EMS responded to the scene. It . was obvious that the child was deceased. But witnesses told MailOnline that Harris was 'acting . oddly' and that he had told bystanders who tried to save the tot that the child . had been ‘choking’ minutes earlier. Instead of confessing to the tragic blunder of having . left the child in the car all day – and admitting his baby had been dead for . hours – it was claimed Harris had tried to cover his tracks. The mystery deepened even further when the police . later revealed that Harris had returned to his SUV at lunchtime and was seen . placing an object in the car via the driver’s side door. Leanna . wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the . funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, . the attorney for Harris. According to a police affidavit released on Sunday, Cobb County police say Leanna Harris has admitted to researching child deaths in hot cars online, but has not been charged . The service was attended . by Cooper’s mum Leanna, his grandparents on both sides and several aunts and . uncles. Pastor David Eldridge . spoke and gave the opening prayer followed by sentiments from family and . friends. After the service the . family will lay Cooper to rest in a private burial. A charity fund at The Home . Depot where Harris works, will pay for the funeral. On Thursday a petition, . which had attracted more than 11,000 online signatures and calling for the . murder charges against Harris to be dropped, was taken down. Mourning: Mother Leanna wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris . A wave of . supporters initially said the charges against the Home Depot worker were . outrageous and that it was an accident. The petition on Change-org demanding that the charges be dropped and the case . sparked national debate. But . as more details in the case emerged, support group Parents Support . Parents - the people behind the petition - decided to close it down. In the obituary the family . asks that in lieu of flowers donations should be made to the Homer Fund. They thanked everyone who . had supported them through this trying time. They wrote: ‘The . outpouring of love has been tremendously over-whelming in the best possible . way.’ Car: The toddler was left in the hot car, pictured, for more than seven hours .","Her husband Justin is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper in SUV for seven hours .

He was due to plead not guilty to speeding at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday, but changed his plea to guilty. A second charge of failing to provide information on the identity of the driver was dropped. Crouch, who didn’t appear in court, was ordered to pay £350 costs and a £15 victim surcharge for speeding at around 8.05pm on November 19. Barry Warburton, defending, said: 'It was a Saturday evening in November and there was no traffic on the road whatsoever. On the ball: Peter Crouch in action for Stoke City .

"Recently released transcripts of jailhouse phone calls between murder suspect Curtis Reeves and his family reveal the retired Florida police captain is confident of his acquittal. Other evidence released by the Pinellas-Pasco attorneys office, including photographs taken from inside the Wesley Chapel movie theater where Reeves shot dead Chad Oulson, 43, and injured his wife Nicole Oulson over a text messaging dispute, sheds light on the case. Reeves, 71, faces charges of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the January 13 shooting and is being held without bail. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: This photo released by the attorney's office shows Curtis Reeves handcuffed in the movie theater where he shot Chad Oulson . Refused bail: Reeves, seen here at a February 5 bond hearing, was ordered to remain in prison until his trial . He is accused of gunning down husband and father Oulson and injuring his wife after the two men became involved in an argument over Oulson text messaging on his cell phone during previews for Lone Survivor at Grove Cobb 16 theater. 'When all the facts come out, we all should be in good shape,' Reeves told his family on January 16 - three days after the shooting, reports the Tampa Bay Times. In the recordings released by the Pasco-Pinellas State Attorney's Office, he tells his wife Vivian and his son and daughter to sell his motorbike or kayak if they are in need of money. Violent scene: A photo released as evidence shows the auditorium in the Grove Cobb 16 theater in Wesley Chapel after authorities say Curtis Reeves shot and killed Chad Oulson in a dispute over texting during previews January 13 . Sudden escalation: The confrontation that resulted in Oulson's death occurred before the movie had even begun . Armed: Reeves entered the theater with this gun, which he then used to shoot Oulson . 'You all need to know that you're all the love of my life. And if it need be, y'all plan on me not being there so you plan whatever you have to do to make your life easy, okay,' he said.  'My life will be easy if your all's is. Plan the future and don't spend all the money on me.' 'We have all of that under control. We're not even going to talk about it,' daughter Jennifer Shaw tells him. Photographs from the movie theater after the shooting show Curtis Reeves in handcuffs sitting in a theater seat, scattered popcorn, a dropped cell phone and a spent casing from the bullet that killed father-of-one Oulson. They also show Nicole Oulson's badly injured hand after she was shot trying to deflect the bullet that killed her husband. Video from the scene appears to show Oulson snatching Reeves' popcorn off his lap and throwing it at him. Reeves responds instantaneously with a single, fatal gunshot. No weapons allowed: The management forbids patrons to bring weapons into the theater . Life cut short: Chad Oulson, pictured with his wife and child, was killed during a confrontation with Reeves in January . Former cop: Reeves served as a Tampa police officer but is now in jail awaiting trial for murder . Reeves is claiming he shot the unarmed Oulson in self-defense because he feared for his life. He told police that Oulson attacked him and that he feared for his life. 'Like I told everybody, I've spent 71 years doing the right thing and this guy just... anyway,' he said to his family over the phone. However, in an interview with police after the shooting, Vivian Reeves gave a conflicting story. A detective asked her, 'Did you see him get hit in the face?' 'No, I didn't,' responded Vivian Reeves. A statement given by Reeves in the aftermath of the shooting has also been released. 'Suddenly, he jumps up and he turns around and he stands in his seat,' Reeves is said to have told investigators. 'He kept on hollering and I'm not sure what he said to be honest with you. He said something that led me to believe he was going to kick my ass, and I don't know if that's exactly how he phrased it or not,' reports ABC Action News.

"The New York dad who shot dead his girlfriend, one of their daughters and his girlfriend's mother before taking his own life thought the woman was cheating on him, according to reports. Nightclub bouncer Jonathan Walker, 34, is believed to have shot Shantai Hale, 31, his seven-year-old daughter Kayla Walker, and Hale's mother Viola Warren, 62, in their heads at their Springfield Gardens, Queens home in the early hours of Saturday. Walker, who was later found dead from a gunshot wound to his head in his car, also shot his 12-year-old daughter Christina in the head, but she survived and managed to call 911. Hours before the attack, Walker was overheard at a liquor store saying he thought Hale was cheating, possibly with more than one person, a law enforcement source told the New York Post. Murdered: Shantai Hale, left, and her seven-year-old daughter Kayla Walker, right, were both shot in the head at their home in Queens on Saturday morning by Walker's father, authorities said . Gunman: Jonathan Walker, 34, pictured, massacred his family before taking his own life on Saturday . He got drunk before skipping his bouncer shift on Friday evening and then headed home, where he shot his two daughters. He shot them because he said he would prefer them to die than go into foster care after he killed their mother, a source told the Post. Walker then shot his common-law-wife, a computer analyst, and her mother, who worked at JFK airport, in another bedroom before driving from the home and taking his own life inside his car. The car, a 2013 GMC Acadia, and his dead body were found in a wooded area near JFK Airport. A .45-caliber firearm was recovered from the scene, authorities said. The father had apparently used the same gun to shoot his family and take his own life. Christina, who managed to call 911 and open the door for first responders, was rushed to Long Island Jewish Medical Center and is in a medically induced coma after undergoing surgery to ease swelling on her brain. Victim: Viola Warren, his girlfriend's mother, was also fatally shot in the head during the early-morning attack . Killed: He fatally shot Kayla, left, her mother, right, and her grandmother. He also shot Kayla's 12-year-old sister Christina, but the girl survived her wounds and managed to call 911 . Doctors are 'hopeful', her uncle, Silford Warren, said. 'She moved her head backward at just the right moment when [her father] fired and that probably saved her life,' he told the Post. New York City Councilman Donovan Richards said Walker was with friends moments before the shooting, and said he was going home to watch Netflix. 'What happened to make him snap?' Richards said, Newsday reported. 'That's the million-dollar question that everybody is trying to find out.' Richards added: 'It doesn't add up, it just does not add up.' Chief detective Robert K. Boyce told Newsday that the NYPD responded to domestic incidents at the home in 2005 and 2006 but called them 'nominal matters'. He also said Walker had been arrested twice previously, but that both cases are sealed.

"Tragic: Constable Rod Gellatly died yesterday after shooting himself at a  Glasgow police station in an apparent suicide . A firearms officer died yesterday after shooting  himself in an apparent suicide at a city police station. Constable Rod Gellatly had ‘turned the gun on himself’ after arriving at work as normal yesterday morning. Police refused to give any further detail but admitted officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the 41-year-old’s death. The incident happened at Baird Street police station in Glasgow – the Strathclyde Police base for firearms specialists, generally of constable or sergeant rank. There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that PC  Gellatly had shot himself in the station’s toilets. It is understood he came to work, took a weapon and ammunition from the armoury and was later found dead by colleagues. An ambulance was called around 11am but later left with no casualty on board. The tragedy is certain to raise  questions over the vetting of firearms officers who have to undergo strict psychological assessment before being allowed to carry a weapon. The average percentage of officers with firearms training across Scotland is around four per cent – currently around 700 out of 17,436 officers. Lothian and Borders Police was called in immediately as an independent force to investigate, while a report was sent to the procurator fiscal. An independent probe by another force is also standard practice in cases where an officer is killed in a firearms incident. In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins of  Strathclyde Police said: ‘It is with great sadness I have to tell you that a serving Strathclyde Police officer died today in an incident where a firearm was discharged at Baird Street Police Office. ‘Our thoughts are with the  officer’s family and friends at this difficult time.’ PC Gellatly is understood to have been married and lived on the south side of Glasgow. He served previously in the Fleet Air Arm as a Petty Officer based in the South of England between 1989 and 2002. Cordoned off: Officers stand outside a Strathclyde police station in Baird Street, Glasgow, where an officer died after a gun was fired . Emergency: Officers called for an ambulance at 11am today, which attended the scene at Baird Street Police Station and left shortly before 2pm . But in recent years he had been living in the Glasgow area and serving as a policeman in Strathclyde, including spells in Wishaw and Shotts. Police are issued with a range of firearms which vary between different forces but include Heckler & Koch rifles and semi-automatic carbines and pistols, while some forces use shotguns. Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ‘We can confirm that one of our colleagues has died following a firearms incident in Baird Street police station this morning. ‘It is too early to speculate as to the circumstances surrounding the tragic death and our thoughts turn immediately to his family who have lost their loved one and colleagues who have lost a friend.’ Labour MSP Graeme Pearson, the former head of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, said: ‘It is a dreadful tragedy for the officer, his family, his friends and a terrible loss to the wider police service. ‘I know Strathclyde Police will support those affected with the level of professionalism one expects in the circumstances. 'A lost friend': Fellow officers today paid tribute to the policeman who hasn't been named . James McIvor, 37, of nearby Pinkston . Road, added: ‘It was a bit of a mystery at the start of the day then we . found that a police officer was killed. ‘The fact a gun was involved makes it . even more horrifying. It is a big shock for it to happen, especially in . the middle of a police station.’ Scaffolder Neil McCuaigs, 38, was working nearby at the time and said police dogs could be heard barking aggressively. He said: ‘I knew something  terrible had happened straight away.’ Last night Gary Gray, 39, came to lay a poppy cross at the station with his son Bobby, eight, to ‘show respect’. He said: ‘I heard what had happened on . the radio so I came down to show my respect. I think sometimes the . police are not given the credit they deserve for the help they give us. ‘They are here to help, they do a . difficult job and I think we should show our appreciation – not just for . this victim but for them all.’","Constable Rod Gellatly, 41, died after the incident at a Strathclyde Police station in Baird Street ."

Divorcee and foster mother Mrs McDonough, 52, died shortly after being admitted to the Royal Inverclyde Hospital, Greenock. Her charity worker daughter spent . days battling for her life at the same hospital, with relatives, . including her father Thomas McDonough, keeping a bedside vigil. Detectives were waiting for her . condition to improve to interview her for answers. But last night it was . reported that she, too, had died. Police in Scotland, who will now have to establish by other means how the tragedy unfolded, yesterday outlined details of the women’s movements before the incident. Detectives were hoping to speak to Miss McDonough, left, to discover what happened to her . and mother, right . They appear to have  travelled to . Dunbartonshire before checking in to the Greenock hotel, which is barely . 17 miles from their Paisley home. The women arrived there at around . 3.50pm on Thursday, left a short time later and then returned between . 12.30am and 1am on Friday.

Detective Inspector David Wagstaff of Police Scotland said: ‘At present we are keeping an open mind on the circumstances. ‘However, we can confirm that we are . not looking for any third party at this time. I would urge anyone with . information, however, insignificant it might seem, to get in touch with . police.’ Officers want to speak to anyone who . saw their car, a red Suzuki Swift registration SL56 CBF, in the Paisley . or Greenock area last Thursday and  Friday. Mr Wagstaff added: ‘We are still piecing together the last known movements of Margaret and Nicola. ‘Our enquiries have revealed that . after last being seen in the Paisley area around 9am on Thursday, both . travelled to the Balloch area and we have a sighting of them around 11am . in Carrochan Road, Balloch. ‘Were you in the Balloch area on . Thursday morning? Did you see the red Suzuki Swift? You may have . information that could assist us. ‘I would also ask anyone who may have . seen either Margaret or Nicola or their car in the Paisley and Greenock . area during the course of Thursday and Friday to get in touch. I’d . particularly like to speak to any of their friends or acquaintances. ‘Were they in touch with you on . Thursday by phone, face-to-face or via text message? Did they let you . know about any plans they had made?’ Police at the Premier Inn where the two women were discovered with what officers called 'slashing injuries' Mr Wagstaff continued: 'I need information from the local communities of Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and Balloch as these are the areas that we know Margaret and Nicola travelled to.' Mrs McDonough, a foster mother, is believed to have been considering adoption after taking in a girl and boy, aged two and five. But the children have been removed by social workers. The former Liberal Democrat candidate . stood in elections for East Renfrewshire Council. Her candidate profile . states: ‘She sees first-hand the needs of very vulnerable children in . her care and their families, and would like to be able to take some of . that knowledge into the decision-making processes of the council. ‘She also has interest and experience . in looking at special educational needs for young children to ensure . that all children reach their full potential.’ Detectives combed the hotel for evidence but say they are still treating the incident as 'unexplained' A friend, who did not want to be . named, said: ‘She was a wonderful mum of five grown-up children and I . expect that is why she decided to become a foster mother, because she . wanted to carry on looking after children. ‘I remember seeing her in the bank recently with one of her foster children, who was having a huge tantrum. ‘I told her she had her hands full but she was completely calm. She took it in her stride, she was a natural mother.’ The mother and daughter had apparently booked a single night stay at the Premier Inn not far from their home . Mrs McDonough is believed to have . remained single after her divorce seven years ago. She remained in the . family home and had five grown-up children, including Nicola. The others are Kevin, Michael, . Matthew and Margaret, who are all believed to have kept a vigil beside . their sister’s hospital bed.

"Police found a tall lamp lying on a bedroom floor and open suitcases containing folded clothes in the closet of a California home, according to court records unsealed Friday in the investigation that eventually led to the discovery of four dead family members in shallow desert graves. The documents offer the most detailed look yet of the disheveled condition of the family's house in Fallbrook when investigators arrived in February 2010 while searching for Joseph McStay, then 40, his wife Summer, 43, and their two sons, Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3. Police also found two bowls of slightly spilled popcorn on a living room couch and a carton of raw eggs and bowl of microwave popcorn on a kitchen counter. Revealed: Recently unsealed court documents reveal what led police investigating the disappearance of the McStay family in California to believe they'd been killed, including two bowls of slightly spilled popcorn on a living room couch. Pictured here is a photo from inside the McStay home . Also found by police in California were clothes folded in half-full suit cases inside a bedroom at the McStay residence. Here, photos reveal some of what police saw inside the home . 'In my opinion, a family does not just up and leave under the circumstances described above,' San Diego County Sheriff's Detective Troy DuGal wrote while seeking court approval for a more thorough search of the house and phone records. He said he believed that some or all of the family members had been kidnapped or killed. Among the dozens of items recovered from the house was an eviction notice from the McStay's previous residence in San Clemente. The family's disappearance remained a mystery until their remains were found in November 2013 by an off-road vehicle rider near Victorville in the desert northeast of Los Angeles. Charles 'Chase' Merritt, who knew the family through the water-fountain business of Joseph McStay, was arrested last November and pleaded not guilty to murder. News organizations including The Associated Press asked judges in San Diego and San Bernardino to unseal search warrants in the case. Killed: The four bodies of the McStay family were eventually found in 2013 buried in the California desert . Mystery: The family's disappearance remained a mystery until their remains were found in November 2013 by an off-road vehicle rider near Victorville in the desert northeast of Los Angeles . Gruesome: Here, workers fill the two shallow graves at the site on the outskirts of Victorville that contained the skeletal remains of members of missing McStay family in San Bernardino . Shallow graves: Residents of Victorville, California, and surrounding communities place crosses near the graves where the McStay family was found in Victorville . San Diego Superior Court Judge Runston Maino unsealed all the warrants obtained by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which oversaw the investigation until turning it over to the FBI in April 2013. At a brief hearing, the judge dismissed objections of Merritt's attorney, Robert Ponce, who argued that publicity surrounding release of the documents might taint a jury, and that a decision should be delayed until his client could appear personally. San Bernardino Superior Court Judge Michael Smith will consider next Friday whether to unseal search warrants obtained by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Those documents, written within a year of Merritt's arrest, are more likely to reveal why investigators decided McStay's former business associate is a suspect. Sean Daugherty, a San Bernardino County deputy district attorney, didn't object to releasing the San Diego search warrants but has indicated he will oppose unsealing documents from later stages of the investigation in San Bernardino. An ex-convict was charged last November with four counts of murder in the slayings of a couple and their two young sons whose skeletal remains were found buried last year in the California desert, police and prosecutors said. The suspect, Charles 'Chase' Merritt, 57, was described by police as a former business associate of the father, Joseph McStay, who was reported missing with his wife and two boys in February 2010 from the family's Southern California home. Merritt, arrested without incident in Los Angeles, is believed to have acted alone, though investigators are keeping mum about any motives for the killings, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon. Charles Merritt, a business associate of Joseph's, was arrested in the murders of the family of four, including two young boys, whose disappearance from their San Diego County home in 2010 was a mystery until their remains were discovered in graves in the California desert last year . The four victims - McStay, 40, his wife, Summer, 43, and their two sons, 4-year-old Gianni and 3-year-old Joseph Jr. - died of blunt-force trauma, the sheriff said. According to police, they were killed inside their home in the San Diego County community of Fallbrook on Feb. 4, 2010. San Bernardino County authorities took over the investigation in November 2013 after their remains were unearthed near Victorville, about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The shallow graves were located when a motorcyclist reported finding what he thought were human bones in the desert. Merritt faces the death penalty if convicted, county prosecutor Michael Ramos said, declaring, 'This is a cold and callous murder of an entire family.' The lead homicide detective, Sergeant Chris Fisher, told a news conference that Merritt had at least two prior felony convictions and served two state prison terms. Fisher said McStay and Merritt each had owned his own decorative-fountain business and that McStay had asked Merritt 'to make some custom waterfalls.' 'They started working together, became friends (and) that's how their relationship started,' Fisher said. He added that the two men had a meeting at a restaurant the day of the slayings. But he revealed nothing of what detectives knew of that encounter or what evidence led investigators to Merritt. McStay's mother, Susan Blake, told reporters her son had loaned Merritt 'quite a bit of money,' but she did not elaborate.

"Heartbroken: The children's mother, centre, pictured with their grandparents who were told they couldn't adopt the children by Edinburgh social workers . The grandparents of two children given to a gay couple for adoption have been denied access to them for three years. The Scottish Daily Mail first revealed their appalling ordeal in 2009, when the case sparked a storm of protest across the UK. They claimed they had been barred from looking after the youngsters because they were deemed ‘too old’ to care for them, although the council refutes this. The couple, who raised seven children of their own and cared for their eldest daughter’s children until the boy was five and his sister was four, claim promises of contact were broken. The 64-year-old grandfather has since suffered a stroke – and now fears he may die without seeing them again. City of Edinburgh Council social worker Heather Rush told the grandparents around the time of the adoption that they would not be allowed to see the children if they did not give their blessing to the controversial move. The grandparents from Perthshire – who cannot be identified for legal reasons – spoke of their on-going torment last night, after the Scottish Government unveiled plans on Tuesday for grandparents to get sweeping new legal rights to bring up their grandchildren. The grandfather said: ‘Those children were everything to me. They were rays of sunshine in the life of my family and when they were taken away we felt we’d lost everything. ‘People always think that sorrow fades with time but I can promise you it doesn’t. I still go upstairs at night to find my wife in tears and I’m not much better. ‘It’s affected my health badly. Four weeks ago I had a stroke and I am in no doubt that the stress of our lives being torn apart was behind it.’ The couple were aged 61 and 46 when the children were removed by social workers in Edinburgh, where they lived. At the time, they say they were told they were considered ‘too old’ to be parents to the children of their heroin addict daughter, even though the children were happy with them and they had cared for them almost since birth. Apology: City of Edinburgh Council bosses admitted mistakes were made in the in the way the grandparents were dealt with in this case . Although the grandfather was approaching retirement age, he was fit and well and still doing heavy manual work as a farmhand. His 49-year-old wife said last night: ‘We are glad to hear the Scottish Government has listened to what we believe the majority of the public wants and is recognising the rights and the vital role of grandparents. ‘We’d like it to make a difference to . our situation but it’s too late for that now. Our grandson turned nine . in July and his little sister will be eight in December, and obviously . we hope and pray they are well and settled. ‘We . wouldn’t disrupt them again even if the law gave us the right to do it . as it wouldn’t be in their interests, but we would hope any new . legislation would enshrine our rights to reasonable contact with them. The children, a boy and a girl, were looked after by their grandparents before being adopted aged five and four (stock image) ‘We were told when they were taken away that the couple adopting them would be happy to let us have contact. ‘After speaking to the Mail to raise awareness of our loss, we were effectively “punished” and told trust had been breached and it would be a year before the couple would consider whether we could be trusted. ‘But three years have gone by now and nothing has changed. We were more than grandparents to them. Because our daughter couldn’t cope, we were mother and father to them as well. ‘They loved us and we adored them, and it’s a sin that the state can break the natural love and bond that a family shares.’ She added: ‘My husband is 64 now and has had a pretty serious stroke. He requires an angioplasty  operation and could have another stroke at any time. ‘I pray he’ll be well for years to come, but the children being snatched from us has caused this, and it would be unforgivable if his health should fail again – for him to be forced to die still yearning for his grandchildren. ‘We can only send a card at Christmas and birthdays, through the social work department. We get no acknowledgement. ‘We know the children still love us . and care for us because we got a note at Christmas saying they had asked . us to let them know what things they liked as very young children, when . they cut their first teeth, and asking us for photos of ourselves. ‘We . were delighted to provide all we were asked for and hoped it might lead . to contact, even once a month, but there’s been nothing. It’s not . right.’ Paving the way for change: Scottish Parliament announced plans this week  for grandparents to have new legal rights to bring up their grandchildren . In May 2009, Edinburgh council bosses admitted that mistakes were made in the way they dealt with the grandparents and apologised after two highly disturbing phone calls between the couple and social worker Mrs Rush. In the first, she told them they would not be allowed to see the children if they did not give their blessing to the controversial gay adoption. In the second, which came the day the grandparents went public with their story, Mrs Rush allegedly told the children’s mother her parents would never see them again. A council spokesman said: ‘Decisions about contact are based only on the well-being and best interests of the children. In this case it was made very clear to the family at the time of the adoption placement that there would be no direct contact.’","The couple were allegedly deemed 'too old' by City of Edinburgh Council social workers to care for their two grandchildren themselves .

"Refugees taking shelter in Lebanon from violent jihadists have turned around and headed back into war-torn Syria after insurgents launched repeated attacks across the border. The fleeing victims of the Syrian civil war were seen yesterday at the border town of Arsal, picking through the remains of a refugee camp which Islamist fighters burned to the ground. Having previously thought of Lebanon as a relatively safe haven from the long-running civil war between Syria dictator Bashar Assad and hard-line Muslim forces in the country, the Syrian victims found themselves in the firing line earlier this week after new attacks. Fleeing: Syrian refugees gather their effects and head back to their homeland after jihadists made incursions into Lebanon . Driving away: The convoy of cars and vans is pictured waiting in Arsal, which was captured by the jihadists last week before being won back by Lebanese forces . Razed: The Arsal refugee camp, pictured, was burned down by the invading militants . Lives destroyed, again: Children look on at the damaged remains of the tents where they had lived . Collateral: In the background surviving tents can be seen, but the damage was too much for the refugees, who made the decision to head back to Syria . Today a new wave of Jihadists attacked the village of Kfar Qouq, but were forced back by armed locals. Some of the fighters are thought to be members of the Islamic State (IS) group, despite their strongholds being hundreds of miles away in the north-east of Syria and parts of Iraq. Lebanese security sources said the jihadist forces had also been under attack from Syrian government forces that day. Kfar Qouq is near the Bekaa Valley town of Rashaya, 60 miles south of Arsal, which was seized a week ago by Islamist militants who crossed from Syria. That incursion was the most serious spillover yet of Syria's three-year-long civil war into Lebanon. On the way out: This car, lined up with other traffic on the road out of Arsal, was damaged in the fighting . Queues: Syrians have loaded everything they can carry onto trucks and into smaller cars for their ride home . Dozens of people were killed in five days of fighting between the army and the militants who included Islamists affiliated to the Islamic State, which has seized territory in Syria and Iraq. The militants pulled out of Arsal to the mountainous border zone on Thursday, taking with them 19 captive soldiers. Militant sources said on Friday that they sought to exchange them for Islamists held in Lebanese jails. Two commanders close to the group  said the demands had been sent to the Lebanese government and army . Loaded up: Refugees are seen here in the Lebanese village of Labweh in the Bekaa Valley on their way to Syria . Crammed in: Dozens of refugees pile into one truck, seen here between checkpoints by the Syrian border . Hurt: Injured Syrians are seen inside a van. They hope to be safer inside their own country . The militants withdrew from Arsal into the mountainous border region after a battle in which dozens of people were killed, including 17 soldiers. The militants said their list of Islamist prisoners they want released included Emad Gomaa, whose arrest last Saturday sparked the incursion into Arsal. The army has said the attack by the Islamists had been long-planned. Gomaa had been a commander in the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in the Syrian civil war, but he switched affiliation to the Islamic State in the weeks before his arrest. Reprisals: Members of the Lebanese army patrol near Arsal earlier this week . Damage: This army building in Arsal was damaged by jihadist gunfire in an attack this week . The militants are also seeking the release of other Islamists jailed since a 2007 insurrection by an al Qaeda-inspired group at a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon. Last month, the Nusra Front issued a statement promising to secure the release of Islamist detainees being held at Roumieh prison, northeast of Beirut. 'This has taken a long time and the government does not seem to be willing to listen or understand. Maybe this time they will,' said the second militant source. 'We have nothing to lose now, we have lost people and our people are refugees again so there is nothing more to lose.' An army patrol entered Arsal town on Friday for the first time since the militants pulled out, a security source said.","Refugees poured out of border town Arsal, heading back to war-torn home .

"The Twitter account of Take That star Gary Barlow was hacked yesterday with an offensive message posted about his stillborn child. Barlow was targeted by an . internet troll who posted the disturbing message after a court ruling that the singer had invested in a massive tax . avoidance scheme. The . message, which is too offensive to repeat, was removed after eight . minutes but in that time had been re-tweeted hundreds of times. Scroll down for video . The Take That singer was awarded the OBE for 'services to the entertainment industry' Barlow and his wife Dawn lost their fourth child, a daughter called Poppy, who was stillborn in 2012. The Manchester Evening News reported a spokesman for Barlow confirmed his Twitter account was hacked on Monday lunchtime. The news comes as David Cameron yesterday insisted that he should be allowed to keep his OBE, despite a court ruling . that he had invested in a massive tax avoidance scheme. The . Take That star – and prominent Tory supporter – has faced a barrage of . criticism, with MP John Mann branding him ‘unethical’ and others calling . for him to hand back the honour. But Mr Cameron believes the measure is . unnecessary. Prime Minister David Cameron said it is not 'necessary' for Barlow to hand back his OBE . The Prime Minister insisted the singer had 'done a huge amount for the country' including raising money for charity. Tory-supporting . Barlow, 43, and bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their . manager Jonathan Wild, poured £66million into Icebreaker Management, . which styled itself as a music industry investment scheme. However a judge ruled last week that it was in fact a tax shelter designed to help the super-rich avoid paying income tax. The band members  – of which Barlow was the biggest investor – are now likely to face repaying £20million to HMRC. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, claimed Barlow 'might want to show a bit of contrition by giving back his OBE'. But Mr Cameron rejected the idea. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don’t think that’s necessary frankly. Gary Barlow has done a huge amount for the country, he’s raised money for charity, he’s done very well for Children in Need so I’m not sure... 'The OBE was in respect of that work and what he’s done but clearly what this scheme was was wrong and it’s right that they’re going to pay back the money.' Mr Cameron said he was against aggressive tax avoidance schemes, and it was right that Barlow and the other Take That stars returned the money . London Mayor Boris Johnson also insisted the singer should be allowed to keep his gong. He told BBC News: ' Should Gary Barlow lose his OBE following his multi-million pound tax dodge? Should Gary Barlow lose his OBE following his multi-million pound tax dodge? Now share your opinion . 'We will . want to see him coughing up in the same way as everybody else. But I . don’t think as far as I understand the matter that he’s done anything . illegal, has he? 'As . far as I’m concerned there aren’t any criminal charges against him or . whatever. I think he should cough up but on the OBE question that people . keep asking me, I don’t think there’s any need for him to hand back his . OBE.' Barlow backed the Tories at the last election, joining Mr Cameron just weeks before polling day at a policy launch. It . is believed the Take That stars were able to avoid tax on about . £63million from world tours and CD sales. They were among nearly 1,000 . people who contributed £300million to 62 partnerships. But . a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker investment partnerships, . which were formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit at all – . despite investing in a range of musicians including Sinead O’Connor. It was also revealed that HMRC has been trying to shut down the scheme for years. Barlow joined David Cameron on the campaign trail in the run-up to the 2010 general election, backing Tory plans for an X-Factor-style school singing contest. Asked if he was supporting the Conservatives, Barlow replied:  'I would not be here if I was not.' The Prime Minister hosted a Children In Need reception in Downing Street attended by Barlow in January 2012 . Gary Barlow . has spent more than 20 years in the public eye, rising from boyband to some calling him a national treasure. He was Take That's lead singer when the band was formed in 1989, alongside Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams. When the band split in 1996, his solo career was eclipsed by Williams. It was not until the band reformed in 2005 that Barlow achieved the status of national treasure. In 2010 he surprised many by joining David Cameron at a Tory party policy launch less than a month before the 2010 general election. Asked if he was backing the Conservatives, Barlow replied: 'I would not be here if I was not.' He served as a judge on three series of X Factor, and confirmed his place in the musical establishment when he organised the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert in June 2012 - which featured a . host of stars including Stevie Wonder and Sir Paul McCartney who played . to a televised audience of millions. He returned to . Buckingham Palace in November 2012 to be awarded his OBE by the Queen. He was given the honour for services to the entertainment industry and to charity. Barlow . masterminded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert - staged at the Palace . during a special bank holiday weekend in June 2012 - which featured a . host of stars including Stevie Wonder and Sir Paul McCartney who played . to a televised audience of millions. The . anthem Sing, co-written with Andrew Lloyd Webber, and featured at the . Jubilee concert, topped the singles charts during the summer and his OBE . was announced days later in the Queen's Birthday Honours. His . charity work includes gathering a team of celebrities to climb Mount . Kilimanjaro in 2009 for Comic Relief and organising charity concerts for . Children in Need in 2009 and 2011. The Prime Minister added: 'I’m against these aggressive tax avoidance schemes but I’m not just against them, this Government has taken a huge amount of steps to legislate and toughen the laws and go after aggressive tax avoidance schemes for the very simple reason that if people go after these schemes and aggressively avoid tax they’re making it the case that everyone else has to pay higher taxes as a result. 'So I think we should be very clear, tax evasion is illegal and for that you can be prosecuted, you can go to prison for tax evasion. 'Tax avoidance is in these cases, very aggressive tax avoidance schemes, they are wrong and we should really persuade not to do them and that’s why we have these court cases where the court looks at whether a scheme is really about avoiding tax rather than anything else and the court was very clear in this case.' Judge Colin Bishopp said: ‘Icebreaker is, and was known by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme. 'The aim was to secure [tax] relief for members, and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing.’ He added: ‘No serious or moderately sophisticated investor seeking a profit... would rationally have chosen an Icebreaker partnership.’ Insiders say the judgment on Friday took the stars by surprise, and there is speculation Take That will have to launch another tour to raise funds. There is no suggestion, however, that other band members Jason Orange and Robbie Williams were involved in the scheme. Last night Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Commons Treasury select committee, said the bandmates had no grounds to complain if they were forced to pay back a  crippling sum. He said: ‘They should pay their taxes the same as everyone else. 'The people who buy their records pay tax. It is unethical to avoid paying what you owe. 'Barlow should put a cheque in the post.’ Yesterday, fans vented their anger and called for Barlow to be stripped of his OBE, which he was given in 2012 for services to music and charity. One joked on Twitter: ‘Gary Barlow to swap OBE for IOU.’ Another said: ‘Did Gary Barlow “Take That” too literally?’ Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘This case shows that however famous people are, they must pay their fair share of tax.’ Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'People who don't pay the taxes that they should undermine the economy, damage our public services and place an extra, unfair burden on hard-working families and companies who play by the rules.' Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke told the Times newspaper: 'People who have seriously abused the tax system should be stripped of their honours.' The . group’s spokesman declined to comment yesterday – but it was reported . that Barlow believed he ‘was not given the full picture’ about the . scheme. Icebreaker’s . spokesman said: ‘Icebreaker Management is extremely disappointed with . this decision  and will consider all the options, including appeal.’ A . spokesman for HMRC said: ‘HMRC has put in place generous reliefs to . support genuine business investment... But we will not tolerate abuse of . the system by people trying to dodge their tax obligations.’","Message live for only eight minutes, but was re-tweeted hundreds of times .

"Josh Kelchner, a long-term foster child, has defied the odds to graduate from New York's prestigious West Point Military Academy as a lieutenant. After a rough childhood that included four different high schools and 12 foster homes, the 22-year-old has finally come to a point in his journey where he can relax - briefly. Currently on holiday in Puerto Rico, the graduate has a short break before he heads to Fort Sill, in Lawton, Oklahoma, for field artillery training and to begin his five years compulsory service. Against the odds: Josh Kelchner smiles after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as a second lieutenant . Kelchner's childhood still haunts him. A local newspaper article about the then 17-year-old in 2008 describes the trials of the younger Kelchner. When Kelchner was just a toddler his father abandoned the family, leaving his mother to raise Kelchner, who would be joined by three younger siblings. His mother did not cope with her responsibilities and neglected Kelchner, who can count 12 different foster homes over seven-and-a-half years. 'Whenever you get harshness you can’t think it’s your fault,' Kelchner told News-Press recently. 'You move past it. You don’t think it’s your fault.' Kelchner tried to keep his siblings together as they were shuttled from one home to another. 'I had one girl on one arm, the other girl on the other arm and my brother on my shoulders,' he told News-Press. 'I didn’t want us to be broke up. I felt like they were the only thing I really had that stayed constant,' he said. Hard work: Josh Kelchner, seen here with his girlfriend, was abandoned by his father and neglected by his mother as a child but has worked hard to overcome his problems . 'According to his brother and sisters, he’s the one who got them up for breakfast and took them to the bus stop,' said Gwendolyn Burdette, Kelchner’s caseworker for the Department of Children and Families, in 2008. When Kelchner finally lost the battle to keep his siblings together in 2005, it was an opportunity for the teenager to settle into a new home and focus his future. He moved in with the Burdick family and settled into school and was allowed to just be a kid. He excelled at sports at Dunbar High School - his fourth - and was no slouch academically, either, making the honor roll. Kelchner's siblings were all adopted out and according to News-Press, are doing well. Proud: Josh Kelchner poses in uniform with his girlfriend . When Kelchner was 17, he attended a West Point seminar. Out of 400 other attendees, he left with an award for outstanding leadership. After his experience at the seminar, Kelchner decided to apply to attend West Point Military Academy. The academy receives more than 13,000 applications from students wanting to attend each year. It accepts just 1,100 of these. Kelchner was accepted, and after a brief upset when he left the academy in shame after flunking out of an academic course, he graduated with flying colors. Now, Kelchner feels he's found somewhere he feels at home and is planning a career in the military. 'I like the atmosphere and the camaraderie,' Kelchner told News-Press. 'Everybody helps everybody out.' 'I’m kinda thinking long-term. We’ll see how this feels,' he said.","Josh Kelchner, 22, has graduated the prestigious West Point Military Academy .

"The terrible fate of Earth after a nuclear war has been mapped out using computer models for the first time. Worldwide famine, deadly frosts, global ozone losses of up to 50 per cent and more would greet any inhabitants of the planet still remaining after a nuclear conflict. And the researchers hope their study of what they call a relatively 'small' nuclear war will serve as a deterrent against such weapons being used by any nation in the future. Scroll down for video . Researchers based in Colorado have studied the effects of a nuclear conflict on Earth. They used climate models to predict what would become of the planet after the detonation of 100 'small' nuclear warheads, and conclude there would be global devastation. Pictured is an atomic weapon test in the 1950s . The unnerving consequences were laid out in a paper called ‘Multidecadal global cooling and unprecedented ozone loss following a regional nuclear conflict.’ Year 0 . Five megatons of black carbon released into the atmosphere, which absorbs sunlight and begins to cool the planet. Black carbon rain also kills millions. Year 1 . Average surface temperature drops by 1°C (2°F). Year 2 . Crop growing season is shortened by 10 to 40 days. Year 5 . Earth is an average of 1.5°C (3°F) colder than the present day, colder than it has been in 1,000 years. There is also nine per cent less rainfall. The ozone is also up to 25 per cent thinner, increasing UV rays on Earth. Year 10 . Ozone recovers slightly to just 8 per cent less than modern day. Year 20 . Planet warms slightly to 0.5°C (1°F) lower than the present day. Year 26 . Rainfall increases to about 4.5 per cent less than today. In it the researchers looked at the outcome of a ‘limited, regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan in which each side detonates 50 15-kiloton weapons.’ They then used computer models to examine the impact on the planet and its environment - and it makes for grim reading. The immediate result of 100 nuclear weapons roughly the size of those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki being detonated would be the release of five megatons of black carbon into the atmosphere. Black carbon, not too dissimilar to soot, would block out the sun and can also be fatal to humans. Following a spell of black carbon rain, a deadly weather front that would devastate what remained of humanity following the nuclear war, the temperature of Earth would begin to drop. After a year the temperature would fall by 1°C (2°F), while after five it would be 1.5°C (3°F) cooler than it is now. About 20 years after the conflict it would warm again to just 0.5°C (1°F) below today’s temperature. Accompanying what the researchers call ‘the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1,000 years’ would be a huge loss in ozone levels. They say that global ozone losses of 20 to 50 per cent would occur over populated areas, ‘levels unprecedented in human history’. The immediate result of 100 nuclear weapons being detonated would be the release of five megatons of black carbon (shown) into the atmosphere, say researchers. Black carbon, not too dissimilar to soot and released from the burning of things such as fossil fuels, would block out the sun and can also be fatal to humans . The drop in temperature would produce ‘killing frosts’ that reduce the world’s growing season by 10 to 40 days. Meanwhile the eradication of up to half of the ozone would increase UV rays in some locations by as much as 80 per cent, raising the chance of developing skin cancer for large swathes of humanity. Combined with the global cooling, this ‘would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.’ The planet’s falling temperature would also decrease the amount of rainfall. Five years after the conflict Earth would see 9 per cent less rain, while 26 years after the war there would still be 4.5 per cent less rain. The result of all this would be devastation and ultimately death for hundreds of millions, and perhaps billions. But the researchers hope that their example of a relatively small nuclear war between two modestly armed nuclear nations, India and Pakistan, will encourage superpowers such as the U.S. and Russia to discuss nuclear disarmament. ‘Knowledge of the impacts of 100 small nuclear weapons should motivate the elimination of more than 17,000 nuclear weapons that exist today,’ they write. In their paper the researchers conclude humanity would suffer worldwide famine, deadly frosts and huge ozone losses. The results would be the death of hundreds of millions or billions.

"He was freed from prison on compassionate grounds because he supposedly only had months to live. Now - two and a half years on - the Lockerbie bomber will protest his innocence in 'deathbed memoirs' to be published next week. To avoid a public backlash, profits . from sales will be handed to charities – with the convicted terrorist . himself receiving none of the cash. Deathbed: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi has terminal cancer . However, it has emerged that one of the . first beneficiaries is likely to be a group which has publicly backed . Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi’s fight to clear his name. The move will raise fears that the Libyan will indirectly profit from a boost to the campaign to prove his innocence. The book could also heap fresh embarrassment on the Scottish Government and Labour, whose ministers repeatedly claimed . the decision to free Megrahi, incensing Lockerbie victims' families, was . taken solely by the Scottish Executive on 'compassionate grounds'. But documents have since come to . light showing that Labour secretly helped free Megrahi to appease . Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and . unleash 'holy war' on Britain. Megrahi was controversially released from a life sentence in August 2009 because of his terminal illness. He was believed to have only months to live. Not for profit: Proceeds from Megrahi's book will go to charity . The former Libyan intelligence officer . is the only person convicted of the December 21, 1988 atrocity. The . bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland killed 270 people. Upon his release, he returned to Libya, where he was hailed as a hero. He was last seen in December, . apparently . with just days to live, when he gave an interview from his death bed. Speaking from his family home in Tripoli, he protested his . innocence and asked to be left alone to die from the ravages caused by . prostate cancer. He said he had little knowledge of . the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and claimed Libyan . opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him. Relatives of those killed in the December 1988 atrocity claimed any profits should go instead to those affected by the attack. Frank Duggan, president of Victims of . Pan Am 103 – which represents the  families of the Americans who died – . said: ‘Why not give this money to the people of Lockerbie, or give it to . the people who helped the victims’ relatives? ‘At the very least it would have been less contentious to give it to charities which haven’t actively supported him.’ However, he added: ‘Victims’ relatives in the U.S. wouldn’t accept five cents from him and they know the whole book is really nothing more than a fraud.’ Tragedy: Rescue workers at the crash site of Pan Am flight 103 in Lockerbie, in 1988 .

But last . night Scottish Tory justice spokesman David McLetchie said: ‘The . publication of a book written by Megrahi, the UK’s worst mass murderer, . will only cause further heartache for the families of his victims. ‘It’s . a bitter reminder that a man given a short time to live and let out of . jail by the SNP is now authoring a book two-and-a-half years later, . which further demonstrates the folly of this decision.’ The 496-page paperback, priced at . £14.99, promises to present ‘conclusive new evidence’ to prove Megrahi . was ‘an innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and . judicial folly’. In it, . Megrahi will claim to reveal ‘how I came to be blamed for Britain’s . worst mass murder, my nightmare decade in prison and the truth about my . controversial release’. A BBC Scotland documentary to accompany the publication of the book will also be aired next Monday. Home: Megrahi (centre left) holds the hand of then Libyan leader Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam (in white) as a crowd in Tripoli cheer his return . Last night, a Birlinn spokesman insisted ‘no money will ever go to Megrahi’. Managing director Hugh Andrew added: ‘I absolutely defend our right to publish this book. It is not a statement on his innocence or guilt but he has the right to have his case in the public domain. A great deal more information has come to light since the trial.’ Author Mr Ashton, who has invested much of his own money in the project, said: ‘On the advice of his lawyers, Abdelbaset opted not to give evidence at trial – a decision he regretted. The book presents the account that he would have given at trial and leaves it to the readers to judge.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We do not doubt the safety of the conviction of Al Megrahi, who was found guilty of an act of state-sponsored terrorism and did not act alone.’","Profits from book sales will go to charity that campaigns for his innocence .

"The U.S. has ordered diplomats' families and non-essential staff to leave its embassies in Sudan and Tunisia as protests against an anti-Muslim video continue to rage across the Islamic world. American citizens have also been warned not to visit either country due to the dangers posed by anti-U.S. riots. The announcements came as the Libyan government revealed that Al Qaeda might have been responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the American ambassador and three others.

"A company chief has been criticised after he turned up to work in a new £178,000 Ferrari the day after the firm had announced 45 redundancies. Trevor Modell, a consultant and former director at engine makers Lister Petter Ltd, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, drove to the factory in the Ferrari 458 Italia supercar as staff were still reeling from the cuts. A spokesman for Unite, the union negotiating the employees' redundancy packages, said Mr Modell's behaviour was 'insensitive at best'. Trevor Modell drove to work in a Ferrari 458 Italia the day after 45 members of staff had been made redundant (file picture) The union had previously failed to improve working conditions at the site because the company had claimed it had little money. He added that while job losses were expected at the site, the number of redundancies announced was a 'shock'. The spokesman said: 'Lister Petter has been in a mess for a while. 'The union believes this has been a result of bad management over a period of time.' Unite has said they had so far negotiated that around 20 of the jobs being lost would be through voluntary redundancies. Those getting compulsory redundancies are expected to be told this Friday. The firm, which employs 190 staff making diesel engines and has been in Dursley for almost 150 years, expects to finish its relocation to a facility in Hardwicke, near Gloucester, next year. Asked how Mr Modell could afford such a luxury car at a time when the firm has to lay off workers, company director Pat Comer insisted that although once a director Mr Modell was now working as a consultant for the company. Mr Comer also said delays in supplying critical components for its engines recently had impacted short term working, but denied that this had contributed to the job losses. He said: 'The redundancies are as previously advised part of our restructure to ensure that we are best placed to remain competitive and serve our developing markets. 'The company remains committed to its facility that is in the process of being constructed at Hardwicke and should be available for us to start occupation in the second quarter of 2014.' Mr Modell was unavailable for comment when MailOnline contacted the company.","Trevor Modell drove to factory in Ferrari 458 Italia day after redundancies .

"Shock: Jamie Skinner collapsed during the Under-14s game in Edinburgh and could not be revived . Tributes have been made to two promising teenage footballers who died yesterday within hours of each other. Jamie Skinner, 13, died in front of his father and brother after collapsing during and Under-14s match in Edinburgh. He was attempting to head the ball while . playing for Tynecastle FC against Spartans FC when he collapsed on the . Saughton Astro pitch in the city. His death came just hours after 18-year-old David Paul, who was on the verge of breaking into Hibernian FC's first team, died suddenly in his sleep at his family home in Edinburgh. Police Scotland said that initial inquiries suggested there were 'no suspicious circumstances'. Tributes have flooded in for the talented boys from their clubs and friends, and professional football players. Eyewitnesses said Jamie had appeared to be fit and healthy - but then fell unconscious to the ground and ‘never woke up.’ There was speculation last night that Jamie - described as a ‘wonderful human being’ by teachers at his school - may have died from heart failure, but this was not confirmed by police or club bosses. The club said his death followed an ‘innocuous event’, as he jumped to head the ball, and that his family were ‘devastated’ and had been ‘ripped apart’ by Jamie’s sudden death. A statement released by the club, which is not officially linked with Hearts FC, said Jamie had been ‘playing the game he loved’ and ‘lost his life on the pitch.’ It added: ‘In an innocuous event during the game Jamie collapsed and despite the valiant attempts of everyone at the game, and the ambulance service, attempts to revive him were sadly in vain. ‘Although Jamie was new to our Tynecastle family, he had up until recently been playing for Hearts. He was a prospect that undoubtedly would have had a bright future in the game. Tragic: David Paul, 18, (left) died in the early hours of yesterday morning, hours before Jamie died on the pitch . ‘No words can fully express our grief and dismay at seeing this happen. ‘We can only pass on all our thoughts and prayers to friends and family and hope they will get some strength from the outpouring of love and support from everyone. ‘Everyone at Tynecastle is in total shock at what has happened, and we are sure the youth football community will join with us in also thinking of all the players, coaches and supporters at the game who witnessed this sad event, and the club also thanks everyone who tried to assist. ‘As a mark of respect all Tynecastle teams will hold a minute’s silence before their next game.’ The . club posted on Twitter: ‘No words can express the grief and dismay we . feel following the sudden death of Under-14s player Jamie Skinner, we . thank all your support.’ David Paul's devastated father Gordon . yesterday thanked those who had contacted the family to express their . condolences and offer support and asked for privacy. Support: The manager of Jamie's club, Tyneside FC, paid tribute to the 13-year-old who had a 'bright future' It is understood that the news was immediately passed to Hibs manager Terry Butcher, who has only recently taken over the Edinburgh side. A spokesman for Hibs said: 'It is with great sorrow that Hibernian FC today confirms the sad death of youth player David Paul. 'David, who could play in midfield or in attack, passed away in the early hours of today at his home in Edinburgh.' Hibs . chairman Rod Petrie said: 'Everyone at the club is deeply affected by . this. 'David was a talented and promising young footballer, and a fine . young man. 'Our thoughts - and the thoughts of the entire Hibernian . community - are with his family at this dreadful and difficult time for . them.' Last night Tynecastle Football Club vice-chairman Simon Kinghorn said Jamie collapsed just before noon yesterday, early in the second half. Jamie had only just joined Tynecastle from Hearts FC and that both his father and brother were watching the match on the touchline, Mr Kinghorn said. He added: ‘I’ve spoken to the family who are devastated, obviously. They are trying to come to terms with this awful news and these tragic circumstances. We as a club will do anything we can to support them. ‘They are just besides themselves at the moment. ‘For this to happen at any time would be tragic but three days before Christmas it’s just absolutely terrible. ‘It’s a time when families are getting together and this one has just been ripped apart.’ Mr Kinghorn said: ‘Trained medical staff both at the ground and the hospital did all they could to save Jamie but were unable to revive him.’ The match was called off after the tragedy and as a mark of respect several other matches across the city were also postponed yesterday. An eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The young lad took unwell whilst playing football on the 3G at Saughton. ‘He was fine one minute and then he just collapsed and never woke up. ‘When he took unwell people at the . game started pumping his chest but he never woke. The ambulance crews . took over but he never made it.’ Scottish football clubs expressed their sorrow and team-mates of the young players left tributes on Facebook and Twitter. Jamie's friend Russell Cairns wrote: 'It was a pleasure to play alongside him at Hearts he was a legend, RIP my friend.' Professional football players and sports stars expressed their shock at the deaths. Scotland international Charlie Adam wrote on Twitter: 'Thoughts go out to the family of Jamie Skinner who sadly died playing football today... He was playing for hearts v Dundee. RIP.' Former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler added: 'Terrible news about the 2 young players in Scotland. RIP Jamie Skinner, RIP David Paul.' As a mark of respect, all Tynecastle teams will hold a minute's silence before their next game. Scottish tennis player Jamie Murray wrote on Twitter: 'RIP David Paul and Jamie Skinner. Both terrible tragedies. Life doesn't make sense sometimes.' Mark Wotte, the Scottish Football Association's performance director, works with many young footballers across the country. He said: 'Very sad news and devastated to hear young Jamie Skinner has passed away on the football pitch, my thoughts are with his family and Hearts FC. 'Can't believe another young player passed away in his sleep today. RIP David Paul. My thoughts are with his family and Hibernian FC.' Jamie's school, Liberton High School, tweeted last night: ‘Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Jamie Skinner at this tragic time. He was a wonderful human being. RIP Jamie.’ On their Twitter account, Youth Football Scotland tweeted: ‘Our thoughts & prayers go out to family and friends of Tynecastle U14s player Jamie Skinner, who tragically passed away today.’ Stoke City and Scotland international Charlie Adam wrote: ‘Thoughts go out to the family of Jamie Skinner who sadly died playing football today @ the age of 14.’ Police Scotland confirmed a 13-year-old boy had collapsed on the pitch and was taken to hospital where he died. A post-mortem examination will be carried out.","Jamie Skinner fell after trying to head the ball for Tynecastle FC in Edinburgh .

"Historian David Starkey has defended his controversial outburst on Newsnight which sparked a racism storm following the riots - by protesting that the subject of race has become unmentionable. The writer and broadcaster was condemned for commenting on Newsnight that 'whites have become black', while appearing to blame the disorder on black 'gangsta' culture. Hitting back at his detractors, he said the reaction to his remarks had been hysterical. David Starkey sparked anger as he suggested that black 'gangster' culture had become the norm . 'We will not continue, I think, to tolerate being lied to and cheated in the matter of race,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'Instead of 'not in front of the children', we want honesty.' The historian's original comments prompted hundreds of complaints, with the BBC saying viewers felt his contribution to the programme was 'inappropriate and racially offensive'. But Starkey told the newspaper: 'I thought my appearance on Newsnight was supposed to be part of a wide-ranging discussion about the state of the nation. 'Central to any such discussion, it seems to me, are the successes and failures of integration in Britain in the past 50 years. And it was these that I was trying to address.' Admitting that his friends agreed his greatest error was mentioning former politician Enoch Powell, whose 1968 Rivers of Blood speech attacked immigration, he added that a legacy of the reaction to Powell had been 'an enforced silence on the matter of race'. He wrote: 'The subject has become unmentionable, by whites at any rate. And any breach has been punished by ostracism and worse. Response: The BBC fought back against complaints from viewers that Dr Starkey's views were not challenged strongly enough . 'As the hysterical reaction to my remarks shows, the witch-finders already have their sights on me.' He also insisted he had been trying to point out 'the very different patterns of integration at the top and bottom of the social scale.' He wrote: 'At the top, successful blacks, like (MPs) David Lammy and Diane Abbott have merged effortlessly into what continues to be a largely white elite... 'At the bottom of the heap, the story of integration is the opposite: it is the white lumpen proletariat, cruelly known as the 'chavs', who have integrated into the pervasive black 'gangsta' culture.' Riots: Mr Starkey claims last week's unrest was caused by the spread of black culture . And he defended his right to point out problems in the black community.'If all the people of this country, black and white alike, are to enter fully into our national story, as I desperately hope they will, they must do so on terms of reciprocity,' he wrote. 'In other words, I must be as free to comment on problems in the black community as blacks are to point the finger at whites, which they do frequently, often with justice, and with impunity.' Dr Starkey's Newsnight appearance sparked criticism from political figures including Mr Lammy, who called his views 'irrelevant', and Labour leader Ed Miliband, who said it was 'absolutely outrageous' that someone in the 21st century should be making such comments.",Writer describes reaction to his Newsnight riot comments as 'hysterical'

"President Barack Obama nominated Janet Yellen for the top spot at the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, in a move that would see the central bank led by a woman for the first time if she is confirmed. Obama introduced Yellen as a 'proven leader' who is 'tough, not just because she's from Brooklyn.' He credited the current Fed second in command for being a consensus builder, adding: 'She understands the human cost when people can't find a job.' Scroll down for video... Official: President Barack Obama officially nominated Janet Yellen (left) to head the Federal Reserve at the White House on Wednesday . Historic: Yellen, if confirmed, will become the first woman to ever hold the position and will replace current chairman Ben Bernanke . Yellen had been widely tipped to . succeed current chairman and confidant, Ben Bernanke, who steps down . after an eight-year stint, which coincided with the worst financial . crisis since the 1930s. The pair appeared alongside the President at the White House when Mr. Obama will made the formal announcement. 'Ben Bernanke is the epitome of calm, and against the volatility of global markets he's been a voice of wisdom and a steady hand,' Obama said. Yellen, 67, emerged as the leading . candidate after Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary whom Obama . was believed to favor, withdrew from the contest last month. A . close ally of Mr Bernanke, she has played a key part in keeping . interest rates low to support the economy. In accepting the nomination, Yellen said more still needs to be done to strengthen the recovery. She said the past six years have been tumultuous for the economy and challenging for many Americans. She said that while the recovery is not complete, 'we have made progress, the economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder.' 'We have made progress, the economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder,' Yellen said as she accepted the nomination . It is believed she will continue the work started by her predecessor, when he steps aside in January. The . announcement comes as the country is gripped by a partial economic shutdown and the looming breach of the nation's $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. The . President has criticised Republicans for demanding either changes in . health care or spending policies, in return for paying for government . operations and raising the debt ceiling. Shutdown: President Obama is not expected to use Yellen's nomination as an opportunity to score points . But sources at the White . House said Obama was unlikely to use Yellen's . nomination announcement as an opportunity to score political points on . the shutdown. Moody's . Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi, argued the timing of the . announcement has probably been designed to send a signal of policy . stability to the financial markets. Investors . are growing increasingly concerned over the shutdown and what they . believe will be the larger threat of a default on Treasury debt if . Congress does not raise the borrowing limit by the time it hits it on October 17. Mr Zandi said: 'Markets are very unsettled and they are likely to become even more unsettled in coming days. 'Providing some clarity around who will be the next Fed chairman should help at least at the margin.' Becoming . vice chairman in 2010, Yellen helped to balance the bank's traditional . method of exerting control over the economy through short-term rates, . with the unconventional programs it launched to help steer the economy . through the financial meltdown of 2008. These included monthly bond purchases and guidance to investors about the likely direction of rates. After the financial crisis erupted in 2008, under Bernanke's leadership the bank created programmes that are credited with helping save the US banking system. It lent money to banks after credit markets froze, cut its key short-term interest rate to near zero and bought trillions in bonds to lower long-term borrowing rates. Task ahead: Yellen will be taking over at a time when the Reserve will roll back its support for other banks . Senator Tim Johnson, who heads the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which must approve Yellen's nomination, said he would work with the panel's members to advance her confirmation quickly. He added: 'She has a depth of experience that is second to none, and I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman.' Senator Chuck Schumer, a committee member, described Yellan as 'an excellent choice'. Obama's choice of Yellen coincides with a key turning point for the Federal Reserve. In the coming months it is expected to start slowing the pace of its Treasury and mortgage bond purchases as the economy starts to recover. Boss: Current chairman Ben Bernanke is due to step down in January after eight years at the helm . The program had been intended to keep loan rates low to encourage borrowing and spending. While economists were united in their view that Yellen's appointment was a strong signal of continuity, she will inherit the difficult task of rolling the bank's support without causing major financial market upheaval. DMJ Advisors chief economist David Jones said: 'Yellen is not going to rock the boat in terms of her approach to monetary policy. But it will be her challenge to reverse this prolonged and unprecedented period of monetary ease.' Even after the bond buying programme is scaled back, the bank's policies will remain geared toward keeping borrowing rates low to help stimulate growth and cut unemployment, which currently stands at 7.3 per cent. Few expect to see the short-term rate increase much before 2015. Yellen had long been considered a logical candidate for the chairmanship in part because of her expertise as an economist, her years as a top bank regulator and her experience in helping manage the bank's polices. Before the crisis struck, she was among a minority of top economists who predicted subprime mortgages posed a severe threat to the economy. New dawn: If she is successful, Yellen will become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve in its history . As vice-chairman, Yellen has built a reputation as a 'dove' - someone who is typically more concerned about keeping interest rates low to reduce unemployment than about raising them to avoid high inflation. Her nomination could face resistance from congressional critics who argue that the bank's low-rate policies have raised the risk of high inflation and lead to bubbles in property and assets, such as stocks. Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he voted against her for vice chairman in 2010 because of her dovish policies. He said: 'I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.' Yellen has pledged that when the economy finally begins growing faster she will begin to increase rates to prevent high inflation. Yellen drew outspoken support from Senate Democrats, a third of whom signed a letter this summer urging Obama to choose her. And last month, more than 350 economists signed a letter to Obama urging him to nominate Yellen. If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would be the first Democrat chosen to lead the bank since Paul Volcker was appointed by Jimmy Carter in 1979. And she would also be the first vice chairman of the Federal Reserve to go on and be appointed to the top spot. Dove: Yellen would prefer to keep interest rates low to avoid unemployment . Yellen served as a board member for . three years in the 1990s before leaving to head the Council of Economic . Advisers in the Clinton administration. She . also served for six years as president of the Reserve's regional bank . in San Francisco before Obama chose appointed her to the number two spot . on the seven-member board in Washington. Yellen, like Bernanke, was a distinguished college economics professor before she joined the central bank. She . taught at the University of California in Berkeley between 1980 and 1994 . when the then President Bill Clinton chose her to join the Federal Reserve board in . Washington. She served on . the board of governors until February 1997, when President Clinton chose her to . lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers. If she is successfully appointed to the role, Yellen would not only be the first woman to head the US central bank; she also . would be the first woman ever to head a major central bank anywhere in . the world.","The vice chairman will succeed Ben Bernanke to the top spot if confirmed .

"Kate Bush has become the first woman in history to have eight albums in the Official Albums Chart at the same time. The achievement comes following her return to the stage after 35 years, which went down a storm with critics and fans alike, who hailed her performance as 'spellbinding'. Yesterday, two of Bush's albums reached the top 10 - The Whole Story at number six and Hounds Of Love at number nine - with a total of eight Bush albums in the top 40, the Official Charts Company said. Historic: Kate Bush, pictured on stage last week, has become the first woman in history to have eight albums in the Official Albums Chart at the same time - with two appearing in the top 10 . 50 Words For Snow is at number 20, The Kick Inside is at number 24, The Sensual World is at 26, The Dreaming is at 37, Never For Ever is at 38 and Lionheart is at 40. A further three of her albums are at numbers 43, 44 and 49. Bush is now only behind Elvis Presley, the overall record holder who managed 12 entries in the top 40 following his death in 1977, and The Beatles, who notched up 11 simultaneous top 40 entries with their 2009 album reissues. More than 80,000 tickets for Bush's Before The Dawn 'tour' - 22 shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in west London, the venue where she effectively retired from live performances after six weeks on the road in 1979 - sold out in less than 15 minutes after they were announced in March. Back in 1978, Bush became the first female artist in history to score a UK number one on the Official Singles Chart with a self-penned song - Wuthering Heights went on to top the chart for four weeks, becoming the first of Bush's 26 top 40 hits. Official Charts Company chief executive, Martin Talbot, said: 'Her new live shows have created a huge stir, but for them to help push her catalogue to make such a significant sales impact is further evidence of the love that the British public have for her music, from generation to generation.' Meanwhile, Brighton rock duo Royal Blood top this week's album chart with their self-titled album, scoring the UK's fastest selling British rock debut in three years. Triumphant: The achievement comes following Kate Bush's return to the stage after 35 years, pictured, which went down a storm with critics and fans alike, who hailed her performance as 'spellbinding' Ed Sheeran spends his 10th week in the top five with X at number two, and US singer/songwriter Ariana Grande scores a personal best with new album My Everything at three. Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro slide three places to number four with their debut Stars, while Sam Smith's In The Lonely Hour is at five. In the Official Singles Chart, Lilly Wood and Robin Schulz are at number one with Prayer In C. Maroon 5 are new at number two with Maps, the lead single from upcoming album V. Last week's number one, David Guetta's Lovers On The Sun featuring Sam Martin, slides two places to number three, while Taylor Swift spends a second week in the top five with Shake It Off at four. Rounding out this week's top five are Norwegian duo Nico & Vinz with Am I Wrong at five.","Kate Bush is first woman to have eight albums in the top 40 at same time .

"Half a billion dollars in damages have been awarded to seven women who were raped and beaten for years by a pedophile televangelist who took them as his 'child brides.' They are the victims of Tony Alamo - a charismatic Pentecostal preacher whose massive Alamo Ministries has been branded a polygamist cult. The women described being repeatedly molested and sexually abused, some starting at age 9, by Alamo. Despite serving a 175-year prison sentence for rape and child sex trafficking, Alamo and his ministry are believed to have billions of dollars in assets, mostly water rights in California. Convicted: Tony Alamo, seen here smiling in 2009, is serving 175 years for the repeated rape and beatings of children he had taken as 'child brides' Miller County, Arkansas, Circuit Judge . Kirk Johnson entered a default judgment this week against Twenty First . Century Holiness Tabernacle Church, an arm of Alamo Ministries, after . the southwest Arkansas-based group failed to respond to the civil suit. Johnson awarded the women a total of $525 million in actual and punitive damages. In the judgment, Johnson wrote that Twenty First Century Holiness Tabernacle Church acted 'willfully and maliciously' in causing the plaintiffs' damages. Alamo, now 79, is serving a 175-year prison . sentence after being convicted in 2009 of taking several young girls across . state lines for sex. The victims in the civil case are among the victims . from Alamo's criminal case. The attorney for the victims - now grown women - David Carter . believes the personal injury judgment is the largest in the history of . Miller County and the state of Arkansas. He also thinks he can get his clients most - if not all - of the money. Mr Carter introduced evidence . found during a search of ministry properties in Fouke, Arkansas, . alleging that water rights on property Alamo holds in Santa Clarita, . California, are worth several billion dollars. Carter . said he will register the judgment in California and begin proceedings . to have properties in that state sold to satisfy the judgment. Cult figure: Alamo, seen here with his wife Susan, was a popular televangelist whose ministry became increasingly cult-like. When Susan died in 1982, he built a mausoleum and put her body on display for 16 years . Federal agents raided Alamo's compound in Texarkana, Arkansas, in 2008 and arrested him on charges of rape and child sex trafficking . Neither Alamo, now 79, nor his church responded to the lawsuit and the judge entered a default judgement . Mr Carter said he's very satisfied with the court's judgment. 'It serves as notice that you cannot facilitate or enable abuse without answering for your responsibility in court,' he told The Associated Press. The actual damages awarded to each woman range from $10 million to $29 million. The court also gave each plaintiff punitive damages worth double the amount of actual damage. Those range from $20 million to $58 million. The lawsuit also names Alamo and Jeanne Estates Apartments, which were operated by the church and controlled by Alamo. Rulings have not been issued against those defendants. A federal judge recently dismissed a similar case, saying it should be heard in state court. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey said it would be inappropriate to hear the case in federal court, knowing that the case would have to be re-litigated in state court. The lawyer who represented Twenty First Century Holiness Tabernacle Church in federal court said he was not involved in the state court litigation, and attempts at finding a lawyer who did represent the church in Miller County Circuit Court were unsuccessful. There is no lawyer listed for Twenty First Holiness Tabernacle Church on the judgment order. According to the Texarkana Gazette, one of the women testified during a hearing Monday that when she was 8, Alamo took her to his room and laid her on his bed. He then put his hands up her shirt and down her pants, she said. 'A few days later, he asked me to be his wife,' she said. The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault. She said she was forcibly raped from age 9 until she escaped the ministry at age 15 and had been beaten when Alamo thought she was flirting with a waiter. 'Tony had older wives beat younger wives. They had to beat with all their force or Tony would beat them,' the woman said, according to the newspaper. When Tony's wife Susan died of cancer in 1982, he built this shrine around her body and claimed she would rise from the grave . 'He told us we were stupid, ugly, and that we didn't mean anything. He would cuss us while hitting us at the same time.' Alamo was born Bernie 'Mark' Hoffman to a Jewish family in Joplin, Missouri. From the beginning, he had dreams of stardom. He has one son, born in 1964 to his first legal wife, Helen Hagan. Alamo was legally married two other times. His second wife Susan died of cancer in 1982. After her death, Alamo had her body put on display in a mausoleum for six months. He required his followers to pray over her body and claimed she would be resurrected. Sixteen years after Susan's death, he returned her remains to her family. Alamo was also a fashion designer and merchandiser of some success. He opened a shop, The Alamo of Nashville, that sold duds he had designed. His customers included some high-profile names. Michael Jackson reportedly owned two of Alamo's bib shirts. He also made and sold his own line of sequined denim jackets that bore his label - Tony Alamo. Tony moved to Los Angeles, where he met Susan - an aspiring actress, who helped him found his ministry. Susan's daughter from a previous relationship, Christhiaon Coie, told the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2008 that Alamo began his ministry in the 1970s by inviting hippies to his apartment and 'saving' them. He convinced his followers that they needed to send him money and give him their world possessions in order to be saved. As the SPLC reports, Twenty First Century Holiness Tabernacle Church was 'based more on hatred and financial gain than genuine religious sentiment.'","Tony Alamo, a televangelist who formed a massive ministry, was convicted of beating sexually abusing several girls while he ran Twenty First Century Holiness Tabernacle Church .

"Under fire: Rev Alice Goodman has been criticised by some of her parishioners for placing a bumber sticker reading: 'WTFWJD' on her car . When the Rev Alice Goodman bought a bumper sticker for her car, she wanted something that would catch people’s attention. But perhaps she did not envisage the unholy row that her choice would one day provoke. For seven years the noted opera librettist and wife of a distinguished poet drove around happily with the sticker bearing the letters WTFWJD? on the back of her red Subaru Legacy. Now, however, someone in her rural parish has complained after realising that the letters stand for What The F*** Would Jesus Do? The offended parishioner took a photograph of the 54-year-old American-born vicar driving in her car and sent it to the local newspaper along with an anonymous letter quoting the Bible’s prohibition of swearing. Yesterday, Miss Goodman, rector in the Fulbourn and the Wilbrahams parish in Cambridgeshire, was unrepentant about the sticker and said her detractors should  ‘get a life’. ‘F*** is not a blasphemy, it’s a vulgarity, an Old English word,’ said Miss Goodman, who is married to Sir Geoffrey Hill, professor of poetry at the University of Oxford. ‘My bishop knows I have the sticker on my car, and has no difficulty with it, and I’ve had the former Archbishop of Canterbury in my car, Rowan Williams, and he didn’t raise an eyebrow.’ The parishioner, quoting from James 5:12, had written to the newspaper: . ‘The Bible says: “But above all do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation”.’ Miss Goodman said she has no intention of using the F-word in the pulpit. ‘The sticker is urging people to just wake up and take notice,’ she said. ‘The Gospel that I’m preparing to teach on this week is the  one where Jesus says he comes not to bring peace but the sword. I’ve never had a complaint about it before. 'I would suggest that anyone who thinks it is inappropriate should get out a little more. ‘The important distinction to be made is with taking the name of the Lord in vain and the common vulgarities. ‘I wouldn’t use language like that in church. But that’s why I have it on the back of my car – it’s a different context. 'Harmless': Dr Goodman said f*** is not a blasphemy and is just an old English word . Cause of the complaints: The bumper sticker reading WTFWJD stands for 'What The F*** Would Jesus Do?' ‘And I would say also that Christ came to save us and not to make us genteel. ‘People have a lot of time on their hands right now. I think somebody must have had a lot of energy, animus and busybody-like qualities to photograph this. ‘You want to say “for heaven’s sake – get a life”.’ The Venerable John Beer, Archdeacon of Cambridge, said last night that he saw no problem with the sticker. He said: ‘It sounds like the Rev Alice Goodman has responded in all good conscience to the criticism of this anonymous newspaper reader. Support: Rev Alice Goodman claims the former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams has accepted a lift in her car and didn't raise an eyebrow about her bumper sticker . Controversial: Rev Alice Goodman has previously sparked controversy in America after writing an opera about the murder of a disabled Jewish man by Palestinian terrorists . ‘Perhaps a way forward  may be for the vicar and the reader to meet together to discuss it further.‘Christianity has a long tradition of open debate where people can bring their differing views and share their perspectives.’ Miss Goodman is a former chaplain at Trinity College, Cambridge, and wrote the libretti for US composer John Adams’s operas Nixon in China and the politically controversial The Death of Klinghoffer, about the murder of a disabled Jewish man by Palestinian terrorists. Dr Williams’s secretary said yesterday that he was on holiday and unavailable for comment.","Reverend Alice Goodman put the sticker on her red Subaru Legacy .

"An ancient bright blue pigment first used 5,000 years ago is giving modern scientists clues toward the development of new nanomaterials that could be the basis for futuristic gadgets. Egyptian blue, one of the first pigments known to man, has potential uses in state-of-the-art medical imaging devices, television remote controls and other telecommunications technology, new research claims. Regarded as humanity's first synthetic pigment, it was used in paintings on tombs, statues, papyrii and other objects throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. Hieroglyphics from the Tomb of Nebamun: The wall paintings in this tomb use Egyptian blue, considered humanity's first synthetic pigment, which new research shows could be used in new nanomaterials . Considered humanity's first synthetic pigment, Egyptian blue was used by the Egyptians for thousands of years. The term for it in the Egyptian language is hsbd-iryt, which means artificial lapis lazuli, revealing the ancients obsession with the precious stone, which they prized for its rarity and stark blue colour. Its characteristic blue colour, resulting from one of its main components — copper — ranges from a light to a dark hue, depending on differential processing and composition. The earliest evidence for the use of Egyptian blue is in the Fourth Dynasty (c.2575-2467 BC) and in the Middle Kingdom (2050-1652 BC), it continued to be in the decoration of tombs, wall paintings, furnishings and statues . By the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), Egyptian blue began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects. The pigment was known to the Romans by the name caeruleum. Vitruvius describes in his work De architectura how it was produced by grinding sand, copper and natron and heating the mixture, shaped into small balls, in a furnace. Lime is necessary for the production as well, but probably lime-rich sand was used. After the Roman era, Egyptian Blue fell from usage and the manner of its creation was forgotten. However, after the end of the Roman era, Egyptian blue fell into disuse and the secrets of its creation were forgotten. But . now researchers from the University of Georgia have found that Egyptian . blue can be rolled into nanosheets so thin that thousands would fit . across the width of a human hair. Not . only that, but the sheets produce invisible infra-red radiation similar . to the beams that communicate between remote controls and TVs, car door . locks and other telecommunications devices. Known to chemists as calcium copper silicate, remnants of Egyptian blue been found on the Parthenon's statue of the messenger goddess Iris and in the famous Pond in a Garden fresco in the tomb of Egyptian 'scribe and counter of grain' Nebamun in Thebes, amongst other places. The ancient Egyptians held the colour blue in very high regard and were eager to present it on many media and in a variety of forms. The earliest evidence for the use of Egyptian blue is in the Fourth Dynasty (c.2575-2467 BC). It appears on limestone sculptures from that period, as well as being shaped into a variety of cylinder seals and beads. In the Middle Kingdom (2050-1652 BC), it continued to be used as a pigment in the decoration of tombs, wall paintings, furnishings and statues and by the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), began to be more widely used in the production of numerous objects. The Romans knew it by the name caeruleum, and Vitruvius describes in his work De Architectura how it was produced by grinding sand, copper and natron and heating the mixture, shaped into small balls, in a furnace. Marble statue of Iris from the Parthenon, Greece: Use of Egyptian blue, of which traces were found on this statue continued until the fourth century AD, when the secret to its manufacture was lost . Apart from Egypt, it has also been found in the Near East, the Eastern Mediterranean and at the limits of the Roman Empire. Although undoubtedly an Egyptian invention, it is unclear as to whether its existence elsewhere was a result of parallel inventions or whether its technology had spread to these areas. Its use continued throughout the Late period, and Greco-Roman period, only dying out in the fourth century AD, when the secret to its manufacture was lost. It was only at the beginning of the 19th century that there was a renewed interest in learning more about its manufacture when it was investigated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1815 and others such as W. T. Russell and F. Fouqué. Now . thanks to the discovery of its remarkable properties, Egyptian blue . could be due a renaissance as part of the latest generation of high-tech . nano-engineered devices. Tina . Salguero, assistant professor of chemistry at Georgia, and her . colleagues detailed their findings in an article on the pigment . published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. They . wrote: 'Calcium copper silicate provides a route to a new class of . nanomaterials that are particularly interesting with respect to . state-of-the-art pursuits like near-IR-based biomedical imaging, IR . light-emitting devices (especially telecommunication platforms) and . security ink formulations. 'In this way we can re-imagine the applications of an ancient material through modern technochemical means.'","Egyptian blue was first used 5,000 years ago in the Fourth Dynasty .

"Pardon: Lucille McLauchlan, 47, was 33 when she was freed from a Saudi sentence to eight years and 500 lashes . A nurse who was jailed in Saudi Arabia over the murder of a colleague has died after suffering a brain haemorrhage. Lucille McLauchlan was being treated in Ninewells Hospital in Dundee after she collapsed in her home in Broughty Ferry on Sunday. Her children could not wake her up and she was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was put on a life support machine but died this morning with her family around her, Ms McLauchlan's solicitor William Boyle said. The 47-year-old was sentenced to eight years and 500 lashes in 1996 for her part in the murder of Yvonne Gilford. She was pardoned 17 months later and allowed back to the UK. Her co-accused Deborah Parry, who had been sentenced to death, was also released. Both women later claimed they were forced to confess to a crime they did not commit and retracted their confessions. Mr Boyle said: 'Lucille passed away in the early hours of this morning following a traumatic brain haemorrhage. 'Her life support system was switched off on medical advice and arrangements were made, along with Lucille's wishes, for her organs to be donated. 'All the family are in a state of shock, and they ask that her and their privacy be respected.

"Convicted rapists and paedophiles across the UK are being taken on ten-pin bowling and cinema trips in a taxpayer-funded scheme. The extraordinary soft-touch initiative means sex offenders who are freed early from prison are then escorted on recreational outings. The scheme, known as Circles of Support and Accountability, is already running in England and is being offered to councils across Scotland after an initial trial in Fife. As of July last year, there were 96 local programmes, known as 'Circles' - which consist of one offender and four to six volunteers - operating in England and Wales. The annual average cost per circle is £9,800 and on average, this amounts to £295,500 across England and Wales (including the cost of volunteers) each year. Scroll down for video . Sacro’s director of operations Paolo Mazzoncini, left, said ‘social isolation and emotional loneliness’ can increase the risk of reoffending’ and but Scottish Tory chief whip John Lamont, right, criticised the move as 'a slap in the face for victims' The scheme is based on the idea that ‘our neighbourhoods are not safer places when we reject or ignore those involved in sexual offending’. Volunteers are recruited with the aim of ensuring that sex offenders are not ‘socially isolated’, as this can increase the chances of reoffending. The mentors, who are supervised and trained at public expense, provide personal and practical support for the ‘lonely’ criminals, helping them to reintegrate into the community. The scheme has run in England since 2002, and in 2008, Circles UK, a national body supporting the development, quality and effectiveness of the scheme in England and Wales was launched. Between April 2008 and March 2010, the National Offender Management Service funded two pilot sites in Hampshire and the Thames Valley. For these two pilots, the total annual cost of the programme (including the cost of volunteers) was £415,000. There are 96 'Circles' operating in England and Wales which consist of one offender and four to six volunteers . But last night Scottish Tory chief whip John Lamont described the move to Scotland as a ‘slap in the face for victims’. He said: ‘Perhaps if sex offenders such as these served their full term inside, it would allow the rehabilitation process to have more effect. ‘That would negate the need for these schemes which seem to be a soft-touch compensation for automatic early away days for sex offenders release. 'This is a slap in the face for victims and their families who will not think this is the best use of taxpayers’ money, and it goes some way to reinforcing the impression the justice system spends more time catering for the needs of criminals than their victims.’ They ‘buy in’ the service at an average cost of £9,000 per offender. It is estimated that within five years around 100 sex criminals across Scotland will be participating in the initiative. Volunteers are recruited with the aim of ensuring that sex offenders are not ‘socially isolated’ Paolo Mazzoncini, Sacro’s director of operations for the east of Scotland, said ‘social isolation and emotional loneliness’ have been shown to be ‘two factors which can increase the risk of reoffending’. He said that in the scheme volunteers from the local community ‘form a circle’ around the offender – known as the ‘core member’ under its terminology – to provide a support network for the ‘personal and practical needs of the offender’. Part of the volunteers’ job is to challenge the offender if they show ‘any signs of minimising their behaviour’ and to hold them accountable. Mr Mazzoncini, on a YouTube video released in an attempt to reassure the public about the scheme, says: ‘Should circle members have cause for concern, they will report them to the authorities and they will be acted upon quickly and robustly.’ He stresses that the circles are not intended to replace statutory supervision of sex offenders by police and social workers. One volunteer, known as Geoff, says on the video that the volunteers are there to ‘help society in general and try to ensure there are no more victims’. Volunteers say the circle meetings can be ‘very light-hearted’ – and can even include a ‘trip down memory lane’ for the paedophile. One of the sex offenders involved in the scheme says he was ‘lonely’ and had no friends, but the circle members gave him advice and helped to ‘keep him safe’. He said the meetings were initially ‘a bit awkward’ but the volunteers helped him to ‘avoid risky situations’ and to develop greater confidence. The idea for the scheme came from a similar project in Canada. A survey by the country's prison service found it reduced reoffending by 70 per cent. The Canadian social enterprise project involves creating employment for marginalized individuals, including ex-offenders, young people at risk of offending, the homeless, and people with disabilities. The 'United We Can Bottle Depot' is an example of this type of successful social enterprise project. Since 1995, United We Can has aimed to provide jobs for the disadvantaged in impoverished area of Vancouver through a recycling scheme. More than 700 'binners' bring recyclables to the project's warehouse each day where materials are sorted by 150 employees. A source close to the scheme conceded that the recreational trips for sex offenders were an ‘emotive issue’ and the paedophiles could be escorted to the local library as well as to cinemas and bowling alleys, depending on their interests. The insider said: ‘The idea is to provide support to them as they go about their normal daily lives.’ The sex offenders are expected to pay for their cinema tickets themselves, but the volunteers who accompany them have been trained and must be supervised at taxpayers’ expense. The original idea is from Canada, where a survey by the country’s prison service found it reduced reoffending by 70 per cent. Tom Halpin, Sacro’s chief executive, said: ‘Social isolation and emotional loneliness have been shown to be two key factors in increasing the risk of sexual reoffending. ‘Circles of Support and Accountability places a “circle” of highly-trained volunteers, supported by experienced professional staff, around an offender to monitor and support them with reintegration. It is not a replacement for existing public protection arrangements. ‘This is about keeping communities safe and making them safer, preventing people being harmed. ‘A circle is about working in partnership, assisting an offender to reintegrate into the community with the community as a resource.’","Sex offenders freed early from prison are escorted on recreational outings .

"A woman with a beard that needs shaving twice a day has been trolled by someone who cruelly compared her to the bearded Eurovision Song Contest winner Conchita Wurst. Mother-of-two Cheryl Monks, 32, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 12. She suffers from excessive hair growth on her face as well as other areas because the condition affects the balance of hormones in her body. Cheryl Monks has polycystic ovary syndrome which causes her to grow a beard which she shaves twice a day . But she was left deeply hurt after she woke up on Sunday morning to an anonymous Facebook message containing a picture of bearded drag queen act Conchita Wurst, saying: ‘Did you see yourself on television last night? Can you see the resemblance?’ Ms Monks said she burst into tears when she saw the message and now doesn’t want to leave her home due to fear of further abuse. She said: ‘It hit me - it was more than a shock. When I saw it, I just felt like lying down and giving up. ‘I watched Eurovision on Saturday night and I had turned my phone off. ‘When I turned it on on Sunday morning I . saw the message but by this time whoever sent it had blocked me so it . doesn’t say who it’s from. After Saturday's Eurovision Song Contest, Ms Monks received a message on Facebook comparing her to the competition's drag queen winner, Conchita Wurst, who has a beard . Ms Monks says that when she saw the message comparing her to Conchita Wurst (pictured) she burst into tears and that she now does not want to leave her house . Polycystic Ovaries Syndrome (PCOS) is the main cause of excess hair in women. Estimated to affect 10 to 15 per cent of women, PCOS is when the ovaries don’t work properly and are covered in small cysts. As a result, eggs are released erratically or not at all, causing irregular or missed periods, and often reduced fertility and acne. One of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones (androgens), which leads to hair growth. All women produce androgens. However, sometimes women produce higher levels, or they may have normal levels, but their hair follicles are more sensitive to androgens. 'If excess hair is due to a hormonal imbalance, then it tends to occur in areas such as the chin, upper lip, sideburns, chest and inner thighs,' says Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair. 'These are areas of the skin that are more sensitive to testosterone. 'The hair is also likely to be coarse and dark.' Given the implications for fertility, women worried about excess hair should see their GP, advises Steve Franks, professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College, London and an endocrinologist at St Mary’s and Hammersmith Hospitals, London. 'There may be other problems to investigate,' he suggests. 'Often, excess hair is a symptom of PCOS, but it also can be indicative of less common, but potentially more serious, hormonal disorders, or tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland - the two parts of the body that produce testosterone. 'Many, if not most, GPs will take the problem seriously and refer to an endocrinologist if appropriate. 'Women should not be afraid to ask for a referral to a specialist.' ‘To wake up to that was really hard. ‘It’s an incredibly cruel thing to do, my family are really angry. I just wanted to curl up and disappear.’ Ms Monks, who is in remission from . cancer as well as suffering from PCOS, says she believes the person who . sent the message must know her. She believes the person who sent her the message was one of her Facebook friends. She thinks the person blocked her as a friend after sending the message. If . someone does this, their message will no longer show their name and . profile picture, but will appear to have been sent by 'Facebook user'. She said: ‘I figure it has to be someone I know who is aware of my condition and that makes it even harder to understand. ‘I do a lot of singing and karaoke so I think that is another reason why they’ve drawn a comparison between me and the Eurovision winner. ‘It’s ridiculous because we don’t even look alike. ‘I find it really upsetting that it’s probably someone I see around the town.’ Ms Monks, who spends more than £2,000 on razors every year, says it is not the first time she has suffered abuse. She said: ‘As long as I can remember, I’ve had people say horrible things to me. It’s a constant struggle. ‘I think people don’t understand the condition and so they have a go at me through ignorance. ‘It has made it so much harder to come to terms with it and a couple of years ago I even tried to commit suicide. ‘In the last year I’ve come a long way and I’ve grown in confidence but this has really set me back. ‘At the minute I don’t want to leave the house because I’m so worried people are laughing at me, but I have to go to work to provide for my kids. ‘My kids have even been bullied in the past because of my condition. Ms Monks said: 'At the minute I don't want to leave the house because I'm so worried people are laughing at me but I have to go to work to provide for my kids' Ms Monks is trying to raise enough money to pay for laser hair removal treatment . ‘I’ve been learning to accept myself for who I am but this just shows how little people understand my illness. ‘People should judge a person by who they are, not what they look like. Ms Monks believes the person who sent her the message was one of her Facebook friends. She thinks the person blocked her as a friend after sending the message. If . someone does this, their message will no longer show their name and . profile picture, but will appear to have been sent by 'Facebook user'. ‘The person who sent this is real scum and they need to grow up and get a life, it’s just ignorant and shameful.’ Ms . Monks, a shop assistant from Morecambe, Lancashire, has constantly . campaigned for treatment for herself and others whose lives are blighted . by the condition. She is currently saving towards the £10,000 needed for laser treatment at a private clinic to remove the excess hair. Ms Monks set up the inspiration foundation forum and support group on Facebook, which currently has 7,000 girls and women with PCOS as members. Bearded drag act Conchita Wurst, who secured Austria’s first Eurovision win in 48 years, pledged to promote tolerance as she received a jubilant welcome home to Vienna on Sunday. The singer, whose real name is Tom Neuwirth, was greeted at the airport by more than 1,000 fans, some wearing painted beards and singing the winning anthem Rise Like a Phoenix.","Cheryl Monks has polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess hair .

"The Mars Curiosity rover has found its first meteorite on the red planet – a hefty, shiny rock dubbed ‘Lebanon’. Made mostly of iron, the impressive meteorite is 7 feet (2 metres) wide and could help scientists uncover the reason why most meteorites on the red planet are iron rich. The rock has generated excitement in Houston. On Twitter, the rover's handlers wrote: ‘Heavy Metal! I found an iron meteorite on Mars’, while Nasa spokesman Guy Webster described the rock as ‘huge’. This rock is an iron meteorite called 'Lebanon,' similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on Mars by the previous generation of rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The smaller piece in the foreground is called 'Lebanon B.' The area highlighted shows the strange angular cavities in the surface of the rock . Images of the meteorite also revealed a smaller space rock nearby, which has been labelled ‘Lebanon B.’ Mr Webster added that a third meteorite, which is also about 7 feet (2 metres) wide and close to the Lebanon meteorites, may have been captured in a raw, unreleased image. The Lebanon image show strange angular cavities in the surface of the rock, similar to other iron meteorites previously observed by Spirit and Opportunity rovers. ‘One possible explanation is that they resulted from preferential erosion along crystalline boundaries within the metal of the rock,’ Nasa said. The rock has generated excitement in Houston. On Twitter, the rover's handlers wrote: 'Heavy Metal! I found an iron meteorite on Mars', while Nasa spokesman Guy Webster described the rock as 'huge' This is the first meteorite find for the Curiosity rover (pictured) which landed on Mars two years ago . ‘Another possibility is that these cavities once contained olivine crystals, which can be found in a rare type of stony-iron meteorites called pallasites.’ Nasa released a detailed photo of the Lebanon meteorites yesterday, however the Curiosity rover made the discovery of the space rocks on May 25. They are the first space rocks on Mars discovered by the Curiosity rover since it landed on the red planet two years ago. Iron meteorites are not rare among meteorites found on Earth, but they are less common than stony meteorites. On Mars, iron meteorites dominate the small number of meteorites that have been found. Part of the explanation could come from the resistance of iron meteorites to erosion processes on Mars. Earlier this year, scientists in Hawaii claimed to have solved the mystery behind the ‘blueberries’ on Mars. These marble-sized objects are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the Martian atmosphere, they claimed. Researchers had previously thought that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing over the Martian surface billions of years ago . The tiny sphericals were discovered on Mars by Nasa’s Opportunity rover a decade ago near the Endeavour Crater, and scientists have since been baffled by their origin. They seem to be crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle,’ Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres said. ‘They are different in concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in composition. They are different in distribution. So, we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us.’ According to the researchers, a meteorite 1.6 inches (4 cm) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16-inch spherules over a large area.","'Lebanon' meteorite is 7ft (2 metres) wide and made mostly of iron .

"Pardon: Lucille McLauchlan, 47, was 33 when she was freed from a Saudi sentence to eight years and 500 lashes . A British nurse who spent more than a year in a Saudi Arabian jail for helping to murder a colleague was on life support last night after suffering a brain haemorrhage. Lucille McLauchlan, 47, was sentenced to eight years and 500 lashes by a Saudi court in 1997 as an accessory to the murder of fellow nurse Yvonne Gilford and for the theft of her bank card, but was freed after a royal pardon. On Sunday, her son Zak, 14, discovered her unconscious at the family home in Broughty Ferry, near Dundee. She was taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. Last night it emerged that McLauchlan had suffered a ‘catastrophic’ brain haemorrhage. It is understood she is being kept on life support while organ transplant arrangements are made. McLauchlan and fellow nurse Deborah Parry, 54, from Alton, Hampshire, hit the headlines in 1996 after Saudi police arrested them in a shopping mall. McLauchlan was trying to withdraw money from a cash machine using Miss Gilford’s bank card. McLauchlan admitted stealing the bank card and allegedly claimed Parry had stabbed Miss Gilford, 55, after the Australian told her their lesbian relationship was over. Parry confessed too. The pair later said they had falsely confessed after being tortured, but they were sentenced by the Saudi court and Parry was given the death penalty. However, in a humanitarian gesture by King Fahd, they were freed after 17 months in jail and flew home in May 1998.","Lucille McLauchlan, 47, sentenced to 8 years and 500 lases in Saudi in 1997 .

"Super-sized graves dedicated solely for obese people are set to be installed at a cemetery amid fears of a growing ‘obesity crisis’ – and they will be near the road so the undertakers don’t have far to carry the body. Plans for 30 super-sized plots have been drawn up by council workers after larger graves were requested by funeral directors who have been struggling to haul coffins over long distances in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. Sutton Bridge and Wingland Parish Council hopes to open a new three-acre burial ground next year because space is running out at the cemetery in the local church - where plots measure 9ft by 4ft. Sutton Bridge and Wingland Parish Council hopes to open a new three-acre burial ground featuring the super-size plots at Fields Farm North in Sutton Bridge, pictured, next year . As well as hundreds of standard graves, the authority plan to dig extra wide 9ft by 8ft plots near to the entrance of the burial ground. Parish councillor Vicky Hills - who is leading the project - said the need for larger plots was ‘the result of people not being responsible for their weight’. She said: ‘I think in today’s climate obesity is becoming more of a problem. They will cost more money because we are going to have double plots. ‘It’s the result of people not being responsible for their weight, basically. ‘It was requested by the funeral directors that they should not be too far from the road so they don’t have too far to carry them. ‘If you can imagine you’ve got your coffin as well, then you’ve got your body. It’s totally dead weight, to coin a pun.’ The new . burial ground will last for 100 years and will be situated a mile away . from the current cemetery at St Matthew’s Church in Sutton Bridge. The . parish council expects the cost of the new facility to cost over . £200,000 and is due to submit a planning application to South Holland . District Council. Plans have been drawn up for 30 super-size plots which will be situated near to the road (indicated by the red box) in a new cemetery in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire . While a standard casket typically measures between 24 and 27 inches wide, manufacturers are now producing boxes as wide as 52 inches, capable of fitting a person weighing up to 1,000 pounds . It is not yet known how much the extra large graves will cost themselves - but it is expected to run into thousands of pounds. Councillor Hills said the price to bury loved ones at the site had not yet been determined but admitted the larger plots would cost more than standard ones. She said: ‘We are just waiting for the detailed drawings and then we will be submitted it to the council for planning. ‘It is likely to cost more. It is like aeroplane seats, they are all starting to charge more for obese people now.’ It is not the first council to announce plans to extend graves for larger bodies. In November last year, Rochford Council in Essex said it would be increasing the size of graves in the area to accomdoate obese people. However, Sutton Bridge and Wingland is believed to be the first authority to dedicate an area of a cemetery completely to overweight corpses. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, described the move as ‘sensible’ but expressed concerns that the separate plots could be likened to paupers’ graves and upset grieving relatives. Parish councillor Vicky Hills - who is leading the project - said the need for larger plots was 'the result of people not being responsible for their weight' (file picture) He said: ‘Having a dedicated area sounds like the council will be making the best use of the space available to them so in that sense it sounds quite sensible. ‘But I am concerned there might by a stigmatisation attached to people having to arrive at cemetery to ask “so where are the fat people buried?""’ ‘It’s like the old paupers graves, there are some relatives that might be embarrassed to be seen there while trying to cherish the memories of their departed. ‘But the true tragedy is that these are ever needed in the first place. ‘The Department of Health will try and have you believe that obesity levels are falling but there’s no doubt that the fat are getting fatter. ‘It is a disastrous thing that we are even seeing crematoriums and cemeteries being forced to expand to accommodate larger bodies in wider and wider coffins. ‘But I still do worry for the people who go to mourn who may feel polarised by these separate graves in a different part of cemetery away from others.’ The decision comes after it emerged school children in Lincolnshire are among the worst in the country for childhood obesity. Rochford Council in Essex is another authority which is digging larger graves in its cemeteries to accommodate bigger bodies . Obesity is forcing ambulance bosses to revamp their fleets to cope with obese patients including East Midlands Ambulance Service which has introduced a fleet of 128 larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to 55st . Figures reveal the 20 per cent of Year 6 pupils - aged 10 to 11 - were classed as obese, compared to 18 per cent for England and 17 per cent for East Midlands. In December last year Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council, Staffordshire, installed a new £12,000 lift table to handle wider coffins for obese people. The authority said the decision came after Bradwell Crematorium was unable to accommodate the funerals of 15 overweight people in 2013. Some funeral parlours in Britain have even had to install hoists capable of lifting 50 stone, purchase reinforced steel trollies and increase the size of their fridges in order to manage larger corpse. Hospital morgues and crematoriums have already had to make alterations to deal with the changes, such as installing extra-large furnace. And ambulance bosses have also started paying out millions to ‘supersize’ their vehicles to cope with the growing number of obese casualties. The East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) introduced a fleet of 128 larger ambulances, each capable of dealing with patients who weigh up to 55st.","Plans for super-sized plots have been drawn up for Lincolnshire cemetery .

"Scots tycoon Mary Gorman has been told she must stand trial on drugs and violence charges that could see her jailed for up to ten years. The multi-millionaire wife of Gadget Shop founder Chris Gorman was arrested last year after allegedly performing a sex act on an unknown man in a U.S. nightclub toilet cubicle while her husband watched. Gorman, 43, is accused of assaulting a police office who was attempting to eject her from the Roxy nightclub in Orlando, Florida. It is also claimed that she had two wraps of cocaine in her handbag, as well as drugs paraphernalia. She denies the charges. Strike a deal: Mary Gorman, 43, (left) wife of Chris Gorman (right) was initially told she would avoid a prison sentence if she pleaded guilty . It emerged last month that the .

But U.S. prosecutors have performed a U-turn and Gorman now faces trial. The change of approach was apparently . sparked by growing  concern within the state attorney's office that the . community service option was too lenient, given the charge of violence . against a police officer. Gorman was charged with battery of a police officer and possession of cocaine at an Orlando club in August . The dramatic turnaround will be a . devastating blow to Gorman and her 44-year-old husband, who have an . estimated £45million fortune.

'Mrs Gorman is charged with battery of . a police officer and so was not deemed suitable to take part in the . programme. The charges are too serious to be part of the programme.' Gorman's lawyers are understood to be . confused about the change of heart, given that prosecutors knew the . severity of the charges before discussing the option of the pre-trial . diversion scheme.

"Seen with a young actress who is now living in fear for her life, this is the first picture of the man said to be behind the anti-Islam movie that has triggered  violence across the Middle East. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula – also known as Sam Bacile – was last week named by the FBI as the film-maker responsible for Innocence Of Muslims, which ridicules the prophet Muhammad. The Mail on Sunday has exclusively obtained this on-set image of him with the film’s star Anna Gurji, who says she was duped by the 55-year-old director. Scroll down for video . Conman: Nakoula Basseley Nakoula on the set of the film with Ms Gurji in a red wig . Nakoula is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian. Now living in California, he is a convicted drug dealer and conman who was last released from jail in June last year. The film has ignited anti-US clashes from Morocco to Malaysia. Seven people have been killed, thousands injured and last night the rioting had spread to Sydney, Australia. It was also reported that Sudan had rejected a US request to be allowed to send in Marines to protect its embassy. In California, 21-year-old  Ms Gurji, who plays Muhammad’s child bride, spoke yesterday of her fear of reprisals and how she was ‘betrayed’ by Nakoula. ‘I was playing the youngest bride of a character named George,’ she said. ‘I had no idea George would be changed to Muhammad. I’m locked up in my house. I’m terrified people in the Middle East will blame me. ‘I’m Catholic so they might think I have . something against Muslims. I’m taking pills to sleep. I’ve been crying . for days. I feel betrayed. My face is stuck on the movie clip. People . see that awful film and they see me.’ 'Betrayed': Anna Gurji said she was misled over the film's true contents . Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is escorted out of his home by Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers in Cerritos, California . Ms Gurji said she and her fellow actors believed they were making an action film called Desert Warrior and that Nakoula, or ‘Sam’ as she knew him, never discussed religion. ‘I was told I was to be Hilary, the young bride of a character called George,’ she said. ‘The film was about a comet that falls to Earth in the ancient Middle East. There are different tribes who think the comet is somehow holy and fight over it. There were supposed to be lots of special effects so a lot of the filming was in front of a green screen. It was super low-budget.  I was getting $75 [£50] a day and all my scenes were shot with George against the green screen. I had no idea how it would be twisted. ‘Maybe I’m naive but no warning bells went off. I auditioned, showed up and did my lines. None of us involved in it had any idea there was a secret agenda.’ Chaos:  Smoke rises from the US embassy building in Tunis during a protest against Nakalou's film .

"Angela Merkel's German government 'nearly collapsed' in a row over who should be the country's new president, it was claimed today. Former East German rights activist Joachim Gauck was eventually backed for the presidency, despite Mrs Merkel's deep reservations. The chancellor caved in to pressure from the Free Democrat Party (FDP) led by Philipp Roesler during tense negotiations. Praise: Angela Merkel and former East German rights activist Joachim Gauck (L) appear at a press conference as he is announced as the party's choice for president - despite the chancellor's opposition . Mrs Merkel warned Mr Roesler that he . was putting the coalition at risk by backing Mr Gauck, German newspaper . Bild reported. The German leader eventually caved in and backed the . candidate who she publicly opposed two years ago. But yesterday Mrs Merkel praised Mr Gauck, a rights activist who grew up in East Germany, as he was announced as the parties' choice to be the new president. Mr Gauck told a press conference: . 'What moves me the most, is that a man who was still born during the . gloomy, dark war, who grew up and lived 50 years in a dictatorship ... is now called to become the head of state. 'This is of course a very special day in my life.' All smiles: Mrs Merkel, right, had opposed Joachim Gauck as the candidate for president but caved in to opposition from her coalition partners . The new president was chosen after Christian Wulff was . forced to resign in disgrace after failing in a bid to gag newspapers . who accused him of seeking political favours. Mr Wulff, a close political ally of . Mrs Merkel, stood down after becoming embroiled in a home loan scandal . involving more than £430,000 received from a businessman friend’s wife. The claims are being investigated by prosecutors. If Merkel had not backed down and . agreed to support Mr Gauck, she would have faced a long fight which would . have become a major distraction as she tries to tackle the eurozone debt . crisis. Stood firm: Philipp Roesler, leader of the Free Democrat Party insisted that Mr Gauck must be president during tense negotiations . Mr Gauck, 72, is now almost certain to succeed Christian Wulff, Merkel's hand-picked choice for president in 2010. She . pushed through his election at the time despite the fact many Germans . and the leading opposition parties wanted Gauck to become president. He was nominated by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens for the largely-ceremonial post. But as the row brewed over his . appointment, Michael Kretschmer, a lawmaker from Merkel's CDU accused . coalition partners the FDP of a 'massive breach of trust' that would . have serious consequences for future cooperation. Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder of the Christian Social Union accused the FDP of 'extortion'. A senior member of the FDP, who asked to remain anonymous said the talks had been 'on a knife's edge'. The FDP has slumped to just two per cent in the opinion polls as they have been pushed around by rival parties. Mr Gauck, a Protestant pastor, was a leading figure in the peaceful protest movement that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was one of a number of pastors who supported the protests that ultimately brought down the East German regime, setting the stage for the reunification of Germany in 1990. After the Berlin Wall fell, Mr Gauck ran the state-run archives on the Stasi, earning recognition for exposing the crimes of the dreaded East German secret police. While the president has no power over policy, the person in the role has been seen as a source of moral guidance and can influence the political debate by giving speeches.","Joachim Gauck to be named new German president .

"Convicted: Danny Fitzsimons, 31, was sentenced to at least 20 years in 2011 for the killings. It was claimed he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder . Security firm G4S was warned not to employ an armed guard in Iraq days before he murdered two colleagues – one of them an ex-Royal Marine, a new BBC documentary claims. Danny Fitzsimons, 31, was sentenced to at least 20 years in 2011 for killing Paul McGuigan, 37, from Peebles in Scotland, and Australian Darren Hoare, also 37, in Baghdad in August 2009. All were working for UK security firm G4S, operating as ArmorGroup in the region. G4S controversially failed to supply enough staff during the Olympics this summer and was recently handed a £13million Government contract to monitor sex offenders in Scotland. BBC Scotland Investigates: Britain’s Private War, to be screened on BBC2 tonight, claims that a G4S whistleblower sent a series of emails to the company in London, warning them about Fitzsimons’ previous convictions and unstable behaviour. Signing one email 'a concerned member of the public and father', the anonymous worker warns G4S: 'I am alarmed that he will shortly be allowed to handle a weapon and be exposed to members of the public. I am speaking out because I feel that people should not be put at risk.' Another email, sent as Fitzsimons was due to start work in Baghdad, says: 'Having made you aware of the issues regarding the violent criminal Danny Fitzsimons, it has been noted that you have not taken my advice and still choose to employ him in a position of trust. I have told you that he remains a threat and you have done nothing.' The programme reports that Fitzsimons had worked as a private security contractor before in Iraq, but he had been sacked for punching a client. In the documentary, the parents of Paul McGuigan, whose fiancée Nicci Prestage gave birth to his baby daughter in October 2009, call for the company to face criminal charges over the killing. In the documentary, Mr McGuigan’s mother Corinne Boyd-Russell, from Innerleithen, in the Borders, said: '[Fitzsimons] fired the bullets. But the gun was put in his hand by G4S ArmorGroup. They put the gun in that man's hand. Killed: Paul McGuigan, 37, from Peebles in Scotland, left, and Australian Darren Hoare, also 37, right, died in Baghdad in August 2009 in a drunken firefight with Danny Fitzsimons . Legal first: Fitzsimons became the first Westerner to be convicted by an Iraqi court since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. A whistleblower allegedly sent emails to G4S warning the firm of his criminal past . 'I want G4S to be charged with corporate manslaughter and be held accountable for what they did.' The parents of Fitzsimons were also shocked to hear about the existence of the emails. Fitzsimons' mother Liz, from Manchester, said: 'And they still took him out there? They [G4S] need to be taken to task for that. 'The people who we feel are . responsible, who we hold responsible for putting that gun in Danny's . hand, are without a shadow of a doubt G4S.' 'They put the gun in his hand': In the documentary, Mr McGuigan's mother Corinne Boyd-Russell, from Innerleithen, in the Borders, said G4S should be prosecuted for corporate manslaughter . Firefight: The shooting took place in Baghdad's secure Green Zone where foreign contract workers are based . Fitzsimons became the first Westerner . to be convicted by an Iraqi court since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion when . he was convicted in February last . year, narrowly escaping the death penalty. The former security contractor from Rochdale admitted shooting the men but claimed it was self-defence. The . men had been out drinking and the other two tried to kill him during an . altercation, Fitzsimons said during previous testimony. He also claimed . to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. A G4S spokesman said: 'We are aware of the allegation over . emails but following an internal IT investigation it is clear that no . such emails were received by any employee before the incident. 'We have not been shown any formal documentation which proves Mr Fitzsimons had post-traumatic stress disorder. Off the hook: Last week it emerged G4S chief Nick Buckles will keep his job despite an independent review finding the bungling security firm guilty of 'mishandling' its Olympic contract . 'This was a tragic case and our thoughts remain with the families of both Paul McGuigan and Darren Hoare, who were valued and highly respected employees of the company, and who continue to be sadly missed by their families, colleagues and friends alike. 'We confirmed publicly on September . 15 2009 that, in this particular case, although there was evidence that . Mr Fitzsimons falsified and apparently withheld material information . during the recruitment process, his screening was not completed in line . with the company's procedures. 'Our . screening processes should have been better implemented in this . situation but it is a matter of speculation what, if any, role this may . have played in the incident.' Since his conviction G4S has been roundly criticised for its handling of Olympic security arrangements. Bungling: G4S signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 Games security guards, but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts and could not deliver and the army was drafted in (pictured) Last week, it emerged G4S chief Nick Buckles will keep his job despite an independent review finding the bungling security firm guilty of 'mishandling' its Olympic contract. Mr Buckles, whose pay and benefits package was worth £5.3million last year, had been widely expected to lose his lucrative post over the fiasco. But instead, two of his deputies will pay the price for the group’s failures during the Games. The company’s UK boss David Taylor-Smith and events chief Ian Horseman Sewell have both resigned. G4S signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 Games security guards, but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts and could not deliver and the army was drafted in. A damning report by accountancy firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers found the company’s handling of the deal was ‘ineffectual’. It said the group was ‘capable of fulfilling the contract’ but ‘did not recognise’ the scale of the work, and listed a catalogue of errors, including bad management. Controversially, however, PwC said it was not ‘in the best interests of the company’ for Mr Buckles to leave, despite the fact he was twice dragged in front of MPs to explain the fiasco.","Danny Fitzsimons, 31, was sentenced to 20 years in 2011 for killing Scot Paul McGuigan, 37, and Australian Darren Hoare, 37, in Baghdad in 2009 .

"These incredible pictures show how storms have stripped some of Britain’s top beaches of millions of tonnes of sand - leaving them strewn with rocks and green slime. Experts say the effects of last year’s severe storms is only now being felt along some of the most beautiful coastal parts of the UK. Fistral Beach, Bude and Perranporth in Cornwall have been all but decimated, leaving the British Costa looking drab and lacklustre. Scroll down for video . Storms have stripped some of Britain's top beaches of millions of tonnes of sand. Pictured: Fistral Beach . Fistral Beach, Bude and Perranporth are now strewn with rocks and green slime. Pictured: Fistral Beach . The images from Fistral Beach in Newquay, Cornwall - a world famous spot for surfing - show it stripped of its golden sand and covered in stones and seaweed. Officials say the beach has lost 125.37 cubic metres of sand per metre of beach - or the equivalent to half a billion bags of sugar. The popular holiday spot in Newquay, Cornwall, is regarded as Britain’s finest surfing location and regularly hosts international competitions. It also sits under an iconic hotel which appeared in the film The Witches. Before the sand shifting occurred, Fistral Beach in Cornwall was a popular destination for tourists and surfers . Experts say that  British coastline is only now feeling the effects of last year’s storms. Pictured: Fistral Beach . But so much sand has vanished that the once golden shoreline is now dotted with razor-sharp rocks which are covered in slippery green seaweed and algae. Lifeguards say their job has become harder as the submerged rocks pose a danger to swimmers and surfers. To their dismay, boffins have warned it could take years for the sand - now languishing offshore in mountainous sandbanks and bars - to return. The shoreline poses a threat to tourists with its razor sharp rocks. Pictured: Fistral Beach . Lifeguards admit that their jobs have been made harder due to these submerged rocks. Pictured: Fistral Beach . Similar sand loss has been seen along the coast - including Perranporth and Bude. Greg Spray, RNLI lifeguard manager for Newquay, said: 'The winter storms altered the topography of many of Cornwall’s beaches this year, and the shifting sand has created some strong rip currents and exposed bedrock on some beaches. 'As a result the lifeguards have worked extremely hard all summer advising the public of the hazards and keeping people as safe as possible. It could take years for the sand - now languishing offshore in sandbanks - to return. Pictured: Fistral Beach . 'The beach is an ever-changing environment and lifeguards continually monitor and assess the conditions to ensure the flagged bathing areas are situated within the safest area of the water, and the hazardous areas are clearly highlighted.' Saber Atmen, of Fistral Beach Surf School, said the newly exposed rocks are restricting surf lessons. He said: 'I’ve been here for 11 years and this is the worst I’ve seen it. It was pretty bad in 2005 or 2006, but it’s never been worse than this. 'We can’t go in the sea at any time of the day. We’re having to work around it and try to avoid the high tide by two hours. 'If we did it at high tide, it could potentially be dangerous.' Gerd Masselink, a professor of coastal geomorphology, from Plymouth University said there had been a 'dramatic' loss of sand and gravel from several famous Cornish beaches. Locals have experienced the effects of shifting sand in Fristal Beach in the past - though never this dramatic . Newquay's Fristal Beach was once regarded as Britain's finest surf destination, regularly hosting competitions . He said most of the missing sand has been deposited in sand banks and bars deeper offshore. Perranporth lost 210.28 cubic metres of sand per metre of beach - about a million tonnes of sand. Bude lost almost all of its beach, although some locations such as St Ives have actually gained sand. He said: 'So far we haven’t seen much recovery. This is bad news for tourism. 'After last winter’s storms it might take another four years for the beaches to recover.' Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, added: 'It would be lovely to get the sand back as soon as possible but nature will take its time.'","Effects of last year's severe storms only now being felt in coastal UK .

"It was carefully restored only two years ago and takes pride of place in a primary school’s assembly hall. But now a mural featuring a golliwog is at the centre of a remarkable police investigation after a parent made an official complaint. Margaret Rocha, 43, contacted police, councillors and MSPs after spotting the image during a visit to Wardie Primary School in Edinburgh, as she considered applying for a place for her son. The mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels, features a golliwog . She said she was astonished to see the mural, which was painted in 1936 by RH Westwater and features scenes from Alice in Wonderland across nine panels. It was restored in 2011 with a £17,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). Police Scotland is now investigating the ‘hate incident’ – with the HLF also reviewing the situation. Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city – but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons. Mrs Rocha said she found the image ‘deeply offensive’ and would now look for a different school for her son. She added: ‘I raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and didn’t seem to think it was an issue. It’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall. ‘It’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition, where you might explain what a swastika was or a Ku Klux Klan outfit. ‘It goes back to the American Black Sambo – the blacked-up face.’ Council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons . In the mural, the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the Alice in Wonderland figure in the central panel. The mural and Wardie’s distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles. The school is part of the international Decorated School project set up to study the art and architecture of school buildings, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Experts said they were unclear as to why the golliwog was included in the  first place as it does not feature in Lewis Carroll’s story. They have speculated that it may have been added to promote Robertson’s jam, which used to feature a golliwog character named Golly on its logo. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘Police in Edinburgh have received a complaint in relation to a mural at a primary school in the Trinity area. Officers are now liaising with the City of Edinburgh Council’s education department with regards to this matter. ‘Police Scotland treats all reports relating to hate incidents extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate whenever a report of this nature is made.’ The HLF admitted it was unlikely its staff had inspected the mural, since the grant was a small sum awarded under its fast-track scheme. Colin McLean, head of HLF Scotland, said: ‘The Heritage Lottery Fund supported the restoration of a historic mural based on scenes from Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland at  Wardie Primary School. ‘We will be discussing this issue with the school over the coming week.’ The council refused to consider covering up the image but said it would now use additional teaching packs at the school from campaign group Show Racism the Red Card. A spokesman insisted that the council and school take diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously. She said: ‘The mural is of both historical and artistic importance. ‘While we understand the offensiveness of the image, it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council. ‘Our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multicultural and anti-racist.’ Jeremy Howard, a co-ordinator of the Decorated School project from the University of St Andrews, said: ‘This is history. If you start painting it out or get rid of it you’re deceiving people about what views were prevalent in the 1930s. ‘I think once children are being taught about issues of race, social issues and human rights – especially as they get to Primary 6 or Primary 7 – that could definitely be the time to introduce it. ‘It seems to me to be a perfect tool for that, saying that in the past the establishment didn’t even blink an eye at having this here, but we do now.’ Councillor Allan Jackson said: ‘I have seen this mural before and appreciate this is an awkward one. ‘I can understand people being offended given the subject matter. However, it’s complicated by the fact it’s a part of the history of the school. ‘I will raise this with parents. There is an argument for using it to educate pupils as to views of the past. Then again, at  primary age this might not be the most appropriate time.’ Alan McKenzie of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association added: ‘If a  parent has expressed genuine concern over such an image, then clearly this needs to be reviewed.’ g.grant@dailymail.co.uk .","In the mural, the golliwog is sitting above the Alice in Wonderland figure .

"Ed Miliband came face-to-face with his image problems yesterday – as he was presented with cartoons portraying him as Wallace from the children’s animation films. The Labour leader dismissed suggestions that he has become a figure of fun in the eyes of voters. But as he laughed off comparisons with the film character on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show, it emerged that he is worried enough about his poor public image to have sought help from a world renowned expert on autism. Mr Miliband has also employed a voice coach. It was autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen who apparently advised the Labour leader to make a virtue of his political ‘empathy’ – a word he used seven times in a speech last Friday. Scroll down for video . Awkward: Labour leader Ed Miliband has tried to play down the importance of image, but was handed cartoons mocking his image by the BBC's Andrew Marr . The newspaper cartoons have cemented in the minds of some voters the idea that Mr Miliband is not up to the job of being Prime Minister . BBC presenter Andrew Marr told Mr Miliband 'that's one of you on fire' as he handed over the drawings . Mr Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge academic and cousin of Ali G creator Sacha Baron Cohen, is the author of Zero Degrees Of Empathy, a book which examines how political leaders need empathy to help them resolve conflicts. He said he has had several conversations with Mr Miliband over the past year. Empathy was about ‘being a good listener’ and being able to take in to account ‘different perspectives’. Mr Baron-Cohen was given an advance copy of Friday’s speech. ‘His office contacted me this time last summer. They asked me if I’d meet him because Ed had read my book. He invited me to talk to him about the politics of empathy,’ he told The Sunday Times. ‘I talked to him about the relevance of empathy to a party leader and potential future prime minister. He has invited me to various events over the past year. He’s now starting to use the word empathy. 'It may be that he’s trying to position himself as a different kind of leader. It’s about being a good listener and taking into account diverse perspectives.’ Mr Miliband has hired professional voice coach Paul Jamieson to improve how he speaks, the Mail on Sunday reported. Mr Jamieson, a theatre producer, claims to ‘unblock’ his clients and ‘harness their physical leadership’. Members of the public should be brought into the House of Commons to grill the Prime Minister once a week, Ed Miliband said yesterday. He said he wanted to reinvigorate British politics by allowing ordinary voters to have their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions, or PMQs. Mr Miliband, who will put the idea to Commons Speaker John Bercow, said it would ‘let the public into our politics’. But critics claimed the sessions would undermine Britain’s representative democracy, in which MPs reflect their constituents’ concerns. No10 said it would consider the idea, but raised doubts about how voters in Cumbria, Northern Ireland or Penzance would be able to take part. He is the second theatre figure linked to the Labour leader in recent months. Earlier this year it was reported that Donmar theatre boss Josie Rourke has helped him with voice projection and posture. Yesterday, questioned on his image, Mr Miliband laughed at the Wallace-inspired cartoons of himself when Andrew Marr produced copies on air. Mr Marr said there was an 'Ed Miliband problem' at the top of the Labour party which was putting off voters. 'You have got very poor leadership ratings at the moment. And you enemies are trying to dig into people's heads an image of you which is then very, very hard to remove.' At this point he produced newspaper cartoons of Mr Miliband portrayed as Wallace in various scenarios. 'You are going to show it to me? Brilliant,' Mr Miliband said, nervously. Mr Mrr continued: 'That's one of you on fire... you have clearly bitten someone there...' Mr Miliband sought to laugh it off, telling the presenter: 'I didn't realise you were going to bring me present, that's incredibly kind. I will show it to my kids.' Mr Miliband joked that he was going to give the cartoons to his sons, as he again insisted he did not think image was important . Mr Miliband tried to laugh off the 'gifts' but has admitted that voters have come to view him like the plasticine character . Labour hope to turn the personal attacks on Mr Miliband into an advantage, believing voters are fed up with spin and PR being considered more important than policies. This week a string of senior frontbenchers will being a series of speeches on what Labour would do if Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister next year. But the high-risk strategy has only succeeded in turning the spotlight back on Mr Miliband's woeful personal approval ratings. 'Mr Miliband said: 'I want to find ways to change our political culture. 'I have had lots of people saying to me over three or four years I have been leader ""why don't you do more things like David Cameron"" - things like the photo with the huskies that he did in the Arctic Circle, the wind turbine on the roof, things like that. 'What I have worked out is personally, I don't care about it that much. Of course communications is an important part of modern politics, I'm not pretending it isn't. And image as well. 'But I don't care... It is not the most important thing.' Mr Marr, a former newspaper editor and ex-BBC political editor, told Mr Miliband repeatedly that image 'does matter' in 21st century politics . Labour hope to portray Mr Miliband as someone who is more focused on changing the country than how he looks on camera . But in an extraordinary riposte, Mr Marr, a former BBC political editor and editor of The Independent, said he was wrong. Mr Marr told him: 'You may hate it, you may think it is trivial, you may think it is awful, but it's how things are done now. 'Just as how in the Victorian period you had to stand up and make a three-hour speech in front of 300 people, now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth. 'Therefore it is the job, it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been. 'It is not enough to say "" it doesn't matter"". It does matter. It's the way things are done.' Mr Miliband insisted he would 'keep trying', adding: 'What I was saying was not photos don't matter or I am never doing to take photos. 'It is more what do we really value most. What is really going to change things for people.'","Labour leader has taken on his critics to insist he is not interested in image .

"When you’ve shelled out a small fortune on a pukka pair of personalised shoes, it’s nice to get the chance to show them off. That opportunity arose for Prince Harry while chatting to children at an awards ceremony last night. As he kneeled down to talk to the youngsters, the soles flashed with a capital letter H studded into each one with shiny brass tacks. The shoes, costing about £1,500, were handmade at John Lobb, which is close to St James’s Palace and holds three Royal Warrants. Scroll down for video .

Mrs Hartley told Harry that Carson had four other siblings. ‘I would hate to have four sisters,’ the prince joked.

In a reception at the Park Lane Hilton in London, the prince was also introduced to Maddison Sherwood, six, who gave him a home-made card with a drawing she had done of him - with bright ginger hair. ‘Is that meant to be me?’ he laughed but took the joke in good spirits. Maddison, from East Keale, Northamptonshire, was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy in 2009 when she was ten months old. Her condition causes severe muscle weakness and she relies on a ventilator. When she was born her parents, Lidia and Jamie, were told she would never talk, eat or be able to support her own head – but she now attends mainstream school and can do everything her family was warned against. Mrs Sherwood, 28, said: ‘We asked him how old he was – we had read that he was 30 but pretended we didn’t know. He told me that he was feeling very old. ‘He also told Maddison that she was doing wonderfully and that she should carry on and do what she was doing as she had proved everyone wrong so far.’ Another award winner who left the Harry speechless was Olivia Ruston who presented the prince with an hilarious pottery piggy bank she had made with a shock of ginger hair. ‘Is that meant to be me?’ he roared, ‘that’s just brilliant.’ ‘I haven’t had one since I was a child so I had better start saving my pennies in it,’ said the prince who recently was said to have inherited £10 million for his 30th birthday.

Rosie Flory, 15, also gave Harry a wrist band and cards made from drawings created by her brother, Harry, who died in 2012 from a brain tumour. Rosie, from Bournemouth, became Harry’s own Florence Nightingale and made sure his last months were happy and comfortable. ‘We spoke about how grief affects us in different ways and how we cope with it. Obviously he has had experience of losing someone close to him,’ she said. The prince also admired a tiara worn by Rachel Hooley, ten, from Cramlington, Northumberland, who suffered acute heart failure when she was seven and was given a transplant at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. She recently took part in the British and World Transplant Games in everything from swimming to sprinting. ‘He loved my tiara and dress – I couldn’t believe it,’ she said. Harry met 15-year-old Cecilia Adamou from Cobham, Surrey, who was born with a serious congenital heart condition and has bravely overcome a series of resulting complications. ‘I've had a heart transplant, a kidney transplant. I've also got two brain tumours, and two spinal tumours and some feet problems,"" she said. ""I was told I would never walk again.’ ‘Prince Harry said a lot of people in the Army are told that but they do walk again.’ She too has defied the doctors' predictions and is walking again. ‘Hopefully I'm over the worst it,’ she added.

"A strip club will open for the first time in an Atlantic City casino . A strip club will open for the first time inside an Atlantic City casino as gambling venues try to halt a decline in revenue worth billions of dollars. Scores, the famous New York strip club, will open a satellite establishment inside the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort next month. Although burlesque nights are regularly held in the resort city, it will be the first strip club to open inside one of the world famous casinos since gambling was legalized 35 years ago. Bob Gans, the Trump Taj Mahal's managing partner, said a strip club is a 'natural' next step. He said: 'We feel this is the third leg of the Atlantic City triangle: gambling, alcohol and adult entertainment.' Atlantic City has suffered from a drop visitor numbers since 2006 when the first casino opened in Pennsylvania. In the past eight years revenue has fallen from $5.2billion to just over $3billion as it has struggled with new competition. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the decline that shows no signs of ending. In addition to family-friendly . attractions like a revamped Steel Pier amusement park, the return of the . Miss America pageant and free outdoor light shows on Boardwalk Hall, . Atlantic City has been looking for other ways to separate people and . their money. The seaside resort has a century-old reputation as an adult . playground, so it's somewhat surprising it took this long for strippers . to make their way inside the gambling halls. Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort will be the first Atlantic City casino to have a strip club when it opens next month . Mr Gans is investing $25million in the . newest Scores, which will open September 12 with five private VIP rooms, 11 . stripper poles and an ultra-VIP room for celebrities and high-rollers. Cover charges will range from $10 to $30. The club's Diamond Dollars, which cash-strapped customers can charge to . their credit cards, come with a steep 20 per cent markup: $100 worth of . club dollars costs $120. New Jersey laws governing casinos prohibit total nudity so strippers at Scores can only undress to G-strings and pasties - small fabric patches that cover nipples. Lap dances are . prohibited, as is any simulation of sexual activity. Mr Gans is confident Scores will succeed, even in a city with four other strip clubs, including one with all-nude dancers. New Jersey laws governing casinos mean strippers must keep at least a G-string and pasties on . 'There . are 30million people who come to Atlantic City every year. 'You have the safety of a hotel casino, and we have the right brand and . the know-how to do something that hasn't been done before. We can be the . Pied Piper here.' While . Las Vegas is known for its racy offerings, there are no strip clubs . inside any Sin City casinos. One . pool venture did not fare as well.

"US spy chiefs have been accused of building an £800million cyber base to keep tabs on American citizens. The state-of-the-art data centre in the Utah desert – codenamed Bumblehive – is intended to bolster online security efforts. But former employees say it could be used to monitor people’s private emails. The US National Security Agency, the secretive body that serves the military and intelligence communities, denied the claims. It said: ‘Many unfounded allegations have been made about the planned activities of the Utah Data Centre. Surveillance: The site plan for the NSA's Utah data center, code-named Bumblehive, which has been accused of being built to spy on American citizens . One of the biggest misconceptions about NSA is that we are unlawfully listening in on, or reading emails of, US citizens. This is simply not the case.’ Fox News aired a television report . about the 1million-sq/ft facility on Friday in which former NSA . employees raised concerns that the facility would be used to monitor the . emails of U.S. citizens. 'Many unfounded allegations have been . made about the planned activities of the Utah Data Center,' the NSA said . in a statement. It added that 'one of the biggest misconceptions about . NSA is that we are unlawfully listening in on, or reading emails of, . U.S. citizens. This is simply not the case.' The NSA said it remained 'unwavering' in its respect for U.S. laws and American citizens' civil liberties, and noted that it was subject to broad oversight by all three branches of government. All wiretapping of U.S. citizens by the NSA requires a warrant from a three-judge court set up under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed in 1978. Former President George W. Bush issued an executive order shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York that authorised the NSA to monitor certain phone calls without obtaining a warrant. The warrantless wiretapping programme remained a secret until 2005, when a whistleblower went to the press to reveal the extent of the surveillance. Under construction: An aerial view shows the extent of construction at the Bumblehive site, which the NSA insists will not be used for the unlawful survellance of American citizens . Although the NSA has strenuously denied acting beyond its surveillance powers groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have warned that a bill currently passing through Congress could dramatically increase the amount of personal data that government agencies have legal access to. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) has just been inspected by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. In a written statement addressed to congressmen, the ACLU said: 'CISPA creates an exception to all privacy laws to permit companies to share our information with each other and with the government in the name of cybersecurity. 'Although a carefully-crafted information sharing program that strictly limits the information to be shared and includes robust privacy safeguards could be an effective approach to cybersecurity, CISPA lacks such protections for individual rights. 'CISPA’s information sharing regime allows the transfer of vast amounts of data, including sensitive information like internet records or the content of emails, to any agency in the government including military and intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency or the Department of Defense Cyber Command.' Preparing for the future? Campaigners in the U.S. have warned over a new law, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which if passed could give the government more legal rights to access citizens' data . The NSA issued a news release about construction of the massive, Utah data centre in January 2011, identifying it as the largest Pentagon facility construction project in the country. It said the project would result in 5,000 to 10,000 new jobs during the construction phase, with 100 to 200 permanent employees to work there once it was completed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is handling the construction of the facility. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the centre was due to be completed in September. The NSA is the executive agent for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will be the lead agency at the facility, but the centre will also help other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, in protecting national security networks, according to a NSA news release.","National Security Agency insists the site will operate according to laws that limit spying on U.S. citizens .

"A West Virginia man suspected in four killings in separate shootings was discovered dead in his truck of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a nine-hour manhunt, police said Monday. Jody Lee Hunt, 39, of Westover was found in a clearing in the woods in the southern part of Monongalia County, inside his 2011 Ford F-150, according to state police. The vehicle and body were found about 7 pm in 'a power line right of way,' spokesman Lt. Dennis Johnson said. Hunt was wanted in two shootings in the Westover area and another in the Cheat Lake area in Monongalia County, spokesman Lt. Michael Baylous said. Medical officials will work to confirm the identity of the body, he said. Officials said they would not release further information Monday night. On Tuesday, investigators at each of the three crime scenes will 'sit down and piece all those puzzle pieces together and find out how this all happened,' Baylous said. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Police have found the body of Jody Hunt, 39, who is suspected of killing four people in three shootings in West Virginia on Monday . Sharon Berkshire, 39, was killed by a man police believe may have been Jody Hunt, against whom Berkshire had filed a domestic abuse case last month . Into Monday evening, state and local police had fanned out in search of Hunt, who was believed to be driving a 2011 Ford F-150 extended cab truck with license plate OLK 303. The truck reportedly has a sticker reading 'Rough Country' in the back window and a Black Tonneau cover over the bed, reports the station. State police spokesman Lt Michael Baylous identified the two victims killed in the Cheat Lake area as  Berkshire of Westover, as well as Michael David Frum, 28. They were found inside a home. The third identified victim, Doug Brady, was found dead inside his Westover business, Doug's Towing. A November 7 Facebook post from Berkshire appears to show the very same truck Hunt is believed to have been driving, along with the words, 'New ride for this girl !!!!' According to Monongalia County Circuit Court records, Berkshire filed a domestic violence case against Hunt some time last month. Unfortunately, here efforts appear to have come too late. Court records also indicated there were no protective orders currently in place for Berkshire. 'My actions were not right nor were the actions of those who tried to tear me down and take from me. This was not the plan but a struggle to see that those who strives to hurt me received their fair pay of hurt like I received...You will not hurt me any more. You will not destroy my soul and heart as you tried so hard to do.' Another post appeared later: . 'I hope that everyone takes the words I love you seriously. Be honest with the one you are with.

"Following Apple's CarPlay announcement last week, the company has now updated its iOS software to add the hands-free options to iPhones and iPads. Apple is selling the product as a 'smarter, safer and more fun way to use an iPhone in the car' because it uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features - but safety campaigners are not convinced. Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while . driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as . texting with fingers. Apple's CarPlay uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features. Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers . The AAA Foundation's results confirm the recent findings from the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University. In April last year, Texas researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers. They found both methods impacted . driver response times equally - but it often took voice . recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. Apple announced its CarPlay system last week after adding Eyes-Free technology to its iOS software last year. It updated the iOS software yesterday to make the CarPlay functions more widely available. A car equipped with the CarPlay technology lets a user connect their handset to the system and use their car's built-in display and controls. The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users without Car Play-compatible cars control the system in a similar, using voice commands. While a separate study from the . AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the U.S., discovered that . hands-free kits increase mental workload and distractions, causing . reaction times to get . slower and brain function to become compromised. This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. Cognitive distraction expert David Strayer and his research team at the . University of Utah measured brainwaves, eye movement and other metrics . to assess what happens to drivers’ mental workload when they attempt to . do multiple things at once. Mr Strayer fitted cars with mounted cameras that tracked the eye and head movement of drivers. A Detection-Response-Task device known as the 'DRT' was used to record . driver reaction time in response to triggers of red and green lights . added to their field of vision. A special electroencephalographic (EEG)-configured skull cap was also fitted to the drivers' head and was used . to track the participants’ brain activity so that researchers could . determine mental workload. To measure the distractions, drivers were played an audio book. There brainwaves were also measured while they talked on the phone and while they listened to telephone conversations. The drivers were then monitored while voice-activated emails were played to them directly from their handset. Russ Martin, right, from the AAA Foundation is fitted with an electroencephalographic (EEG)-configured skull cap by Joel Cooper, research assistant professor of psychology at Utah University, left. The caps were fitted to drivers to measure their brainwaves and determine the risk posed by voice-activated technology . Drivers' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice-activated emails were played to them, in a system similar to that used in Apple's CarPlay, pictured. Talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk, but listening to voice-activated features was classed as an extensive risk . Researchers used the results of these tests to rate the levels of mental distraction . drivers experienced while performing each task. These levels of mental . distraction were represented on a scale, similar to the Saffir-Simpson scale used for hurricanes. Tasks such as listening to the radio ranked as a Category 1 level of distraction and were rated as a minimal risk. Talking on a phone, both handheld and hands-free, resulted in a Category 2, moderate risk. Surprisingly, listening and responding to in-vehicle, voice-activated email features . increased mental workload and distraction levels of the drivers to a  Category 3 - and was classed as an extensive risk. Some 35 per cent of drivers admit to . reading a text or email while driving in any given month, while 26 . percent admitted to typing one, according to data from AAA. Russ Martin, pictured, had his brainwaves monitored while listening to his emails being read aloud to him from his phone. His mental workload increased and his reaction times were slower. Researchers from the AAA Foundation concluded that voice-activated technologies pose an 'extensive risk' to drivers . Google Android software already has a special 'car mode', shown here, which lets users access commonly used functions via large buttons . 'There is a looming public safety crisis ahead with the future proliferation of these in-vehicle technologies,' said AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet. 'It’s time to consider limiting new and potentially dangerous mental  distractions built into cars, particularly with the common public misperception that hands-free means risk-free.' AAA Foundation Presidents and CEO Peter Kissinger added: 'These findings reinforce previous research that hands-free is not risk-free.; . 'Increased mental workload and cognitive distractions can lead to a type of tunnel vision or inattention blindness where motorists don’t see potential hazards right in front of them.' As well as Apple's Siri, other voice-activated technology include the Joyride app that lets you play trivia games using your voice, while driving. Voice-activated assistant app Vlingo is also built into some Samsung models. Google's . Android software has voice-controls and a special 'car mode' that . allows users to access commonly used functions via large buttons. Based on their research, the foundation is suggesting a number of initiatives to tackle the problem. Apple's voice-activated Siri tool lets you send and listen to emails and texts from your phone . The Joyride app lets drivers play trivia games while driving and has a built-in media player . The Vlingo app is built into some Samsung handsets and is a Siri alternative . It wants to 'limit the use of voice-activated technology to core driving-related activities such as climate control, windshield wipers and cruise control, and to make sure these applications do not lead to increased safety risk caused by mental distraction while the car is moving.' The AAA Foundation wants voice-to-text technologies such as using social media or listening to emails and text messages disabled. 'This study constitutes the most in-depth analysis to date of mental distractions behind the wheel. AAA is hopeful that it will serve as a stepping stone toward working in collaboration with automakers to promote our shared goal of improving safety for all drivers,' said Darbelnet. 'Specifically, these increasingly common voice-driven, in-vehicle technologies should be limited to use for just core driving tasks unless the activity results in no significant driver distraction.'","Apple's CarPlay system links a smart car's display with an iPhone .

"About two dozen U.S. military specialists deploying to Liberia will test laboratory samples for Ebola, but most of the nearly 4,000 troops due to go there are not expected to be in direct contact with the virus, defense officials said Tuesday. General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. forces in Africa, said three mobile labs had deployed to Liberia and four more were being sought to run tests that would distinguish between people infected with Ebola and those who have diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria. Each lab would be staffed by a team of three to four experts trained to operate in the worst chemical, biological and nuclear environments, Rodriguez told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. Scroll down for video .

Creepy: A stuffed Ebola virus hangs on the wall of the U.S. Navy mobile laboratory on October 5, 2014 near Gbarnga, Liberia. Several more facilities will soon open as more troops deploy to West Africa . The teams operate in full protective clothing. Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva. The U.S. military is ramping up its response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where it has already killed more than 3,400 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Concern is growing that the virus could spread to other parts of the world. The United States has 348 military personnel in Liberia and Senegal working on combating the spread of Ebola. Rodriguez has been authorized to send some 3,900 troops if needed. He said at this point he expected the effort to last a year and did not think more troops would be necessary. 'We're going to stay as long as we're needed, but not longer,' said Rodriguez, who estimated the cost of the military operation at $750 million for the next six months. Many of the military personnel due to go to Liberia in the coming months are construction workers who will build up to 17 100-bed Ebola treatment facilities. Rodriguez said health officials estimated at least 70 percent of those diagnosed with the virus need to be in treatment facilities in order to slow the spread of the disease. Assistant Defense Secretary Andy Weber, who is responsible for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said the Pentagon was working with international partners to ensure there are more beds than patients, aiming to contain the spread by isolating the patients. Ramping up: General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. forces in Africa, said three mobile labs had deployed to Liberia and four more were being sought to run tests that would distinguish between people infected with Ebola and those who have diseases with similar symptoms, such as malaria . Moving out: The 101st Airborne Division (pictured here in Afghanistan in 2013) are preparing to go to West Africa to assist in the Ebola crisis . 'If you've seen the modeling from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), it's on a fast rise. But we can turn it. We know what to do,' said Weber, who is leaving the Defense Department to become the deputy to the State Department's Ebola Coordinator, Ambassador Nancy Powell. 'Over half the people infected with Ebola can survive if they have just basic medical support,' he said. 'So we can get ahead of this, but right now we're playing catch-up because it really started to spread at an exponential rate in August.' Weber said the U.S. departments of Defense and Health and Human Services had been primary investors in the search for drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tools to counter the Ebola virus, including the promising experimental drug ZMapp produced by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. 'Ebola has always been on the threat list of agents that we're concerned about,' he said, noting that rare diseases like Ebola are 'not a commercial market so big pharma doesn't have an interest in pursuing these, which is why the government involvement is so important.'

"A rare frog which was thought to be extinct has been spotted in northern Israel. The Hula painted frog hadn't been seen since 1955, so when it was suggested that the time had come to officially declare it as extinct, few people objected. However, a newly published paper in the journal Nature Communications has just revealed that in 2011 the frog was spotted in its native habitat of northern Israel's Hula Valley. The Hula painted frog was thought to be extinct because it had not been seen since 1955. It has a pocked back and a black belly that is covered with white spots . The Hula painted frog is considered to be one of a rare class of 'living fossils', so-called because they have remained physically un-evolved over millions of years, and have few or no living relatives. It has a pocked back and a black belly that is covered with white spots. It was spotted by Yoram Malka, an Israeli park ranger, who glimpsed it from his passing vehicle and caught it before sending a picture of it to Professor Sarig Gafny, a river ecologist at Israel's Ruppin Academic Centre. Speaking to National Geographic, Professor Gafny explained that he was shocked at what the image on his phone showed. He said: 'Everything fell out of my hands. I forgot about my fever, jumped into my car and drove two hours north to see it.' The Hula Valley wetlands had been drained in the 1950s, just a decade after the discovery of the Hula Painted frog. The frog was spotted in its native habitat of northern Israel's Hula Valley (pictured). It has been dubbed a 'living fossil' because it has remained un-evolved for millions of years . The wetlands’ destruction destroyed the frog's natural habitat and so it was assumed the frog was gone for good. Tests show that the frog is related to a group of amphibians that died out over 10,000 years ago. It was originally classified as a member of the Discoglossus amphibian group, but the discovery of the 'living fossil' has allowed scientists to carry out genetic tests and CT scans and accurately categorise it as part of the Latonia group. Professor Gafny said: 'Nobody ever had a chance to see a Latonia because it went extinct in Europe. ‘The only way anyone could see it was through looking at fossils. ‘But then with every characteristic that you look at in the current Hula painted frogs, it matches that of the fossils of Latonia and not that of the Discoglossus...So this is a living fossil.’","The Hula painted frog was thought to be extinct until it was found in 2011 .

"Since 1978, millions of tiny plastic people have been populating the Earth. And now it is predicted that there could be a miniature Lego figure for every person on Earth in 2019. According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade. A physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the little plastic people will go on to out-number humans . The first Lego figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then, billions have been produced . At the end of 2006, the company . announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence, being . played with by children across the planet. Now, a physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out-number humans. If the predictions are correct, there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of Lego figures calling Earth home in 2019. Lego said in 2008 that it has made 400 . billion Lego bricks since the company began, which is enough for 62 each . for every person in existence at that time. According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade. Here, s model maker at Legoland Windsor puts the finishing touches to a wall made up of over 6,000 Lego figures . The first Lego figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then, billions have been produced, making them the world's biggest population group, according to the company. The mini figure has been modelled after celebrities from Stephen Spielberg to Santa Claus and enjoyed various careers, including astronaut, policeman, racing driver, warrior, pirate, skater and scientist as well as taken on the role of fictional characters like Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Yoda. Lego said that when the mini figure first appeared, it was decided that its face should have only one colour - yellow - and that its facial features should be happy and neutral. However earlier this year, robot experts at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, studied all 6000 minifigures from 1975 to 2010 and found that from the early Nineties onwards, Lego's mini-figures' facials expressions have been diversifying from consistently happy smiles to expressions reflecting greater conflict. The first figures had no sex, race or specific role, as these would be determined by a child's imagination and it was not until the launch of Lego Pirates in the 1980s that the figures were given differing facial expressions. In 2003, with the launch of Lego Basketball, it was decided that the little characters should finally have authentic skin colours as well as resembling characters as closely as possible - as was seen in the Harry Potter sets.","A graph produced by a physics graduate in Virginia, compared human population predictions and the forecast production of Lego figures .

The gas was discovered less than a year ago when Su Geng, 83, reported to authorities a strange smell coming from her cellar. She said: 'They told me after doing a test that there was methane leaking out of the ground. They set fire to the air to prove it to me.'

"A wealthy British banker and his wife have died from carbon monoxide poisoning at their holiday home in Estonia. The bodies of Philip Townsend and his wife MaryAnne were discovered February 24 and local police say they are treating the deaths as an accident. Mr Townsend, 56, and his wife - the couple have two children a girl, 17 and 17-year-old son both at boarding schools - moved into the Grade Two listed Wood Dalling Hall near Reepham, Norfolk in 1989. Tragic: The bodies of Philip Townsend and his wife MaryAnne who lived in Wood Dalling Hall near Reepham, Norfolk were discovered last Friday . It is understood that Mr Townsend, the . son of a Royal Naval commander, worked in the City but specialised in . arranging deals with Russia and the Baltic states. Locals say the family kept to themselves but became increasingly involved in acrimonious disputes with villagers over land and property. In 1996 Mr Townsend is reported to have obtained a High Court writ to stop a neighbour watering her hanging baskets. Mr Townsend has also become embroiled in lengthy and costly legal battles with neighbours over boundaries and water supplies. Villagers tonight spoke of their shock at news of the double tragedy. Sub post mistress Tricia Joyce said: 'It terrible news - this is a very small quiet community and everyone knows the family.' A statement from relatives of the couple released last night said: 'It is with great regret that the family of Philip and MaryAnne Townsend have to report the tragic accident that took place at their home in Estonia on Friday. 'They both died due to carbon monoxide poisoning. There will be no further police investigation and there will be a UK coroners hearing in the normal way. 'Their children are being looked after by relatives in Norfolk and members of the family have been to Estonia. A further statement about the funeral service will be made shortly.' The family also asked to be left alone to grieve 'in these difficult times.' A spokesman for Norfolk Coroner's office said: 'The coroner has no jurisdiction unless and until the body of a deceased person is within this area. 'The coroner is aware of the deaths of two people in Estonia but will not receive any formal report unless and until their bodies arrive in Norfolk.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the deaths of two British nationals in Estonia on February 24th and in contact with the next of kin providing appropriate consular assistance.'",The bodies were found last Friday in their Estonia holiday home .
"Hyundai has unveiled a new luxury sedan that is capable of outsmarting speed cameras. Known as the Hyundai Genesis, the car will slow down automatically if it is being driven over the speed limit. Its automatic braking technology combines with GPS locations of speed cameras to slow the car down if it detects it is in danger of getting a ticket - but only in range of a camera. Scroll down for video . Hyundai's new luxury Genesis sedan, pictured, features smart technology that enables it to 'cheat' speed cameras. It uses GPS to locate speed cameras and then, after alerting the driver to the speed, slows the car down if it detects it is going too fast . The feature was announced by company spokesperson Guido Schenken in Seoul for the launch of the car. If automatic braking isn't enough for you, then the Cruise RP-1 might be of interest. It claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front. The gadget, designed by Kyle Vogt, comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver. The 'sensor pod' relays what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time decisions on where to position itself on the road. It can be pre-ordered and is expected to be ready next year. By comparison, Google has said that its automated self-driving cars will arrive between 2017 and 2020. He said the vehicle is able to track the known locations of speed cameras on the road, although it is currently unable to keep track of mobile speed cameras. The feature might prove to be controversial, though, with some drivers claiming speed cameras are not meant to be cheated, but rather are a safety measure for roads. The car gives the driver a chance to slow down before applying the brakes itself. As it approaches a camera, the Genesis will beep at a distance of 2,600ft (800 metres) to let the driver know the legal speed, reported Drive. Another beep will sound if the speed is over that before the automatic braking system kicks in and slows the car down to the correct speed as it passes through the eyes of the camera. The speed-camera avoidance system is likely to prove controversial with road safety groups, as it may advocate driving fast before and after a camera. Therefore negating the point of having speed cameras in the first place . It can also be used for average speed cameras found on motorways, keeping the car at the correct speed through a region. The car will no doubt be useful for people exploring a new location where they are unaware of the location of local speed cameras. But it’s unlikely to prove popular with people campaigning for increasing car safety on the roads. This speed camera feature will not be available on the first models of the Genesis, which is available from October 2014, but will be released eventually. The Genesis will also come with a number of other features. These include a blind spot detection system to check for cars, a lane departure warning assistance that keeps the car on the road and emergency braking if an upcoming hazard is detected. The Genesis car features a number of smart driving features. The Automatic Emergency Braking system uses cameras and radar sensors to detect if a crash is imminent and, if so, can rapidly stop the car. The Heads-Up Display above the dashboard (pictured), meanwhile, displays directional data .","Hyundai has revealed a new feature of its smart Genesis car in Seoul .

"The average parent will spend £51,000 on their child before their 18th birthday but one mother has decided to spend almost half of that elsewhere. Kerrie Williams,33, has spent over £20,000 on just seven lifelike dolls, while refusing to spend anything but the necessary on her two daughters. Kerrie a mother-of-two from Darlington, Country Durham has spent thousands on clothes, toys and accessories including a £1,000 pram for her collection of 'reborn' dolls. Kerrie Williams has spend £20,000 on her collection of re-born babies . The hyper-realistic toys are made from vinyl and designed to resemble human babies. And they don't come cheap with each doll costing between £150 and £400. Kerrie now owns seven of the dolls, who each have an enviable collection of accessories, and her expensive habit has left her with little spare cash for her two real daughters Karina, 13 and Jade, 12. Kerrie admits that she has to scrimp on what she buys for her daughters in order to spoil her fake babies and that Karina and Jade are becoming increasingly jealous of the attention their mother lavishes on her toys. Kerrie's two daughters Jade (left) and Karina (right) have had to go without new clothes in order to fund their mum's habit . 'My daughters are always asking me for new clothes. I tell them it's a waste of money because they will grow out of them' says Kerrie. The part-time carer's collection of doll's clothes and accessories includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and converse. 'Karina wanted a pair of Vans trainers and was furious when I told her I couldn't afford them. 'She gets jealous because I bought the reborns the same pair - but they can wear them forever.' Kerrie began collecting reborn dolls to cope with a miscarriage she suffered in January 2012. She says that her fake babies helped to comfort her when no one else would. 'I was 12 weeks pregnant when I miscarried and I hit rock bottom afterwards. I just desperately wanted another child. As well as the dolls Kerrie has spent thousands of pounds on accessories including clothes, shoes and prams . Kerrie's clothing collection includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren, Converse and Doctor Martins . 'My daughters were too old for my hugs and attention. They preferred to go out with their friends instead. 'I love my daughters so much, but babies are completely dependent on their mums, and all I wanted was another little one to hold.' The doting mum saw a picture of a reborn on Facebook and instantly fell in love with the child's angelic plastic features and mistook it for an actual baby. 'He had perfect blonde hair and looked so peaceful. All I wanted was to scoop him up in my arms. I was so shocked when I discovered the baby, named Owen, was a reborn. 'He looked so realistic, so I called the manufacturer straight away to place an order.' The first fake addition to Kerrie's family arrived in May 2012, but her daughters and now ex-partner Paul, 35, were unimpressed. Kerrie says that their mother's new interest left the family a little confused. 'I hoped the baby could replace the child we had lost - but instead my family said Owen was weird.' Undeterred, she handpicked another six dolls over the course of the next year - splashing out on Serenity, Wynter, twins Corey and Cody, and vampire babies Lillith and Lilliana. The mum also sold her first reborn, Owen, after deciding he no longer looked realistic when compared to her other dolls. Last December she added a reborn named Till, who was designed to look like the child she lost. Kerrie began collecting the dolls after a miscarriage left her at rock bottom . Kerrie mistook her first doll Owen (pictured) for a real child when she saw a photo on Facebook . Kerrie now has seven of the re-born dolls . Following her purchase of Owen Kerrie picked out a further six dolls over that year including the twins (left), Corey (right) Cody . Kerrie has baby Till designed to look like the child she lost . Kerrie has also purchased two 'vampire babies' complete with fangs Lillian (left) and Lillith (right) 'I provided the designer with my features and Paul's too' says Kerrie who adds that rather than solving her marital issues Till drove her and her partner further apart. 'I hoped Till would bring us closer together, but instead Paul became very uncomfortable with the dolls and banned them from sleeping in our bedroom. 'We split up soon after Till arrived.' Single Kerrie often takes her babies out in one of their four pushchairs, visiting the local park, or ASDA superstore to try on baby clothes. Despite the babies being entirely fake Kerrie says that the public like to interact with them. 'I love getting the babies dressed up and taking them shopping around town with me. 'Most of the time people are lovely to them - they like to ask me how they're getting on.' Occasionally Kerrie is met with harsh criticism from people who find her obsession odd. 'Usually people believe they're real babies unless I tell them otherwise but sometimes I hear strangers laughing at me. 'They taunt the babies and say they look like dead children, but I think my babies are beautiful.' One set of Kerrie's dolls have even began to frighten her daughters as they take the form of a Halloween character . 'I have two vampire babies, named Lillith and Lilliana. The moment I saw them I knew they had to live with me. Kerrie often takes her dolls to the supermarket in their prams and says that many people mistake them for real babies . Kerrie had a doll designed to look just like her eldest daughter Karina (right) but Karina says she thinks it looks scary . Serenity has been designed to look as though she is laughing . 'My daughters find them scary but they're as special to me as real children.' With four moses baskets, four prams and more than 50 pairs of shoes, Kerrie's daughters have had to get used to sharing their home. 'I know the girls are jealous because I've spent twice as much on the babies.' But the reborn addict's plan to help her daughter Karina fall in love with her plastic brothers and sisters failed. Kerrie purchased a new baby, named Saffron, in July designed to look exactly like her eldest daughter, which she hoped would bring the family closer, however Karina was unimpressed. 'I designed a special doll to look just like Karina did as a baby and I hoped she'd bring us closer together as a family. 'But Karina doesn't like her and thinks she's ugly.' However this has not deterred Kerrie who is now in the process of designing her latest doll to look like her younger daughter Jade. Kerrie says that although she spends more on her fake babies they will never be more loved than her actual daughters, however this is not going to stop her spoiling them. 'Reborn babies can never replace how special my real children are, but I still love my dolls - no matter what anyone thinks. 'They're always worth spoiling - babies this perfect are worth every penny.' Although the dolls already take up all the spare room in her house, Kerrie has plans to expand her plastic brood and in December, doll Megan will join the clan. It was her interest in dolls that eventually led to the break down of her marriage with her husband leaving shortly after she bought home Ti . Although Kerrie says that her dolls will never make up for what she lost they have provided her with some comfort when no one else could .","Kerrie Williams has spent thousands of pounds on lifelike 'reborn' dolls .

"Former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover feared Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so much he sent the civil rights leader an anonymous letter urging him to commit suicide, it has emerged. A new book has chronicled how the FBI under Hoover classified King as 'the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country' and went to extreme lengths - including breaking in and bugging his home, office and hotel rooms - to destroy him and his work to bring about racial equality. After delivering his 'I Have A Dream Speech' at the 1963 March on Washington, the government's interest in the leader intensified and Hoover allocated significant resources to monitoring King's movements and eavesdropping on his conversations, according to 'The Burglary: the Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI.' Targeted by the FBI: Former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover feared Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., pictured, so much he sent the civil rights leader an anonymous letter urging him to commit suicide, it has emerged . The FBI was apparently looking for a communist party connection - which is how they got permission from Attorney General Robert Kennedy - however the only information they garnered was about the reverend’s extramarital affairs. When Hoover learned King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, he stepped up his attack, instructing his agents to send King an anonymous note in which they threatened to divulge details about his affairs if he didn't take his own life. 'King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes,' the nasty note read. 'You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that. You could not believe in God... Clearly you don't believe in any personal moral principles.' Attack: When J. Edgar Hoover, pictured, learned King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, he stepped up his attack . It then went on: 'King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is.... You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.' The agents told him he had just 34 days in which to 'do it.' In the book, journalist and author Betty Medsger details Hoover's intense loathing of King and his overzealous violation of the reverend’s privacy. 'Hoover's attitude toward King can be described as a nearly savage hatred... The plot involved office break-ins, use of informers, mail opening, wiretapping, and bugging of King's office, home, and hotel rooms,' she writes. This almost fanatical obsession with King is disclosed in tens of thousands of FBI memos from the 1960s. The Bureau itself said the investigation was 'aimed at neutralizing King as an effective Negro leader.' Not only was the leader tracked incessantly but his associates were watched closely also. But Hoover's particular contempt for King is also clear in the memos the FBI boss kept in his personal files. According to CNN, he would scrawl things like 'this is disgusting' and 'astounding' across the bottom of positive news stories about King's success.","Former FBI director J.

"60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial led by Oxford University scientists . Britons are to be the first in the world to test a new vaccine against the deadly ebola virus. Altogether 60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial led by Oxford University scientists. If the vaccine performs as well in humans as in monkeys, the trial will be extended to 80 people in The Gambia and in Mali. The entire trial programme is being fast-tracked – subject to ethical approval – with the intention of using the vaccine in people at high risk in West Africa early next year. Latest figures show that more than 1,550 people have died from the virus, with more than 3,000 confirmed cases - mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago and the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts the outbreak will last for many months, affecting at least 20,000 people. At present there is no vaccine to prevent the disease and no proven treatment. The new vaccine contains a single ebola virus protein from the strain sweeping West Africa – anyone inoculated with it cannot develop the disease itself. It is different from the experimental medicine ZMapp being used to treat William Pooley, the first Briton to contract the virus while working as a nurse at a remote health centre in Sierra Leone. The 29-year-old is currently in isolation at London’s Royal Free Hospital. The new trial will be led by Professor Adrian Hill, of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, which has unprecedented experience in carrying out trials using similar types of vaccine. He said the speed with which arrangements had been made was unparalleled in 20 years of experience in the field. He said: ‘The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response. ‘In recent years, similar investigational vaccines have safely immunised infants and adults against a range of diseases including malaria, HIV and Hepatitis C. ‘We, and all our partners on this project, are optimistic that this candidate vaccine may prove useful against ebola.’ The vaccine is being co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, along with a dual vaccine containing proteins against both West Africa and Sudan strains of ebola which is being trialled in the US. The UK initiative is backed by a £2.8 million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development. The consortium’s funding will also enable GSK to begin manufacturing up to around 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine at the same time as the initial clinical trials. Scroll down for video . The new vaccine is different from the experimental medicine ZMapp being used to treat William Pooley, the first Briton to contract the virus while working as a nurse at a remote health centre in Sierra Leone . If the trials are successful stocks could then be made available immediately by GSK to the WHO to create an emergency immunisation programme for high-risk communities. Each set of volunteers will be split into groups of 20 that will receive different doses of the vaccine so researchers can evaluate the best dose to use in terms of both safety and activity. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people, the World Health Organisation has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease. The United Nations health agency issued plans to combat the outbreak in four West African nations - Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - where it said the actual number of cases could already be two to four times higher than the reported 3,069. The current death toll stands at 1,552. Describing plans to tackle the West African outbreak, the WHO said: 'This roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two-four fold higher than that currently reported.' The deadly West African outbreak that began in Guinea in March and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, requires a massive and coordinated international response, the WHO said. It is being tested here and in West Africa to take account of differences between the different populations that might affect safety or immune response. Prof Hill said successful completion of both stages of the trial in healthy volunteers could mean the vaccine is ready for large-scale use early in 2015. He said results from studies in monkeys suggest a good safety profile from the single ebola virus protein, which produced high levels of antibodies and immune-boosting white blood cells. As it does not contain infectious virus material, it cannot cause a person who is vaccinated to become infected with ebola. The duration of response could only be discovered in ‘real-life’ situations but even if it only lasted a few months it would be enough to contain outbreaks, he said. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: ‘This epidemic has shown how difficult it can be to control ebola. ‘How useful drugs and vaccines might be in complementing existing public health interventions can only be assessed in epidemics. ‘The initial safety work we’re announcing today with our international partners will hopefully make that possible during this crisis and for inevitable future epidemics.’ Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies said she was pleased GSK had chosen the UK to apply for the first phase of human testing for the vaccine.","60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in Oxford trial .

"Hillary Clinton has stuck by her defense of the prisoner exchange that led to the release of Bowe Bergdahl saying that the priority was to get the American soldier back no matter what led to his capture. ‘We want to get an American home, whether they fell off the ship because they were drunk or they were pushed or they jumped, we try to rescue everybody,’ she said in an interview with NBC as part of her book tour. 'That's part of who we are, and that sets us apart from a lot of other countries in the world who cheapen life, who don't care.' Explaining the process: Hillary Clinton reportedly initially refused a similar plan to exchange prisoners for Bergdahl but now she is reiterating the White House' defense of the swap . The flippant remark comes as a debate rages on about the lengths to which the administration went to rescue Bergdahl who is believed to have willingly left the base and deserted his Army mission in Afghanistan before being captured by the Taliban in 2009. She also elaborated about the five Taliban leaders who were released from Guantanamo Bay, saying that in spite of the outcry from both the public and political leaders, she does not think that American safety has been put in jeopardy as a result of their release. ‘These five guys are not a threat to the United States,’ she told NBC’s Cynthia McFadden. ‘They are a threat to the safety and security of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's up to those two countries to make the decision once and for all that these are threats to them. So I think we may be kind of missing the bigger picture here.’ Principle: Clinton says that the Bergdahl swap was necessary to keep up the American adage of getting all military personnel home . This comes after it was revealed that while she was Secretary of State, Clinton opposed the idea of a prisoner swap for Bergdahl because she did not trust the terrorist groups that they would undoubtedly return to once released. Her aides have contradicted those reports, and she has remained publicly supportive of the move. Her spokesman Nick Merrill said specifically that she ‘set a high bar and insisted on strict conditions for any deal’, offering that as an insight into why no such swap took place under her tenure. ‘You don't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There's a lot that you don't want to have happen. On the other hand you also don't want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to die in captivity,’ she said last week. ‘This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen - is an American citizen - was serving in our military... The idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform, I think is a very noble one.’ Making the rounds: Clinton's interview is one in a series of public appearances to promote her book, and on Wednesday she was in Chicago sharing the stage with Rahm Emanual, the city's mayor who used to work for her husband . Her interview comes as part of the publicity roll out for her book Hard Choices, which went on sale Tuesday. The NBC interview aired Tuesday night and just hours later, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was seated in front of the House Armed Services Committee to testify about his knowledge of the planning process of the prisoner exchange- specifically answering why the administration did not notify Congressional leaders 30 days before Bergdahl was released. ‘Time was not on our side,’ Hagel said during his testimony Wednesday morning. 'Since the time he went missing we've been looking for ways to get him back. 'This was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him.'","Hillary Clinton defends the White House's decision to swap five Taliban leaders for Bowe Bergdahl .

"It is well known that chimpanzees use tools, much like humans. But now experts have found that West African chimps in Guinea have a favourite tool set for catching their staple food of ants. They search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots, called Alchornea hirtella, which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants, new research reveals. Scroll down for videos . West African chimps have a favourite tool set for catching their staple food of ants. They search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots, called Alchornea hirtella, which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants (pictured) The plant provides the animals with two different types of tool - a thicker shoot for ‘digging’ and a more slender tool for 'dipping'. When they have found an army ant colony, chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects. They then dip the second tool into the nest, causing the angry ants to swarm up it. Once the slender shoot is covered in ants, the chimpanzees pull it out and wipe their fingers along it, scooping up the ants until they have a substantial handful that they eat in one motion. This technique, called ant dipping, was previously believed to be a last resort for the hungry apes, which they only exploited when their preferred food of fruit couldn't be found. But the latest study, based on over ten years of data, shows that army ants are a staple in the chimpanzee diet which are eaten all year round regardless of available sources of fruit. It has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for over 50 years. In 1960, Jane Goodall witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground. This was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose, other than humans. It was later found that the Gombe chimps use twigs, leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed, drink, clean themselves, reach other objects and to fashion weapons. In communities outside Gombe national park, communities make different tools. Chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels. They have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells. Adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make-shift spears to intimidate rivals. This study says that chimps use  shoots from Alchornea hirtella to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way. It is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees. This may be because the ants are a source of protein and fats, according to Kathelijne Koops from the University of Cambridge, who published the findings in the American Journal of Primatology. ‘Ant dipping is a remarkable feat of problem-solving on the part of chimpanzees,’ said Dr Koops. ‘If they tried to gather ants from the ground with their hands, they would end up horribly bitten with very little to show for it. But by using a tool set, preying on these social insects may prove as nutritionally lucrative as hunting a small mammal - a solid chunk of protein.’ If Alchornea hirtella is nowhere to be found, the chimps will fashion tools from other plants, and they spend a long time looking for their preferred shrub. Previous research has shown that chimpanzees will select longer tools for faster, more aggressive types of army ants. The average 'dipping' tool length across the study was 25 inches (64cm), but some were selected that were 30 inches (76cm) long. Dr Koops is investigating how chimpanzees acquire knowledge of such sophisticated techniques. ‘Scientists have been working on ruling out simple environmental and genetic explanations for group differences in behaviours, such as tool use, and the evidence is pointing strongly towards it being cultural,’ she explained. ‘They probably learn tool use behaviours from their mother and others in the group when they are young.’ The research for the ant-dipping study - which took place in Guinea's Nimba Mountains - proved challenging, as the chimpanzees were not used to people. When they have found an army ant colony, chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects. They then dip the second tool into the nest, causing the angry ants to swarm up it . The team acted like archaeologists, studying 'exploited' ants nests to measure abandoned tool sets and ‘sifting through faeces for ant heads’. To study these illusive creatures further, Dr Koops set up cameras to film the chimps using the tools extensive video footage of the chimpanzees and their tool use. She even filmed a chimp making a tool to investigate the camera. Dr Koops said: ‘This study is part of a big ongoing research project. The next stages will involve looking at social opportunities to learn: how much time do youngsters spend within arm's length of other individuals, how much time do they spend close to their mother, as well as innate predispositions to explore and engage with objects.’ ‘By studying our closest living relatives we gain a window into the evolutionary past which allows us to shed light on the origins of human technology and material culture,' she added.","West African chimps use Alchornea hirtella shoots to hunt army ants .

"If mankind does ever become embroiled in a Terminator-style 'war against the machines', we're really going to have to start doing a few more press-ups. Researchers have developed a robotic muscle, an incredible thousand times more powerful than that of a human and capable of hurling an object 50 times heavier than itself. The breakthrough relies on a material called vanadium dioxide which has a unique ability to change its size, shape and structure when heated. Scroll down for video . Robo muscle: The 'micro-bimorph dual coil' developed by U.S. scientists that can hurl an object 50 times heavier than itself . A team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in U.S. have used vanadium to build a torsional motor which works just like a human muscle, except it is far faster and more powerful. The vanadium muscle is capable of catapulting extremely heavy objects over five times its own length in just 60 milliseconds. But there's no need to worry about hoards of Herculean robots rising up and taking over the world just yet, the proto-type robo muscle is only micro-sized. Study leader, Junqiao Wu told nanowerk.com 'We've created a micro-bimorph dual coil that functions as a powerful torsional muscle, driven thermally or electro-thermally by the phase transition of vanadium dioxide. Outclassed: Even the likes of Olympic Gold medalist Jessica Ennis can't compete with the awesome power of the robotic muscle . 'Using a simple design and inorganic materials, we achieve superior performance in power density and speed over the motors and actuators now used in integrated micro-systems.' What makes Vanadium dioxide so unique is that it is an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor when it hits 67C, a bit like plastic transforming into metal. The scientists hope that this remarkable ability can be harnessed to create far more energy efficient electronic and optical devices. When heated, vanadium dioxide crystals change their structural form rapidly, both contracting and expanding at the same time. It is this particular trait that the researchers have harnessed to create the robo-muscle. Dr Wu explains: 'Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system. 'The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape. 'This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion. 'With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space.'","Breakthrough made by team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .

"A painting of Britain's fattest ever cow which gained celebrity status during the 19th century is expected to fetch £6,000 at auction. The Craven Heifer became a national phenomenon and toured the country after being deliberately fattened up by her vicar owner. The Reverend William Carr fed her . relentlessly for five years until she weighted 312 . stone and 11ft 4ins in length and over 7ft in height. Her record for the heaviest cow in Britain still stands 200 years later. Giant: The 1811 portrait of the 312 stone Craven Heifer is expected to sell for £6,000 at auction . The painting he commissioned in 1811 by an unknown artist has been owned by a private collector for the past 25 years and is now being sold by auctioneers Bonhams. Alistair Laird, director of paintings and prints department, said: 'The Craven Heifer was so big that a . special door twice the width of the other cows had to be built to get . her in and out of the cow shed. 'It was quite common for farmers to commission paintings of over-sized animals to advertise advances in breeding techniques. 'A huge number of prints were made from the original painting of the Craven Heifer, which led to her to became very famous.' The cow was sold to wealthy landowner John Watkinson for the equivalent sum of £10,000. He took her on a tour of towns and cities in England and thousands of people came to see her. Mr Laird said: 'In the 19th century agriculture played a much larger role in the economy than it does now. 'Farm . animals, especially cattle and pigs, were just fed and fed until they . got bigger and bigger and some of them reached huge proportions. Celebrity: Such was the fame of the Craven Heifer that a number of pubs were named after her . Prince Charles even supped a pint during a visit to the Craven Heifer Hotel in Stainforth in 2001 . 'After being sold for 200 pounds, an incredibly large fee for the time, she went on a tour around the country and people were charged to look at her. 'This was in the days before the RSPCA and TV and if there was an enormous animal coming to town then people would come and see it.' The heifer was born in 1807 in Bolton Abbey, in Craven, North Yorkshire, and lived for five years. Such was the cow's fame that pubs across England were named after her. At least three still exist today in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and Colne and Rossendale, in Lancashire. A second similar oil painting showing an over-sized pig is also being sold at the same auction on January 29. The creature was painted by E.S England after it won a 'fat stock' show in Leeds in 1906.","The Craven Heifer weighed 312 stone and toured the country in the 1800s .

"Controversial celebrity chef Paula Deen made her loyal fans in Tennessee wait hours outside for her to arrive and open her latest store on Friday, as she begins her comeback tour following her racism scandal. Many arrived long before the Paula Deen Store in Gatlinburg was due to open at 8am, standing around patiently for a glimpse of their favorite Southern chef. When Savannah native Deen finally arrived, she was presented with the original stove she cooked on in her first TV show and took a tour inside after belatedly greeting the public. Late arrival: Celebrity chef Paula Deen made her fans wait for hours for her arrival to her eponymous new store in Galinburg, Tennessee . 'Oh my gosh it's been so long since I've seen it,' said Deen who will be starting a 20-city speaking tour this month across the South. 'And nobody could see it, but I had two little boys playing at my feet as I stood up at this stove and cooked. 'I had two little boys playing with their cars and their soldiers playing at my feet.' Deen said she is excited about her new store and fans agreed according to Local 8 News. 'She's been a true inspiration to me for so long. I've been collecting all her cookware stuff for about five years now,' said Austin Dalton from Grainger County. After making her fans wait for hours last week, Deen took a tour of the store, whose grand opening is on June 20. Gift: Deen arrived in Gatlinburg with a $10,000 check to the Boys & Girls Club of the Smoky Mountains. She says she plans to give back to the communities where she does business . She will also begin her Paula Deen Live shows on June 21 and 22 in Pigeon Forge - which will be the start of a 20-city speaking tour as part of her attempt to resurrect her career following accusations of racism. Members of the public will pay anywhere up to $211 for tickets and she will be joined by her husband Michael on stage at the start of the tour. 'The crowd just loves him. He's an integral part of the show. And he will put me in my place in a New York minute! We have so much fun bantering back and forth with each other,' she said. So far, seven of the 20 talks have been announced, and are scattered between Tennessee, Texas and her hometown of Savannah, Georgia. The kick off in Pigeon Forge comes as little surprise since Deen is in the process of having a $20million restaurant built in the resort area. The rest of the tour dates will be unveiled later this week, but they are expected to remain below the Mason-Dixon line, with stops in Nashville, Tennessee and San Antonia, Texas. 'When I step out onstage, it's the most amazing feeling, y'all. I feel so alive when I walk on that stage, and I love that kind of adrenaline rush,' she told The Miami New Times. 'By going on tour, I can see all my amazing fans in different cities across the United States.' Back in the (virtual) kitchen: Paula Deen has announced a 20-show cooking tour that will kick off this summer as the latest leg in her comeback campaign (pictured at a food festival in Miami this February) Tickets go on sale Thursday May 1 and the super fans who are willing to pay three-digit ticket prices to see the 67-year-old chef will get extra access to photo opportunities, meet-and-greets, and extra receptions featuring her signature recipes. The tour is just the latest in an increasingly busy schedule for Deen, who lost her Food Network show and millions in corporate sponsorships after she admitted in a deposition that she had previously used the n-word. Earlier this month, she spoke about how she was able to launch her business in Savannah at a conference for the town's tourism board. She was wearing a removable boot brace at the time, explaining how her dog had inadvertently jumped on her and caused her to break her foot. In February, she announced that a private equity investment firm poured $75million to $100million into her brand, banking on her prospects of bouncing back.","Disgraced celebrity chef made fans wait in line for hours the Paula Deen Store in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, on Friday .

"It seems these two real estate agents saved their dirty tricks for the bedroom. Coldwell Banker realtors Robert Lindsay and Jeannemarie Phelan have allegedly been caught on camera having sex numerous times in a New Jersey home which they were trying to sell about two years ago. Now they're being sued by the owners, Denville's Richard and Sandra Weiner, who claim the agents deliberately steered away potential buyers so they could use the house for their 'sexual escapades'. Dirty tricks: Realtors Robert Lindsay (left) and Jeannemarie Phelan (right) have been accused of having sex in a New Jersey home which they were hired to market and sell . The Weiners also claim Lindsay, a former Passaic County Board of Realtors president, made a duplicate . key and intentionally over-priced the home to discourage buyers from December 2011 to January 2012. NorthJersey.com reports the couple is suing both Lindsay and Phelan for committing the 'ultimate breach of trust' and Coldwell for violating the realtor code of ethics. According to the suit filed on December 6, the Weiners began working with Lindsay and Coldwell in early 2010 when Lindsay repeatedly told them the Wayne home would sell for $650,000. The couple contracted him to list it in December 2011. That's when the trouble allegedly began. On December 27, 2011, security cameras allegedly captured the agents hugging and kissing in the kitchen before undressing and having sex on the Weiners' bed. The suit says footage shows the pair allegedly hooking up many more times until they were busted by cops on January 23, 2012. 'Sandra Weiner happened to be checking the video cameras feed at . the time and saw strange people in the house with what she thought were . flashlights,' the suit states. 'The house was dark at the time. The Weiners called the . local police, who then went to the house. 'The police opened the . door to the house and found Lindsay pulling up his pants. Lindsay lied to police by telling them that he was there to . prepare the house for an open house. 'Instead, Lindsay and Phelan were . at the house to have sex.' After watching the footage, the Weiners claim 'they could no longer use the bedroom or the remainder of the house' and 'were uncomfortable and disgusted even being in their house, UPI reports. The Weiners filed the suit in state Superior Court in Passaic County (pictured) on December 6 . The suit accuses Coldwell of . violating the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National . Association of Realtors, which requires that 'shall not deliberately mislead the . owner as to the market value.' Hal Maxwell, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in New Jersey, told NorthJersey.com  the company no longer works with Lindsay or Phelan. 'Immediately after learning of the allegation of improper behavior at the property by two independent contractors in January 2012, we ceased our affiliation with the agents,' he said. 'These agents have not listed or sold properties on our behalf since the allegation of misconduct at the home was first reported.' The Weiners are seeking compensatory damages for invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional . distress, breach of contract, trespass of land and other civil counts.","New Jersey's Richard and Sandra Weiner are suing two real estate agents who they claim intentionally over-priced their home so they could use it as a 'play pad to have sexual relations'

Tragic: Constable 'Dave' Ross, 32, seen here on his wedding day with his wife Rachael, was one of the three slain officers who were fatally shot on Wednesday night in Moncton . Cut short: The couple had a young son and Constable Ross joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2009 . Honored: Douglas James Larche, 40, was one of the slain constables and received a commendation in 2008 for saving an unconscious baby (left) and the third victim was Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, who was born in France but grew up in Canada (right) Two other officers- Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen- were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening. Constable Dubois was released Thursday afternoon and Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown said that he met with Constable Goguen in the hospital yesterday evening. The manhunt for Bourque only ended in the early hours of Friday morning, when the 24-year-old was caught shortly after midnight. 'Justin came out with his hands up, and he said, ""I'm done,""' resident Michelle Thibodeau told the CBC after she saw the arrest occur in her backyard. 'I'm done,' a witness heard him say to police. Residents in much of Moncton- which has a population of nearly 70,000- were told to stay indoors during much of the manhunt that started Wednesday night but one person called in a tip to police that led to Bourque's arrest. The tip directed police towards a wooded area in a residential part of the city where they found Bourque hiding out. He . turned himself over without incident and did not have any of the . weapons- including two long guns and a bow and arrow- that he was seen . carrying in earlier sightings from the beginning of the ordeal. Further investigation found that the weapons were hidden close by and have since been taken away by police. Bourque was transported to the city's courthouse on Friday afternoon and charged with three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He does not have to undergo a psychological evaluation. He is due back in court in early July. 'Fortunately . most people will never have to experience what our officers have gone . through in the last two days,' RCMP commanding officer Roger Brown said . Friday morning. Heartbreaking: The shooting was the deadliest attack on the Canadian police force in almost a decade and RCMP officials Roger Brown (left) and Marlene Snowman (right) became emotional in every press conference about the ordeal, including this morning (pictured) Support: The police officials praised the public for being helpful by turning on their outdoor lights to help the officers during the nighttime searches and now many have asked to donate to funds for the relatives of the slain officers . 'I can't dig deep enough to explain the sadness that we all feel.' Few details have been released about the slain officers, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge. Constable 'Dave' Ross was recently . married and has a young son. He had been serving with the RCMP since he . graduated from the police academy in 2009. His . cousin Lucinda Ross posted about the shooting on her Facebook profile . early Thursday morning- a full day before the police officially . confirmed his role in the incident. 'My cousin, a police top dog, passionate about his work, died while doing his functions,' she wrote in French. 'All of my thoughts are with his wife and their son and all of their family. Rest in Peace, Dave.' Constable Fabrice Georges Gevaudan hailed from Boulogne-Billancourt, France. Killer: Justin Bourque, 24, has officially been named the suspect and was charged on Friday . Armed and dangerous: When he was captured, Bourque did not have any of these weapons on his person but they were found near where he was hiding out in the woods . In custody: Armed officers escorted the vehicle driving Bourque to the courthouse on Friday afternoon . The third officer, Constable Douglas James Larche, was a respected member of the force and received a commander's commendation for saving the life of an unconscious baby in 2008 in Moncton. Funeral arrangements have not yet been released and Commissioner Brown said that a fund will be established for the children of the slain officers. Aside from Constable Ross, it is not clear which other victims were fathers. 'It has been a very challenging 30 hours or more for the officers who worked around the clock to get this done,' RCMP superintendent Marlene Snowman said at a press conference Friday morning. 'It will take some time to heal but together we will get there. None of us can be prepared for this type of situation.'","Justin Bourque has been charged with three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder .

"A white teacher in Iowa has come under investigation after telling a black student to say 'Yes, sir, master'. The incident happened as teacher Shawn McCurtain was telling his class of students to go downstairs in Roosevelt High School in order to take their economics final in the middle of last month. When student Jabre White said 'Yes, sir,' The Des Moines Register reports that McCurtain replied 'You meant to say ""Yes, sir, master.""' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reporting racism: Jabre White (right) told his mother Nicholle (left) about what an economics teacher at his school said in the middle of May and the teacher's punishment has not been announced but he is still employed . The senior quickly responded back to the teacher, who was helping a different teacher in that role and hadn't taught Jabre for the full year. 'Who the f*** are you talking to? You're nobody's master, and this is not the slave days,' Jabre said. He was held up by the school at graduation days after the incident as a student who has shown marked improvement since joining the school two years ago. After his junior year, he was awarded one of the school's highest honors. The 17-year-old told his mother about the incident with McCurtain shortly after it happened and she contacted the school's principal to hear about what was being done to investigate and punish the teacher. Nicholle White heard back from principal Joseph Blazevich who confirmed that their investigation proved that the incident had happened. Scene: Officials from Roosevelt High School in Des Moines (pictured) have confirmed that the 'shameful' incident did take place but could not reveal how- and if- the teacher would be punished . 'The instructor was very remorseful,' Mr Blazevich said according to Ms White, and he described the incident as 'terrible' and 'shameful'. That said, the principal was unable elaborate about what, if any, punishments the teacher is facing because district rules mandate that disciplinary actions against teachers are kept confidential. 'I have tried to be humble... But I also feel I need to express as a mother, and as a black woman, how I feel,' Ms White said to The Des Moines Register about her dealings with Roosevelt High School officials. At this point, McCurtain is still employed by the school. School district spokesman Phil Roeder indicated tht there will likely be some kind of punishment but could not expand given their privacy rules. 'To put it mildly, it was wrong in every way you look at it,' Mr Roeder said.","Officials at Roosevelt High School have confirmed that teacher Shawn McCurtain made the comments .

"A married mother-of-two has been charged with multiple counts of rape after admitting to having a sexual relationship with one of her teenage daughter's male friends. Heather Salines, 38, has entered a not guilty plea to the six counts of aggravated rape after she admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old boy. She also sent the boy, whose name has not been revealed because of the nature of the crimes, nude selfies which ended up leading to her arrest. Apologized: Heather Salines, 38, admitted that 'things spiraled out of control' but entered a not guilty plea against the six charges of aggravated rape that she faces . The investigation into the case began when a student at Belmonte Middle School in Saugus, Massachusetts reported that the boy was showing off the naked pictures that Salines had sent him. The Boston Herald reports that the boy told police he had previously had sex with Salines and they had exchanged naked photos. She was later questioned by authorities and admitted that they had sex on a number of occasions but the exact number of sexual encounters has not been revealed. Salines said she had met the boy two months before they became intimate, and he had told her about the personal turmoil he went through after 'he lost his mother at a young age'. 'When I looked at him, he did not act like a 15-year-old... he acted like a grown man,' she said. At one point early in the illegal . relationship, he was alone at her house and they 'were kissing and that . she was touching him over his clothing'. Connection: She had met the boy, who was friends with her teenage daughter, two months before they started having a sexual relationship and he told her how he struggled when he lost his mom at a young age . 'Things spiraled out of control,' Salem News reports, citing the charging documents. They first had sex in a car in the parking lot of a Saugus-area park on March 17. The Boston Herald reports that she pointed the finger at the boy for taking the trysts to the next level, saying that he was the one to suggest they get a hotel room since there was always the threat that her daughter could walk in on them when they were at the house. The boy was friends with Salines' teenage daughter but the age and sex of her other child are unknown. Salines and the boy booked a room at the local DoubleTree hotel on March 19, two days after their coupling. 'She said they became close, and she developed feelings that she was not proud of,' the police report states, according to the Salem News. Tryst: The first time Salines and the boy had sex was in a parked car and the second time was in this DoubleTree hotel near their hometown of Saugus, Massachusetts . 'She said she tried to renege but that one thing led to another.' Salines now faces six counts of aggravated rape and abuse of a child, one charge of child enticement and one charge of disseminating obscene material to a minor. The aggravated rape charges are by far the most serious, as the mandatory minimum for each count carries a 10 year prison sentence, meaning that she could face 60 years behind bars if she is found guilty. She has been indicted by a grand jury and appeared in court on Thursday in Salem to enter her not guilty plea. Salines was accompanied by her lawyer and a man that would only identify himself as a family member. That relative told the Salem News that she 'has the full support of her family'.","Heather Salines has been charged with six counts of aggravated rape after admitting to a sexual affair with a 15-year-old boy .

"President Obama had some kind words for Hillary Clinton, saying that he knows she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run. The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House. The interview aired Friday morning but was taped on Thursday- the same day that Obama secretly had lunch with Mrs Clinton. Opening up: President Obama said that he and Hillary Clinton have become 'buddies' and though he doesn't know what she is going to do in 2016 but if she runs, she would be a 'very effective' president . 'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview. 'I think because we ran in the longest primary in history and our staffs, I think, were doing battle politically, I think the perception was that this was always kind of a marriage of convenience when she came in as secretary of State. 'I always admired her. As soon as she got here, she couldn't have been more effective, more loyal and since that time, we've become really, really good friends.' The lunch with Clinton- which was accidentally revealed by a People magazine editor who tweeted that Clinton was headed to meet Obama after her interview for the magazine- was an indication that the two have remained close in spite of her decision to step down from the State Department in January 2013. Though his words were clearly . positive, Obama made it clear that he was not leaving his Vice President . out of the race entirely as well and was purposeful in mentioning Biden . even though he was not in the conversation- or building- at the time. 'I . think I've been blessed to have some people around me like her, and . Vice President Biden, and my chief of staff who are just great, . hard-working, effective people, and I love them to death,' Mr Obama . said. Cat out of the bag: The 'Live with Kelly and Michael' interview was taped on the same day that Clinton had a secret meeting with the President which was accidentally revealed by People magazine with this tweet . Not for her: President Obama said that his wife Michelle will never run for office . Clinton has not officially announced that she is running for president, and Obama admitted that he doesn't 'know what she's going to decide to do' in 2016 but she is seen as the one to beat. One woman that apparently will never be challenging Clinton for a political position: Michelle Obama. The president revealed in the interview with Kelly and Michael that his wife has no desire to run for office. When asked by Kelly what he would say if Michelle turned to him in 10 years and said that she wanted to run for office, the President said: 'I would say where did you take my wife because I was sure there was an alien body-snatching going on.'

"It was 42 minutes past midnight when Gareth Bale shared a photograph of his Champions League winners’ medal with his three-point-something million Twitter followers. Very soon, it had been retweeted more than 10,000 times. A picture of him holding the European Cup aloft had been posted little more than an hour before and proved to be even more popular. Somewhere in between the two, he shuffled through the interview area in the concrete bowels of Benfica’s Stadium of Light, bashful and reluctant to stop and dwell on the most amazing night of his professional life. VIDEO Scroll down for Ancelotti: Bale was able to score when it mattered . Priceless: Gareth Bale scored the vital goal as Real Madrid beat rivals Atletico in the Champions League final . Tweeting frenzy: Fans lapped up Bale on Social Media after he posted this picture with himself and the trophy . Mine to keep: As well as his first European Cup winners medal . Some of his team-mates couldn’t stop talking. They left still wearing their white Real match-shirts, or the specially printed “La Decima” tee-shirts, but Bale looked slick and well-groomed, fresh in his black club suit and skinny tie, with a silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon. He did not even look in the slightest bit tired. That’s euphoria (and supreme fitness levels) for you. He had the medal, he had lifted the trophy every footballer wants to get their hands on and Bale had made a vital contribution. Perhaps it was not THE most vital contribution. That accolade belongs to Sergio Ramos. Real Madrid were around 120 seconds from heartbreak when he headed in the equaliser which took the game into extra-time. Without Ramos, leaping to score in the 93rd minute from a Luka Modric corner, this would have been a tale of woe for Bale, a disappointment at the end of an otherwise promising first campaign in Spain when he shouldered manfully the burden of being the world’s most expensive footballer. There would have been no extra 30 minutes for Bale and Angel di Maria to display their phenomenal stamina and running ability against an industrious Atletico Madrid team who were quickly running out of steam. All for the team: Bale was humble in his post-match interviews, thanking his Real colleagues . Life through his eyes: Bale celebrates with the Real fans after the match . Welsh wonder: Bale with the flag of his home nation as he celebrates Real's victory . Delight: Gareth Bale scored a vital goal for Real Madrid in extra time in the Champions League final . Until the Ramos equaliser, Bale would have been cast as a villain rather than a hero. He had missed good chances, clear chances, one in each half, with another, much sharper chance in between. He had missed the target with them all and yet, even while performing poorly in front of goal, he had offered much great threat than either Karim Benzema or Cristiano Ronaldo. His moment came after 110 minutes. Few would have had the power in their legs at this stage of the night to have followed in Di Maria’s shot with such energy and expectation. It was a fine example of his desire and determination, despite earlier misses, to follow the ball. He would not hide. When Di Maria’s effort hit Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois on the foot and spun into the air it sat perfectly for him to spring and convert a header from a yard or so, and Bale became the first Welshman to score in the European Cup final and the 20th Brit. For the record, the other 19 are: Tommy Gemmell (2), Stevie Chalmers, Bobby Charlton, Brian Kidd, George Best, Terry McDermott, Tommy Smith, Phil Neal (2), Kenny Dalglish, John Robertson, Alan Kennedy, Trevor Francis, Peter Withe, Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard, Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney. Historic: Bale heads home in injury time to give Real Madrid a vital lead in Lisbon . Big moment: The £86m Welshman delivered when Real Madrid needed it most in Lisbon . Roar: Bale celebrates his goal in extra time at the Stadium of Light in Lisbon . This was far removed from Bale’s exhilarating solo goal to win the Copa del Rey against Barcelona last month and yet so much more meaningful and precious to a club which has been obsessed for the last 12 years with winning their tenth European title. At last, here it is and Bale was central to it all. His goal destroyed Atletico to such an extent that they conceded two more goals, the sort typically conceded by weary and exhausted teams. It was to all intents and purposes the killer strike - the winner-  although everyone in the Real camp seemed relieved when Ronaldo managed to engineer and then convert a penalty and spare them all the inevitable sulk. This was supposed to be his night in Lisbon – the stage had been set after all - but not even the over-worked and self-important celebration of the otherwise meaningless fourth goal could distract from the fact this was ultimately about more than one man. Real Madrid achieved their dream and Bale played a key part. Nine months after leaving Tottenham he could not dared to have hope for more.","Gareth Bale deserves his hero status at Real Madrid .

"A Cambodian activist who used her 'story' of being forced into the sex trade at a young age has resigned from her eponymous U.S.-based charity after an investigation into her past. Somaly Mam shot to fame in recent years for her humanitarian work helping fight sex slavery, using a horrific story about her own personal experiences of being forced into- and then escaping- work as a prostitute. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured her charity's facilities in Siem Reap, Cambodia in October 2010, and she has attracted the attention of celebrity activists like Susan Sarandon and Meg Ryan. Holes started showing in her story as she started contradicting the timelines of her abuse that she wrote about in her memoir and told in interviews with American talk shows and news publications. Resigned: Somaly Mam, pictured at a New York fundraiser for her eponymous charity in October, has resigned following the results of an investigation into her past . Famous friends: Dylan McDermott (left) and Katie Couric (right) were among the celebrities who attended the October fundraiser for Somaly Mam's eponymous organization . Announcement: Somaly Mam's American foundation was created in 2007 and works closely with the international charity she and her ex-husband founded in 1996 . Two of the young girls she brought to the press- one of whom was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show and the subject of reporter Nicholas Kristof's column in The New York Times- have had their stories debunked as well. She has now resigned from her eponymous American foundation, which was created in 2007 to help aid the efforts of an earlier international charity, AFESIP, that Mam and her ex-husband launched in 1996. The international charity has not made any statements about the latest allegations. A spokeswoman for the Somaly Mam Foundation told MailOnline that Mam 'is not currently employed by AFESIP' but is still known for her role as the charity's co-founder. Somaly Mam claimed to be orphaned and taken in by a man she came to call her 'grandfather' who went on to rape her repeatedly and forced her to marry a soldier at the age of 14 before eventually being sold to a brothel. She eventually escaped, met a French doctor who married her and took her back to Europe in the early 1990s where they launched their crusade to save other girls like her. They returned to Cambodia, set up safe houses and provided resources for the 'thousands' of girls they rescued, all through a foundation they built in her name. Accepting praise: Somaly Mam, pictured at left with a young girl she helped rescue from sex slavery, was named as one of Glamour magazine's women of the year in 2006 shortly after the publication of her book . Big names: Queen Latifah was the star to present Mam with the Glamour award in 2006 . Newsweek wrote a cover story about her in their latest issue detailing the ways in which her fraud unravelled in recent months. She and her now ex-husband, Pierre Legros, started to attract attention in the non-profit world and signed Mam up for interviews in order to promote their first organization, AFESIP, the full name of which in French meant 'Helping Women in Danger'. In 1998, Mam gave a joint interview with one of the teenage girls she 'saved' named Meas Ratha, who told a harrowing tale of how she was sold to a brothel and held as a sex slave. Last year, that same woman came forward and said that Mam had coached her to say she was a child prostitute. 'Somaly said that... if I want to help another woman I have to do (the 1998 interview) very well,' Ms Ratha, who is now in her early 30s, told Newsweek last year. International attention: Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Somaly Mam's charity AFESIP's rehabilitation facility and met with some of the survivors in October 2010 . Fake stories: One of the poster children that Mam lauded in interviews was Long Pross (who Clinton is seen touching). Pross claimed she was an orphan living at a brothel whose pimp stabbed her in the eye; doctors records prove she was brought to the hospital by her parents and linked with Mam's group later . The second woman who Mam held up as the survivor of trauma was Long Pross, who was featured in an extensive profile and accompanying video by Nicholas Kristoff in The Times in 2009, where she told him that her eye had been gouged out by her violent female owner after Pross asked for time off from prostitution following her second painful abortion. She told the same version of events to Oprah and in a PBS documentary, but Newsweek has now debunked that. A doctor in Cambodia named Pok Thorn has before and after photos of Pross' eye when she was brought in- by her parents- at age 13. This directly contradicts the timeline Pross had been espousing, since she had claimed to be sold to the brothel at that same age, and been working at the brothel for years- being given to at least four times to different men after being stitched up repeatedly and billed as a virgin- before her two abortions and brutal run-in with her boss who gouged her eye with a piece of metal. The hospital where Dr Pok Thorn works, Takeo Eye Hospital, told Newsweek that they were the ones who put Pross in touch with Mam because they contacted her charity, AFESIP, to see if Pross could be enrolled in their vocational training course. Selling her story: Mam, seen here during a Tyra Banks Show appearance in 2006, admitted that she lied to the United Nations about the Cambodian army killing some of the girls she rescued . Celebrity endorsements: Susan Sarandon is just one of the famous Hollywood stars who has been a champion of Mam's cause for years . Close: Susan Sarandon has been a longtime supporter of Mam's foundation, seen at left at the annual fundraiser in 2012 and at right in anti-sex trafficking event in 2010 . Those who know her say that Mam had a similar alternative life story: her parents are alive and raised her. She was a well-known and popular girl who attended a local high school from 1981 to 1987 and is remembered by her classmates for regularly wearing pigtails to school. She has also been caught in multiple lies on the public stage. After telling the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 that eight girls her organization rescued were later killed by the Cambodian army in 2004, she admitted that she made up that story. She also told Glamour magazine in 2006- when they named her one of their Women of the Year- that her teenage daughter had been kidnapped and her captors video taped her being gang raped- all as retribution for the work Mam was doing. Her ex and the charity’s legal advisor both came out to say that she was never kidnapped but ran away with her boyfriend. International support: Queen Sofia of Spain (left) met with Mam on an official visit to Cambodia in 2008 .

Conflicting stories: Somaly Mam's book (left) was published in 2005 and a recent investigation by Newseek (right) proved that much of what she said about her upbringing is false . Vouching for her: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, seen with her in 2012, wrote the foreward to her book and profiled one of the 'rescued' girls, whose story was proved a lie . '(With donors), she’s very polished and very on and very charming…exceedingly charming... and when people are not there, she can be tyrannical; she’s moody, she’s erratic, she’s entitled,' a former AFESIP volunteer psychologist told Newsweek about Mam. In the statement issued by the Somaly Mam Foundation on Wednesday, they tell how they hired a third party law firm Goodwin Procter LLP to investigate Mam’s claims two months ago, and, upon hearing their results, they have now accepted her resignation. ‘The Foundation provided Goodwin Procter unfettered access to our information, documents, and staff, and, for the past two months, a team of Goodwin Procter legal professionals based out of Boston, San Francisco, and Hong Kong conducted an extensive investigation,’ the press release states. ‘As a result of Goodwin Procter’s efforts, we have accepted Somaly’s resignation effective immediately. ‘Despite our heartfelt disappointment, the work of the Foundation and our grant partners must and will carry on. We have touched the lives of over 100,000 women and girls. We have treated nearly 6,000 individuals at a free medical clinic in Phnom Penh’s red light district and engaged nearly 6,400 students in anti-trafficking activism.’","Somaly Mam claimed to be taken in by an old man when she was orphaned and he raped her before selling her to a brothel .

"President Obama has revealed that his older daughter Malia has gone through the teenage rite of passage by attending her first prom. He wouldn't say whether she had a date or went with friends, joking that it was 'classified information'. The President opened up about his daughters and how fast they are growing up during an interview that aired on Live! With Kelly and Michael this morning. Cat out of the bag: President Obama revealed today (left) that his daughter Malia (right, in November) attended her first prom this spring . Obama says it was 'a little bit jarring' to see his 15-year-old 10th grader in heels for the first time, before . adding that Malia looked beautiful. Speaking generally about the prospect of his daughters beginning to date, he said that he doesn't think he'd been too intimidating for any boy who might roll up to the White House to pick Malia up. The president says he and the first lady were worried that growing up in the White House would give their daughters 'an attitude' but proudly boasted that they have remained respectful, kind and considerate young women. That result, he said, is a result of Mrs Obama's maternal instincts. Big interview: Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan taped the interview in the White House and it aired Friday . 'I'm labor, she's management,' he joked about their parental roles. '(Michelle)'s a brilliant lawyer and was a very strong professional and smart as can be when it comes to policy... but what drives her and she's passionate about is children.' Tall in heels: Malia, seen with her father last June, has grown rapidly since her father's first term . One thing he did say that his wife won't undertake is a political career of her own. When asked by Kelly what he would say if Michelle turned to him in 10 years and said that she wanted to run for office, the President said: 'I would say where did you take my wife because I was sure there was an alien body-snatching going on.' 'One thing I can promise you is Michelle will not run for office.' In the rapid fire round of questions at the end of the taped interview, President Obama admitted to being an intense trash talker during the basketball games he hosts at the White House, but also credits the playful banter as the reason why he feels his opponents don't just let him win. 'They will tell you that they don't let me win because I trash talk so much that it's not worth it,' he said. 'When they hit me and knock me down they get nervous.' The most damaging incident came when the President was accidentally hit in the face with another player's elbow, sending Obama to the White House doctor to receive 12 stitches on his lip. 'He just swung around and whacked me,' the President said of the player, without revealing his name. 'I'm not sure the got invited back but I did send him a picture' of the cut, he said, with a note that read 'you're the only man who ever got away with cold clocking the President'. The interview was timed to coincide with his Thursday announcement of a push for further study on youth concussions.","The Obamas' 15-year-old daughter went to prom but the President wouldn't reveal if she had a date or went with friends .

In the past two years she has made several appearances on Fox News as a guest commentator including appearing on the new Fox News show Outnumbered as a guest panelist. ‘I just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of showbusiness, but California and showbusiness is the purest form of capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April. She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs. Vote Romney: In 2012 the Clueless star took to Twitter to show how she would be voting in the presidential election . The actress lent her support to Mitt Romney in 2012 by re-tweeting his posts . Stacey Dash (left) tweeted her . support for Mitt Romney (right, on the campaign trail), posting this sexy picture with her endorsement . ‘For the federal government . to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say ""We're . all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy"" is just a bit . ridiculous,’ she said. The New York Post recently reported that Dash is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series. The premise of the show, which has the tentative title of 'Stacey . Dash is Normal' - follows Dash's life as a Republican single mother . living in Hollywood. Dash became a conservative darling in 2012 when she started speaking out about politics after revealing that, unlike many African American voters, she supported Romney. ‘I believe that if you stand for something you have to stand for it, you can't hide behind it or it won't get done,’ she told the Fox and Friends crew last month. She said that her career has not been negatively impacted as a result of her Republican beliefs, perhaps because she said that there were more conservatives in Hollywood than many would expect. Trio of trouble: Alicia Silverstone (left), the late Brittany Murphy (center) and Stacey Dash starred in the 1995 high school comedy Clueless . ‘If you make movies and the movies make . money, they're going to make the movie. You know for example, if . Obamacare were a movie they would not make a sequel, let's just say . that,’ she joked. During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, she used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'. The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'. While many took issue with Dash, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her. 'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Dash told Morgan. She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to endorsing his 2012 opponent 'because of the state of the country'. 'I want the next four years to be different,' she said at the time.","Actress Stacey Dash, 47, has joined Fox News as a contributor .

"The jewellery of a former Playboy model who called Australia home is set to go under the hammer in a bid to raise funds for charity. Uta Pearson became a well-regarded collector of antiques and jewellery in South Australia after reaching the height of fame when she appeared as a Playboy centrefold in 1974. The German-born model, internationally famous for her 'Bond girl' looks, continued to buy the pieces and left behind an exquisite collection after her death last year, aged 74. Uta Pearson spent most of her life living in South Australia. She was a Playboy model and glamorous jetsetter who left behind an incredible collection of jewellery when she died late last year . Her exquisite jewels are being auctioned and the proceeds will be donated to charity to assist wildlife . As a passionate traveller, the stunning blonde bought and traded antiques and jewels during her many journeys around the world. Having lived in both New York and London, Uta settled in Australia in 1966 where she remained for 47 years. Due to her fun-loving, outspoken character, and her passion for fashion, she appeared on local television and wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines. She was often photographed in social pages and was very proud of her appearance in Playboy magazine. Amongst the pieces up for grabs are antique diamond butterfly brooches and a beautiful butterfuly made from a stunning blue stone . Her style has been described as boho-chic and her collection of jewellery contains many sought-after pieces . Uta was always concerned about wildlife conservation. She raised funds for this cause during her lifetime. Her final wishes were that her assets be liquidated and the proceeds donated to the animal conservation society of her choice. Ironically, many of the incredible pieces are also in the shapes of animals. Caring Uta's final wish has now been granted - auctioning of her jewellery, and other assets, to raise funds for charity. Amongst those benefiting from the sale by Bonhams will be the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust based in Jersey - where Uta had been a member since the 1970s. Uta was a socialite, model and television personality who as born in Germany and travelled the world before she settled in Australia, where she lived for 47 years . The collection of jewellery, which includes 85 pieces, will go under the hammer on November 25, in Sydney, Australia. Amongst the pieces up for grabs are antique diamond butterfly brooches and spider and snake bracelets. Lucky bidders could also take home Nouveau diamond encrusted bats, and rings modelled as coloured diamond animals. Long-time friend and the executor of the model's will, Vaughan Cottle, said that the donation was not out of character. He said: 'She was quite the character, and not afraid to coerce her friends into donating, as she'd often leave herself short to make sure that animals in Gerald Durrell's care were provided for.' Uta's final wishes were that her assets be liquidated and the proceeds donated to the animal conservation society of her choice. She chose the Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey . Rachel Shaw, head of fundraising at Durrell, said: 'We are very grateful to Uta for her support during her lifetime, and with this final gift in her Will. 'She has also given us a wonderful opportunity to offer people the chance to own some beautiful pieces of jewellery, and at the same time help us in our mission of saving species from extinction.' The proceeds will we used by Durrell to continue to work towards financial stability. The charity's conservationists are currently poised to launch the most all-embracing mission in the trust's 51 year history - a global effort to save amphibians. A spokesperson for Bonhams added: 'It was Uta's wish that these jewels, which brought her much enjoyment over her life, be offered at auction and that the proceeds of their sale be donated to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.' The antique jewellery from Uta's collection will be auctioned off as part of Bonhams Fine Jewellery auction on November 25 in Moore Park, Sydney .

"Two musicians have staged a creative- and virtual- protest against US Airways after they were banned from boarding a commuter flight with their instruments. Nicholas Kendall and Zach De Pue were outraged when they were told that they could not bring their violins on board with them on Memorial Day. When they were refused entry to the plane in Charlotte, North Carolina because the flight crew would not let them carry the instruments on board, Mr De Pue started playing his violin furiously on the tarmac. Scroll down for video . Taking to the tarmac: Zach De Pue and of the band Time For Three broke into a ballad when flight attendants wouldn't allow him to bring his violin as carry on luggage . Closing them off: The captain closed off the door when De Pue started playing (and his bandmate was filming) 'The captain and crew told us that our violins were not allowed on the flight! They literally left us alone on the tarmac without any direction. Amazing!' Mr Kendall wrote in the Youtube video caption. 'Are violins dangerous? It's hard enough to make it as a classical musician. Cut us some slack, PLEASE!!!' The Blaze spoke to representatives from the airline who portray the situation slightly differently. They said that while it is company policy to allow instruments on as either carry on luggage or checked baggage, that is left up to the flight crew's discretion. In this case, the flight attendants apparently felt that there was not enough room in the cabin to fit the instruments, but that was not a sufficient explanation for the musicians. On their way: Nicholas Kendall (left) and Zach De Pue (right) were connecting in Charlotte for a flight to Fayetteville where they would meet their third bandmate in order to perform in a music festival . Verbalizing their problems: The band updated their followers on Twitter after being rebooked to a second flight . 'I used to think that captains knew about art but I guess not,' Mr De Pue says in the video. 'Bach would be very upset.' The duo was on their way to Fayetteville, Arkansas to meet their third band member in order to play at the Nature Festival. After complaining on Twitter and being rebooked on a second flight, the two men were able to get to their final destination. The frustration didn't end when they boarded the second flight, however, since they thought it was the same sized plane as the first. The video has been viewed more than 22,000 times since it was uploaded on Monday. It appears as if the internet is on their side, since more than 1,000 viewers liked the video while only 87 have disliked it.","US Airways says that it is up to the flight attendants discretion whether instruments can be brought on board .

"A mother-of-four who suffered a horrific reaction to a false widow spider bite says the pain still prevents her from hugging her children. Carol Veitch, 45, was bitten more than a year ago. But the agony she is in means giving her five-year-old son Paul a goodbye cuddle before school is impossible. While she had no fear of spiders before, she is now too scared to leave the house, and says her newly developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Scroll down for video . Carol Veitch, 45, from Harrogate, suffered a horrific reaction after being bitten by a false widow spider a year ago. She has been left in too much pain to hug her children . Mrs Veitch, pictured here with husband Richard, 51 and son Paul, now 5, before the false widow bite. She wasn't scared of spiders before but has developed arachnophobia so severe she can't leave the house . Mrs Veitch suffered a horrific reaction to the bite, which caused hundreds of sores to appear all over her body . Two days after the bite her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she had flu-like symptoms, and then over the following eight weeks sores and swelling developed over her body . Mrs Veitch was cleaning her home in Harrogate, which she shares with husband Richard, 51, when she felt a bite on her ankle. Unable to find the culprit, or a visible mark, she thought her skin must be becoming irritated by the hot summer weather. But two days later her calf and ankle had visibly swollen and she was exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Mrs Veitch said: 'I was coughing and couldn't breathe. I went to the doctor and he told me that I had a chest infection and bronchitis. 'While there I got him to check my leg. I was in a terrible state so they put me on steroids.' Just days after she first visited her GP in Harrogate, Mrs Veitch found the false widow spider trapped in her bath tub. She said: 'I took the spider to the doctor and we got it identified by the local environmental health department. The doctor said my symptoms were typical of a false widow bite.' 'The doctor was shocked because none had been sighted in Harrogate at the time - the nearest case had been in Manchester.' The false widow spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom . False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. The chances of being bitten by a false widow are incredibly low, with no more than 10 spider bites being reported each year in the UK, according to animal experts. Over the following eight weeks Mrs Veitch's condition became worse, with sores and swelling developing across her arms and face. Despite treatment with medication, the sores are still so painful that direct physical contact leaves her in agony. Mrs Veitch said: 'I would love to give Paul a cuddle before he heads off to school, but I can't, because my skin is too sore. 'I can't face going swimming with my kids because it looks like I have leprosy. 'If I was stood next to someone who looked like me I would be terrified. 'I can't go out or show my arms because it's  embarrassing. 'My face has changed because it swelled up so much. I'm completely covered in sores.' Mrs Veitch had no fear of spiders before she was bitten but is now so scared of them that she is afraid to leave the house. She said her newly-developed arachnophobia is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. She said: 'I can't sleep because I'm terrified one will come into the bedroom. 'We found a common house spider in the living room last week and I didn't sleep for two nights. 'If I see one on television I'll have a huge panic attack and leave the room crying.' Mrs Veitch's husband, Richard, 51, has taken time off from his job as a construction foreman to care for his wife. She said: 'It's had a massive effect on my marriage because I used to be so independent and now I rely on him for so much - but he's been brilliant.' Mrs Veitch, who has three sons - Pail, five, Nathan, 23, and Jamie, 26, and a daughter named Amber, 15, now attends regular therapy sessions to help her overcome her new-found fear. She said Paul has also developed arachnophobia due to being traumatised by his mother's illness. Mrs Veitch said: 'I've terrified him. If he's in the car with his dad and he sees even a tiny spider he will go hysterical. 'I can't even cuddle him to make it better. 'If he see's anything move he'll jump to attention and try to protect me. He's so brave. 'If he sees a creepy-crawly he will yell to me 'don't look' until Richard has moved it away.' Mrs Veitch said the bites have affected her family. She is now very reliant on her husband and can't hug her children before they go to school . British homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months, according to experts. That’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits. And it could mean we’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months. The mild summer has meant the eight-legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished. With temperatures set to fall, experts from Sydney University have said the larger-than-usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate. Professor Adam Hart, of the University of Gloucestershire, agreed with their predication and said: ‘This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it’s quite mild out there.’ Both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females. Mr Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Society told MailOnline that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside, with males hunting for females. But he agrees that the particularly mild summer we’ve had, not too hot and not too cold, will have given spiders access to more prey.","Carol Veitch, 45 was bitten by a false widow spider more than a year ago .

"Smoking, age and high blood pressure are well-known causes of erectile dysfunction but now an . impotence calculator designed exclusively for MailOnline shows the exact risk a man has of developing problems in the bedroom. The results are startling. For example, according to our impotence calculator, if you are 50, smoke and have high . blood pressure, your risk of developing ED is 14 per cent - double the average man's risk. A 40-year-old man who does not smoke . but has high blood pressure and heart disease will be at an 8 per cent . risk of ED - which puts him at a 10 per cent greater risk than the average man. Scroll down for calculator . Both Jack Nicholson (left) and Michael Douglas (right) have admitted to . taking Viagra. Poor lifestyle choices such as smoking and being overweight are thought to play the most major role in causing the . condition . And a middle-aged man who suffers with . type 2 diabetes, has heart disease, high blood pressure and smokes is almost . eight times more likely to suffer sexual problems than a healthier man . of the same age. It is thought that 50 per cent of British men aged between 40 and 70 - around 12 million - suffer with erectile dysfunction (ED) at some point in their life. The problem is becoming increasingly . common in younger men too, with eight per cent of men in their 20s and 11 . per cent of men in their 30s admitting to suffering with impotence. In younger men, the cause of ED is often psychological, with anxiety or stress playing a key role. The calculator was designed by online GP service DrEd.com. Later this week, the manufacturer of Viagra is set to lose its exclusive right to make the drug. Experts predict the price of the sex drug could drop by up to 90 per cent, taking the cost of a pill from £10 to £1. Over 20 manufacturers have applied for a license to produce a generic version of the drug, whose chemical name is sildenafil. The causes of ED are diverse but in older men lifestyle tends to play the most major role. High . blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, being overweight, . a lack of exercise and drinking alcohol have been found to be the main risk . factors. Low testosterone levels, nerve damage from diabetes and surgery for prostate cancer are also known causes. But usually the man's inability to get an erection is due to reduced circulation in the area, which prevents the penis from filling with blood. In most cases the blood vessels have narrowed due to leading an unhealthy lifestyle. An increasing number of young men are developing erectile dysfunction. It is thought that eight per cent of British men in their 20s and 11 per cent of men in their 30s have the condition . Injections of the drug Caverject into the penis prevents blood from leaving after it flows into the penis, which creates an erection. Injections are useful for men suffering extreme nerve damage from diabetes or surgery. This is a prescription-only treatment. Herbal remedies such as Golden Ginseng have weak clinical trials to show that they arouse sexual behaviour in mice. Testosterone patches and gels such as Testim and Testogel applied to a large area such as the chest can be very effective but there is some evidence that it can rise the risk of prostate cancer. Vacuum pumps and rubber rings to trap blood in the penis are good options for men who are unable to drugs or simply do not wish to take them. They can also be used in conjunction with medication. Surgical treatment is a last resort. Two cylinders can be placed either side of the penis and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. Squeezing the pump fills the cylinders with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. Viagra was formulated by pharmaceutical company Pfizer and was launched in Britain in 1999. Last year 2.3 million British men were prescribed the drug, costing the NHS £40.3million. Indeed it is so commonly used that stars including Michael Douglas, Jack Nicholson and Hugh Heffner have openly admitted to taking it. Viagra works by increasing blood flow around the body, including the penis. But recent NHS cuts have made it difficult for men to get the medication, with only men suffering with diabetes, multiple sclerosis and prostate cancer now being offered it. Because of this a fifth of all prescriptions are now private. With the drug going off-patent in a matter of days, Pfizer is trying to stop online pharmacies from selling imitation versions of their product up to 95 per cent cheaper and without customers requiring proof that they have been prescribed it. A 2011 study, in which Pfizer bought ‘Viagra’ from 22 internet pharmacies and tested them, found that 77 per cent were counterfeit. Pfizer has said it will launch its own cheaper brand, named sildenafil Pfizer, to avoid being outdone by competitors. The company said men would still need a prescription to buy the diamond-shaped pill on viagra.com but would not need to see a pharmacist to get it. Indeed many men remain too embarrassed to talk about ED and seek help for their problem. Dr Sebastian Winckler, a GP at DrEd.com says: 'Many men feel too embarrassed to go to a doctor, but they shouldn't be. 'ED is a common issue. Try asking for a male doctor if that would make you more comfortable, or use a reputable online doctor service, where you can get treatment without seeing a doctor face-to-face.","Around 50% of men aged between 40 and 70 suffer with impotence and increasing numbers of men in their 20s and 30s are developing condition .

"Middle school students in Oregon will now have access to condoms after a spike in local pregnancies prompted administrators to revisit their sexual education policies. The Gervais School District has passed a rule that will specify certain teachers to hand out condoms to students when the students ask for them. 'If they wanted a condom, they would have to meet with a teacher- a designated teacher, the sex ed teacher, or some of our counselors and maybe some administrators,' the local superintendent Rick Hansel told CBS. Spike in pregnancies: The new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at Gervais High School became pregnant over the course of the last academic year . Should teachers be allowed to give middle school students condoms? Should teachers be allowed to give middle school students condoms? Now share your opinion . 'There would be designated people for students to have a conversation with and then a condom would be distributed at that time.' School administrators feel that by forcing the students to talk to a teacher about the issue in order to get the condoms will help as opposed to just leaving the condoms somewhere out in the open for students to take without any supervision. Addressing the issue: Superintendent Rick Hensel said that the policy will force students to speak to teachers before getting the condoms . The new rule comes after 7 per cent of the young girls at Gervais High School became pregnant over the course of the last academic year. That number has dropped slightly this year to 5 per cent- which equate to nine girls between sixth and 12th grade- even though the policy will not go into effect until next year. In the Gervais school district south of Portland, the high school and middle school are run separately, but that didn't stop the administrators from extending the new rule to both. 'I think the concern was that if we have our middle school, we have some of the same teachers teaching the same topics at the high school, obviously there's going to be a different type of curriculum for the middle school, but at some point they just kind of felt it would evolve to that anyway- so let's just include them (sixth graders),' Mr Hansel told CBS. He also noted that the middle school is only 40 feet away from the high school. Parents are split on the issue, with some board members- who voted to approve the rule- noting that it will lead to more constructive conversations about sex while others think that it is unnecessary to make it available to children at such a young age .","Gervais High School and Middle School have a new policy that means students can talk to specific teachers and then be given condoms .

"ABC has announced that Barbara Walters will have the first interview with UC-Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger's father. Peter Rodger has not spoken out about his son's killing spree that left six dead and 13 others injured before killing himself. The special will mark the famed broadcaster's first return to television since she retired last month. His side of the story: Barbara Walters will tape an interview with Peter Rodger, the filmmaker father of Isla Vista killer Elliot Rodger, in her first return to television since her retirement last month . Final warning: Elliot Rodger posted a confessional video titled 'Retribution' shortly before going on a killing spree near the UC-Santa Barbara campus in May . ABC did not reveal when the interview will air, saying only that it will be an upcoming special edition of 20/20. The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree. Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto. She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls. Treatment: A family spokesman previously said that Peter Rodger (right) and his ex-wife had made sure that Elliot (left) was receiving treatment . His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911. Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio. Neither parent has spoken out about the killings yet, and in the immediate aftermath they gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time. '(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN. 'They thought he was in good hands.' Part of the deal: When Walters retired last month, she said that she would still come back to work from time to time on the 20/20 Interview Specials (pictured during one such interview in 2013)","Barbara Walters will sit down with Peter Rodger, the filmmaker father of Elliot Rodger .

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in ten women will develop preeclampsia, which can shut down the kidneys or liver, cause blood vessel spasms and even cause the placenta to detach from the uterus, and one in 100 will develop the more serious eclampsia, which goes to brain and causes life-threatening seizures. Preeclampsia typically appears after the 20th week of pregnancy, but can also be present in the six weeks post-partum, and often, 'women who have preeclampsia do not feel sick,' according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. 'While obviously not dangerous for the baby, postpartum preeclampsia is still critical for the mother,' according to the Preeclampsia Foundation.

"A top lawyer is to investigate the handling of a dossier which was passed to Tory Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 but subsequently lost . The row over an alleged Westminster child sex ring took a new turn last night after the Government admitted that 114 secret files on paedophile cases have gone missing. And four new cases of alleged child abuse, possibly dating back decades, are to be investigated by police. The development came as the Home Office ordered a full-scale legal inquiry into claims there has been an Establishment cover-up of a powerful network of child sex abusers linked to Parliament and No 10. A top lawyer is to investigate the Government’s handling of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity, which  was first passed to Home Secretary Leon Brittan by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 – but subsequently lost. Mark Sedwill, the Home Office permanent secretary, told David Cameron yesterday that the new investigation would examine whether the findings of a review of the ‘Dickens dossier’ conducted last year ‘remain sound’. The earlier review failed to find the dossier and said its contents had been broken up, with relevant information passed to the police and the rest destroyed. As public fears of a cover-up grow, Mr Cameron has been forced to order a fresh hunt for the missing dossier. The Prime Minister said:  ‘It’s right that these investigations are made. We mustn’t do anything that could prejudice or prevent proper action by the police.’ For the first time, Mr  Sedwill also revealed there had been previous attempts to find the dossier – and how huge numbers of Home Office files have either vanished or been destroyed. He said a massive review of 746,000 Home Office files  covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘573 relevant files which had been retained’. However, he added: ‘The extensive analysis of the central database identified 114 potentially relevant files had been destroyed, missing or not found. Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens who died in 1995 told his family the dossier would 'blow the lid off' the lives of powerful and famous child abusers . 'The investigation identified 13 items . of alleged child abuse, nine of which were known or reported to the . police including four involving Home Office staff. ‘The remaining four, which had not been previously disclosed, have now been passed to the police.’ Mr . Sedwill did not provide names, or say if the four cases involved public . figures. He vowed to appoint a ‘senior, independent legal figure’ this . week. His comments came . in a letter to senior Labour MP Keith Vaz, who said: ‘I welcome this . inquiry but it is essential that it reports promptly and . comprehensively.’ Fellow . Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘The missing files raise serious . questions. This suggests either incompetence on a wide scale or a . massive cover-up.’ He has also suggested the dossier was destroyed to protect people named in it. Mr . Dickens, who died in 1995, told his family that the dossier would ‘blow . the lid off’ powerful and famous figures who were child abusers. His son Barry said his father would have been ‘hugely angered’ that the allegations had not been properly investigated. Campaigning . Labour MP Tom Watson said last night that the new review did not go far . enough and called for a wider inquiry into whether police were . pressured into not pursuing investigations. It . was also claimed last night that more than ten current or former . politicians are on a list of alleged child abusers held by police . investigating claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. Several, including Cyril Smith and Tory grandee Sir Peter Morrison, have died, but others are still active in Parliament.

"The retired judge leading an inquiry into historic sex abuse said she will not quit yesterday, after her brother was linked to an Establishment ‘cover-up’ of the paedophile ring she will be investigating. Baroness Butler-Sloss faced demands for her resignation less than 24 hours after she was appointed to lead the Government’s probe into abuse by politicians and other powerful figures. MPs and legal experts said it was inappropriate for her to keep the post given that her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was Attorney General under Margaret Thatcher when many of the abuse claims were first made. Scroll down for video . Baroness Butler-Sloss faced demands for her resignation less than 24 hours after she was appointed to lead the Government's probe into abuse by politicians and other powerful figures . Sir Michael was accused of presiding over a ‘whitewash’ and ‘the cover-up of  the century’ in the 1980s by Geoffrey  Dickens MP, who led a campaign to  identify members of a paedophile ring  allegedly operating in Whitehall, and  including an MI6 officer. Actor Nigel Havers, Sir Michael’s son, defended his aunt yesterday. He said she ‘had no political ties to my father and knew nothing about what was going on in the House of Commons at that time’, adding: ‘She has every right to lead the inquiry.’ But Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed Cyril Smith’s abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover-up of child abuse, said: ‘It’s astonishing the Government didn’t realise they were appointing the sister of someone who had tried to deter the prosecution of a significant paedophile. It’s far too Establishment – and the Government need to think again.’ Further doubt was cast on Lady Butler-Sloss’s suitability last night when it emerged she had made significant errors in an inquiry into a Church of England paedophile scandal three years ago. Eight months after her report was published, the peer had to issue a six-page addendum in which she apologised for ‘inaccuracies’ that arose from her failure to corroborate information provided by senior Anglican figures. MPs and legal experts said it was inappropriate for her to keep the post given that her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was Attorney General under Margaret Thatcher when many of the abuse claims were first made . Mr Danczuk said the mistakes ‘raise more concerns’ about her ability to lead an inquiry into failures by Westminster, Whitehall, the BBC, Church and other public bodies to protect children from abuse. Alison Millar, a lawyer who has represented many victims of child abuse, added: ‘The concern is that she is just too close to the Establishment and in particular, [there is] concern over her connection to Sir Michael.’ However, Lady Butler-Sloss – who also headed the Cleveland inquiry into false accusations of child abuse – said yesterday: ‘If people think I am not suitable then that’s up to them.’ Whitehall sources insisted the allegations relating to Sir Michael had been considered before her appointment was announced. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘She commands the very highest respect for her professional expertise and integrity.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed Cyril Smith's abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover-up of child abuse, said: 'It's astonishing the Government didn't realise they were appointing the sister of someone who had tried to deter the prosecution of a significant paedophile' Last week the Mail reported the story of Sir Peter Hayman, the deputy under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office, who was also believed to be a senior officer in MI6. In 1978, Hayman – a subscriber to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange – was caught sending and receiving obscene literature through the post after a package was found on a London bus. He was named in a report submitted by the Metropolitan Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions – but never prosecuted. Mr Dickens used Parliamentary privilege to name Hayman and asked Sir Michael if he would prosecute him. In a written answer, Sir Michael replied that he agreed with the Director of Public Prosecutions that there was no need to do so. Mr Dickens called his decision the ‘cover-up of the century’. n David Cameron yesterday backed the NSPCC’s demand for new laws to make it an offence not to report child abuse in a children’s home, hospital or boarding school. The charity’s proposed rules would, however, be limited to so-called closed institutions, where children stay overnight. A whistleblower has accused the Home Office of giving tens of thousands of pounds of public money directly to the Paedophile Information Exchange. Former civil servant Tim Hulbert said the payments were made to the group at the request of the Metropolitan Police’s Special Branch. His comments cast doubts on the credibility of an internal Home Office inquiry this week that found it did not give any grants directly to PIE, which wanted to decriminalise sex between children and adults. Former civil servant Tim Hulbert has accused the Home Office of giving tens of thousands of pounds of public money directly to the Paedophile Information Exchange . The report found that while two groups linked to PIE received almost £500,000 from the Home Office, the paedophile group itself did not get any cash. But Mr Hulbert believes paperwork that could prove grants were paid straight to PIE may be among 114 files relating to child sex abuse lost by the Home Office. Breaking 35 years of silence, he said he had raised concerns with Clifford Hindley, his boss at the Voluntary Services Unit at the Home Office, when asked to renew a grant in 1979 for PIE, thought to have been worth around £30,000. He told ITV News he went to Mr Hindley and said: ‘Look, Clifford, what the hell are we doing funding an organisation like PIE?’ He added: ‘I had young children and PIE were openly campaigning for the reduction of the age of consent to four. ‘Secondly, it seemed crazy that we should be funding an organisation that was advocating a lessening of the constraints around child abuse when one of our constituent organisations was the Department of Health, which was spending a lot of money to prevent child abuse. ‘I remember having a frank exchange with him about this and his arguments [for continuing payments] were, one, it was recognised as a legitimate if not necessarily appropriate campaigning organisation. Secondly, I have a very clear recollection that he told me it was being funded at the request of Special Branch.’ He said Mr Hindley ordered the grant to be paid. But the fact that it was a renewal suggests money had also been paid by the Labour government of James Callaghan, which left office in 1979. It is not known why Special Branch would request the payment, although suspicions have been raised that undercover officers were trying to infiltrate the group to find prominent members who could be blackmailed.","Baroness Butler-Sloss faced demands to resign hours after appointment .

"Google isn’t the only firm looking to create phones that can be upgraded, rather than replaced. The Puzzlephone lets owners swap parts in and out of the handset either when they break, or when a better version of that particular module is released. The Finnish firm behind the plans is currently testing prototypes of the device, and hopes to release the handsets by the second half of 2015. Scroll down for video . The Puzzlephone (pictured) from Finnish-based Circular Devices lets owners swap parts in and out of the handset either when they break, or when a better version of that particular module is released . Circular Devices began working on the project in 2013. Each Puzzlephone is based around three elements - the Spine, Heart and Brain. The phone’s LCD display, microphone, main buttons and speakers connect to the Spine. Its Heart contains the battery and so-called secondary electronics, while the Brain is where the camera and processor is kept, alongside the main circuitry of the device. Each of these three segments can be slid out of the core, and replaced with another. According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Each phone . will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - . made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized . endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of . phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. Circular Devices recently commissioned Rauno Huttunen and his team at Versoteq to create the prototype, which was printed using a 3D printer. ‘As we are facing ever greater challenges of increasing consumption and decreasing resources,’Circular Devices explained, 'we need new solutions. We need mobile standards that enable resource efficiency as well as platforms for hardware innovation. 'When one part of the phone needs repair or upgrade there is no need to replace the entire device. 'Puzzlephone was established to create that change - to create a mobile industry that is both ecologically and socially sustainable.' Mr Huttunen added: 'We liked the openness of Puzzlephone, and the modularity of it and we can use it to demonstrate the capabilities of 3D printing.' In addition to switching out the hardware modules, Puzzlephone’s operating system will also be customisable. In the future, the firm said it will release Puzzlephone standards to developers and manufacturers so they can use the concepts in their own devices. Circular Devices plans to release the first Puzzlephone during the second half of 2015. It is currently seeking funding for the device, and is testing the prototype. In October, Google unveiled the first working prototype of its own modular phone called Spiral 1. In a video, an engineer is shown turning on the device, unlocking it and launching an app during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston. Individual modules are shown being added to, and removed, from the handset including the LED module, battery, processor, speaker, and a USB port.

Dubbed Spiral 1, the device (pictured) is demonstrated during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston. Individual modules are shown being added to, and removed, from the handset including the battery, processor, speaker, and a USB port . 'The first step is figuring out how is this is going to work,' explained the creative agency. 'What are going to be the functions of the different parts of the system? And then from there, we select specific components and draw schematics.' 'Once you have a layout, you get the boards fabricated. 'It’s magical when you open up the box and say ""oh my goodness, that’s the thing we’ve spent all these months designing.' The firm said that when the power is applied for the first time to the modules, it's what is known as the Smoke Test. 'Your primary thought at that point is, is this thing going to start smoking?' continued the engineer. In the video, an engineer is also shown turning on the device (pictured), unlocking it and launching an app. According to the developer kit files released in April, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module . 'Is it going to overheat? Is there some critical error or not? And then, once we have the individual pieces working we put them into the complete system.' In the video, a board is shown fitted with connectors. The designers then demonstrate sliding the components in and out. In the Spiral 1 prototype, 50 per cent of the phone is taken up by the modules, but Toshiba has made custom chips for Spiral 2, which the company said will increase the amount of space on the device.

"Former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit claimed there was a mindset in the 1980s to protect the system . The Thatcher government may have orchestrated an Establishment cover-up of child abuse by senior politicians, Lord Tebbit claimed today. The former Tory party chairman claimed there was a mindset to ‘protect the system’ which has been to shown to have gone ‘spectacularly’ wrong because incidents of abuse grew. The Home Office has ordered a full-scale legal inquiry into claims of an Establishment cover-up, after admitting it has lost 114 files including a dossier relating to allegations of abuse. David Cameron is to appoint a top lawyer to investigate the Government’s handling of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity. The file was first passed to Home Secretary Leon Brittan by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 – but subsequently lost. Mark Sedwill, the Home Office permanent secretary, said a massive review of 746,000 Home Office files covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘573 relevant files which had been retained’. However, he added: ‘The extensive analysis of the central database identified 114 potentially relevant files had been destroyed, missing or not found. 'The investigation identified 13 items of alleged child abuse, nine of which were known or reported to the police including four involving Home Office staff. ‘The remaining four, which had not been previously disclosed, have now been passed to the police.’ Today Lord Tebbit, a minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government from 1979-87, said social attitudes at the time had been wrong. He told BBC One’s Marr Show : 'At that time I think most people would have thought that the establishment, the system, was to be protected and if a few things had gone wrong here and there that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into it. 'That view, I think, was wrong then and it is spectacularly shown to be wrong because the abuses have grown.' Asked if there had been a ‘big political cover-up’ 30 years ago, Lord Tebbit replied: ‘I think there may well have been but it was almost unconscious. It was the thing that people did at that time. ‘You didn’t talk about those sorts of things. It is not the sort of thing that people did. Not even if I may say so, television journalists, let alone the politicians. ‘I think Mr Cameron is right initially to have looked for a distinguished judicial figure to have a look to it, to see what the dimensions of the problem are to report back fairly quickly I hope and then will arise the question of what further sort of inquiries is needed into it.’ There is no suggestion Lord Tebbit knew about the cases at the time. Only last year, a review - carried out for the Home Office by a HM Customs and Revenue investigator - concluded the relevant information in the Dickens file had been passed to the police and the rest of the material destroyed in line with departmental policy at the time. The disclosures have intensified calls from MPs for Mr Cameron to hold an over-arching inquiry into all the allegations of historic child sex abuse from that period. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the loss of 114 files by the Home Office, relating to historic allegations of child abuse in Westminster, had been on an 'industrial scale' and called for a quick resolution. He told BBC Breakfast: 'What is a huge surprise is that it is 114 files out of what appears to be 527, which contained material that was relevant. So that’s a loss of files on an industrial scale and before we jump to conclusions and we rely on innuendo let us follow a process in all this, but let’s get that process done quickly.' A dossier of allegations of abuse was first passed to then-Home Secretary Leon Brittan (left) by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, but it has been lost or destroyed . Labour MP Simon Danczuk said there was a lack of appetite to confront abusers . Senior politicians and the police are reluctant to tackle allegations of abuse in Westminster, a senior Labour MP has claimed. Simon Danczuk, who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, said there was a culture of 'move along, nothing to see here'. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he also claimed police officers feared political intereference. 'Among the higher echelons of party politics, where the real power resides, my impression is that there is little appetite to confront the abusers in their midst,' Mr Danczuk said. 'Quite the opposite. The mood is defensive, the approach is dominated by silence. 'Move along, nothing to see here,' or 'what's the point in raking all that up old boy?' is the attitude I have seen time after time.' He said he was visited by police officers 'to discuss an investigation into a current parliamentarian accused of horrific child abuse'. He said the police asked him: 'Did I think it was likely that their inquiries would be met by political interference.' He went on: 'I looked at them in utter disbelief. How can the police put a Cabinet Minister behind bars for lying about speeding points but be worried they couldn't properly investigate someone for child abuse? 'The incident spoke volumes about the mindset that pervades politics. This kind of obstructive, 'Look the other way, sweep it under the carpet' thinking threatens to drag politics to new depths of public hate.' The pressure has been growing since Labour MP Simon Danczuck - who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith - raised the issue of the Dickens dossier at a Home Affairs Committee hearing. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the latest review but said that it still did not go far enough. 'The Home Secretary doesn't seem to have grasped the gravity of this and so officials and Downing Street have not yet taken the action we need,' she said. 'Given the many different inquiries, Theresa May must establish an overarching review led by child protection experts. This would draw together the results from all the different cases, investigations and institutional inquiries to allow us to learn from the failure of previous decades and keep children safe in the future.' Meanwhile, differences emerged in the government about the need for a Hillsborough wide-ranging inquiry into allegations of abuse at the highest levels. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that he did not rule out a wider inquiry but he made clear that the ongoing police investigations would have to take precedence. 'I assume any additional inquiries wouldn't be able to second guess or even look into the matters which the police are looking into already,' he told the BBC1 Sunday Politics programme. Education Secretary Michael Gove disclosed that officials in the Department for Health and the Department of Education had been looking at some of the historic examples of child abuse and at the need to improve child protection. 'At the moment we are reviewing within the Department for Education exactly what we can do in order to keep children safe now,' he told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. 'I think it is important both that we analyse what has happened in the past when a different culture prevailed, but also it is really important that we ensure that those who are keeping children safe now - teachers and social workers - are supported.' Alison Millar of the law firm Leigh Day which representing some of the victims of alleged child abuse, said it was now 'an absolute necessity' that there was an independent inquiry into alleged abuse within Westminster. 'This cannot be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault, it will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power,' she said. 'To be relevant, and effective, any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard. At the moment the allegations are so serious. and go so far up in the Government, to make many survivors fear for their safety.' But Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude insisted it was 'too soon' to call for an overarching inquiry, though he added that may be the answer longer term. Appearing on the Sky News Murnaghan programme, he said: 'We need to be very open about these things so that there can't be any hint of a cover-up and I know that is how this will continue to be approached.' Asked whether there was a need for an overarching inquiry, he replied: . 'That could slow things down. 'The first thing to do on this front is simply to have the inquiry, the investigation that has been launched, that will be done very quickly and then let's see where that takes us. 'It may well be the answer then is to have a much broader inquiry but I think it is too soon to come to that conclusion.'","Ex-Tory party chairman says it was 'more important to protect the system'

"David Cameron's advisor on child abuse Claire Perry said there was a 'chumocracy' in Westminster looking to protect itself from paedophile claims . David Cameron's advisor on child abuse has lashed out at the Westminster 'chumocracy' that has protected itself from allegations of paedophilia. Tory junior minister Claire Perry said Parliament was full of 'too many people with the same interests and the same out-of-touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own'. Her damning remarks come amid allegations that a paedophile network was operating in Westminster and was being protected by senior politicians. Home Secretary Theresa May this week launched an inquiry into organisations including churches, the security services and the BBC. A separate review will also examine the failures in Westminster to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse. It came after it emerged last week that an explosive dossier of papers allegedly naming high-profile child abusers in Westminster had been handed to the Home Office in the 1980s - but had since gone missing. Miss Perry, the MP for Devizes, questioned why it has taken so long to take the allegations seriously. Writing in her local newspaper The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald she said: 'Why has it taken so many years for allegations to be believed and action to be taken? 'Part of the problem can be traced, in my view, to the ‘chumocracy’ that for too long has been at the heart of the so-called Establishment, consisting of too many people with the same interests and the same out-of-touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own. 'It is this sort of persistent ‘otherness’ that so many of us are determined to change, to make the system more representative, more real and more normal. Some may say we have not succeeded yet but we will keep on trying.' Miss Perry added: 'The other, and more worrying part of the problem is the way that the voices of victims were ignored for so long – children told to keep quiet, ridiculed, or threatened – with tragically the most vulnerable of all being more likely to be targeted for abuse. 'That, to me, is the real scandal and we must do all we can to make sure that when victims speak out they are heard and action is taken.” Home Secretary Theresa May last week unveiled two investigations into allegations of historic child abuse . Miss Perry also raised concerns about cyberbullying and online grooming.' She said: 'There are not just historic cases to be considered and for many it is the replacement of the ‘known’ worries with those that are less quantifiable in the modern world, like cyberbullying or online grooming where children are flattered, cajoled and sometimes threatened into meeting predators online or in the real world with serious and damaging consequences. 'The new raft of online safety measures and better education of parents and children about cyber dangers will help, but it is a reminder that technology amplifies the threats to children that have existed in the offline world for a very long time.'","Claire Perry says  politicians have 'out of touch sense of entitlement'

"Photographer Cinnamon Heathcote Drury, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, was cleared of racially aggravated assault . A portrait photographer to the stars wept yesterday as she was cleared of pushing over a pregnant woman and calling her a terrorist in a supermarket row. Cinnamon Heathcote-Drury had also been accused of calling the family of the hijab-wearing woman suicide bombers, and telling her: 'I'm a British citizen. I don't know where you came from.' But a jury took only 15 minutes to acquit her of racially aggravated assault after hearing that the police investigation was a 'shambles'. And the prosecution accepted during the hearing that she was a 'wonderful person' who was 'eloquent and well-spoken' and not a racist. Isleworth Crown Court heard she had offered to help mother-of-three Mounia Hamoumi, who was six months' pregnant at the time, unload her shopping trolley after her husband refused to help because he was too busy looking after their children. The confrontation began after her husband told Miss Heathcote-Drury to 'get lost' as they queued for the till at Tesco in Kensington, West London, in November. Prosecutor Nermine Abdel Sayed said Miss Heathcote-Drury became 'aggressive', adding: 'You used the words “suicide bomber” and “terrorist”.' Miss Heathcote-Drury was also accused of saying: 'You're probably claiming jobseeker's [allowance]', and of pushing Mrs Hamoumi to the floor. Miss Heathcote-Drury denied pushing Mrs Hamoumi and using any racist language, saying that the comments attributed to her had been 'made up' and that she had been the victim of an assault. She said she was told by the husband 'You **** off', before being tripped up by Mrs Hamoumi as she tried to walk away. She also claimed Mrs Hamoumi kicked her in both shins, punched her and slammed her arm on a supermarket trolley. On trial: Isleworth Crown Court had heard Heathcote Drury called a Muslim family 'terrorists' But police declined to pursue Miss Heathcote-Drury's allegations of assault and charged her. Her defence barrister told the court . that the police investigation was a 'shambles' with no evidence of . injuries on the alleged victim and no independent witnesses who saw the . alleged shove. The jury also heard that Miss Heathcote-Drury had repeatedly requested CCTV footage of the fracas from the store and the police. But she was told by police five months after the incident that the footage did not show anything of significance for the case.

"It has been revealed that Elizabeth Lauten, the former GOP staffer who called Sasha and Malia Obama 'classless,' was herself arrested for shoplifting as a teen . The GOP staffer who was forced to resign today after calling the first daughters 'classless' is now being exposed as a hypocrite. Elizabeth Lauten, 31, stepped down from her job as communications director for a Republican representative after her Facebook diatribe against Sasha and Malia Obama's behavior and dress at the annual Turkey pardoning sparked outrage online. Evidence has now emerged indicating Lauten didn't exactly practice what she preached when she was a teen, growing up out of the public eye in North Carolina. When Lauten was 17,  just a year older than the president's eldest daughter Malia, she was caught stealing from a Belk department store in her hometown, according to court records obtained by the Smoking Gun. Lauten was charged with misdemeanor larceny for the crime in December 2000, but since she was a first-time offender she qualified for the District Court's deferred prosecution program and the charges were eventually dropped. Public records also show that Lauten was ticketed at the age of 19 for speeding and running a red light in Virginia. MailOnline reached out to Lauten for comment, but she did not respond to calls or emails. The Obama Administration responded to Lauten's comments on Monday, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying he was surprised a congressional staffer would use a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize the first family. He says individuals who frequently speak publicly tend to be mindful of how their words are perceived. Earnest added that it's common sense that first daughters should be off-limits to criticism. Earlier Monday, after thousands of calls for the self-professed media expert to be sacked, Lauten agreed to resign from her post as communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher of Tennessee. Scroll down for video . Scene of the crime? According to court documents obtained by the Smoking Gun, Lauten was 17-years-old when she was caught stealing from a Belk store in North Carolina. Public records indicate she was living near Jacksonville, North Carolina at the time, which has one Belk store in the local mall (pictured) Harsh: Lauten wrote that 13-year-old Sasha (center) and her sister Malia, 16 (right), should 'dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar' in her controversial Facebook post . Lauten told NBC News by phone on Monday morning that her resignation is already 'in the works,' four days after her controversial post on Facebook went viral. 'Dear Sasha and Malia,' she wrote in the post, 'I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class.' Resigned: Elizabeth Lauten has stepped down as communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher after writing this (left) diatribe against Malia and Sasha Obama on Thanksgiving, slamming their attire and attitude . Lauten added: 'Act like being in the White House matters to you. 'Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. 'And certainly don't make faces during televised public events.' Sasha, 13, was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks, worn over bare legs. Her sister Malia, 16, wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper. The White House has not commented on the incident. Lauten apologized for her post hours later, writing that 'judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart', saying that 'hours of prayer' had shown the error of her ways. The girls' expressions during their father's Thanksgiving address prompted playful comments on social media. After the President had pardoned the designated bird, a four-month-old 49-pounder called Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey. 'Nah', she replied, in a rare departure from her usual, gracious disposition, which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers. But Lauten's reaction sparked outrage. The incident was not Lauten's first social media slip-up. In August, she posted a tweet from her boss's verified Twitter account about 'shagging'. Stephen Fincher's followers were baffled when he tweeted: 'God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,' in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio. Lauten later deleted the post and apologized for the 'accident' - but insisted 'shagging' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference. 'It had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don't think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn't have it,' she said, according to Politico. Following mass outrage to her post on Thursday, Lauten deleted it, set her profile to private, and issued an apology: 'I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager. Apology: Hours later she removed the original outburst, issued an apology and set her page to private . 'After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. 'Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart. 'Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.' Over the weekend, Lauten's critics defended Malia and Sasha by tweeting the renowned picture of George W Bush's daughter Jenna drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party, cigarette in hand, while her father was in office. The 2001 photo, which earned the then 19-year-old the nickname Jenna And Tonic, went viral with the hash tag '#classy'. Other responses included a picture of the moment Jenna, one of the former president's twin daughters, stuck out her tongue at White House photographers while riding in the presidential limousine. 'Did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a FRAT party? good lord,' one Twitter user wrote. Another commented: 'The Bush twins used fake ID's to get into bars. & Jenna Bush stuck out tongue at press. Is that 'classy?' @DCGopGirl #tcot #UniteBlue.' One wrote: 'Where were your ignorant comments on the Palin family brawl, the Bush girls (Jenna & Tonic).' 'So Sasha and Malia Obama have no class? Two words: Jenna Bush. #ElizabethLauten,' one tweet read. And one said: 'I have a feeling that Jenna Bush & sister are a little ticked off at #ElizabethLauten for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight.' Not fair: Twitter users rushed to defend the girls who Lauten said 'deserve a spot at a bar' rather than the White House . Unimpressed: The First Daughters looked bored and unimpressed by their father's jokes about turkey .

"Manchester United's 5-3 capitulation at Leicester in September was, Louis van Gaal confessed on Saturday, his darkest day in charge at Old Trafford. ‘It’s still a mystery,’ wrote the United boss in his programme notes ahead of the rematch with the Premier League’s bottom club. If he was looking for answers, Van Gaal got them all before half time here. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Manchester United 3-1 Leicester City .

Three goals were more than enough on this occasion, United’s 3-1 lead never looking like the prelude to another dramatic collapse, in spite of the way they sleepwalked through the second half at times. Indeed, Van Gaal’s only criticism on Saturday was that they ‘killed the game too much’. ‘We lost the away match and we have taken revenge,’ he said. ‘We have dominated, especially in the first half. ‘In the second half, I want to kill the game but I have to admit my players did too much to kill the game. We have played more balls backwards and wide than forwards. you have to play forward without risk. ‘But I am very pleased. I have seen here a team that is playing more like a team.’ Van Gaal had demanded goals after seeing United score a mere five in their last six games and he could have few complaints at the response. Just as he did at Leicester in September, Robin van Persie was the man to set the ball rolling after an awfully dour opening in which he was guilty of spooning one of precious few chances 10 yards into the air. The Dutch striker made no mistake when opportunity knocked again in the 24th minute courtesy of great work by his international teammate Daley Blind. Falcao, Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Adnan Januzaj and Daley Blind (left to right) congratulate Van Persie (centre) Van Persie thanks fellow countryman Blind, pictured in the background with Rooney and Januzaj, for laying on an assist . United’s summer signing from Ajax picked Andrej Kramaric’s pocket in midfield as he anticipated a pass out of defence and instantly floated a pass over the top of the Leicester defence. Van Persie looked suspiciously offside as he raced to meet it but the first-time finish was outstanding, driving the ball beyond Mark Schwarzer with his weaker right foot. ‘The first goal was offside but they are honest mistakes,’ said Leicester boss Nigel Pearson, perhaps too graciously. ‘Sometimes they go for you, sometimes they don’t. It’s unhelpful to have decisions go against you but that’s how it is. ‘But it would be wrong of me spending too much time pointing out one decision in a game against a team who played exceptionally well.’ Having scored the first, Van Persie set up United’s second five minutes later.

Red Devils captain Rooney congratulates Falcao following his first-half goal at Old Trafford . Leicester’s lack of pace was ruthlessly exposed again as he spotted Angel di Maria’s overlapping run and played the ball into the Argentine’s path as he accelerated away from Wes Morgan. Di Maria’s low shot was saved by Mark Schwarzer but Radamel Falcao was ahead of Ritchie de Laet and Marcin Wasilewski to bundle the ball home from close range and claim his fourth goal for United. Van Gaal said: ‘I am more happy that Falcao was scoring because Robin has already scored enough goals. Falcao needs that goal more than Robin. It is fantastic that they scored and beautiful goals also.’ United made it 3-0 a minute before half-time when Adnan Januzaj —making his first league start since early November — forced a corner from the left. Blind met Wayne Rooney’s cross with a glancing header and Morgan couldn’t get out of the way fast enough as the ball ricocheted off his head and into the net. Even the Leicester fans who sang ‘we’re going to win 5-3’ knew lightning would not strike twice. ‘The pure maths of it,’ said Pearson. ‘Three down and people can smell a heavy defeat.’ However, the second half developed into something of a procession for United and it was only when they switched off that Leicester got even a glimpse of goal.

Then substitute David Nugent was presented with half a chance by Phil Jones’s lackadaisical backpass to David de Gea, and the goalkeeper had to be alert to block Nugent’s effort from a tight angle. Leicester did claim a consolation goal in the 80th minute, however, after United failed to clear. Blind was unfortunate to be hit in the face by the ball at close quarters and was still clearing his head when Esteban Cambiasso flicked the ball into the path of Marc Albrighton. His cross to the back post found Wasilewski whose downward header was too powerful for De Gea.

"In what prosecutors called a drug smuggling conspiracy involving Mennonites and a Mexican drug cartel, a man was sentenced on Monday to 15 months in prison for aiding the movement of tons of marijuana to the U.S. Mennonite Abraham Friesen-Remple was expected to be released later in the day after a judge sentenced him to time served as part of a plea deal he made in October. Prosecutors said he played a minor role as a driver, helping the Juarez cartel smuggle drugs in gas tanks of cars and inside farm equipment. A Mennonite man who allegedly helped a Mexican drug cartel smuggle tons of marijuana into the U.S. was released today after a 15-month sentence (stock photo) Friesen-Remple was one of seven people indicted, all but one of whom are members of a Mexican Mennonite community in Chihuahua. Prosecutors also say the Mennonites also grew marijuana for the cartel. The investigation involved wire taps in which 32,200 calls were recorded in Spanish and a German dialect used by Mennonites . Authorities said the operation moved to North Carolina after the arrest of a person who ran a Colorado Springs, Colorado, auto body shop involved in the case. Court records show Friesen-Remple delivered a shipment of marijuana - hidden in a farm bulldozer - to a home in Shelby, North Carolina. DEA agents tapped his phone and learned he was getting directions from someone in Mexico. The next month, a fellow member of the drug ring, who became a cooperating witness, told agents Friesen-Remple delivered the 1,575 pounds of pot that agents found during a search of his home, according to court records. Friesen-Remple was arrested on August 20, 2013, in the Santa Testa Point of Entry in New Mexico. He pleaded guilty to using a telephone to facilitate the distribution of marijuana. During sentencing, U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer noted his lack of criminal history and limited role in drug distribution. The Mennonite community in Chihuahua dates to the 1920s, when thousands of Mennonites moved from Canada to northern Mexico to preserve a way of life rooted in farming and objection to military service. They continue to farm and ranch in isolated communities.","Abraham Friesen-Remple is expected to be released later Monday after a judge sentenced him to time served as part of a plea deal .

"It may not have been available on tap, but it appears our primate ancestors enjoyed alcohol millions of years ago. Researchers believe early man developed a gene mutation that meant they could metabolise fermenting fruit lying on the ground. It was previously thought alcohol was a relatively recent addition to our diet and the direct fermentation of food happened around 9,000 years ago. Cheers: Our ability to drink alcohol has been traced back to genes found in the common ancestor humans share with gorillas (right) and chimpanzees who lived 10 million years ago . The latest study, led by Professor Matthew Carrigan from Santa Fe College in Florida, looked at the alcohol gene ADH4 from various times in almost 70 million years of primate evolution. From this, his team were able to identify a single variant that emerged about 10 million years ago. It helps breaks down ethanol - the only type of alcohol that can be consumed - in the digestive system. The findings shows that early humans - or hominins - adapted to metabolise ethanol long before human-directed fermentation. Bottoms up: The mutation spotted by the researchers coincided with the change to a terrestrial lifestyle, and may have given human ancestors a selective advantage as it meant they could eat highly fermented fruit when food was scarce. This same trait can be seen in chimpanzees today . The mutation spotted by the researchers coincided with the change to a terrestrial lifestyle, and may have given human ancestors a selective advantage as it meant they could eat highly fermented fruit when food was scarce. And it could explain why tree-dwelling orangutans still can't metabolise alcohol while humans, chimps and gorillas can. Alcohol dehydrogenase 4 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ADH4 gene. The enzyme is found throughout the aesophagus, stomach and intestines. However, not all ADH4s are the same, meaning some species of primate can effectively metabolise ethanol while others are unable to. For instance, the ADH4 enzyme in our more ancient and arboreal ancestors did not efficiently oxidise ethanol. According to the study, the change suggests exposure to dietary sources of ethanol increased in hominids during the early stages of our adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. 'Here we resurrect digestive alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH4) from our primate ancestors to explore the history of primate-ethanol interactions,' said Professor Carrigan. 'The evolving catalytic properties of these resurrected enzymes show that our ape ancestors gained a digestive dehydrogenase enzyme capable of metabolising ethanol near the time they began using the forest floor about 10 million years ago. 'The ADH4 enzyme in our more ancient and arboreal ancestors did not efficiently oxidise ethanol. 'This change suggests exposure to dietary sources of ethanol increased in hominids during the early stages of our adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. 'Because fruit collected from the forest floor is expected to contain higher concentrations of fermenting yeast and ethanol than similar fruits hanging on trees this transition may also be the first time our ancestors were exposed to - and adapted to - substantial amounts of dietary ethanol.' In the study, the evolutionary history of the ADH4 family was reconstructed using genes from 28 different mammals - including 17 primates - collected from public databases or generated from DNA extracted from tissue samples. Pictured are the amino acid changes in the evolution of humans. ADH4 proteins are shown along tree branches. Ancestral ADH4 proteins examined in this study are shown by numbered nodes within the tree. Branches of the tree in red indicate enzymes active against ethanol . 'Ancestral reconstructions of ADH4 demonstrate the ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas possessed a novel enzyme with dramatically increased activity toward ethanol and we suspect this novel metabolic capacity was adaptive to this hominin ancestor,' said Professor Carrigan. 'This transition implies the genomes of modern human, chimpanzee and gorilla began adapting at least 10 million years ago to dietary ethanol present in fermenting fruit. 'This conclusion contrasts with the relatively short amount of time - about 9,000 years - since fermentative technology enabled humans to consume beverages devoid of food bulk with higher ethanol content than fruit fermenting in the wild.' He said the history has implications not only for understanding the forces that shaped early human terrestrial adaptations but also for many modern human diseases caused by alcohol today. Early results of the study were revealed last year, with the final results recently reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Study looked at gene ADH4 in 70 million years of primate evolution .

Carl Bovard, who is blind in one eye, believes living with 14 big cats including two lions, six tigers and a desert lynx, is a risk worth taking . Playing pool with Tyson an eight-month-old African Caracal at his home in Melrose, Florida . After an accident left him blind around 13 years ago, Mr Bovard realised the main thing he missed was seeing animals – so when he regained sight in one eye he adopted his first two tiger cubs. The 43-year-old set up Single Vision – his educational, non-profit company – nine years ago and welcomes tours to his house and 274-acre garden in Melrose where his animals live with him. 'There are many dangers that come with keeping these animals and you've just got to take all the precautions you can to stay safe,' said Mr Bovard. 'There's no doubt about the fact that death would be the worst outcome from this. I know I'm dicing with death.

Sanctuary owner knows he is dicing with death every time he cuddles Sampson a five-year-old Siberian tiger . He enjoys playing and wrestling with Sampson in his back yard, even though he weighs more than 700lbs . 'Instinctively they just know to go straight for the vitals – when I'm with them I never give them a free shot at my neck.' Mr Bovard plays rough with the tigers, allowing them to recreate the honing of the natural hunting talents they would develop in the wild – but that does not come without its drawbacks. 'I've had a leopard bite me on the nose and I had to get that sewed back together. I've also had my shoulder separated, he added. 'I was playing with a few of the cats and another decided to join the fun. He ran at me and they can get up to around 50 miles per hour in a couple of strides – that hurt. 'But when they're growing up they play really rough together in the wild. It's how they hone their natural instincts – I can't deny them that.' Every Sunday, Mr Bovard treks to the local Walmart, where he picks up about 1,500lbs of meat for the week as his big cats can get through 200lbs in a single sitting. This is around $400 for food per cat. He then stores the meat in six freezers in a shed by the alligator cage.

His biggest tiger is a Siberian named Samson – he weighs more than 700lbs and is over nine and a half feet tall when he stands on his back legs. Despite the fact that Samson could tear him in two with one swipe of his massive paw Carl still carries his food right to him. He added: 'Some people use a guillotine system to feed their tigers but I walk the food right in. 'I have a great relationship with the animals but it changes when I have food in my hands.' 'They become very territorial. I like to keep my distance from them – I don't want to push it, they snarl and growl when you go anywhere near them but that's their natural instincts.' He currently has two lions, two bobcats, three cougars, two Bengal tigers, two Siberian tigers and an Asian black leopard in his backyard. The future of his facility and others like it across the USA  is being challenged by a petition seeking a federal ban on licensees who allow the public to have direct or physical contact with big cats.

The future of his facility and others like it across the USA is being challenged by a petition seeking a federal ban on licensees who allow the public to have direct or physical contact with big cats . Despite the controversy that comes with keeping and breeding big cats in captivity, Mr Bovard believes his organisation is helping tigers and lions. 'Having these cats in captivity and being able to show them off gives people a chance to get a passion for them,' he said. 'It is essential that we keep them in captivity to create that passion in people and make them want to help these beautiful animals. 'People say to me – they belong in the wild but my question to them is – what wild? 'There are seven billion people on this planet and we are destroying the habitat of these animals. 'Pretty soon the only tigers left are going to be those in captivity and they may need to be used to repopulate the wild. 'I do what I can to give these guys the best lives possible and I want to work to ensure more tigers and lions in captivity are better treated.'

He currently has two lions, two bobcats, three cougars, two Bengal tigers, two Siberian tigers and an Asian black leopard in his backyard . Before they go out into the  enclosure in Carl's back garden all of his animals live in his modest Florida home. He added: 'Your furniture pays the price as they're very destructive but it's important that they are socialised before going into the yard. 'We've got to get them used to being around people and other animals so inside the home is the best place for them. 'But as much as they are socialised they are still wild animals with wild instincts – these big cats will never be domesticated. 'But we have tigers and lions living together now – they would never encounter each other in the wild and I don't think they would get along if they did.'

'We are angry because this is not an isolated event,' teacher Magdalena Catalan, 34, told reporters. 'Many of us are parents and we see very ugly things in this country that we want to fight.' The government is combing the hills of southern Guerrero state with horseback patrols and is sending divers to look in lakes and dams, but has not found the youths missing since Sept. 26 .

"Charged: Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42 (pictured) is accused of murdering British citizen Claudia Seye Aderotimi in 2011 . Scroll down for video . A transgender goth singer known as the 'Black Madam' accused of injecting a fatal dose of silicone into a dancer's buttocks before sealing the wounds with super glue, has broken her silence. Padge Victoria Windslowe said she felt remorse over the death of 20-year-old Claudia Seye Aderotimi, but shouldn't be charged with murder because she only wanted to help people at her 'pumping parties'. 'The Philadelphia District Attorney's . Office would like to promote [the] thought that it was greed, . recklessness and malice that fueled my conduct,' the 42-year-old wrote in a letter sent to Philadelphia's Daily News. 'However, . I swear that my aim was noble in nature. I simply really just loved the . feeling of ... helping others feel more beautiful, wonderful and . magical about themselves - just as someone once helped me.' Windslowe, from West Philadelphia, also revealed that she rejected a plea deal to serve 15 to 30 years in prison for third-degree murder. The maximum sentence for that crime is 20 to 40 years. She instead offered to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and serve the maximum sentence of 2.5 to five years. In a letter to D.A. Seth Williams obtained by Daily News, the hip-hop artist wrote that pleading guilty would allow her to honor Aderotimi's memory and avoid a trial. 'Please let us amicably put this case to rest without any more negative press and media attention on our city ... which a trial like this would bring,' Windslowe, who was born male, wrote. Black Madam: Goth singer Padge Victoria Windslowe (pictured) used to inject silicone into women's buttocks at 'pumping parties' without a license or medical background . Performer: Padge Victoria Windslowe, also known as Black Madam (pictured left and right) is a transgender goth singer who has a range of music videos on YouTube . According to the District Attorney's Office, Windslowe held a 'pumping party' in a hotel room near Philadelphia . International Airport in February 2011, during which she injected silicone into . Aderotimi's buttocks for free. Windslowe, who does not have an injecting license, then allegedly closed the wounds with glue and cotton balls. When Aderotimi, a British citizen, complained of chest . pains, Windslowe allegedly told her to drink more fluids and to call an . ambulance if needed, before leaving the party. Aderotimi, an exotic dancer, . died a short time later of a pulmonary embolism which, law-enforcement . officials say, was caused by Windslowe's . silicone. The musician, whose videos and interviews can be viewed on YouTube, was charged with third-degree murder in July 2012 after a lengthy investigation involving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. By that time she was already in custody, having been charged with . aggravated assault for a silicone butt injection that gravely injured a . 23-year-old woman in February 2012. The woman was allegedly coughing up blood and was also treated for a blocked artery in her lung at Temple University Hospital. Police believed Windslowe had performed at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations and using different names to avoid detection. Tragic: British citizen Claudia Aderotimi, 20 (pictured left and right) had a heart attack after complaining of chest pains within hours of a botched silicone bum injection in a cheap hotel room . At the time of her 2012 arrest, DA Seth Williams said Windslowe was arrogant and greedy. 'Her conduct cost one young woman her . life and placed countless others in danger,' he said. 'The defendant put . her own greed above the public's health and safety, and instead of . being remorseful she bragged about prospective clients.' Windslowe's  court-appointed defense lawyer said it was 'grossly inappropriate' for his client to have contacted Daily News, but echoed her claims that she did not commit murder. 'The commonwealth, by filing a . third-degree-murder charge, is claiming there's malice. The defense will . claim that there isn't malice. That's for a jury to determine,' David S. Rudenstein said. Windslowe's trial is scheduled for February 17, 2015.","Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, is charged with murdering Claudia Seye Aderotimi, 20, in 2011 and gravely injuring a 23-year-old woman in 2012 .

"A mystery that has intrigued archaeologists and historians for centuries may be on the cusp of being solved thanks to the discovery of a ruin deep in the Amazonian jungle. The site, discovered by a multinational team of explorers, could be the tomb of Atahualpa, the last emperor of the Incas, who was executed by the Spanish after their conquest of South America. If they are right it could join the ranks of the great archaelogical discoveries, such as the tomb of Tutankhamun in Egypt, the Terracotta Army in China and the Rosetta Stone. What lies inside? The ruins in the Llanganates National Park in Ecuador (pictured) could shed light on a fascinating period and solve a longstanding mystery of South America's past . The structure, 260ft tall by 260ft wide and comprised of hundreds of two-tonne stones, is high up in the Andes in the Llanganates National Park in Ecuador, 20 miles from the town of Banos de Agua Santa, but an eight hours trek through treacherous swamps and mountainous jungle. Already, 30 artefacts have been found at the site. Some of those involved in the dig, which is at a very early stage, believe it could be the final resting of Atahualpa, the last Incan emperor, or the site of the Treasure of the Llanganates, a glittering haul of gold and other treasures gathered by his people to pay for his release following his capture by the Spanish. It is said Atahualpa promised to fill a room with priceless artefacts to secure his release, but he was rebuffed and throttled by the Spaniards in 1533. Adversaries: A depiction of the meeting between Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro (centre) and Inca leader Atahualpa (left). The Spanish captured the emperor soon after . The tomb of Atahualpa? A ruin in Ecuador could be the missing tomb of the last emperor of the Inca Empire . The structure may simply be an unusual rock formation, but a haul of artefacts have been found there . This room, which may have been where his body was secretly secreted by his followers, has fired the imaginations of explorers, but despite numerous expeditions it has never been found. That may soon change. Benoit Duverneuil is a French-American archaeologist, and one of those at the site. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'This could be one of the biggest archaeological discoveries ever.' He added that the structure looks like an ancient plaza and many of the stones have sharp edges, as if sculpted by human hands, but warns that is still may simply be an unusual rock formation. 'The team also believes the structure could contain rooms and other mounds nearby may be covering other structures. The ruins are high up in the Andes in the Llanganates National Park in Ecuador, 20 miles from the town of Banos de Agua Santa . Atahualpa was the last Sapa . Inca or sovereign emperor of the Tawantinsuyu (the Inca Empire) before he . was executed by the Spanish conquerors. He . became emperor when he defeated and killed his older half-brother . Huascar in a civil war after the death of their father, Inca Huayna . Capac. After his general's . victory over his half-brother, he took 80,000 men to seize the . capital, Cuzco, in Peru, to take the throne and stopped in the Andean city of . Cajamarca when he encountered the Spanish, led by Francisco Pizarro. Pizarro's . men ambushed Atahualpa's troops and captured him. Afterwards, the . Spaniards sacked the Inca army camp, in which they found great treasures . of gold, silver, and emeralds. Noticing . their desire for precious metals, Atahualpa reportedly offered to fill a . large room with gold and silver for them to save his own life. Faced . with an attack from Ruminahui, one of the emperor's loyal generals, the . outnumbered Spanish saw Atahualpa as too much of a liability and decided . to execute him. After a mock trial he was garrotted, a method of death . he chose himself. The Spanish gave Atahualpa a Christian burial in Cajamarca, but numerous accounts suggest his body was exhumed by his followers and mummified. Ecuadorian historian Tamara Estupinan believes Ruminahui brought the emperor’s mummy to what is now Ecuador for safekeeping. A member of the expedition displays an artefact. The site is deep in the rainforest and difficult to access . The wall slopes at a 60 degree angle and has a flat area at the top, where many of the artefacts were found. Some experts believe the summit was used for human sacrifices, as the incline could be to allow severed heads to roll down the side. However others in the team, comprised of British, French, American and Ecuadoreans, believe the site dates back to shadowy pre-Inca cultures from before 500 BC. British author and researcher Bruce Fenton has desrcibed the difficulties of working at the site, which is rife with killer bees and is covered by mud and vegetation. He said: 'This is a very inhospitable area and is still considered very dangerous because of the landscape.' 'It seems artefacts are spread over a wide area of inhospitable jungle and this only makes sense if a long-lost settlement is present.' The Ecuadorean government is expected to start an official expedition soon. Some of the rocks found could be elaborate carvings, but some experts believe they could simply be unusual rock formations .","Newly-discovered site in Ecuador could be resting place of Atahualpa .

"Teachers are having to toilet train five-year-old children who come into school in nappies and are unable to say their own name, a report exposing the 'heart-breaking' educational failures in England has warned. More than 60 per cent of primary school staff said they had noticed an increase in the number of children wetting or soiling themselves at school during the past five years, according to a survey quoted in the report by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ). And staff in some schools said they routinely carried disposable gloves to clean up after pupils who were not potty trained. Findings: Weaker children may be better off at lower performing schools, research from the London School of Economics has shown . The chairman of the working group that drew up the report, Sir Robin Bosher, he said that one in ten children in each class he had seen was 'so unsociable that they hurt others, adults and other young children'. Education experts who put together the survey for the right-wing think tank said they had been told of children entering primary school at the age of four who 'commonly act as though they are 12 to 18 months old'. They added that 19 per cent of four-to-five-year-olds could not sound or name letters of the alphabet or link sounds to letters, and six per cent of boys did not know English was read from left to right. The report, which looked at education in England between 2007 and 2012, blamed 'shockingly acute disadvantage' in children's home lives that 'stretches the capacity of schools and threatens to place those children at a disadvantage for the rest of their school careers'. The CSJ also warned that pupils from poor white families - particulary white British boys - were in danger of becoming an 'educational underclass' as they slipped further behind children from ethnic minorities. White . British boys from the poorest families – already the lowest achievers – are now half as likely as boys from impoverished Chinese or Indian . families to get good qualifications and far less likely to succeed than . boys from the worst-off black Caribbean or African families. Performance discrepancy: Girls from poor white British families are doing marginally better than their male counterparts but they are both falling behind . White girls from worse-off families . are also far adrift of their contemporaries in ethnic and cultural . minorities, the analysis by the  Centre for Social Justice said. Mark Edwards, the principal of Manston St James Primary Academy in Leeds, said: 'Sometimes I see children arriving at school aged four or five unable to string a sentence together, almost completely unable to speak. I can easily spot which children have not gone to nursery. These children get easily frustrated, explaining why some bite or lash out in the classroom.' The . CSJ blamed the low aspirations of poor white families, benefit . dependency and the failure of schools to encourage white  children in . the same way they have tried to help minority children. Janet Cooper, programme manager at Stoke Speaks Out, which tackles language delay in the Staffordshire city, told researchers: 'I believe most parents love their children but do not have the knowledge and skills to promote their development fully. Widening gap: The underachievement of poor white children has become even more pronounced . 'Parents do not always realise the . significance of the first three years when the majority of brain . development is taking place, and fall foul of marketing of dummies, . forward-facing buggies, bottles, TV, game stations, iPods. 'Many . parents opt for what they think is an easy life – putting the child in . front of the TV – but do not realise that this will cause them more . issues in the long run.' The . report, from the pressure group founded by Work and Pensions Secretary . Iain Duncan Smith, called for further and faster education reform to . reverse the educational decline among poor white British children. Christian Guy, director of the CSJ, . said: ‘These figures are sobering. They suggest that despite much money . and effort white working-class boys are in danger of becoming an . educational underclass. ‘We . need to take a close look at the reasons behind this growing inequality . and re-assess the measures we are taking to close the performance gap.’ The . deepening failure of white boys in school was first noticed a decade . ago and the widening gap is set out in figures for those on free school . meals and who gain five A* to C GCSE grades, including English and . maths. Only 26 per cent of white boys on free school meals reached the benchmark last year, compared to 40 per cent of black boys. Among all pupils who have free school . meals, 36 per cent achieve good GCSE grades. More than two thirds of . Chinese pupils from poor families hit the target mark and more than half . of those from Indian or Bangladeshi families. Non-British . whites from poor families, including boys whose parents come from . Eastern Europe, have similar levels of achievement to black boys. Despite efforts under two governments to improve the performance, the . gap has widened rather than narrowed. White boys are 0.5 per cent down on their 2007 levels, while black boys are up by 3.9 per cent.Girls from poor white British families are doing marginally better, with 35 per cent hitting the GCSE target, compared to 41 per cent of all girls from poor backgrounds. Educational underclass: White working class boys' grades have slipped even further behind their peers' Only Roma gypsy and Irish traveller children do worse than poor white British children. The report said that traditionally white working class families put a low value on education because high qualifications were not necessary to get jobs in industry. Their attitudes have lagged behind as the economy has been transformed. Worklessness in regions that were once heartlands of heavy industry has also taken its toll. The CSJ quoted a Midlands headteacher saying: ‘Families where generations of parents have been on benefits have created dependency and a lack of aspiration and ambition.’ The report also pointed to Ofsted findings that some schools had effective programmes for helping minority children but little for white British pupils in trouble. The report was drawn up by a group headed by Sir Robin Bosher, a former primary school head who now leads the Harris Federation of academy schools. He said: ‘Educational failure is too common in our current system. It affects disadvantaged children and makes reform urgent.'","Poor British white boys less likely to succeed than nearly any other group .

"Ryan Donaldson was back at his desk with a throbbing head and little recollection of the night before. This, however, is no tale of drunken debauchery. Rather, the 15-year-old had just written his name in Newcastle’s history books as their youngest reserve-team scorer and his Toon-daft pals at St Cuthbert’s High School – former home of John Carver, Sting and Declan Donnelly - wanted to hear all about it. Donaldson, though, had been knocked unconscious shortly after his record-breaking goal on a bruising night against Blackburn Rovers at Morecambe’s Christie Park and, even to this day, his memory is sketchy. Ryan Donaldson (right) in action for Cambridge against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round . The 23-year-old is on top of the world as he celebrates the League Two's side result against United . But the schoolboy had announced his arrival and big things were expected. There was an England call-up and, by the following summer, Kevin Keegan handed the teenager his debut in Mallorca. He shared an agent with Alan Shearer and went with Newcastle’s record goalscorer to a book-signing session at a Tesco superstore – it all amounted to Donaldson being touted as United’s next superstar. But his is a typical tale of one hyped so young and, after failing to make the grade on Tyneside, he dropped out of the Football League. Where his tale differs from the majority, however, is that Donaldson’s career is again on the rise. On Tuesday night, having been man-of-the-match during Cambridge United’s shock goalless draw with Manchester United in last month’s FA Cup Fourth Round, he is aiming to give Louis van Gaal the headache. For the 23-year-old – who has scored three times at Wembley for the U’s - it is another taste of the stage he craves. ‘The first game was incredible. They’ve been criticised and we think they got a rollicking at half-time, but honestly, they’re so good,’ Donaldson told Sportsmail. ‘But we did so well and got what we deserved. For me, to get man-of-the-match was brilliant. Donaldson says Angel di Maria (centre) has agreed to give him his shirt after the FA Cup replay .

But we’re dreaming of doing a Bradford now, it just shows what can happen with a bit of discipline and belief and we’re not just going for the occasion. ‘Although Angel Di Maria has promised me his shirt – I hope he doesn’t want mine because we’re running low and need to pay £40 to replace them if we do swap!’ What about Donaldson? Given that he shared an England Under-17 dressing-room with United’s Phil Jones and Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere – and scored 10 goals from 15 appearances for the young Lions - why isn’t he lining up on Tuesday night in red as opposed to yellow? After his release from Newcastle in 2012, the midfielder moved south of the Tyne to Gateshead. He then followed former Newcastle academy boss Richard Money to Cambridge and netted twice in last season’s FA Trophy Final victory before getting the winner in the Conference Play-off Final against former club Gateshead. He reflects: ‘I don’t think all of the hype helps when you get tagged as the next such and such. I was just a schoolkid loving playing for my hometown club. ‘When I got released I’d been there 12 years and it was difficult, but it was a bit of a relief at the same time and I admit I wasn’t good enough. Donaldso (left) was handed his Newcastle debut by Kevin Keegan in a pre-season friendly against Mallorca . The midfielder (right) in action for the Toon against Accrington in the Carling Cup second round in 2010 . ‘But when players get released too many drop out of the game– they lose hope and think their chance has gone. ‘For me, when you’re in those England squads, everyone builds you up. But in reality, only a few make it at the very top. ‘Others have to drop down and rebuild their career, I’m one of those players.’ Donaldson is taking small steps. For example, he prefers to share a house with four of his team-mates - Will Norris, Richard Tait, Liam Hurst and Rory Gaffney. It is all a far cry from the million-pound Cheshire mansions in which their FA Cup opponents reside. Before the first game, Gary Lineker paid the boys a visit. Donaldson is relishing taking on Louis van Gaal's side again in the FA Cup on Tuesday night . ‘It was a bit scary standing having a coffee with him in the kitchen,’ said Donaldson. ‘He was making a documentary and probably thought it was a bit strange all of us living together, but it works for us. ‘We all get on well – there’s the odd argument over dishes or making the tea or playing darts, but I find living with the lads helps, especially being so far from home.’ If League Two Cambridge do pull off an upset then perhaps Van Gaal will suggest Messrs Rooney, Van Persie and Di Maria buy a pad together. For Donaldson, another star-man showing and he might just land the move which gets him a place of his own.","Cambridge travel to Old Trafford on Tuesday night for their FA Cup fourth round replay .

"He may have recently been named the richest man in America for the 18th consecutive year, but for Bill Gates a hamburger is still a hamburger. The Microsoft co-founder, and man with a $59billion wealth, told students during a talk at the University of Washington in Seattle, that beyond a certain point, it all tastes the same. His words came as Sean Parker, the Napster founder and former Facebook president who has a $2.1bn fortune, complained of having added worries now he is rich and questioned whether life was better before. Same taste: Speaking to a packed atrium at the University of Washington yesterday, Bill Gates said past a point of wealth all hamburgers were the same . Keen listeners: Gates had been asked by a student at the university's Seattle campus how to get rich like him . Asked by a student for advice on how to become as rich as him, 56-year-old Gates replied, according to geekwire.com: 'I didn't start out with dream of being super-rich. 'Even after we started Microsoft we looked at guys running Intel and thought, wow, that must be strange (to be rich). It is, sort of strange. 'Wealth above a certain level is a responsibility to leave to children, which may or may not be good for them, or figure out how to give it away. 'I can understand wanting to have millions of dollars, there's a certain freedom, meaningful freedom, that comes with that. 'But once you get much beyond that, I have to tell you, it's the same hamburger.' Referring to a Seattle-area fast-food chain he added: 'Dick's has not raised their prices enough. But being ambitious is good. You just have to pick what you enjoy doing.' In 2000, Gates and his wife Melinda combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which funds health and education projects around the world. It claims to be the biggest philanthropic organisation in the world and currently has more than $25billion in funds.

Despite playing for England at junior level, Ibe is eligible to play for Nigeria until he plays a competitive international for the senior side. Nigeria's interest has not gone unnoticed by the England set-up, who are eager not to lose Ibe. The youngster also had a successful spell at Derby before Brendan Rodgers recalled him last month .

"Is this the face of the Zodiac killer, the serial murderer behind one of America’s most notorious unsolved crime sprees? A mugshot of the man said to be the Zodiac Killer by his son bears a remarkable resemblance to the police sketch of the murderer who slayed at least five people in the late 1960s. Scroll down for video . The face to fear: In searching for the father who abandoned hum, author Gary Stewart discovered that Earl Van Best was not only his father, but also, he claims, the Zodiac Killer This mug shot taken whenr Van Best was arrested for the rape of a minor, Stewart's mother . Uncanny: The police sketch of the Zodiac Killer bears a remarkable resemblace to Stewart's father's mugshot . Gary Stewart, who was adopted at birth, claims his search for his real father, Earl Van Best Jr, led to the discovery that the antique bookseller was the serial killer who terrorized San Francisco in the 1960s. His years of painstaking research are now revealed in the blockbuster book published today, The Most Dangerous Animal of All. The Zodiac killer killed at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Stewart claims to have 'legally sound' and 'forensic evidence' that proves that Van Best is the man responsible . for one of America's biggest unsolved crimes. Stewart's father died in Mexico City in 1984. Stewart . claims that his main breakthrough came when he solved one of the Zodiac . killer’s ciphers sent to the newspapers during his spree. The Zodiac boasted at the time that if police cracked the code then his identity would come out. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved. In a letter written to the San Francisco Examiner he had written ‘in this cipher is my identity”. Stewart found the words 'EV', 'Best', and  'Jr'. Cryptic: Stewart discovered Van Best's name in one of the cyphers he sent to the media during his killing spree . After his discovery he also claimed that another expert found 'Earl Van Best Junior' written backwards in another code. The book claims that the chances of his father’s name being in two ciphers is 'astronomical'. Stewart then went onto match fingerprints taken from his father’s arrest and those from the crime scene. Both have a diagonal scar on them, he claims. He then had a handwriting expert match the writing from the letters with his father’s signature from his wedding certificate. Again he claims that he has an expert who would willing to stand up in court that they were a match. Stewart claims that all this is enough to solve the case but that the San Francisco Police Department may be reluctant because it would cause embarrassment. In a remarkable coincidence his mother Judy married Rotea Gilford one of the lead investigators in the case. He is now dead but Stewart is convinced that this would upset the department and that it may have caused them to try to 'shut down' the investigation into the case. 'The fact remains: Judy married Van, the Zodiac. Judy married Rotea, the homicide detective,' he concludes. He claims that he is still awaiting the results of DNA tests to see whether his matches fragments taken from the crime scene of the Zodiac’s killings. 'It will be interesting to see what happens,' he writes. Ice cream romance: A KPIX news report from August 31, 1962, featuries views of Earl Van Best standing before a judge in San Francisco, for sentencing. Van Best was being tried for the offence of eloping to Reno with 13 year old Judy Chandler. Because the couple had originally met in San Francisco in front of Herbert¿s Sherbet Shoppe, the media referred to this as 'The Ice Cream Romance' Stewart, who was brought up in Louisiana after being abandoned by his real father, said that he discovered the truth while looking for his biological father’s identity. According to the book, Stewart looked for Van Best after his birth mother contacted him, 39 years after she gave him up for adoption. Stewart claims that 'forensic evidence' helped show his father was responsible for the Zodiac crimes. The book's publisher, Harper Collins, told New York Magazine that the claims in the volume were found to be 'legally sound' by its lawyers. The publisher did not contact the San Francisco Police Department for review because they 'knew more than they're willing to admit.' Sentenced: Earl Van Best served a year in prison for marrying his child bride, who decided to try to find her son Gary Stewart 39 years later . Best had a criminal record for rape and fraud, and his mug shot, found by the author, clearly resembles the Zodiac Killer's police sketch, down to the eyeglasses. 'If you look at Gary’s photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac next to his father’s mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,' a spokeswoman for HarperCollins told New York. 'They look alike.' Stewart 'didn’t want to believe it,' she added. 'I don’t think most people want to know that their father is a notorious serial killer.' Son of a killer? Gary Stewart, pictured, claims in a new book that his biological father was the Zodiac killer . According to the book, Van Best was brought up by a Methodist minister and his wayward wife, who he would eventually divorce on grounds of adultery. Van Best was 27 and already divorced once when he met Stewart’s mother Judy Gilford at an ice cream parlor in San Francisco. He fell in love with her even though she was only 13 and they eloped to Reno to get married. Judy had her son in Louisiana and Van Best soon abandoned her and his child. She eventually gave Stewart up for adoption. Stewart, according to the book's description, looked for his father after his birth mother contacted him for the first time ever. It claims that 'forensic evidence' helped show his father was responsible for the Zodiac crimes. Never found: Law enforcement officers from two Bay Area counties and San Francisco met in San Francisco are seen in this Oct. 20, 1969 file photo comparing notes regarding the search for the Zodiac killer . Victims: From left are San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine, who was shot to death, Cecilia Shepard, 22, a student who was stabbed to death, and Bryan Hartnell, 20, who was stabbed but survived . The Zodiac killer killed at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved. 'If you look at Gary’s photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac next to his father’s mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,' she told the magazine. 'They look alike.' 'He didn’t want to believe,' she added. 'I don’t think most people want to know that their father is a notorious serial killer.' A San Francisco Police Department spokesman said that they would take any new leads seriously but they had yet to hear from Mr Stewart. But he refused to comment on speculation that the department had deliberately shut down any investigation. 'There would be no one happier than the San Francisco Police Department to have closure on this case,' said spokesman Albie Esparza. 'It has been open for more than 40 years. We urge the anyone with any new information to contact the police.'

"For almost a century, the pile of dusty old bones lay untouched and unappreciated in a darkened recess of a museum store. But now, it has emerged from the shadows after scientists realised it belonged to an undiscovered species of deadly prehistoric super-predator – the Blood-biting Tyrant Swimmer. The creature, which revels in the Latin name of Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos, would have terrorised the warm Jurassic seas around the British coastline around 165million years ago. Dino-dolphin: The creature resembling a hybrid dolphin and crocodile has been identified by scientists examining fossil remains discovered more than a century ago . The new research makes it one of the world’s oldest known ‘super-predators’ – carnivores that can feed on prey as large, or larger, than themselves. The toothy beast, described in the latest issue of the Journal of Systematic Paleontology, was a marine crocodile measuring up to 30ft long that looked part shark and part sinister dolphin. Its partial skeleton, including a jawbone and teeth, has been stored by the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow ever since it was discovered by an amateur palaeontologist in a clay pit near Peterborough in the early twentieth century. Its significance was overlooked for years until a team of experts led by the University of Edinburgh examined the creature and identified it as a possible ‘missing link’ between a group of ancient marine crocodiles and modern-day killer whales. Dr Mark Young, of the University of Edinburgh’s school of geosciences, who led the study, said: ‘It is satisfying to be able to classify a specimen that has been unexamined for more than 100 years, and doubly so to find that this discovery improves our understanding of the evolution of marine reptiles.’ He said that, at the time the creature lived, much of Europe was covered by a shallow sea, creating a chain of differently sized islands. Tyrannoneustes lived in this shallow sea, along with numerous other marine reptiles, including pliosaurs, plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. Unexamined: The partial skeleton of the creature had lay for almost a century at the Hunterian Museum, in Glasgow, before scientists made the discovery . Dr Young added: ‘Giant pliosaurs were even larger than the Tyrant Swimmer, so they might have feasted on the formidable species. ‘As its name suggests, however, Tyrant Swimmer would have been swift in the water, so it likely could have out-swam possible predators and used the swimming prowess to capture its own prey.’ He indicated that Tyrant Swimmer most likely evolved into an even more stealthy marine predator with very large and numerous teeth and a mouth that could open extremely wide. Dr Neil Clark, palaeontology curator at The Hunterian, said: ‘Little research has been done on this specimen since it was first listed in 1919. It is comforting to know that new species can still be found in museums as new research is carried out on old collections. ‘It is not just the new species that are important, but an increase in our understanding of how life evolved and the variety of life forms that existed 163million years ago in the warm Jurassic seas around what is now Britain.’","Bones kept in museum for nearly 100 years discovered to be deadly creature .

"The idea of capturing an asteroid may seem unbelievable to most. Yet following U.S President Barack Obama's instructions to Nasa that he wants to snare an asteroid and then launch it into the moon/earth orbit, the space agency has released a video of how it could be done. This is all part of the development of a potential manned mission to Mars. Scroll down for video . An asteroid is scouted out... Then the giant space vacuum will snare the its victim... ...and then the asteroid gets wrapped up just like you do with a rubbish bag . ...Before it is moved on towards the earth's atmosphere . The president wants scientists to find a small asteroid that could be shifted into an orbit near the moon and used by astronauts as a stepping stone for an eventual mission to Mars, agency officials confirmed. The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year. NASA would find an asteroid which is between 23 and 33 feet wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s. ‘This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we've ever been before - to an asteroid and to Mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining,’ NASA administrator Charles Bolden said. ‘We're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we're almost there.’ In 2010, Mr Obama proposed that NASA follow the International Space Station programme with a human mission to an asteroid by 2025. The agency has been developing a heavy-lift rocket and deep-space capsule capable of carrying astronauts beyond the station's 250 mile high orbit. The system would be capable of traveling to the moon, asteroids and eventually to Mars, the long-term goal of the U.S. human space programme. The president wants scientists to finding a small asteroid that could be shifted into an orbit near the moon and used by astronauts as a stepping stone for an eventual mission to Mars . ‘I think the asteroid-retrieval mission lays out a place for us to go,’ Kennedy Space Centre director Bob Cabana said. ‘It does everything that needs to be done as far as developing the technologies and the skills that we need for exploration beyond planet Earth.’ Mr Obama's 2014 spending plan proposes £68 million to start work on the new mission, which entails finding a 23 to 33 foot wide asteroid and robotically towing or pushing it toward Earth so it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. Astronauts aboard an Orion capsule would then blast off, land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis. ‘The plan combines the science of mining an asteroid, along with developing ways to deflect one, along with providing a place to develop ways we can go to Mars,’ said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. Barack Obama wants NASA to start work on a potential mission to Mars (image shows a concept for the mission) The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year . NASA has not yet estimated the total cost of the mission, but expects it to be less than the £1.7 billion estimated last year by the California Institute of Technology's Keck Institute for Space Studies. ‘We do not think at this point that it will be that expensive,’ NASA Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Robinson said. The Keck-led ‘Asteroid Retrieval Feasibility Study’ proposed relocating a 500-ton asteroid closer to Earth to give astronauts a ‘unique, meaningful and affordable’ destination in the next decade, meeting Mr Obama's deadline. Ms Robinson said Keck's cost estimate did not take into account projects already under way at NASA and proposed retrieving a type of asteroid that orbits farther away which would require a longer and more expensive mission. NASA also would look to partner with fledging space mining companies, such as start-ups Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, as well as agencies interested in planetary defence. It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s . ‘Obviously we're looking all sorts of interests in this asteroid mission in terms of the kinds of scientific and industrial uses that could be spawned from it,’ Ms Robinson added. Interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky-rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on February 15, shattering windows and damaging buildings. About 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris. The same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from Earth - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet. The incidents had created an imperative ‘to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting Earth,’ Mr Bolden said. ‘One of the serendipitous results from this [asteroid-retrieval] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid, to deflect it ever so slightly.’ Mr Obama is also requesting £535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017. The United States has been unable to fly astronauts since it retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011.","Obama wants Nasa to begin search for a suitable asteroid .

"A Mexican mayor and his wife have been accused of being involved in the disappearance of 43 students who are believed to have been abducted by a drugs cartel. Jose Luis Abarca, who is mayor of Iguala and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa are both accused of having strong links with the Guerreros Unidos cartel. Arbarca ordered the arrest of the 43 students who were protesting against the drugs gang on September 26, who were then handed over to the cartel. Scroll down for video . Mayor of Iguala,  Jose Luis Abarca, right, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, left, are on the run after Federal authorities accused him of taking monthly bribes of up to $220,000 from a drugs cartel . Abarca is accused of ordering the arrest of 43 students and handing them over to a drugs cartel . The mayor and his wife have gone on the run along with the police chief although 52 people have been arrested . The cartel is understood to have paid Arbarca a monthly retainer of up to $220,000 and effectively ran the city which is in the Guerrero state. Since the abductions, protests in the city have become increasingly violent with the burning of Iguala's city hall. The protests have prompted Mexican authorities to act and find the missing students. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said on Wednesday that investigators had found a total of nine mass graves containing 30 sets of human remains during the hunt for the missing students. He said officials were waiting for a second round of DNA tests, after a first round determined they weren't the bodies of the students. While the students remain missing, Murillo Karam said the arrests of Iguala police officers and the leader of the Guerreros Unidos gang, Sidronio Casarrubias, had provided more evidence about the events leading up to their disappearance. Murillo Karam said the students, who attended a radical rural teachers college, had gained the enmity of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca because of a previous demonstration in the city. He said Abarca ordered police to detain students who hijacked four buses because the mayor thought they were going to try to disrupt a speech by his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda. Abarca, his wife and the Iguala police chief are all fugitives. A total of 52 people, including police officers, Iguala officials and gang members, have been arrested in the case. Thousands of people took to the streets of Iguala to protest about the abduction of the missing students . Authorities had previously reported that the mayor's wife, Pineda, had family ties to Guerreros Unidos. But Murillo Karam said it was much more than that, reporting that Casarrubias, the arrested drug gang leader, said she was 'the main operator of criminal activities' in Iguala. Casarrubias also said the mayor had gotten payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt police force. After Iguala police picked up the students, Murillo Karam said, the youths were taken to a police station and then to the nearby town of Cocula. At some point they were loaded aboard a dump truck and taken — apparently still alive — to an area on the outskirts of Iguala where the mass graves have been found, he said. At that point, Casarrubias told authorities, one of his lieutenants told him the students were members or sympathizers of a rival gang, the attorney general said. Investigators discovered a mass grave containing 30 bodies although DNA tests confirmed they were not the missing students although further tests are being carried out in a bid to determine their identity . Since the abductions, protests have turned increasingly violent with mobs attacking government buildings . The families  claim that Abarca colluded with the drug cartel and is responsible for the abductions . Guerreros Unidos had sufficient money to bribe the mayor and local police force because they have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing opium poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for heroin destined for the U.S. market, according to a Mexican official. The official said Guerreros Unidos started turning more to opium after income from marijuana trafficking dropped, apparently because of legalisation of the drug in some U.S. states. After paying local farmers to grow opium poppies in the rough mountains around Iguala, the gang warehoused and shipped the opium out to other regions to be refined, the official said. He said: 'They stockpiled the paste; they sell it to other criminal organisations.' The cartel forces Mexican farmers to grow illegal drugs instead of legal crops according to investigators . Meanwhile, Mexican security forces have . arrested the wife of one of the country's most wanted drug . cartel bosses, Servando Gomez, authorities in the violent . western state of Michoacan said on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for state prosecutors in Michoacan said Ana . Patino was caught on a highway inside Michoacan, where the gang . led by Gomez known as the Knights Templar has posed a major . security challenge to President Enrique Pena Nieto. Patino was detained on a road connecting Mexico City with . the country's second biggest city Guadalajara, the spokeswoman . said, adding that she had no further details. Pena Nieto launched an offensive against the Knights Templar . at the beginning of 2014, capturing or killing many of the . gang's leaders. However, Gomez, also known as 'La Tuta', has . eluded the government's attempts to capture him. Until the crackdown in Michoacan in January, Gomez, 48, was . the most visible cartel boss in Mexico, appearing in a number of . videos posted online in which he sought to justify the gang's . actions. He even gave some interviews to international media. Mexican media has reported that Patino was Gomez's first . wife, and the mother of several of his children. The spokeswoman . said it is not clear whether the two have stayed married.","Mayor of Iguala Jose Luis Abarca and his wife are accused of helping gang .

"Apple's new iPad Air Plus will boast a 12.2 inch screen and four speakers to allow stereo sound however it is placed, it has been claimed. The new gadget is expected to be revealed next year, with some reports even claiming a larger 12.9inch screen. It will also feature a new, much faster A9 processor, according to Japanese magazine Mac Fan. Scroll down for video . The iPad Air Plus is expected to have a 12.2inch screen, dwarfing the iPad Mini with its 7.9inch screen (left) and iPad air (right) with a  9.7 inch screen. The report claims that the new iPad will include a 12.2-inch display, new A9 processor, four speakers to offer stereo sound in any orientation, and arrive sometime between April and June of next year. Bloomberg and others reported that Apple was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015, while a recent report from The Wall Street Journal claimed Apple had postponed mass production of the larger iPad from December 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. The latest rumors from the supply chain point to delays that will see mass production of the larger iPad start sometime in Q1 or Q2 of next year. The new larger iPad is expected to look like the recently launched iPad Air, with rounded corners, . The designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick. The new largter iPad is expected to look like the recently launched iPad Air (pictured), with rounded corners,The designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick. Latest rumors for the device claimed iPad Pro would sport a smaller 12.2-inch display and a profile of 7mm, which lines up with the drawings published in the latest Mac Fan issue today. Several reports have pointed to a yet to be announced iPad that will reportedly include a display measuring somewhere in the neighborhood of 12-inches, however reports have claimed various sizes ranging from 12 inches to 12.9 inches. It comes just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the iPhone 56 plus was impacting on iPad usage. The release of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet’s screen, and the display on its iPad mini. Pocket studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app, and compared the before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users. People with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad . And figures suggest this similarity could cause serious problems for Apple’s tablet range. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people use them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. In fact, the research found that people who recently upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. The research was carried out by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading later. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. ‘The bigger your phone’s screen, the more time you’ll spend reading and watching on it,’ explained the researchers in a blog post. ‘In fact, the bigger your phone’s screen, the more you’ll read and watch as a whole.’ It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. And iPhone 6 Plus consume content on their phones 80 per cent of the time - the same ratio of phone to tablet reading as seen on Android. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5 or 5S, and those with the 6 Plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone.

While those with a 6 Plus are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week and 36 per cent less over the weekend. ‘That being said, there remains one place where tablets still hold reign: your nightstand,’ added the researchers. ‘Regardless of which iPhone they have, users still reach for their iPads around 9pm for some late-night, bedtime reading.’ But, a larger screen does make it less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘This tells us that, at least for now, convenience and portability trump a better, and bigger, entertainment and reading experience.’","Japanese magazine claims to have found designs for the gadget .

"This incredible patchwork quilt of solar images shows the range of wavelengths that scientists use when investigating our Sun. The collage made from pictures taken by from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows how looking at the Sun in different wavelengths highlights various aspects of its surface and atmosphere. While taking a photo of the Sun with a standard camera will simply show its familiar yellowish, featureless disk, the star actually emits light in all colours. Scroll down for interactive graphic explaining each colour . Patchwork: This collage of solar images from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows how observations of the sun in different wavelengths highlights different aspects of the sun's surface and atmosphere. The collage also includes images from other SDO instruments that display magnetic and Doppler information . So scientists use specialised instruments, either in ground-based telescopes or space-based ones like the SDO, to observe light far beyond the limited ranges we can see with the naked eye. These different wavelengths convey information about different components of the sun's surface and atmosphere, so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star. Scientists describe the wavelengths using units of measurement known as Angstroms, which are equivalent to one ten-billionth of a metre. The familiar yellow-green light of 5,500 Angstroms, for example, generally emanates from material of about 5,700 degrees C (10,000 degrees F), which represents the surface of the Sun. Extreme ultraviolet light of 94 Angstroms, on the other hand, comes from atoms that are about 6.3million degrees C (11million degrees F). That makes it a good wavelength for looking at solar flares, which can reach such searing temperatures. By examining pictures of the sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done through such telescopes as Nasa's SDO, its Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and the ESA/Nasa Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) - scientists can track how particles and heat move through the sun's atmosphere. From the sun's surface on out, the wavelengths SDO observes, measured in Angstroms, are: . We see the visible spectrum of light simply because the sun is made up of a hot gas – heat produces light just as it does in an incandescent light bulb. But when it comes to the shorter wavelengths, the sun sends out extreme UV light and x-rays because it is filled with many kinds of atoms, each giving off light of a certain wavelength when they reach a certain temperature. Not only does the sun contain many different atoms – helium, hydrogen, iron, for example - but also different kinds of each atom with different electrical charges, known as ions. Each ion can emit light at specific wavelengths when it reaches a particular temperature. Scientists have cataloged which atoms produce which wavelengths since the early 1900s, and the associations are well documented in lists that can take up hundreds of pages. Solar telescopes make use of this wavelength information in two ways. Instruments that produce conventional images of the sun focus exclusively on light around one particular wavelength, sometimes not one that is visible to the naked eye. SDO scientists, for example, chose 10 different wavelengths to observe for its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. Each wavelength is largely based on a single, or perhaps two types of ions – though slightly longer and shorter wavelengths produced by other ions are also invariably part of the picture. Each wavelength was chosen to highlight a particular part of the sun's atmosphere. Other kinds of instruments, known as spectrometers, observe many wavelengths of light simultaneously and can measure how much of each wavelength of light is present. This helps create a composite understanding of what temperature ranges are exhibited in the material around the sun. But spectrographs don't look like a typical picture, but instead are graphs that categorise the amount of each kind of light.","Collage made from pictures taken in various wavelengths taken by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory .

"A polygamist with five wives and 24 children has revealed the logistical nightmare he faces when it comes to Valentine's Day in the latest episode of TLC's My Five Wives. Brady Williams, 43, from Salt Lake City, Utah, is followed by cameras as he forks out a small fortune on flowers in a bid to keep his spouses happy. He then loads the bouquets into his SUV and darts from house to house to drop them off, performing the same kiss and hug ritual over and over. 'It's a lot of work!' the construction project manager tells viewers. Scroll down for video . Brady Williams, 43, a polygamist with five wives and 24 children reveals the logistical nightmare he faces when it comes to Valentine's Day in the latest episode of TLC's My Five Wives. However, he adds that he's got the holiday down to a fine art and he knows exactly what will win the ladies over. 'I have never gone wrong getting flowers,' he grins. 'They just love them whether it's just one or a dozen, it's all good.' When he visits a local florist he requests five large, rose-laden bouquets containing 'similar but different' stems. Newest wife: Brady with 34-years old Rhonda - the couple have been married for 14 years and have four children, Eden, 13, Lake, 11, Arwen, eight and Nikolas, two . Second visit for the day: Brady with his fifth wife Nonie - they have been married for 16 years and have five children, Paul, 15, Rachel, 13, Marissa, ten, Aeyden, eight, and Tailee, four . Fourth delivery: Robyn and Brady have been married for 21 years and have five children, Hannah, 20, Lauren, 17, Dane, 15, Thomas, 13 and Trey, ten . Wife number three: Rosemary, 40, has been married to Brady for 19 years and has four children - Kimberly, 18, Taylor, 15, James, 14 and Brandon, 11 . My number one: Brady has been married to Paulie, 41, longest - they wed 21 years ago and have six children together, Karlie, 21, Joshua, 19, Madeline, 17, September, 15, Maura, 13, and Camry, ten . When the store worker asks what to write on the accompanying cards, Brady casually replies: 'Just Happy Valentine's Day I love you and then five different names.' He later interjects: 'Are you catching on that I'm a polygamist?' to which the bemused woman replies: 'Either that, or you've got lots of girlfriends.' Brady visits his fifth wife, 34-year-old Rhonda first, followed by his fourth wife Nonie, 35, second wife Robyn, 40, third wife Rosemary, 40, and lastly, his first wife, Paulie, 41. 'I should have just got them delivered,' he says breaking a sweat. Brady has been married to Paulie the longest, and the two tied the knot 21 years ago. Speaking out: The Williams, whose children range in age from two to 20, said they took part on TLC's My Five Wives to dispel the myths surrounding their unconventional lifestyle . Fruitful: The six spouses have two dozen children between them . While his most recent marriage was to Rhonda, 14 years ago. Although polygamy is common within the Mormon community, the Williams' gradually withdrew from the fundamentalist church after reevaluating their core beliefs. Talking about their unusual living arrangement, Brady said: 'The reason we're together is because we love each other, we're committed and we want this. 'We've . got six people who we have to keep on falling in love with over and . over again and I think, personally, that that's a beautiful thing.' The Williams, whose children range in age from two to 20, said they took part on TLC's 'My Five Wives to dispel the myths surrounding their unconventional lifestyle. 'All of America's having sex,' Brady previously said in an interview with the Huffington Post. 'And it's no big deal to just answer it and to just say 'Duh no we're not perverted, we're not twisted, we're just normal. Normal times five.'","Brady Williams, 43, from Salt Lake City, Utah, forks out a small fortune on flowers in a bid to keep his spouses happy every year ."
"The father of a popular TV sportscaster has been sentenced to 60 years for shooting dead his wife while she slept. Allan Kustok, 63, maintained his innocence on Wednesday in an Illinois courtroom after he was convicted of shooting wife, Anita 'Jeanie' Kustok, in the head in 2010. His attorneys have argued 58-year-old Mrs Kustok, a teacher, committed suicide on  September 29 in the bedroom of their home in Orland Park. Cook County Judge John Hynes called the case one of the most baffling he's handled because Allan Kustok was 'living the American dream'. Scroll down for video . Allan Kustok, 63, (pictured left) maintained his innocence on Wednesday in an Illinois courtroom after he was convicted of shooting wife, Anita 'Jeanie' Kustok (right), while she slept in 2010 . The judge was reportedly referencing the 63-year-old's extra-marital affairs before his wife's death. He said Kustok was supposed to be his wife's protector 'but became her executioner'. Kustok said in court on Wednesday that he delayed taking his wife of 34 years to the hospital after finding her body because she was beyond help and he wanted to 'say good-bye on my own terms'. He also claimed that he didn't want a crowd of strangers in his home. The 63-year-old told the court that he had awoken that morning to the sound of a gunshot. The couple's daughter, sportscaster Sarah Kustok, testified  she believed her father was innocent and left court without comment on Wednesday . After 90 minutes, he wrapped her body in a robe and drove her body to hospital. The couple's daughter, sportscaster Sarah Kustok, appeared at the sentencing hearing on Wednesday and left with comment. Miss Kustok works as a presenter for the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network (YES). She had testified in March on behalf of her father and said that she believed he was innocent. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the couple’s son, Zak, did not attend the hearing because he did not support his father. Prosecutors said during trial, that Kustok shot his wife at close range with a Magnum revolver he had given her as a wedding anniversary gift. Defense lawyers said that he had given his wife the weapon as protection because his job often meant he was out of town. Judge Hynes said on Wednesday that Mrs Kustok had been a 'bright light in our community' and her death was a big loss to family and friends. Peggy McKain, Mrs Kustok's sister, said that their mother, Phyllis Runko, who died in 2011 spent the last year of her life with a broken heart, not knowing what happened to her daughter, the Sun-Times reported. Allan Kustok is planning to appeal his sentence. His attorney Rick Beuke said outside court: 'For the very first time in my 30-plus years doing this kind of work, I can honestly say in my heart I believe an innocent man is going to be going to the penitentiary.'

"The family of a teenager who went missing from her home four days ago have made an emotional appeal for her to get in touch with them. Alice Gross, 14, was last seen by her mother at 1pm on Thursday when she left her home in Hanwell, Ealing, west London. Alice, a pupil at Brentside High School, told her mother, Rosalind Hodgkiss, she would be home by 6pm but has not been seen since. Missing: Alice Gross, 14, was last seen leaving home in Hanwell near Ealing, west London, at 1pm on Thursday . Police and her family are increasingly concerned for the teenager as she has a health condition that needs treatment. Ms Hodgkiss said: 'What I would want to say is whatever she feels, or might have happened, we are not angry with her. We love her, we desperately miss her, we want to support her whatever is going on in her thoughts. 'We don't want to speculate about what might have caused her to go, if that indeed is what has happened. We want her to know how much we love her and miss her. 'There is a huge hole in everybody's life and we can't believe that she is not here.' Alice is white, 5ft 2in and slim, with shoulder-length, light brown hair. Appeal: Her family have issued an emotional appeal saying 'we want her to know how much we miss her' Police are concerned for her whereabouts as she has a health condition. They are searching nearby parks . She was last seen wearing dark blue jeans, a dark green lacy cardigan and blue denim Vans shoes. She may have had tartan-framed spectacles with her. Sergeant Chris Naughton, from the Metropolitan Police, said officers had spoken with her friends, carried out house-to-house inquiries and searched parks and open spaces in their efforts to trace her. He said: 'There is always a chance that she could have other friends that we don't know about and that is where parts of our lines of inquiry are going. 'Alice is a 14-year-old girl and like any teenager she goes online, and could have met people online. Searching: They fear she may have met people online or could be with friends she met on a songwriting course . 'Alice was up in Camden in mid-August doing a song-writing course at the Roundhouse and she may well have met some new friends up there that we don't know about, and that may be something we need to explore as a line of inquiry.' He added: 'She has not been missing before and that is always concerning for both the family and ourselves investigating the disappearance.

"Atletico Madrid chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin has called fans responsible for the violent clashes which resulted in the death of a Deportivo La Coruna supporter 'criminals and murderers'. Francisco Javier Romero Taboada - a 43-year-old married man  - was pulled from the Manzanares river near Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium with a severe head injury, advanced hypothermia and in cardiac arrest. He was taken to San Carlos Clinic in Madrid by ambulance but died shortly after. Deportivo La Coruna and Atletico Madrid fans clash outside Vicente Calderon Stadium on Sunday . Rival fans were filmed throwing objects at each other on and near the road alongside the Manzanares river . The man  was taken out of the river suffering head injuries, cardiac arrest and hypothermia, before dying . Spanish newspapers Marca and AS led their front pages on Monday with the tragic news . The violence started at 9am local time on Sunday before Atletico's 2-0 La Liga victory over Deportivo and lasted for an hour, with 200 people involved, according to Spanish newspaper Marca, who say 11 others - including a police officer - were injured and 21 arrests were made. AS, another Spanish newspaper, claim ultras from both clubs agreed to meet near the Vicente Calderon and that 24 arrests were made. Gil Marin condemned those involved and pleaded with fans to come forward with information that may lead to more arrests. He said: 'In a group of 4,000 people there will always (be) a motherf*****. These kind of criminals and murderers are hidden in the mass of people. They seize every opportunity to appear. What they have in their head is garbage. 'Atletico Madrid have banned 13 people for life for other, much-less-serious incidents. Those involved shouldn't be at Vicente Calderon ever again, they should be in jail. 'The most important (thing) is to determinate who is behind all this. I have friends with their sons who live in the area (where Atletico ultras Frente Atletico are located) and they are healthy people. 'The criminal have to go to prison and we are asking that anyone who knows anything to notify us. This incident hurts all of the work we done during recent years.'

We are at his family and friends' complete disposal to help them in any way we can.' Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo also led with story (black banner) on their front page on Monday . Marca used their front page on Monday to demand that action be taken to tackle violence in football, saying 'Enough excuses: we must rid football of violent people.' Spain's government anti-violence commission is due to meet on Monday to discuss Sunday's events. Spanish league authorities (the LFP) condemned the trouble and said on Sunday they had wanted the match postponed, but this was not possible. The LFP and Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) offered their condolences to the family of Romero Taboada. RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez explained that, after only receiving information about the seriousness of the incidents just before kick-of, it was considered 'counter-productive' to postpone the match due to security reasons. He said in Marca: 'Eleven minutes before the start of Atletico Madrid-Deportivo, Victoriano Sanchez Arminio (president of the referee's committee) received a call from the LFP and another from the match referee. 'He spoke with a member of the RFEF and, with the stadium full and little time left, for reasons of security and public order it was decided that it could be counter-productive to suspend it.'","Miguel Angel Gil Marin slams those involved in violent clashes which led to the death of Francisco Javier Romero Taboada on Sunday .

"Unflappable: Sir Rex Hunt in ceremonial dress . The puckish figure was ebullient. ‘Come in, come in — forgive the awful state of the place, we’ve had visitors, you know.’ It was just a few days after the end of the Falklands War, in June 1982, and Sir Rex Hunt, the islands’ governor, was still very much in character. I was among his first visitors to Government House in Port Stanley following his return to the islands. Some ten weeks earlier, it had been taken over by the Argentine army and the furniture was still largely in disarray. Anti-blast tape still criss-crossed the windows of the low, white stone house, which was built for governors in 1845. But — crucially — the Queen’s portrait (removed to a safe-house as the attack was beginning) was back on the wall, and Sir Rex ushered in his visitors with relish. It was not hard to see how this tiny figure,  barely 5ft 4in tall, had brazenly stood up to the heavily-armed invaders. True, he had added almost two feet to his height by first putting on his ceremonial plumed hat to face them. Among the list of famous quotations drawn from wars down the years, the words of Sir Rex, who has just died at the age of 86, will surely always raise a smile of pride among students of that brief war. Sir Rex ignored the outstretched hand of the new — and very temporary — Argentine governor, General Garcia, who admonished him, saying: ‘It is very ungentlemanly of you to refuse to shake my hand.’ Sir Rex replied in his sharp, staccato voice: ‘It is very uncivilised of you to invade my country.’ For the truth is that war was the very last thing Rex Hunt and his wife Mavis had expected when, in 1980, he became governor of the Falkands in what he knew was probably his last posting in the Colonial and Diplomatic Service. Born in Redcar, Yorkshire, in June 1926, he had been a Spitfire pilot in the RAF for several years before joining the Overseas Civil Service in 1951. He served in half-a-dozen places, including Uganda, where they were frequently without electricity and running water, let alone drainage, and South Vietnam, where he was the last British official to leave the British embassy in Saigon, handing the dangling set of keys to ITN reporter Sandy Gall as the Communist army from the North stormed in. Hero: Sir Rex, who was considered a hero in the Falklands, has died aged 86 . Governor Hunt and officials from the Foreign Office were forcibly evicted from the Falklands by the Argentine forces and sent to the Uruguayan capital Montevideo . Sir Rex returned as Governor following the 74-day war and remained in his post until 1985 . After this, Sir Rex thought, anywhere else would feel like a holiday. When the Falklands were offered, the Foreign Office said it would be ‘a tranquil but absorbing posting’. Not so! Two years later, Mavis and their two children, together with domestic staff from Government House, were sheltering in friends’ homes in Stanley while battle raged, and her portly husband was facing the invaders — incredibly — with a pistol. Everything that had led to this moment was astonishing, both militarily and diplomatically. First, the cynical FO had sent him there expecting this comfortable, mature family man to convince the islanders that their best interests would be served if they drifted away from Britain (7,000 miles away) and accepted Argentine sovereignty just across the water. Successive British governments, anxious to divest themselves of what they knew was potential trouble, had been considering relinquishing the British Dependency since the mid-Sixties. Argentina, of course, had been claiming sovereignty for 150 years. The Foreign Office saw Hunt as the ideal man, as he put it, ‘to gain the islanders’ confidence and talk them into accepting a lease-back solution with Argentina’. What happened, instead, was that Sir Rex found himself sympathising with their wish to remain British. As he wrote in his memoir, My Falkland Days: ‘I had previously determined that if it should ever reach the stage that the FCO instructed me to pursue a policy that I believed to be against the best interests of the Falkland islanders, I should have no alternative but to resign.’ Defiant: Sir Rex pictured with the Duke of York (left) who fought during the Falklands conflict as a naval helicopter pilot in 1982 and with then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband Sir Denis after the war in which Britain reclaimed them from Argentina (right) Sir Rex held discussions with the 1,800 islanders who made their feelings very clear: they were British and wanted to stay British. For his part, Hunt saw it as his moral duty to represent their views to London, not London’s views to them. As long as they wanted to stay British, their rights were the same as any other British people. Back at the Foreign Office, there was near apoplexy. Hunt had ‘gone native’. It wasn’t long before the then Tory Defence Secretary, John Nott, was announcing the withdrawal of the British Antarctic survey ship, the Endurance. It was ostensibly part of defence cuts, but the islanders saw it as a first indication of British withdrawal. Whether or not it really was an invitation to the Argentine navy, as they suspected, on March 19, 1982, a party of Argentine ‘scrap metal merchants’ landed on South Georgia, a tiny British island 800 miles east of the Falklands, and hoisted an Argentine flag. Rex was not only governor, he was also commander-in-chief of the Falklands, so he ordered a unit of Marines to remove them. To his astonishment, this was countermanded in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington. On March 31, the Foreign Office learned that an Argentine fleet had set sail for the Falkland Islands with orders to seize them. The U.S. was immediately informed, and Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations was told — but it was 24 hours before the FO passed this information to our man in Port Stanley. Sir Rex and Major Gareth Noot Royal Marines (left) and Major Mike Norman, Royal Marines (2nd left) speaking to Baroness Thatcher, then Prime Minister, at Number 10 . When it did finally arrive, this terrible news of an impending invasion was couched in words that read as though they had been dictated behind a yawn: ‘We have apparently reliable evidence that an Argentine task force will gather off Cape Pembroke early tomorrow morning, April 2. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.’ Dispositions with what? Rex Hunt had just 68 Marines. Desperately, he asked London for instructions. London’s hand-washing reply left him feeling very alone: ‘When you tell the islanders is up to your own judgment. When you arrest the Argentines is also up to you. ‘But we would advise you that although it seems very likely that an invasion will take place, there are still negotiations going on, and even at this late moment, an invasion might be avoided. ‘Your action in rounding up the Argentines might precipitate the very action we wish to avoid.’ But that is precisely what the plucky Sir Rex did, or at least indicated, with an order to his military force to ‘arrest’ the Argentines. It was a case of No Surrender. Battle began two hours later with heavy fire on Government House. Having only a small defensive force, he had to consider surrender, if only to prevent loss of life, but he quickly rejected the idea. Bit by bit, the Argentine forces pushed to within 20 yards of the house. But Sir Rex refused to leave his study, sitting at his desk brandishing his Italian-made pistol, resolving to shoot any Argentines who dared burst through his door. Eventually, with his free hand, he picked up the phone to an Argentine air force senior officer, persuading him to come to Government House for talks under the protection of a white flag . The officer came (cowering on the ground as his own confused troops mistakenly shot at him) and eventually, with a white sheet draped over Hunt’s own umbrella, the officer and the Falklands’ chief secretary walked together to the town hall to arrange a truce, enabling the wounded to be taken to hospital. Sir Rex pictured left with his wife Mavis pictured in 1984 during their . time in the Falklands, and in Stockton, Teeside where he retired to, . right . At this point, Sir Rex put down his pistol and ordered the Marines to lay down their weapons. To the Argentines, however, this appeared as a signal of defeat. Within hours, the Argentine soldiers were strutting into Stanley and lounging all over Government House — including the governor’s study. With Rex Hunt expelled from the island and flown to Uruguay, the Argentines thought they had reclaimed the Falklands. Fortunately for the islanders, though, back in London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had very different ideas from her own Foreign Office — and before long was ordering the assembly of a Task Force. Some ten weeks later, Sir Rex was returning to the Falklands in triumph. When, three years later, he retired from the governorship just before his 60th birthday, many islanders wept. He was more than their governor, he was their saviour. In recent years, he and his wife lived in Stockton-on-Tees where he played a little golf, had intermittent gout, gave talks about his time in the Falklands and was chairman of the Falkland Islands Association. He never tired of talking about the Falklands or its people. ‘They’re great British people,’ he declared that cold morning in 1982 soon after the war’s end, as he showed us into Government House and opened a bottle of wine. ‘Who would want to be anything else?’","Sir Rex Hunt became a household name when he was taken prisoner by the Argentine invasion force and expelled to Uruguay in 1982 .

"The CDC announced today a 21-day monitoring period for anyone returning to the U.S. from Ebola-stricken African nations. Director of the agency, Tom Frieden, said on Wednesday that from next Monday, October 27, the measures will be used in six states to give 'additional new safety'. Passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be asked for emails, phone numbers and addresses, as well as family or friend contacts, to make sure no one goes unnoticed. Scroll down for video . Customs Border Protection officers conduct pre-screening measures on a passenger arriving from Sierra Leone at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago last week. The CDC announced today that 21-day monitoring periods would be in place for all passengers arriving from African nations stricken with the virus . A CDC kit that travelers from Ebola-stricken West African nations will be given containing information cards and a thermometer. They will be required to make daily check-ins with state or local health officials to report their status . Travelers will be given a kit from the CDC which contains information cards, showing the symptoms, and a thermometer to take their own temperatures. Fending off demands to ban travel from Ebola-stricken West Africa, the Obama administration instead tightened the nation's defenses against Ebola by requiring that all arrivals from the disease-ravaged zone pass through one of five U.S. airports. The move responds to pressure from some Congress members and the public to impose a travel ban on the three countries at the heart of the Ebola outbreak, which has killed over 4,500 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, since it emerged 10 months ago. Beginning on Wednesday, people whose trips began in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone must fly into one of the five U.S. airports performing fever checks for Ebola, the Homeland Security Department said. Previously, the administration said screenings at those airports covered about 94 per cent of fliers from the three countries but missed a few who landed elsewhere. There are no direct flights from those nations into the U.S; about 150 fliers per day arrive by various multi-leg routes. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said 'we currently have in place measures to identify and screen anyone at all land, sea and air ports of entry into the United States who we have reason to believe has been present in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea in the preceding 21 days'. A member of a burial team sprays a colleague with chlorine disinfectant in Monrovia, Liberia on October 20. Passengers who arrive in the U.S. from the country along with Sierra Leone and Guinea will face a 21-day monitoring period . Since screening started October 11 at New York's Kennedy airport, 562 people have been checked at the five airports, according to Homeland Security. Of those, four who arrived at Washington's Dulles airport were taken to a local hospital. No cases of Ebola have been discovered. The other airports are Newark's Liberty, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. One man is currently being monitored for Ebola at the University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey. Homeland Security officials at the airports use no-touch thermometers to check for fever, which can be a symptom of Ebola infection. People who have been infected with the virus may not develop a fever and illness for up to 21 days, however. As the U.S. closed a gap in its Ebola screening, an Ebola-free African country said it would begin checking visiting Americans for the disease. Rwanda's health minister said on Tuesday that travelers who have been in the United States or Spain — the two countries outside of West Africa that have seen transmission  during the Ebola outbreak — will be checked upon arrival and must report on their health during their stay. No Ebola cases have been reported in Rwanda, which is in East Africa. The U.S. Embassy in Rwanda said that country is banning visitors who have recently traveled to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone, the three countries at the heart of the outbreak, as well as nearby Senegal, which had a single case . The change in U.S. policy falls short of demands by some elected officials and candidates for a ban on travel from the West African outbreak zone. Senator Chuck Schumer, described the action as an 'added layer of protection against Ebola entering our country'. The change comes as the CDC works to spread the word about its new protective guidelines for medical workers. The advice, released on Monday night,  had been sought by health workers after two Dallas nurses were infected while caring for a Liberian traveler, the first person diagnosed with the virus in the United States. The CDC said it's still unclear exactly how the nurses were infected, but the stronger rules will provide better protection. CDC officials demonstrated the recommended techniques Tuesday at a training session for several thousand health care workers in New York City. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged the health-care workers there to use their training to educate their families and communities. A passenger landed at Newark airport on Tuesday and following a screening was taken to a New Jersey hospital to be further evaluated for Ebola . 'Keep the anxiety down. Keep the fear down,' he said. Earlier CDC guidelines allowed hospitals some flexibility to use available covering when dealing with suspected Ebola patients. The new guidelines set a firmer standard, calling for full-body garb and hoods that protect worker's necks; setting rigorous rules for removal of equipment and disinfection of hands; and calling for a 'site manager' to supervise the putting on and taking off of equipment. They also call for health workers who may be involved in an Ebola patient's care to repeatedly practice and demonstrate proficiency in donning and doffing gear - before ever being allowed near a patient. The CDC cannot require hospitals to follow the guidance; it's merely official advice. The mother of Amber Vinson, one of the sick nurses, said her daughter is 'doing OK, just trying to get stronger' at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Debra Berry said she was glad about the new rules, even though they came too late to help her daughter and fellow Dallas nurse Nina Pham, who is being treated at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington. Pham's condition has been upgraded from fair to good, the NIH said late Tuesday. 'It should help ensure that no one has to endure what Amber and what Ms. Pham have had to go through these weeks, and their families,' Berry told ABC News. In Rwanda, a Ministry of Health document said all travelers from the U.S. and Spain would have their temperatures taken upon arrival and those with fevers would be denied entry. Dr. Agnes Binagwaho, Rwanda's health minister, said Tuesday the travelers will be required to fill a detailed form upon arrival at border entry points. 'It is definitely extra work for us,' Bingwaho said. 'We have to ensure that all citizens or any other travelers arriving from the above-mentioned countries, including the U.S., have to be screened in an extra careful manner and follow up on them during their stay.'","The measures will be introduced next Monday across six states, according to CDC director Tom Frieden .

"Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest maker of personal computers, has announced plans to cut 27,000 jobs. The move, which will affect about 8 per cent of the company's 350,000-strong workforce, will form part of a cost-cutting drive aimed at saving up to £2.2bn a year. The company, which has operations in 180 countries and employs about 20,000 people in the UK, said the changes would 'impact just about every business and region'. Cost-cutting: Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest maker of personal computers, is to slash 27,000 jobs . The jobs will go by October 2014 in the largest payroll purge in the group's 73-year history. It comes eight months after HP hired Meg Whitman as chief executive to turn the company around. The former chief executive of eBay joined HP last September as rival products such as the iPad tablet computer ate into HP's sales. Ms Whitman said: 'Work force reductions are never easy. 'They adversely impact people's lives, but in this case, they are absolutely critical to the long-term health of the company. 'Our goal is simple: a better outcome for the customers at reduced cost for HP.' Making changes: Chief executive Meg Whitman said the job losses were 'absolutely critical to the long-term health of the company' A spokesman for the company said it was too early to say exactly where the job cuts would hit, but no part of the business would escape some losses. 'We have not yet announced specific plans with regards to specific locations,' he said. 'We do expect the workforce reduction to impact just about every business and region.' As part of the changes, the head of HP's Autonomy division, Mike Lynch, is being replaced by Bill Veghte, HP's chief strategy officer. Mr Lynch will leave after what HP called a 'transition period'. Mr Lynch founded software company Autonomy as a small start-up and turned into one of the UK's largest technology companies. It was bought by HP last year for more than $10bn. HP said it would avoid as many redundancies as possible by offering early retirement packages. Word of the cut had leaked out in media reports late last week, so the news came as no surprise. Nevertheless, the sobering details overshadowed the release of HP's latest quarterly results. Although HP's earnings and revenue declined from a year ago, the numbers were better than analysts had projected. HP delivered another pleasant surprise by offering a forecast that raised hopes that the company may be poised to bounce back. Uncertainty: HP's UK headquarters in Bracknell, Berkshire. The company employs about 20,000 staff in Britain . 'While I wouldn't say we have turned the corner, we are making real progress,' Ms Whitman told analysts during a conference call. Ms Whitman cautioned that 'turning HP around is going to be a lot of hard work'. 'It's going to take time,' she added. 'But we know what needs to be done.' Investors were pleased, although it was unclear whether their glee had more to do with the cost-cutting or the company's performance during its fiscal second quarter, which ended in April. Competition: Rival products such as the iPad, left, and the iPhone, right, have eaten into HP's sales . HP shares surged $1.97, or more than 9 percent, to $23.05 in Wednesday's extended trading. That's still about half their value before HP parted ways with Mark Hurd, a cost-costing specialist who stepped down in 2010 amid a scandal revolving around the nature of his relationship with a former actress who worked as an HP contractor. An investigation uncovered inaccurate expense reports. The current troubles at HP have been blamed both on Mr Hurd, who cut research and development to boost profits, and his successor, Leo Apotheker, who failed to respond to the threat posed by a shift to computing on smartphones and tablets. Ms Whitman's plan calls for less bureaucracy so the company can respond more quickly to customer needs. She also wants to boost research and development to spur more innovation. HP, which is based in Palo Alto, California, has been struggling to sell more personal computers and printers, partly because they aren't needed as much now that people are spending so much time surfing the Web on phones and tablets such as Apple's iPad. The company's efforts to sell more business software and consulting services have been stymied by competition from the likes of IBM and Oracle. Hewlett-Packard employs about 20,000 in the UK, based at six offices: . Bracknell . London . Bristol . Warrington . Erskine . Belfast . Ms Whitman plans to funnel most of the savings from the job cuts into product development, with an emphasis on three areas: software services delivered online, a concept known as 'cloud computing'; data storage and analysis; and computer security. Some of the extra cash will go toward boosting HP's earnings, too. HP's workforce has undergone several other reorganisations during the past decade. Two of the biggest occurred during Mr Hurd's regime. HP announced 14,500 job cuts in 2005 in one of his first big acts as CEO. HP also announced 24,600 cuts in 2008 after buying technology consulting service EDS for $13.9 billion. HP did not say where the latest cuts would come from. It is combining its printer and PC divisions, which could reduce costs. The company earned $1.6 billion, or 80 cents per share, between February and April - down 31 per cent on last year's figures.","Eight per cent of company's 350,000-strong workforce will lose their jobs .

"Humans have long been blamed for hunting the American mastodon - an ancient relative of the elephant - to extinction. But new radiocarbon dating of North American fossils suggests that the animals became extinct before humans colonised the region. Experts are still not absolutely certain why the animals died out, but now think that changing habitats from forests to tundra could have played a role. While it was traditionally thought that mastodons (illustrated) roamed areas in the Arctic and Subarctic when it was covered with ice caps, scientists now think that that the area was only temporarily home to the animals when the climate was warm. They also disappeared before humans colonised the region . It was popularly thought that mastodons lived in the Arctic and Subarctic when the area was covered by ice caps. But, that view is at odds with what scientists currently know about the massive animals’ preferred habitat of forests and wetlands abundant with leafy food. To examine the mismatch, an international team of researchers carbon dated fossils and now believe that the Arctic and Subarctic were only temporary homes to mastodons when the climate was warm. The new findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicate that mastodons suffered local extinction several tens of millennia before either human colonisation - the earliest estimate of which is between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago. New radiocarbon dating of North American mastodon fossils suggests that the animals became extinct before human colonisation of North America. The researchers dated a collection of 36 fossil teeth (pictured) Just as with the dinosaurs, scientists are not certain exactly why mastodons became extinct. But new data suggests that mastodons became extinct in pockets of eastern Beringia around 75,000 years ago, following a habitat change from forest to tundra. Mastodons occupied high latitudes between 125,000 and 75,000 years ago when it was covered with forests. But ecological changes led to habitat loss and population collapse. After this, mastodons were limited to areas south of the continental ice sheets where they suffered complete extinction over 10,000 years before the first humans crossed the Bering Strait - or the onset of Pleistocene climate changes. The study says that local extinction of mastodons were 'independent; of their later extinction south of the ice. They also hint that the creatures died out before the onset of climate changes at the end of the ice age about 10,000 years ago, when they were among 70 species of mammals to disappear completely in North America. Ross MacPhee, a curator in the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History, said: ‘Scientists have been trying to piece together information on these extinctions for decades. ‘Was it the result of over-hunting by early people in North America? Was it the rapid global warming at the end of the ice age? ‘Did all of these big mammals go out in one dramatic die-off, or were they paced over time and due to a complex set of factors?’ Over the course of the late Pleistocene era, between about 10,000 and 125,000 years ago, the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) became widespread and occupied many parts of continental North America. Grant Zazula, a palaeontologist in the Yukon Palaeontology Programme, said: ‘Mastodon teeth were effective at stripping and crushing twigs, leaves, and stems from shrubs and trees. ‘So it would seem unlikely that they were able to survive in the ice-covered regions of Alaska and Yukon during the last full-glacial period, as previous fossil dating has suggested.' The researchers used two different types of precise radiocarbon dating on a collection of 36 fossil teeth and bones of American mastodons from Alaska and Yukon - the region known as eastern Beringia. The dating methods, performed at Oxford University and the University of California, were designed to only target material from bone collagen. Over the course of the late Pleistocene era, between about 10,000 and 125,000 years ago, the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) which is shown in this illustration alongside other large furry beasts, became widespread, and occupied many parts of continental North America . All of the fossils were found to be older than previously thought, with most surpassing 50,000 years, which is the effective limit of radiocarbon dating. When taking mastodon habitat preferences and other ecological and geological information into account, the experts believe that mastodons probably only lived in the Arctic and Subarctic for a limited time around 125,000 years ago, when forests and wetlands were established and the temperatures were as warm as they are today. Mr Zazula added: ‘The residency of mastodons in the north did not last long. ‘The return to cold, dry glacial conditions along with the advance of continental glaciers around 75,000 years ago effectively wiped out their habitats. ‘Mastodons disappeared from Beringia, and their populations became displaced to areas much farther to the south, where they ultimately suffered complete extinction about 10,000 years ago.’ The new report suggests that humans could not have been involved in the local extinction of mastodons in the north 75,000 years ago as they had not yet crossed the Bering Isthmus from Asia. The researchers dated a collection of 36 fossil teeth and bones of American mastodons from Alaska and Yukon - the region known as eastern Beringia .","Radiocarbon dating of North American fossils suggests mastodons died out before humans could hunt them to extinction, as previously thought .

"Diego Simeone's future at Atletico Madrid has been thrown up in the air after the manager hinted he could be ready to leave the club. The Argentine described himself as 'notoriously impatient' and insinuated that he wouldn't be the sort of boss to stick around for years.

"Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer has handed the U.S. Attorney's Office her journal and other documents she claims prove Chris Christie threatened to withhold Sandy aid to her unless she supported one of his development projects. Zimmer released a statement Sunday night revealing she spent 'hours' with lawyers discussing the latest controversy to hit the New Jersey governor. 'As they pursue this investigation, I will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project,' she said in the statement. Cut off: Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer claims Sandy relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal . Earlier, she told CNN that it was . 'stunning' and 'outrageous,' but true, that Lieutenant Governor Kim . Guadagno approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the threat, . stating that it was 'a direct message from the Governor.' 'I stand by my word,' she told CNN's Candy Crowley. Democratic . New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski says he will expand an existing . investigation into Zimmer's allegations. He's already investigating . traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, . allegedly orchestrated by Christie aides as political payback. The . damning accusations, which Christie's administration vehemently denies, . came as the Governor left his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flew to . Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican. Zimmer . alleged that Guadagno and another aide, community affairs commissioner . Richard Constable, leaned on her to gain support for the lucrative deal. Tough week: Governor Christie gives the state address on January 14, as his administration is hit by accusations over 'bridge-gate' 'The bottom line is, it's not fair for . the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because . he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC. Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of the Hoboken community in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'. But when Zimmer requested $127 million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC reported. In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Zimmer wrote: 'Please . governor, we need . your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be . treated fairly.' No response has been received from the letter, which was dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for The Rockefeller Group. According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans. The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Zimmer was elected as mayor. Wrecked: Huge parts of Hoboken were flooded when Sandy hit in October 2012 . Aid: A Hoboken shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 . The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies. Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place. But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Zimmer claims. According to a diary entry from the mayor, Guadagno pulled her aside during an event in Hoboken on May 13, last year. The diary entry read: 'She pulls me aside with . no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the . Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. '""The word is . that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going . to be able to help you. I know it's not right – these things should not . be connected – but they are,"" she says, and ""if you tell anyone, I will . deny it.""' Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].' Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to . you.' Claims: Chris Christie with Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable, who allegedly leaned on Dawn Zimmer to support a project in return for more Sandy aid . 'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her . Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations. A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer's . allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned . Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development . project is categorically false.' The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor's Office and the assistance we've provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.' 'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.' A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We . have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If . it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.' Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action. Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.","Dawn Zimmer said she met with the U.S. Attorney's Office for several hours Sunday regarding the accusations .

"A Walmart worker who was headbutted by a customer has decided to press charges against the woman who assaulted her. Alice Keener was staffing a stand within the Texas superstore in La Porte, when a shopper Jessica Albitz ended up getting into an arugment with her. The two women descended into a violent brawl of hair pulling and punching after the headbut. Now Ms Keener has decided to press charges after visiting a dentist about injuries to her teeth. Scroll down for video... Customer Jessica Albitz headbutted tax worker Alice Keener as a row descended into violence . Police said Ms. Keener originally declined to press charges, but an evaluation by a dentist determined that the headbutt knocked two of her front teeth loose. Ms. Keener contacted Deer Park police last week to alert them she would like to press charges. Keener was able to provide medical records to police that proved her claims. Police said they plan to file a warrant for Albitz's arrest in the coming days. Ms Albitz claims Ms Keener, who works at a Jackson Hewitt stall within the store was rude to her and her husband the day before the fight broke out, when the couple came into the store to get their taxes prepared. The next day, the two women got into another argument when Albitz returned to the store and that's when things turned violent. Video footage of the brawl shows Keener react by slamming Albitz's head onto a table five times before dragging her to the floor by her hair as the two women continued to attack each other and shout. They eventually had to be pulled apart by a male customer. Keener, who is larger than the slight Albitz, was later seen picking up pulled out strands of her hair from the floor. After they were separated she can be heard to shout on the video: 'You better get her. 'She come in messing with me. I'm at work.' Albitz later told Click 2 Houston that she doesn't regret the fight. 'I hope I broke her nose. I hope she has two black eyes and I hope she remembers me for the rest of her life,' she said. Albitz said her and her husband had encountered Keener the evening before at a Jackson Hewitt kiosk and she was very rude to them both, allegedly 'talking trash' to Albitz's husband. She told NBC: 'She came in in a bad mood and took it out on us.' When she returned the next day the pair started to argue when Albitz said she heard Kenner whisper an insult under her breath, as she passed the kiosk. Albitz says she confronted Kenner, who then chased her to the front of the Walmart, got 'right up in my face' and spat at her. 'She spit in my face, calling my mother a (expletive). I'm sorry. I love my family and I'm going to take up for my people,' Albitz said. Albitz claimed Kenner began hurling insults at her in the Walmart store and she decided to headbutt her .

"Massimo Cellino has vowed not to sell Leeds United despite being 'disqualified' from owning the club by the Football League. The Italian has two weeks to appeal the decision, taken on Monday, after detailed evidence from the  court that convicted Cellino of tax evasion in his homeland earlier this year was made available to the Football League. Cellino's protracted takeover was only completed in April when he passed the Football League's owners' and directors' test after successfully appealing against their initial decision to block the purchase. SCROLL DOWN TO READ  STATEMENTS FROM THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND LEEDS UNITED . Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September . It was all quiet outside Elland Road on Monday as the statements were released . Leeds' players celebrate Mirco Antenucci's strike in the 2-1 win over league leaders Derby on Saturday . We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until 18 March 2015. The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014. The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. But after another U-turn by the Football League's board, Cellino told Sportsmail: ‘I am not selling the club. You must be joking. I just bought the club. And I want to protect the fans. I am not selling the club, okay?’ Should Cellino's appeal be unsuccessful (assuming he does appeal) he will be disqualified until March 18, 2015, when under UK law the conviction is deemed to be spent. Leeds, who are taking legal advice, earlier argued in a statement that it would be 'destabilising' to remove Cellino from their board, only to reappoint him in March. 'The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party,' it read. The Football League have also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether Cellino - and/or Leeds breached regulations by not disclosing relevant information in a timely manner. Leeds, who are on their third manager of the season and fourth since Cellino bought the club, are currently 15th in the Championship after beating league leaders Derby 2-0 on Saturday. Hollywood actor Verne Troyer (centre) poses with Cellino's daughter Eleonora at Elland Road on Saturday . The statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner stands proud outside the famous old ground . The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test. Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone). In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.” Cellino watches Leeds take on QPR back in March before his takeover had been completed . At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test. Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public. Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course. Editors notes: . * Shaun Harvey was Chief Executive and a Director of Leeds United between 2004 and 2013.

"Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary, seemed to be a healthy young woman when a health inspector knocked on her door in 1907, yet she was the cause of several typhoid outbreaks in New York City. Mary was the first 'healthy carrier' of typhoid fever in the United States. It all began in the summer of 1906, when New York banker Charles Henry Warren took his family on vacation. The Warrens hired Marry Mallon to be their cook. Soon afterwards, one of the Warren's daughters became ill with typhoid fever. Then, Mrs Warren and two maids became ill; followed by the gardener and another of the Warrens' daughter's. In total, six of the eleven people in the house came down with typhoid. Legendary: Known as 'Typhoid Mary', Mary Mallon was the first person identified as a carrier of typhoid bacilli in the United States. Herself immune to the disease, she spread typhoid while working as a cook in the New York City area . Main staircase: Nurses' Building.  One of the oldest buildings on campus, this is where ""Typhoid"" Mary Mallon was known to socialize during her later years on the island . Dormitory: It was thought that an abundance of sunlight and fresh air would aid in recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis; this theory was never tested at North Brother Island, where the TB pavilion was left derelict . Beauty: Main street during summer.  This was the main thoroughfare for the island's automobiles during its years of operation; now, the road is covered with dirt and vines . Western street: This street led to the morgue (pictured right) and physical plant (pictured left) on the island, as well as to the chapel, which collapsed many years ago . Boilers: Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island had a complete physical plant which supplied all steam heat and electricity for the island . Ian Ference has made 17 trips out to Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island in the East River, beginning in 2008. His fascination with forgotten abandoned places led him to become fascinated with the island some 5 years prior, and he spent that time making the connections necessary to make the trips happen. He now boasts a collection of over 5,000 photos taken out on the island. A curated selection of these images is available in print at http://ianference.smugmug.com/Architecture/North-Brother-Island. Additionally, Ference has published a widely read history of the island on his blog, . Mary could not understand how someone who was not sick could spread the disease, so she went on the run. Eventually she was captured and forced to live in isolation upon North Brother Island, a particularly treacherous stretch in New York's East River. Mary Mallon was taken by force and against her will and was held without a trial. She had not broken any laws, yet the government locked her up in isolation indefinitely. Riverside Hospital, was the name of the facility on the island where she was kept. It treated everything from smallpox and leprosy to venereal disease and heroin addiction. The island has been abandoned since 1963, but more than a dozen buildings remain, in various states of disrepair. Typhoid Mary was presumed to have infected some 51 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook. She died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation. Auditorium, School and Services Building: Last used as part of a public school that was a part of a failed drug rehab program on the island, this auditorium was abandoned half a century ago, in 1963 . Western staircase in winter, Tuberculosis Pavilion:  Broken out windows on each landing let snow into the building . Gantry crane: This is where the ferry from the Port Morris terminal would dock once or twice a day, to bring people and supplies to the island, and people and bodies away . Nurses' Building in winter: One of the oldest remaining structures on the island, the Nurses' Building is in rough shape; several floors and portions of floors are inaccessible to those unwilling to jump across voids in the floors . Cast iron staircase: One of the more unique and surprising architectural features on the island, this cast iron staircase linked the three contiguous floors on the Southern (oldest) portion of the Nurses' Building . Mary Mallon did not understand a lot about typhoid fever and, unfortunately, no one tried to explain it to her. Though commonly known at the time that typhoid could be spread by water or food products, people who are infected by the typhoid bacteria could also pass the disease from their infected stool onto food via unwashed hands. For this reason, infected persons who were cooks, like Mallon, were the likeliest to spread the disease. In February of 1910, a new health commissioner decided that Mallon could go free as long as she agreed never to work as a cook again. Mallon accepted the conditions and agreed that she would take hygienic precautions to protect those with whom she comes in contact with from infection. However, she was unable to find work that was as well paid as a chef and Mallon eventually went back to working as a cook. Five years later, in January 1915, the Sloane Maternity Hospital in Manhattan suffered a typhoid fever outbreak. Twenty-five people became ill and two of them died. Bedroom, Doctors' Cottage: Tthe Doctors' Cottage is among the oldest buildings on North Brother Island, and potentially hazardous to the health of anybody who decides to climb about in it . Key to the past: Oxidized copper keys and chemical stalagmites on windowsill, Maintenance Building.  Because it is so hard to reach North Brother Island without the permission of the NYC Parks Department, many artifacts remain in situ . Operating room, Tuberculosis Pavilion: The newest building on the island, the TB pavilion was built to feature medical facilities that were state-of-the-art in 1939; the island was then abandoned for the first time, and it was never used . Corridor, Tuberculosis Pavilion: The most recently constructed structure on the island, the TB pavilion is in wonderful shape - there's barely any significant structural damage . Bathroom, Doctors' Cottage:  The entire southern wall of this bathroom has collapsed, leading to wonderful lighting in the bathroom . An investigation found that a recently-hired cook, Mrs. Brown, might be to blame. It was, of course, Mary Mallon, using a pseudonym. There was little public sympathy for Mary Mallon because she knew at this time she was a healthy 'carrier' of the virus. It was suggested that she willingly and knowingly caused pain and death to her victims . Using a pseudonym made even more people feel that Typhoid Mary knew she was guilty. She was sent to North Brother Island for a second time to live in the same isolated cottage. For a further 23 years, Mary Mallon remained imprisoned on the island. Tuberculosis Pavilion: With a combination of WPA grants and NYC money, a new, state-of-the-art facility for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis was built on North Brother Island . Morgue: This room served as the morgue for Riverside Hospital, in the building that 'Typhoid' Mary Mallon trained to be a pathological assistant in, and where upon her death an autopsy confirmed that she had live typhoid cultures in her gall bladder . Wraparound porch, Nurses' Building: The porch in the rear courtyard of the Nurses' Building demonstrates the diverse architectural modalities of the building, which was constructed in stages over more than a decade . Gymnasium, School and Services Building:  When Riverside Hospital was repurposed from a quarantine hospital to a drug rehab, a school was hastily constructed out of the old Services Building . Corridor, School and Services Building: When the primary purpose of Riverside Hospital became as a detention facility for juvenile drug offenders, the Services Building was re-purposed as a school . The entire island is a captivating place for photographers like Ian Ference. He has made 17 trips out to Riverside Hospital since in 2008. Ian admits he has a fascination with forgotten and abandoned places and has now taken 5,000 photos on the island. 'It is a singular experience stepping off a boat onto the shores of North Brother Island - almost like stepping half a century back into time. And this makes sense, because the island was fully abandoned in 1963.  I cannot, in my photography or in my historic research, begin to describe the smells of the various parts of the island or the feeling of walking into the room where 'Typhoid' Mary Mallon first trained as a pathologist and ultimately was autopsied in. I cannot explain what it's like to feel the adrenaline rush as I edge along the roof of the Nurses' Building to reach a room that no stairs connect to any longer to get a photo, or the frustration at being unable to penetrate the one room in the Tuberculosis Pavilion where the lock has rusted shut, virtually wiping the room off the grid.' What I hope to communicate with my photos is - as best I can - a sense of what it's like to step back in time, to a place with a marvelous history.'","Typhoid Mary, was the first person in the United States identified as a carrier of the pathogen associated with typhoid fever .

"Found: Sir James Tillie, 'an extraordinary man of dubious character', built Pentillie Castle in Saltash, Cornwall, in 1698 and died in 1713 . Human remains discovered at a stately home are believed to be those of the man who built it and ordered that he be buried in his best clothes with his pipe as he waited for the afterlife. An excavation of a mausoleum in the grounds of Pentillie Castle in Saltash, Cornwall, is thought to have uncovered the body of Sir James Tillie, who built the home in 1698 and died in 1713. He asked that on his deathbed he should not be buried, but dressed in his best clothes, bound to a stout chair and placed with his books, wine and pipe in his favourite folly to await resurrection. His servants are believed to have brought him wine for two years until, unable to bear their macabre orders any longer, the remains were interred and a marble statue built in his place. Mystery has long surrounded his final resting place - but recent renovations of the mausoleum uncovered a brick chamber under granite floor slabs, in which human remains were found. It had been long assumed his remains were moved to a church. Archaeologist Oliver Jessop, who was recording the historic fabric of the building, and surveyor Richard Glover, were delighted. Incredible find: The excavation of a mausoleum in the grounds of Pentillie Castle in Cornwall is thought to have uncovered the body of Sir James Tillie, who died 300 years ago in 1713 . Mausoleum: Ted Coryton has been restoring Pentillie Castle in Cornwall with his family after inheriting it in 2007 . ‘It is a very exciting find,’ the two men said in a statement. ‘The discovery of this body in the vault contradicts local tradition and adds another twist to the eccentric goings on of the Coryton family.’ Ted Coryton, who has been restoring the . castle with his family after inheriting it in 2007, was at the opening of the vault . after spending five years researching Sir James’s life and the . estate. Sir James Tillie was born in November 1645 and is described on the castle’s website as ‘an extraordinary man of dubious character’. From humble origins he emerged to be the land agent of a Sir John Coryton, who owned a large estate called Newton Ferrers that bounded the area on which Pentillie was built. But when Sir John died unexpectedly aged 42, Sir James soon married his widow Elizabeth. There had been suggestions that they had been seeing each other before Sir John’s death – and even that Sir John was poisoned. The marriage made Sir James’s rich and he was knighted by King James II after giving him a ‘great sum of money’. But the king is said to have  later ordered a probe into the knighthood for obtaining by false representation. Sir James died in November 1713. ‘It was an exciting moment, to finally uncover the truth and to know that Sir James was in fact in his mausoleum,’ he said. ‘To finally tie up the loose ends was extraordinary. ‘There is no doubt these are very old remains, and all indications are that it is likely to be Sir James Tillie. There was no sign of his pipe, books or wine but there was the remains of a chair that looks typical to the 1700's when he would have been placed there. ‘Despite all the theories that we had banded about as we tackled the restoration of the mausoleum - the strange bricked in windows, the false ceiling joists, the inverted v-shaped roof, the steps that seem barely connected to the main structure - this was certainly not on the list. He added: ‘There are no plans to exhume the body or to undergo any further DNA tests.' The public will be able to view Pentillie Castle's gardens over the coming months, but will not be able to visit the mausoleum.","Excavation of a mausoleum in grounds of Pentillie Castle in Cornwall .

"Atletico Madrid are considering a move for Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa. The Spanish champions are rebuilding their squad this summer and Kagawa, who is one of those players Louis van Gaal is prepared to discard at Old Trafford, has emerged as a target for Atletico manager Diego Simeone. Kagawa, 25, is viewed by Atletico as an alternative to Arsenal's Santi Cazorla. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Kagawa star in funny but strange advert with Gary Lineker . On the move? Atletico Madrid are considering a bid for Shinji Kagawa (centre) The Japanese international arrived at Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2012 but he has struggled to nail down a place in the first-team and has only offered sporadic glimpses of his qualities. Van Gaal has already outlined his belief that the United squad is excessively stocked in Kagawa's preferred No. 10 position and it is understood that Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj all ahead of him in the pecking order. Kagawa has been frustrated by the failure of both Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes to hand him an extended run in his favoured role behind the forward and he has previously spoke of his reluctance to play from the wide positions. Moyes, for his part, argued that Kagawa has been effective playing from the left for  the Japanese national team. In and out: The Japanese international has struggled to nail down a place in the United first-team . Outgoing: Atleti coach Diego Simeone is hoping to strengthen his depleted Spanish side . Nonetheless, with Van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system, the only slot for Kagawa would be in the role that Juan Mata will primarily occupy, with Kagawa too slight to play in a wing-back role. German side Wolfsburg are also monitoring Kagawa and they have previously registered an interest in a player that could be available for around £13million. Borussia Dortmund are not currently prioritising a move to take Kagawa back to Germany but manager Jurgen Klopp remains an admirer and could be tempted into the race, particularly with the future of Marco Reus remaining unclear.

"Promoter Frank Warren believes heavyweight Tyson Fury has what it takes to dethrone world champion Wladimir Klitschko.

'I told Don (Charles, Chisora's trainer) to stop the fight after the 10th round, as it was quite apparent there'd be no change in the way things were going,' Warren told the Telegraph. 'His jab was non-existent and he couldn't cope with Fury's height and size. Chisora wasn't happy – he's a warrior and a very tough guy. He had three stitches under his eye and his nose may be broken.' Fury has questioned whether Klitschko will take to the bout next year, but Warren is confident. 'It will happen,' he continues. 'The WBO have mandated it will happen. Klitschko's next fight is in March and after that there's 30 days for us to negotiate with him. 'Tyson will bring back a world title for Britain.

Obviously tired after his 80-yard sprint, Peres let fly from the edge of the box and screeched his effort beyond the despairing Marco Storari before trotting to the corner flag to celebrate with the visiting fans in the Turin derby. That put Torino level at the time, but they went on to lose against 10-man Juventus thanks in no small part to Andrea Pirlo's stunning late effort.

'When I reached midfield, I already felt exhausted, as it was raining hard and the pitch was heavy,' Peres said. 'Then I remembered the words of our coach, who asked us all to pounce on opportunities to hurt Juventus. 'I thank God for the goal, but unfortunately we lost the match.

"Having failed to score a single Premier League goal since his £16million move to Liverpool this summer, Mario Balotelli is desperately trying to prove he is not a rip-off. But the injured Italian striker, who hasn't played since picking up an injury on international duty in early November, is happy to wear ripped clothing while he awaits a first-team return. Balotelli was at a Manchester Fashion Industry event on Sunday night, wearing a bizarre black leather jacket.

"It was a moment that shocked audiences across the globe - during the World Cup images showed Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez appearing to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during a match between the two nations. And using new Fifa 15 game some fans have humorously recreated the infamous moment. In pictures posted to Twitter fans have claimed the game is ‘so realistic’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the Barcelona striker banned from football for four months. Scroll down for video . Images from the Fifa 15 video game appear to show the Uruguayan striker biting other football players (shown). Suarez was infamously banned for four months during the World Cup for seeming to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, and fans have taken to Twitter mocking the striker with images from the game . ‘FIFA 15 is so realistic’ @djruch10 writes beneath an image that sees Suarez sinking his teeth into a player. ‘Was playing the FIFA 15 Demo earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic,’ @ManCityArmy1894 said under a similar image. Of course, the ability to bite plays is not actually a feature of the new game. Rather, the gamers have used the game’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game. The glitches seem to show Suarez’s mouth sinking into players, and it doesn’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action. Despite being labelled 'so realistic' the ability to bite other players it not really a new feature, but rather just a result of gamers positioning players in the game to make it look like another biting incident . Suarez signed for Barcelona from Liverpool after the World Cup despite the incident. However he is still yet to make his debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting Chiellini. And that is replicated in FIFA 15, as fans picking up the game will be unable to use Suarez in the game’s career mode for the entirety of his ban. However playing one of the game's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one-on-one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken.

"These four body images, comprised of celebrities' best features, reveal the staggering differences in how men and women perceive the perfect body. A new survey has gathered the preferences of both genders, creating 'body beautiful' composites using the physical attributes of the world's most beautiful people. It appears that women covet a ultra-slim boyish figure, while men lust after curvacious full hips and an ample bust - but both sexes prefer a broad and chiselled male body. The composite of various aspects of celebrities' bodies shows the difference in men and women's perceptions of 'perfection' While women opted for the boyish hips of . youthful Noah actress Emma Watson, 23, men plumped for the fuller . curves of 34-year-old model Kelly Brook. The biggest difference is in our choice of favourite face. Women aspire to the supermodel features of model Cara Delevingne, 21, with men more attracted to the softer features of actress Megan Fox, 27. Ladies admire the pert and perky breasts of Jennifer Aniston, 45, while men appreciate the fuller bust of US TV star Kim Kardashian, 33. Both sexes like a fairly muscular frame when it comes to men, though women prefer a slightly more rugged look, choosing Harry Styles floppy hair Jamie Dornan's rough-hewn features . When it comes to hair, long luscious locks are a winner for everyone - but while women are enthralled by the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, their halves would love to run their fingers through 29-year-old Scarlett Johnsson's mane.

"To viewers of her reality show, the demise of Tori Spelling's marriage to Dean McDermott seemed like an inevitability. Beset by rows and hit by his cheating, the two appeared certain to split. But now, MailOnline can reveal, the pair are very much back on - thanks to Dean's decision to quit True Tori, the show which detailed their ups and downs. Tori had initially pushed back against him not appearing in the reality show, but when she checked into hospital in October, the couple experienced a rapprochement. Now they have spent Thanksgiving together in Las Vegas, after switching on its Christmas tree as a family and spending the rest of the week there - and are said to be much happier as a result. In the family: The whole Spelling-McDermott clan switched on the Christmas lights at Las Vegas's Venetian Hotel, starting a Thanksgiving week spent in the city. The children are, from left, Finn, Stella, Hattie and Liam. Hand in hand: The couple put on a united front while walking in New York City on November 19 . On the show: The latest episode shows the couple discussing the state of their marriage . 'It's true, Tori and Dean were talking about ending their marriage when she checked herself into Cedar's Sinai hospital,' says a source close to the dramatic duo. 'Tori was very ill with a mystery virus, and she was worn down both mentally and physically. She'd lost weight and couldn't stop crying over her unhappy life. 'Tori had been working night and day to try and make a go of her TV series, Mystery Girls, as well as filming True Tori. And on top of that, she was dealing with a cheating husband and caring for four little kids under the age of 7.' The Mystery Girls actress and McDermott have four children together - Liam, aged seven, Stella, aged six, Hattie, aged three, and Finn, aged two. Tori - born Victoria - was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital on October 18 for pneumonia and severe bronchitis, but she attributed the symptoms to stress. 'I don't deal with stress well,' admitted Spelling, who also spent six days in the hospital for a migraine back in April. The stress came after McDermott admitted cheating on Spelling in an affair which took place last year. He later checked into reheab. But according to the source, while Tori lay in her hospital bed contemplating a split, Dean surprised her, by stepping up to the plate at home. 'Dean was amazing,' says the source. 'He kept the home fires burning by making sure everything ran smoothly. 'He's always been a perfectionist, and Tori's even accused him of being a little OCD. So when push came to shove and he had to be there for her and the kids, he stepped up and took charge. 'Dean would start out the day by getting the four kids up, dressed and fed, before taking them off to their respective schools. Speaking out: Spelling in a teaser for this week's True Tori in which she questions McDermott over another woman being in their house . Domestic: Dean McDermott in the kitchen of the couple's home. He reminded his wife why they married when he made her favorite lamb chops with strawberry mint sauce dish . Drama: The couple have been through a rough time but are now getting on the straight and narrow . 'And while he had help at home with the little ones, he took it upon himself to drop the two older kids off and pick them up himself, knowing the children were worried about their mother. 'He made sure the house was in tip top shape too,' says the source. 'They have a housekeeper, but Dean cleaned out cupboards, and closets, and washed and folded all the laundry himself. 'And he even cooked meals ahead so that when he went up to the hospital to visit Tori in the evenings, the kids had home cooked meals to enjoy. 'He also made sure the bills were paid, and the shopping was done. And he was sure to be home before bedtime to help with homework, read stories and tuck the children into bed. 'Tori says that the way Dean took control and was there when she needed him, reminded her of the man she married, and she felt she couldn't have concentrated on getting better if Dean hadn't taken so much responsibility.' The source says that after Tori arrived home, the atmosphere around the house changed and she admits seeing Dean through a new pair of eyes. 'Tori was shocked to see how orderly everything was,' says the source. 'Not only was the house spotless and the kids clean, . 'After being in the hospital for two weeks, being away from my kids, that was my rock bottom': Tori was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital on October 18 for pneumonia and severe bronchitis . 'I don't like them seeing me as sick': The 41-year-old reality star said her four children 'weren't even fazed by me being in the hospital. They're used to it. And I don't want them to grow up thinking, ""Mom's sick""' 'Dean also filled the house with flowers and managed to put together one of her favorite meals: grilled lamb chops with strawberry mint sauce and baked potatoes.' The source says that being reminded of Dean's devotion's made Tori take another look at him. Despite all their problems, she knows that when push comes to shove, she can count on her husband to care for his family. So she's decided to recommit herself to the relationship. And as part of this renewed commitment, she's honoring Dean's wishes to leave True Tori. 'At first Tori was upset that Dean wanted to leave the show and she felt he was basically abandoning ship,' says the source. 'Then she realized that if he no longer wanted to make his life public, she had to respect that decision and let him go. In the end, Tori hopes that by letting Dean make his exit, it will improve their relationship. 'And she's determined to keep fighting for her family even if it means continuing the reality show on her own. 'Only time will tell if Tori and Dean can make love work,' says the source. 'But it doesn't look like either one of them is quite ready to throw in the towel just yet.'","McDermott's cheating has been focus of new season of True Tori .

"Feeling the heat: Anxiety caused by telling lies makes the tip of the nose grow warm, the scientists claim . Contrary to what you may say to your children, telling a lie doesn’t, of course, make your nose grow like Pinocchio’s. But it does make it hotter. Scientists claim that a rise in anxiety produced by lying will increase the temperature of the tip of your nose. And if you’re worried that your fib will be uncovered, they also suggest a way of cooling the nose  down – making ‘a great mental effort’. The scientists, from the University of Granada, discovered the phenomenon by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor volunteers. They have called it ‘The Pinocchio Effect’,  in honour of the 19th century Italian tale of the wooden puppet whose nose grew when he failed to tell the truth. In their doctoral thesis, released yesterday, Emilio Gómez Milán and Elvira Salazar López suggest that the temperature of the nose increases or decreases according to mood, as does the orbital muscle area in the inner corner of the eyes. The scientists also claim thermal imaging can detect sexual desire and arousal in men and women, indicated by an increase in temperature in the chest and genital areas. And the technique also allowed the pair to produce thermal footprints  –  body patterns with specific temperature changes – for aerobic exercise and distinct types of dance, such as ballet. The Pinocchio effect: Researchers at the University of Granada found that the temperature of the nose rises as a person becomes anxious . They explained: ‘When someone dances Flamenco, the temperature in their buttocks lowers and it rises in their forearms. ‘This is the thermal footprint for Flamenco, although each type of dance has its own.’ The pair reached their conclusions after discovering that when the volunteers lied about their feelings, the brain’s insular cortex was altered. They said: ‘The insular cortex is involved in the detection and regulation of body temperature, so there is a large negative correlation between the activity of this structure and the magnitude of the temperature change. ‘The more activity in the insular cortex (the higher the visceral feeling), lower heat exchange occurs, and vice versa.’","Scientists from the University of Granada used thermal imaging to prove anxiety makes the nose heat up .

"Messenger: Dianne Reidy said she was prompted to speak by the Holy Spirit . The stenographer who went on a religious rant in the House of Representatives last night following the debt ceiling vote said that she had been working up the courage to do God's work. 'For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber,' Dianne Reidy said in a written statement. 'That is what I did last night.' Reidy's husband Dan said that he was proud of his wife, who he called 'a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of God'. Security had to forcibly remove 48-year-old Dianne from the floor and she was taken to hospital for evaluation Wednesday night after she took control of the microphone. 'He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked- don't touch me- He will not be mocked,' she said. 'The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been it would not have been. It would not have been. 'The Constitution would not have been written by Freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God. Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to Jesus.' Outburst: Dianne Reidy is forcibly removed from the House chamber after her about God and the Freemasons . The woman behind the rant: There is no word yet what prompted Ms Reidy to take control of the mic . According to the New York Post, the married mother makes $126,050 a year. On her Facebook page, she is a fan of several Christian-oriented groups, including the evangelical In Touch Ministries, led by TV preacher Charles Stanley. She was interviewed by Capitol Police before being sent to a hospital for a mental health evaluation. She does not drink, do drugs or have any medication issues, and she has been released from the hospital. 'I’m glad that I fulfilled God’s mission for me, absolutely. It lifted a tremendous burden. It was a very hard burden to carry as you can imagine,' she said in an interview with The Post. Her husband spoke for the majority of the interview, saying that the late nights that she worked during the shutdown really drove her to the brink. 'God was preparing her for this vote . last night, because this was kind of the culmination of everything,' her . husband Dan told The Post. 'This . was the big one. Everybody’s there. And Dianne didn’t know what she was . sharing, she didn’t know when — but she just sensed in her spirit.' Dianne has worked as a stenographer for two decades and the past eight of those years were for the House Clerk- a job she reportedly enjoys because she appreciates the archaic parliamentary order to the ways that laws are passed and debates are organized. Dan Reidy told The Daily Beast that she takes her job so seriously that she would refuse to call in sick even when she was suffering from morning sickness when pregnant with the couple's twin daughters, but instead she insisted she go to work and bring a bag with her in case she got sick. She plans to return to work on Tuesday and has not heard from any superiors to the contrary. 'This whole mess has just kind of sickened her to the whole process,' he said of her disgust with what had been going on during the federal shutdown. Proud: Dan Reidy, pictured with is wife Dianne, and daughters, blamed the long working hours on the outburst . 'The alliances between people who aren’t really allies. The finger-pointing on the dais, [then] the arms around each other… Where are the people being served in this whole deal? 'She was just like, ""Gosh, this is not what it’s about.""' Her . husband, a video company owner and former director of the far-right . Great Commission Ministries International, defended his wife’s public . outburst today: 'My wife is a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of . God. I am proud of her.' The couple is open about their devout religious beliefs. 'Reading a Bible is not foreign to us, but getting up in the middle of the night definitely is. It’s just not a part of our life,' Mr Reidy told the Daily Beast. 'What she was finding out was that God was impressing on her heart that He had a message He wanted her to share with the House of Representatives.' Attention: Those in earshot of Mrs Reidy could be seen looking at her during the outburst . CSPAN was recording the scene last night and had . the screen blocked with the breakdown of the vote that had just happened . to approve the debt ceiling increase and temporary budget agreement. Though it is not a clear shot, it is still possible to see Reidy approach the microphone and begin gesticulating with her arms. People can be heard calling to her, saying the name Molly, but she has been identified in news reports as Reidy. Politico says that she was removed from the area and taken to a nearby elevator. A GOP aide told CNN: 'She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her.

"Brendan Rodgers doesn’t deserve the blame for Liverpool’s poor start to the season, according to former Reds star Steve McManaman. Despite earning three points against Stoke on Saturday, thanks to a late Glen Johnson goal, Liverpool, who finished second last season, are in the bottom half of the table. But McManaman thinks Rodgers, and his much-criticised signings, who have failed to make the desired impact, deserve more time. Brendan Rodgers has been under fire after Liverpool's difficult start to the season . Some of Rodgers' signings, including Dejan Lovren (above) have come in for criticism from fans and pundits . ‘I don’t blame Rodgers to be honest,’ said McManaman, who spent a decade at Liverpool before joining Real Madrid in 1999, and will be watching their next game, against Leicester on Tuesday night, as a BT Sport pundit. ‘Last year, when the team was excellent, we didn’t really focus on Brendan, we focused on how well the team were playing. ‘The fact that the team are struggling this year, people are saying it’s all about Brendan – but I don’t think so. ‘The majority of the players who played last year are playing this year. Players who were excellent last year probably haven’t reached that level yet. ‘He’s brought new signings in to galvanise the team, a lot of the new signings haven’t worked yet.But a lot of those new signings are younger players that deserve a little bit more time.’ Steve McManaman says Rodgers should not be criticised for this season's struggles after last year's success . McManaman believes Rodgers is getting more stick than he deserves, and will turn things around . Mario Balotelli (centre) has not yet scored a Premier League goal for Liverpool since joining for £16million . And McManaman says that if Liverpool can build on Saturday’s win and pick up some momentum, they can still finish in the Premier League’s top four. ‘I still think the Champions League is an opportunity. ‘Apart from Manchester City and Chelsea, the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United, Everton, the teams that occupied those type of places last year alongside Liverpool, they’re fairly inconsistent as well. ‘So I think if anybody makes a really good run of games, and wins games on the bounce out of those teams, they’ve got an excellent chance of getting into the Champions League spots.’ For that to happen, Liverpool need to rediscover the form that saw them score over 100 goals int he league last season. Having lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury, the goals have dried up, but McManaman believes striker Rickie Lambert should be given an extended run in the Liverpool team. Rodgers talks to Rickie Lambert, who has begun to rediscover his goalscoring touch in recent weeks . Lambert celebrates his first ever Champions League goal, scored against Ludogorets last week . Lambert has scored just one Premier League goal since his summer move from Southampton, but has impressed in his last few games, scoring against Crystal Palace and Ludogorets before providing for Glen Johnson to score Liverpool’s winner against Stoke. ‘I think Rickie Lambert needs to play,’ said McManaman. ‘I think he needs to play games, he needs to stay in the team, he needs to know that he’s going to be playing and he needs to build on a bit of form that he’s got. ‘He’s done well recently, he’s been involved in goals and he’s scored goals, he was involved in the goal on Saturday, so I think injuries permitting he should start tomorrow.’ Lambert should get a run in the first team with Balotelli and Sturridge injured says McManaman . However, despite travelling to bottom of the table Leicester, Liverpool should not expect everything their own way on Tuesday night. Nigel Pearson’s side scored five times when they beat Manchester United at the King Power stadium, and have also earned impressive draws with Arsenal and Everton. And McManaman believes Liverpool could be in for a shock if they underestimate their opponents. ‘I’d have thought they’ll raise their game, like they did against Manchester United. Leicester were excellent earlier this season when they scored five times in a victory over Manchester United . The Premier League's bottom side have not won since beating United, but could raise their game on Tuesday . ‘I think the place, no disrespect to if they were playing Burnley at the King Power, but I think when Liverpool or Manchester United or Chelsea come around, the place will be absolutely rocking tomorrow night. ‘It’s going to be a cold Tuesday night, Liverpool will have played a lot of games in the last ten games, there’s a really good chance for them tomorrow to get at Liverpool, and I bet you that’s what Nigel Pearson will be saying to them.' Steve McManaman is football expert for BT Sport who will show Leicester City v Liverpool exclusively live from 7.00pm on Tuesday evening on BT Sport 1 .","Liverpool are in the bottom half of the Premier League table after 13 games .

"Members of some of the United States' most notorious street gangs have infiltrated shelters housing illegal immigrant minors from Central America and are recruiting them, say Homeland Security sources. An estimated 57,000 minors from Central America have flooded across the border from Mexico to the U.S. in recent months, and gang leaders are reportedly filling their ranks from among them. Transnational gangs such as the Mara Salvatruca, also known as MS-13, and the 18th Street gang are using established juvenile members from Central America to cross the border and recruit other children to the cartels, say sources. Recruiting drive: There are reports that gangs are trying to recruit young immigrants from Border Protection facilities where they're being held . Transnational: A young El Salvadorean member of the Mara MS-13 street gang. There are reports that young members are enlisting other youngsters crossing the border . According to Fox News, Border Control agents have witnessed gang members using a Red Cross phone bank at the facility at Nogales, Arizona, to 'recruit, enlist and pressure' other minors into crossing the border. Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Control Patrol Council, a union which represents border agents, says agents have witnessed the recruiting process. The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement said earlier this week that they have no knowledge or evidence that gangs are recruiting immigrant minors. 'We know it’s happening because agents are telling us,' Moran told Fox News. 'The Border Patrol is trying to downplay it.' Gang culture learned in the U.S.: Carlos Tiberio Ramirez, one of the leaders of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang . Flood: More than 57,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwestern border since October, more than twice the total this time last year . He said agents have overheard conversations in which recruits are given phone numbers to call after crossing the border in order to contact gang members. Ironically, many immigrants flooding across the southern border of the U.S. say they're fleeing violent gangs in Central America. Experts, however, say those gangs are actually a byproduct of U.S. policies in the 1990s that sent many immigrants back to Central America after they had been indoctrinated into gang culture in this country. The violence they took with them easily took hold and flourished in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala - countries with weak, dysfunctional governments. One study estimated some 350,000 Central American immigrants illegally came to Southern California from 1980 to 1985 while trying to escape civil war and corruption in their home country. They arrived with few English skills, and many settled in poor neighborhoods with strong Mexican gangs and black gangs. To survive and avoid bullying, some formed gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha or joined others such as the 18th Street gang. They committed serious crimes and were sent to prison, where they were further exposed to violent gang culture. Detainees: Many of the children arriving from Central America are fleeing gang violence in their homelands . In the 1990s, the U.S. increased deportations of immigrants facing criminal charges, particularly gang members. As many as 1,500 Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Honduran youths were sent back each month to Central America. They arrived with the notoriety of being a Los Angeles gangster. 'There's this huge explosion in all three of these countries of the gangs and the number of gang members, partially because it's the way of street kids getting status and reputation, and partially because it's a way of surviving,' said Tom Ward, a University of Southern California associate professor who has studied the issue. What is the relation between the gangs and the influx of immigrants at the U.S. border? Many people fleeing Central America say they are running from violence perpetrated by the gangs. But the migration is also an effort to reunify families. At least 80 per cent of youths stopped at the border have one parent or a close relative already in the United States, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and senior fellow for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. Family members already in the U.S. have saved enough money to pay a smuggler to bring their children across the border so boys won't be forcibly recruited into gangs and daughters won't be subjected to sexual violence.","Border Control agents have allegedly witnessed gang members recruiting members from among the influx of unaccompanied immigrant minors from Central America .

"Spanish playmaker Juan Mata says Manchester United must be ready to fire on all cylinders ahead of a busy festive schedule. Louis van Gaal's side face a run of nine competitive games in just 36 days as they look to cement their place in the top four of the Premier League. And Mata, who impressed for United as they secured a third straight win against Hull on Saturday, says the Red Devils must consolidate their good run of form during a busy December. Juan Mata impressed for Manchester United in their 3-0 win against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday . The 26-year-old will be looking for a similar performance from himself when United take on Stoke . Writing on his official blog he said: 'This win (over Hull) adds up to a good run of results. 'Let’s hope to consolidate that in December, a very busy month that can take us closer to our goals. For a start, we play Stoke this Tuesday, again at home.' However, Mata's joy at United's latest result was shortlived after learning of the news that a 43-year-old male Deportivo fan was tragically killed in his native Spain, following mass brawls prior to their La Liga clash against Atletico on Sunday. Deportivo La Coruna and Atletico Madrid fans clash outside Vicente Calderon Stadium on Sunday . The man  was taken out of the river suffering head injuries, cardiac arrest and hypothermia, before dying . He added: 'After finishing the training session we were told about the incidents in Madrid prior to the game between Atletico and Deportivo. 'Sadness... incredulity... I can’t find the words to describe it. As any other sport, football should help to unite, not to divide. 'This is not the first time that something like this has happened, in Spain or here in England. 'Such barbarisms must be eradicated, once and for all, through education and common sense.'","Juan Mata impressed as Manchester United beat Hull 3-0 on Saturday .

"Farmers are pressing supermarkets to give them permission to feed the nation’s millions of egg laying hens a ‘Frankenstein Food’ GM diet. Currently most supermarkets ban their suppliers from giving hens a genetically modified soya or corn. However, industry organisations, including the National Farmers’ Union, the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) and the British Poultry Council (BPC) are trying to change this. Farmers are asking to be allowed to feed millions of egg-laying hens with genetically modified feed . They say non-GM feed is too expensive and have written directly to the supermarkets and the British Retail Consortium(BRC) asking them to lift the ban. Supporters of biotech farming insist the eggs produced from hens fed on GM are identical to those given a natural diet, but this is disputed. Eggs laid by hens raised in this way would not have to be labelled, so leaving shoppers completely in the dark about the food's origins. Critics say any such move would be completely at odds with the wishes of consumers, who have concerns about the impact of biotech farming on the countryside and human health. A recent Food Standards Agency study also found that consumers want clear labelling of products produced from animals raised on GM. The farming organisations say the bans on GM feed adopted by most retailers is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. They say it is a problem to find non-GM feed, while it tends to be more expensive. Asda and Morrisons have already bowed to farmer pressure and dropped their insistence on non GM feed for hens, however other retailers have yet to follow. Critics say consumers have concerns about biotech farming on the countryside and human health . Roger Gent, chairman of the British Free . Range Egg Producers’ Association (BFREPA), said non-GM soya costs . around £100 per tonne more than the GM equivalent, which is putting up . industry costs . and pointed out there is no such retailer ban on giving GM feed to cattle and pigs. ‘This is not a requirement that is placed on other livestock sectors; it is only the poultry sector that is required to use Non GM,’ he complained. ‘The premium that we are having to pay for non GM soya has grown from £40 per tonne to £100 per tonne. ‘Brazilian soya growers are moving to GM soya and there will soon about 10per cent non GM – insufficient to meet all UK supermarkets’ demand for us to use Non GM feed. ‘They really do need to drop this requirement now.’ Opponents of attempts to allow yet more GM feed on to the nation’s farms include the Soil Association, Friends of the Earth, GM Freeze, GMWatch and Gene Watch. They have written to the BRC warning any change in policy would be a ‘serious mistake’. They said: ‘We believe, particularly in the wake of the scandal about unlabelled and unlisted ingredients in beef burgers, that this would be a very serious mistake, further undermining public trust in animal products sold by British supermarkets.’ The group said it was simply inaccurate to claim there is any shortage of non-GM feed. The proportion of non-GM soya being imported into the EU is now increasing, and is currently around seven million tonnes a year. This is apparently in response to moves by Carrefour in France, and other retailers, particularly in countries like Germany and Austria, to move to non-GM animal feed, and to label meat, dairy products, farmed fish and eggs as coming from animals fed on non-GM feed.","Supporters say eggs from GM-fed hens are exactly the same .

"Chelsea are confident they can beat Tottenham on Wednesday, even without star striker Diego Costa. Costa, who has scored 11 times already in the league this season since joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, is suspended for the game after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in Saturday's goalless draw with Sunderland. But midfielder Nemanja Matic insists that his side have the quality to break down Spurs without the Spain international. Diego Costa is shown a yellow card for a challenge on Wes Brown during the 0-0 draw with Sunderland . The booking rules Costa out of Chelsea's game with Tottenham, but Matic insists his team-mates will step up . 'I'm not scared,' Matic told reporters. 'Of course we need to have everybody available but in Didier Drogba and Loic Remy, we have good strikers.' Matic admitted that, after Sunderland's resilient display this weekend, Chelsea need to find a new way to break down stubborn opponents. 'Now every team is going to try to defend like that against us,' he said. 'We know that and we're ready for that. But we will find the space to score. Costa has been prolific for Chelsea so far this season, scoring 11 times in the league since joining the club . 'We knew they would create problems for us and we were ready for that. 'We didn't play badly. They played well even though I felt comfortable on the pitch and for 90 minutes we controlled the game. 'But they were compact and had 10 players on the edge of the box all the time, it was difficult to find space out there. 'We are not happy with one point but it is better than to go home with zero. If you don't score, you cannot win but [against Tottenham] we cannot let this happen again, we have to score.'

"A year before two Vanderbilt football players were convicted in a 2013 gang rape, campus officials concluded there was a lack of evidence that 'nonconsensual sexual intercourse' had occurred. The report from the Tennessee school's Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action and Disability Services Department led to the expulsion of Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Baty and two other players. However, Vanderbilt has refused to release its on-campus findings, leading some to wonder if the panel determined the players had, in fact, raped an unconscious female student. According to the Tennessean, the school's report concluded only that Vandenburg was an 'accomplice' in violating the woman's privacy. Scroll down for video . Guilty: A jury found Brandon Vandenburg, pictured left on Tuesday, and Cory Batey, pictured right on Monday, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. A year before, Vanderbilt's internal review came to a different conclusion . Video footage taken during the June 2013 incident shows football players carrying an unconscious woman down a hallway and laughing as they photograph her and remove articles of her clothing. The school is now the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for its handling of sexual violence allegations. While that investigation is ongoing, Vandenburg and Baty--both 21--face a possible decades-long jail sentence after they were found guilty last week of multiple counts of sexual assault. The two remaining defendants alleged to have joined Batey and Vandenburg in the dorm room attack, former players Jaborian McKenzie and Brandon Banks, probably helped themselves by cooperating with authorities, but their consequences loom much larger now that their former teammates have been found guilty. University officials, experts on sex crimes and survivors of sexual assault at Vanderbilt and all over the country hope the verdict's loudest signal goes out to women suffering in silence - telling them that justice is possible without destroying their own lives in the process. Most college sex assaults don't turn out this way. A recent Justice Department study found that 80 percent of campus rapes went unreported between 1995 and 2013, compared to 67 percent in the general population. An attorney for one of the ex-Vanderbilt University football players convicted of raping an unconscious fellow student says he will ask that a mistrial be declared after learning that a jury member was a rape victim. Fletcher Long says the juror was asked during jury selection about past experience with the criminal justice system, as either a victim or defendant. Long says the juror failed to disclose the rape. Long said the person 'lied to get on the jury' and 'got on with an agenda.' The juror's attorney, Sunny Eaton, said her client did not make misrepresentations. Eaton said the juror's past had 'no impact whatsoever' on decision-making at trial. The Associated Press does not generally identify sexual-assault victims. A spokeswoman for prosecutors said they do not believe the issue will overturn the verdict. Attorney: Vandenburg's lawyer Fletcher Long says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection . Easy decision: Jurors (from left), Dr Deirdre Young, Todd Easter and Dr. Corbi Milligan said they knew they had to convict Vandenburg and Batey when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack . The victim said she hopes her experience will encourage others to discuss how to end campus rapes. 'I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone,' she said in a statement read by one of the prosecutors. 'You are not to blame.' In this case, the evidence was overwhelming. Jurors saw university surveillance video and the players' own graphic cellphone images that put them at the scene. Vandenburg could be heard laughing and encouraging the attack on video he shared while it was happening. Testimony showed that he passed out condoms during the June 23, 2013 attack. Charging all four players with rape even though not all of them engaged in the act itself sends a strong message about holding people accountable, said Jane Stapleton, a University of New Hampshire professor who runs bystander intervention programs at campuses. Only two players were accused of raping the student, but all four were charged with it because prosecutors held them criminally responsible based on their actions that night. Vandenburg gets a hug from attorney Albert Perez Jr. after being found guilty. The 21-year-old was called an 'accomplice' in violating the rape victim's privacy in an internal investigation from jsut after the June 2013 incident . 'The jury has spoken. Now it is up to the court to impose an appropriate sentence on the defendants. The conduct revealed by the evidence at trial was profoundly disturbing and utterly unacceptable. 'Our heart goes out to the victim. Her testimony was forceful and brave. She has received our care and support. 'Many months ago Vanderbilt found both defendants responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy, and we quickly discharged both of them from the football team and subsequently expelled them from the university. We are confident we acted appropriately. 'Since Vanderbilt first reported the incident to the Nashville police, we have given our full cooperation to law enforcement, including the District Attorney's office. We will continue to do so. 'The safety and security of our students is Vanderbilt's top priority. Sexual violence will never be tolerated. Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.' The trial provided a rare opportunity to see what rape really looks like, experts on sexual violence said. 'There's no shortage of rape and sexual assault cases being put out in the media, but very rarely do we hear all the graphic details of a sexual assault,' said Rachel Freeman, vice president of programs at the Sexual Abuse Center of Nashville. And unlike so many other rape cases, this wasn't a matter of 'he-said/she-said.' The video made it obvious the woman was unconscious and totally incapable of consenting, so it was impossible to suggest that she was somehow to blame, Freeman said. The woman testified that the last thing she remembered was Vandenburg giving her drinks at a Nashville nightspot - and that she woke up the next morning in his dorm room, feeling sick and injured. To this day, she has no memory of the attack, she told jurors. Rumors swirled around campus, but she didn't learn what had happened until well after police came to her. The players had tried to cover it up by erasing the images. Testimony showed at least five other Vanderbilt athletes saw her in distress and did not report it. Only when Vanderbilt officials stumbled across closed-circuit TV showing players carrying an unconscious woman through the dormitory and into the room did they begin asking questions and summon the police, who recovered the digital evidence that made all the difference in court. Seeing the case through wasn't easy. The woman cried quietly throughout the trial, and doubled over and appeared to vomit at one point when Batey was testifying. But The Associated Press and other news organizations preserved her privacy, and she endured the proceedings as a Vanderbilt graduate. The attack didn't keep her from finishing her degree, and she's now pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience at an out-of-state university. That a victim of gang rape managed to keep her academic career on track is a real achievement, advocates say, something Vanderbilt officials hope students everywhere will consider. Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor of academic affairs, called the victim's response 'forceful and brave,' and said sexual violence will never be tolerated at the school. 'Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.' 'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case. All four men were expelled from Vanderbilt but never accused of rape by the university . 'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. The hard work of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and victims' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible. 'I want to especially thank detective Jason Mayo, Sgt. Mike Shreeve, Detective Chad Gish, Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman, Assistant District Attorneys Jan Norman and Roger Moore and victims' advocates Wanda Swan, Lt. Rochelle Barrios and Teresa Shearon. You are my heroes and I am so proud of and grateful for each of you. 'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.'","Brandon Vandenburg, 21, and Cory Batey, 21, were found guilty of raping an unconscious student in a dorm room in June 2013 with two other men .

Events at the Stadium of Light and St Mary’s over the weekend were separated by 20 hours and 300 miles, but what they did was bring the Premier League protagonists closer together. Chelsea were as good as champions last week, unbeaten in 12 and having dropped points just twice all season.

Autumn champions, yes, but as we welcome winter there was a chilly reminder for the Blues that resistance resides within the chasing pack. Gus Poyet and Sunderland were the first team to record a clean sheet against the west Londoners during Saturday’s stalemate, thus providing the rest of the league with a blueprint of how to combat their offensive force. Afterwards, Mourinho bemoaned the time afforded to opposite number Poyet to devise a strategy to shut out his side. ‘While they were in bed on Tuesday night we were getting back at 5am from Germany. They have had all week to work on their plan,’ he sounded. But as Jose will know all too well, December offers little reprieve. Six matches are to be negotiated before the dawn of 2015. It is a mammoth month which can reshape the complexion of a title contest. And, on the evidence of their 3-0 triumph at Southampton, champions Manchester City are in no mood to surrender their crown before the turkey has even been carved. Indeed, come Christmas they could well be back on top of the tree. Six points now separate the Blues and City as we prepare to hurtle through the festive season.

Before this weekend is out Chelsea will have faced Spurs and Newcastle, taking on the former without suspended talisman Diego Costa. He was part of the side which toiled at Sunderland, the Spaniard looking off the pace and out of sorts before picking up his fifth booking of the campaign. One match it may be, but perhaps a precedent has been set of how to foil Mourinho's men. The likes of Hull, Stoke and West Ham – who they face over Christmas – will almost certainly adopt the gameplan which proved so effective on Wearside. City, meanwhile, will look at their fixtures with a sense of anticipation. Four of the bottom seven – Leicester, Crystal Palace, West Brom and Burnley – could well represent the 12 points of Christmas for Manuel Pellegrini’s side.

"Former Vanderbilt football player Cory Batey has said that he would not have raped an unconscious woman if his father hadn't died when he was young. The 21-year-old convicted rapist told Dr Phil through tears that if his father had not passed away from cancer when he was nine, he would've had a strong male figure to put him on the right track. 'I would like to think I wouldn't be in this position if he was alive, honestly,' said Batey, who was one of 13 siblings. 'I just think a man needs his father at a certain point in life to mold him and discipline him and I think I missed out on that and I kind of had to choose my own direction.' Scroll down for videos . Emotional: Cory Batey, 21, cried as he explained how he had embarrassed his mother by gang-raping an unconscious woman in 2013. He said that if he had a strong male figure in his life, it wouldn't have happened . Sobs: He broke down as he described how he had embarrassed his mother, who works at Vanderbilt . The 21-year-old former football player spoke with Dr Phil in the exclusive interview, which will air today . Shocked, Dr Phil asked him: 'Because he wasn't there, do you not know right from wrong?' 'Oh, I know right from wrong,' he responded. Batey was found guilty of aggravated rape last month after assaulting the woman in a dorm with three other football players after a night of drinking in June 2013 - in an attack caught on camera. As he awaits his sentencing - where he faces more than 140 years behind bars - he sat down for an exclusive interview with Dr Phil, which will air in full on Monday afternoon. During the interview, he also became emotional as he spoke about his mother, Audrey 'Jeannie' Batey, who has worked at Vanderbilt for 37 years and who supported her son throughout his trial. 'I embarrassed her,' he said. 'I embarrassed her.' When the jury was shown the graphic videos of him attacking the woman during the trial, he said he couldn't bring himself to look at his mother, who was in the courtroom. 'Because I knew that's not who she raised and I disappointed her more than anything,' he said. Batey, who is one of 13 children, said that his mother has told him that she knows that he made a mistake and did something wrong but 'we'll be okay eventually'. Guilty: Batey and Brandon Vandenburg, who was also convicted, are pictured in mugshots after the verdict . Throughout the interview, he said he was sorry for his actions but repeatedly claimed he was so drunk he could remember nothing of the attack - so he does not believe it is a good representation of who he is. When asked by Dr Phil if he believes he should stay in prison for the rest of his life, which is a possibility when he is sentenced next month, he responded: 'I don't think I should.' Happier times: Batey is pictured with his mother, Audrey 'Jeannie' Batey, who works at Vanderbilt . He added that he does not believe his fellow rapist Brandon Vandenburg, who brought the woman back to the dorm and encouraged the others to rape her, should not be locked up for life either. 'Honestly, I think he's a good kid,' he told Dr Phil. 'I think he just got caught up in some unfortunate circumstances.' He added: 'I think everyone deserves to be forgiven and to be given a second chance. I don't think that was a clear representation of him. I know that's not a clear representation of me.' When Dr Phil pressed him over the assault, in which he urinated over the woman and laughed as she was raped by the other men and sodomized by a plastic bottle, he said he had not been himself. 'I was drunk out of my mind so I don't think I was thinking,' he said. 'That's just not a clear representation of who I am.' He went on: 'My whole life, I feel like I've always been a caring individual to look out for the helpless or the less fortunate... That just wasn't my heart. That just wasn't me.' He added that he hopes his victim and her family can forgive him for his mistake. When Dr Phil quizzed him about his victim, he said she hoped she could see past what he did to her. 'I wish she could really know the type of person I am,' he said. 'I hate that she had to see me in that light and think I’m that person, because I'm not. When I saw that stuff, I was just praying, I was just saying, ""Lord just put it in her heart to forgive me, because that's not me. It’s just not me"".' Sadness: Batey's mother looked on in shock after her son was found guilty of aggravated rape. In the interview with Dr Phil, he became emotional as he described his shame at his mother knowing what he had done . 'I wished I could take it all back,' he added. 'I wish there’s a button that, that I could just delete everything, but unfortunately there’s not. And I’m sorry she’s had to go through this... I just hope [her family] can find it in their heart to just forgive me.' Batey, who was dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit for the interview, was found guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. He faces up to 60 years behind bars when he is sentenced alongside Vandenburg on March 6. It took the jurors just three hours to convict the men. After the verdict, three of the jurors spoke out and revealed that they made their decisions early on in the case after seeing cell phone footage of the attack. 'As soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with,' Todd Easter told ABC News. 'What we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred.' Shock: Batey says goodbye to his attorney Worrick Robinson after being found guilty on January 27 . Another juror, Dr. Deirde Young, said watching the footage - which showed Vandenburg egging on Batey and two other men as the woman lay unconscious - made her feel 'awful.' 'I asked myself, ""how could they do this to that young lady?""' Young added. 'There can't be enough explanation to me. I don't know, I think they need to do some real soul searching. I've never experienced anything like these young men.' In the trial, the victim had testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room. After dragging her to his dorm room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said. The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her. Former life: Batey, left, and Vandenburg, right, are pictured in their headshots for Vanderbilt's football team . Accused: Two of their other former teammates, Brandon Banks, left, and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, right, are also accused in the case but have yet to stand trial . She woke up the next day in a friend's dorm room and felt sore but did not know she had been sexually assaulted until she saw the footage of the attack. During the trial, Batey's attorney had argued that his client was not capable of making decisions because he had consumed so much alcohol. Batey drank as many as 22 drinks that night. Vandenburg's attorney had argued that his client was not guilty of rape because he was physically unable to rape the girl after a night of drinking. The victim was in the courtroom for the verdict, and began crying as the two men were declared guilty on all counts. Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have also been charged in the incident but a trial date for their case has not yet been announced.","Cory Batey, 21, raped an unconscious student with three other men in a Vanderbilt dorm in June 2013 - in a horrific attack partly caught on camera .

I am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately Saturday was my last game for the New York Red Bulls. The decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change, I didn't want it to distract from the progress of the team. I have immensely enjoyed my four-and-a-half years here and would like to thank everyone involved with this club who has made my time here so enjoyable. Thanks must go particularly to Erik Soler, Hans Backe, Gerard Houllier, Andy Roxburgh, Mike Petke, all my team-mates, the technical staff, medical staff, all the personnel who work for the Red Bull organisation, the MLS and of course the owner Mr Mateschitz whose vision and passion brought me to this wonderful city. A special mention must go to the Red Bull fans who have supported this team through the good, the bad and the ugly times in the sun, rain and snow. You guys have really meant a lot to me and thank you for all your wonderful support. I will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter of my career. Thank you all .

"Fears: Rep. Frank Wolf claims national security has been compromised at NASA's Langley Research Center . NASA has been accused of compromising national security by allowing a Chinese national to remove classified information from a top US space research centre. Republican Representative Frank Wolf said 'several dozen' Chinese workers were employed by a contractor at Langley Research Center 'in an apparent attempt to circumvent appropriations restrictions' that were put in place by Congress to prevent  'foreign nationals of concern' from being hired. Rep. Wolf, who is chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA - said he was told about the practice by 'whistleblowers' at the facility in Hampton, Virginia. Addressing a press conference in Washington, he said he was told that one unnamed Chinese national who has links with an institution in China that the US government regards as an 'entity of concern,' is still employed at the site, the Daily Press reports. He said this worker was permitted access to classified information which he was then, allegedly, allowed to take back home to China. Rep. Wolf, who is chairman of the . Commerce, . Justice and Science appropriations subcommittee, which funds NASA, has . often criticised the Chinese Government for its alleged human . rights abuses . and cyber espionage. He said he had spoken to FBI Director Robert Mueller about the alleged national security violations at Langley. Rep. Wolf . said he had been shown documents and information about the alleged . security breach by NASA employees, which he has handed to the FBI. He described the details as 'shocking' and accused NASA's 'management culture' of turning a blind eye - or maybe even 'encouraging' - security violations, the Examiner reports. He said he wants an independent . investigation of NASA's national security operations and a review of all . current foreign nationals employed by the organisation. Fears: Rep. Wolf said he was given the information about the alleged security breach by 'whistleblowers' at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia . NASA's associate administrator for communications, David Weaver, said, in a statement, that the person Rep. Wolf referred to no longer works at Langley. He said NASA takes allegations of security breaches 'very seriously' and that it had completed its own review and referred the issue to the authorities. NASA invests more hundreds of millions of dollars each year on homeland security and counterintelligence activities, and requires annual security training for all of its employees, he added. Mr Weaver said foreign nationals are allowed to work at NASA facilities, and that contractors used to hire them are required to comply with all US Export Control, immigration laws and regulations.","Republican Frank Wolf claims Chinese worker removed sensitive information from Langley Research Center in Virginia .

"The England squad continued to close ranks around Alastair Cook as they prepared for Wednesday’s crucial third one-day international against Sri Lanka. With the tourists 2-0 down in the seven-match series and Cook’s contribution a patchy 32 runs from 54 balls, the pressure is on the captain to perform a double rescue act: save his side – and save himself. And he will be telling himself that the two come as a package. Off-spinner James Tredwell became the latest player to loyally defend his skipper, describing Cook as ‘a class player’ and insisting: ‘I’m sure there is a score around the corner’. The pressure on England captain Alastair Cook continues to mount in Sri Lanka . But England off-spinner James Tredwell has leapt to his skipper's defence ahead of the third ODI . Cook was on the sweep during practice ahead of the clash with Sri Lanka in Hambantota . But that corner is in danger of looking more like a dead end. If England fail to win four of their last five games – a task that looks beyond them after they succumbed with alarming ease in Colombo on Saturday – they will have lost five bilateral one-day series in a row under Cook. A heavy series defeat in this series, plus the continuation of Cook’s personal drought – he has not passed 80 in one-day cricket since June 2012 – could leave the ECB hierarchy in an embarrassing position, especially with the captain understood to be desperate to turn things around. Between now and the start of the World Cup on February 14, England have a maximum of only 10 one-day internationals. National selector James Whitaker insisted two months ago that Cook would be captain at the World Cup. But even his closest allies are struggling to sustain a convincing defence. In the past few days Sir Ian Botham, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen have all called for him to resign, though many feel Cook should have quit the format after leading a Test revival against India in the summer. Kevin Pietersen pleaded with Cook to resign after the humiliating second ODI defeat in Colombo . Ben Stokes (left) and Tredwell bowl during the session ahead of another one-day clash . Ian Bell chats to England coach Peter Moores during a net session on Monday afternoon . Eoin Morgan was one of the England batsman who struggled for runs on Saturday in Sri Lanka . Tredwell, though, was unconvinced that a crisis is brewing. ‘Everyone keeps going on about him, but we don’t really notice it in the dressing room,’ he said. ‘He’s pretty level-headed and calm about it.’ It might help if Cook’s obvious replacement within this tour party, Eoin Morgan, was on top of his game. But he is without a one-day half-century in 14 innings. For the moment, the magic has deserted him. Without it, England will have little chance of mounting a serious assault on the World Cup. ‘Whenever someone goes through a slump, it can become difficult,’ said Tredwell. ‘We all know what Eoin is like. He is a very astute person and he’s working very hard. ‘It is frustrating for everyone really. We’re all working as hard as we can on our skills and when things don’t go right it is not a nice feeling. ‘Maybe some of our skills are not up to scratch and that is what we’re trying to put right. If we get everything right in the same game we’re going to hurt people.’ The worry is that England – already missing the injured Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – lack the all-round quality to compete with a Sri Lankan side who have got their recent 5-0 hammering in India out of their system. They may not even be too inconvenienced by Mahela Jayawardene’s withdrawal from the third one-day international for personal reasons . Attempts have been made to rationalise the two defeats in Colombo. England admit they bowled badly in allowing Sri Lanka to post 317 in the series opener, and Cook said he had been wrong to bat first in the second game on Saturday. But these are details, and there is no mistaking the bigger picture. Here, amid the dense vegetation of Sri Lanka’s south coast, it feels easy to go missing in the jungle. England’s one-day team needs to find itself again – and fast.","James Tredwell backs Alastair Cook to turn England fortunes around .

"Thomas Vermaelen goes under the knife on Tuesday in Finland and the former Arsenal defender is not the only one whose career could depend on the operation’s success. Barcelona’s sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta set himself up for a fall when he signed the Belgian international despite his terrible luck with injuries in the previous two years. He set himself up again when he said on the day of his presentation that the player was ready to perform immediately and that he had no concerns over his fitness. Thomas Vermaelen poses as he is presented as a Barcelona player after joining from Arsenal in the summer . Vermaelen (left) poses alongside fellow new signing Luis Suarez (centre) and Sergio Busquets (right) And, not having learned from the previous two instances, he has now said he should be available for the semi-final stage of the Champions League. Barcelona are so convinced the player will recover before the end of the season they are not even attempting to use a Spanish League rule that allows them to sign a replacement if the player is to miss the rest of the campaign in its entirety. Former Barcelona and Spain keeper Zubizarreta is one of football’s nice guys with none of the arrogant airs that others might allow themselves were they occupying the position of sporting director at one of the biggest clubs in the world. But as sporting director of one of the biggest clubs in the world he lives or dies by such declarations and more importantly by his signings. Vermaelen is, for many, one transfer market mistake too many – the drop that overflows the glass, as they say in Spanish. Vermaelen (second right) joined Barcelona from Arsenal, where he had a number of injury problems . Almost since the day he replaced Txiki Begiristain as the man signing the players at the Camp Nou in 2010, a new central defender has been the priority but season after season Barcelona have failed to bring in the right man. This summer the club failed to land PSG’s young Brazilian Marquinhos and overlooked a host of La Liga based options such as Real Sociedad’s Iñigo Martinez, Villarreal’s Mateo Musacchio, Espanyol’s Hector Moreno or Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte. Instead went for Valencia’s 31-year-old Jeremy Mathieu and Arsenal’s Vermaelen. The later is yet to play a single minute and the former has played well but will never play well enough to justify his £16million price tag given his age. Marquinhos (left) was a player that Barcelona missed out on during their summer transfer spending . Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta (right) poses alongside Neymar (centre) Not all of Barca’s errors in the transfer market are his. Many can be traced back to a cash shortage stemming form former president Sandro Rosell’s obsession with signing Neymar who when all add-on payments were totted up left them with little change from £80m. But his fingerprints are on the signing of Brazilian full-back Douglas who has started only one game; the signing two seasons ago of Alex Song with the promise that he could also play as a centre-back; and most recently missing out on Mallorca’s 18-year-old midfielder Marco Asensio, who he seemed to have sealed but who looks like ultimately being signed by rivals Real Madrid. All that might be forgotten if Vermaelen returns with two outstanding semi-final performances in the Champions League but Barcelona supporters have long since stopped sharing their sporting director’s optimism.","Thomas Vermaelen has been plagued by injuries over the last two years .

"A woman has spent almost £20,000 in a bid to look like her heroine, reality TV star Kim Kardashian. Undergoing a vast array of cosmetic procedures and even wearing pants enhanced with silicone to replicated Kim’s famous derriere, Claire Leeson said she transformed her life after watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2009. Speaking with Ruth Langsford and Ben Shephard on ITV's This Morning, Claire, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex, said: ‘When I left school, friends would tell me that I had a resemblance to Kim. Scroll down for video . Despite family concerns and debts, Claire says she will continue trying to look more like the reality TV star . Claire said her quest to look like Kim, right, started after watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians . ‘So I watched [the show] and realised I had the same amount of siblings and that we have the same kind of arguments and things going on. 'I thought she was so beautiful and I really wanted to be like her.’ Claire, who spends £4,500 on her hair extensions alone, says the drastic steps she has taken to appear more like the Kim, 33, are an attempt to gain self-confidence after being severely bullied in her childhood. Claire confessed: ‘I've had my teeth whitened, then I wanted my boobs enhanced... and with pictures [of Kim] explained to my surgeon that I wanted to look like this. ‘I also wear bum padding - it's a silicone base. Pants with silicone inside. ‘They feel very real... and hopefully will end up having that done because my bum is never going to be as big as Kim's is.’ Claire, who wears silicone pants, hopes to soon be able to have her buttocks enhanced through implants . She added, ‘I look at Kim so much and would love to be exactly like her because sometimes I feel like I'm not fully confident all the time within myself. My family are really worried, but they are so used to it now, but I know that I want to be happy. ‘In one way, I feel like I'm living in a fantasy and in a dream world. But it's real enough for me. Breast implants: £5000Teeth whitening: £2,500Hair extensions: £4,500Make-up: £1,000Spray tans: £1,000Nails: £500Bum padding: £350Shoes and clothes: £3,150 . ‘I was badly, badly bullied over my looks and it took me ten years to realise that I wasn't unattractive. I was so badly bullied that I didn't want to be alive anymore.' Claire was humiliated by bullies who called her fat and ugly for three years between the ages of 13 and 16. After a bully told her that she was too ugly to live and threw paracetamol at her in class, Claire said had had enough. At the age of just 14, she made her first suicide attempt. A year later, Claire attempted suicide again, this time by overdosing on paracetamol while at a friend's house. She was rushed to hospital and luckily paramedics were able to save her. But there was no going back to school this time. Despite managing to sit one of her GCSE exams, drama for which she received an A, she dropped out before finishing them. Instead, Claire chose to pursue her studies at a local college before moving away from Chelmsford at the age of 19. ‘My life was hell and I was told every day that I was the ugliest thing alive and that I should kill myself. 'People do not realise what a damaging effect it has on your mental state for the rest of your life.’ Claire's obsession has even resulted in her getting into debt, as the expensive procedures to look like Kim Kardashian mount up. Revealing how she pays for the upkeep to look like her idol, Claire admitted: ‘I do work but the job I do doesn't pay as much... so it's credit cards and debts up to my eyeballs. ‘I've had [bailiff] letters, but I just ignore them and I say to myself that I will pay them - but as soon as money comes in I just think about getting my Kimmy on! And I'll buy the new hair, make up or whatever...’ Claire added: ‘At the moment, I feel like what I'm doing might not be right but I feel it’s what is best for me for the time being because when I get my Kimmy on I feel like I'm unstoppable and untouchable and I feel like no one can stop me and I can make something of myself. 'I feel strong... and I feel that I have built enough confidence to love myself a little bit more.’","Claire Leeson first became obsessed with reality TV star in 2009 .

"Russia has suspended the import and use of an American GM corn following a study suggesting a link to breast cancer and organ damage. Separately, the European Food Safety Authority(EFSA), has ordered its own review in to the research, which was conducted at a French university. The decision by Russia could be followed by other nations in what would be a severe blow to the take-up of the controversial technology. Cancer risk? A farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered corn by U.S. company Monsanto, right, and two normal corncobs from Germany, left . Historically, biotech companies have proved the safety of GM crops based on trials involving feeding rats for a period of 90 days. However, experts at the University of Caen conducted an experiment running for the full lives of rats - two years. The findings, which were peer reviewed by independent experts before being published in a respected scientific journal, found raised levels of breast cancer, liver and kidney damage. The same trials also found evidence that consumption of minuscule amounts of a commonly used weedkiller, Roundup, was associated with a raised risk of cancer. Both the GM corn, which carries the name NK603, and Roundup are the creation of US biotech company Monsanto. The decision by the Russians to suspend authorisation for the American GM corn threatens to trigger a transatlantic commercial and diplomatic row. Contentious: A combine harvests corn in a field near Coy, Arkansas. The decision by the Russians to suspend authorisation for the American GM corn threatens to trigger a transatlantic commercial and diplomatic row . Russia’s consumer rights watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, said today that it has suspended the import and use of the Monsanto GM corn. Rospotrebnadzor said the country’s Institute of Nutrition has been asked to assess the validity of the study. It has also contacted the European Commission’s Directorate General for Health & Consumers to ask for the EU’s position on the corn’s safety. Consumer scepticism in the UK and Europe means GM corn is not on supermarket shelves here, however it is fed to farm animals, including hens, pigs and dairy cows. Important: In the USA, and much of Europe, corn is used to make an array of food products including cornflakes (picture posed by model) Last week Monsanto said it did not think the French study would affect its license to export the NK603 to Europe but would wait to hear from EFSA. The company said: ‘Based on our initial review, we do not believe the study presents information that would justify any change in EFSA’s views on the safety of genetically modified corn products or alter their approval status for genetically modified imports.’ The biotech industry and university researchers involved in GM research have mounted a major PR campaign over the last year to win over sceptical consumers. In the past week, pro-GM scientists have been lining up to undermine the French experiments and criticise the way they were conducted. However, a number of independent academics have praised the French team’s work, describing it as the most thorough and extensive feeding trials involving GM to date. Mustafa Djamgoz, the Professor of Cancer Biology, at Imperial College, London, said the findings relating to eating GM corn were a ‘surprise’. Prof Djamgoz, who describes himself as a neutral on GM, said: ‘The results are significant. The experiments are, more or less, the best of their kind to date.’ However, he said that it is now important to ensure they are repeated with more animals by independent laboratories to confirm the outcome. ‘We are not scaremongering here. More research, including a repetition of this particular study are warranted,’ he said. The professor said it will take two to three years to get a definitive answer.","The European Food Safety .

"David Beckham and his son Brooklyn walked away from a nasty looking crash this weekend, but his car did not fare quite so well. Photos have emerged showing the driver's side of his Audi RS6 badly damaged while the other car - believed to be a Mitsubishi Colt Coupe Cabriolet - was written off. The former England captain had just picked up his eldest from Arsenal’s training ground on Saturday when the smash happened. David Beckham's road accident on Saturday happened near Arsenal's London Colney training ground . The photos show the driver's side of the former England captain's Audi RS6 was badly dented in the collision . Beckham, 39, had been at Arsenal's training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire  watching his eldest son play for the club’s Under 16 side against Brighton. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder was reportedly treated at the scene for minor injuries to his shoulder while Brooklyn was unhurt. Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the scene and Beckham was driven away in another car. Both were said to be shaken following the accident. One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’ And team-mate Thomas Cadman thought the whole episode was utterly surreal, tweeting: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.' Beckham's airbags are said to have been deployed in the smash.

Police were seen leaving his home, then interviewing witnesses nearby for more information about the accident. Damage was clearly visible on the white Acura 4x4, as well as David's expensive Range Rover Sport, where the bumper was hanging off the front. Brooklyn was signed by Arsenal on a short-term contract earlier this month after impressing coaches at the Emirates. Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s Under 13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s Under 10s.

"Alan Shearer has likened the situation between Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool to the rift he had with Ruud Gullit at Newcastle more than 15 years ago. Former Newcastle striker Shearer was dropped by Gullit in 1999 for their North East derby against Sunderland at St James' Park, which turned out to be the Dutch manager's final match as he resigned three days  after the 2-1 defeat. Gerrard was left on the substitutes' bench for 75 minutes of Saturday's scrappy 1-0 win over Stoke City at Anfield amid reports of a rift developing between the club captain and manager Rodgers.

Rodgers revealed on Monday that Liverpool have offered the 34-year-old a new contract, but Shearer feels there is more to it after finding himself in a similar situation under Gullit. 'Something has gone wrong between the manager who nearly guided the club to a first Premier League title and one of the club's greatest-ever players,' Shearer wrote in his column forThe Sun. 'Have no doubt about it - Steven Gerrard was unceremoniously dropped at Anfield on Saturday. Forget about his age or being rested, or not being able to play every game... he was axed, plain and simple.

'I remember being in a situation at Newcastle when Ruud Gullit dropped me for our biggest game of the season at home to Sunderland. He did not even have the courtesy to tell me, I just read it on the board in the dressing room. 'He was obviously flexing his muscles as manager and maybe Rodgers is doing the same. 'Mind you, it did prove to be the last game Gullit had as Newcastle manager. 'That is certainly not the case with Rodgers at Liverpool and nor should it be.

"Liverpool fans might be missing Luis Suarez but his replacement Mario Balotelli is making sure the Barcelona striker is gone, but not forgotten.

"Half of all women have a fall-back partner on call should their current relationship turn sour, it emerged today. A substantial percentage have kept another man in mind in case they end up single. And married women are more likely have a Plan B in the background than those who are just in a relationship. The back-up is likely to be an old friend who has always had feelings for them . Do you have a fall-back partner in case your relationship turns sour? Do you have a fall-back partner in case your relationship turns sour? Now share your opinion . It also emerged the back-up is likely to be an old friend who has always had feelings for the woman in question. But other candidates are an ex-boyfriend or ex-husband, a colleague - or someone who they have met at the gym. The survey of 1,000 women also found Plan B is also likely to be someone whom she has known for around seven years, who will be 'ready and waiting' because of 'unfinished business'. Furthermore, around one in ten women said their Plan B had already confessed his undying love, while one in five said they were confident he would 'drop everything' for her, if she asked him to. Slightly more than four in ten said they had got to know the man whilst they were with their partner, while a similar percentage said he was 'on the scene' long before. One in five said they were confident he would 'drop everything' for her, if she asked him to . Around one in four women who have a back-up plan have feelings as strong for him as they do for their other half. Incredibly, 12 per cent went as far as to admit their feelings were 'stronger' for Plan B, and close to seven in ten admitted they are currently in contact with him. But despite the secrecy involved in having a close friend or ex to turn to, around half of the women who took part in the poll said their other half was aware of the 'third party'. Of those, one in five said they were able to joke about it, but one in three said their man was 'uncomfortable' discussing him. One in four admitted their current partner had met their Plan B, while one in five admitted he was a friend of the man in her life. The good news for the nation's men is that one in three women said they 'doubted' anything would ever happen with the man in the background. Around half had a 'never say never' approach, while trouble may lie ahead for one in six who said they were 'seriously considering' rekindling their romance with the man in the shadows. A spokesman for online market research company OnePoll.com said: 'For our research to establish that 50 per cent of women in relationships have a 'Plan B' is a worrying sign. 'This news may cause a few men in relationships to think twice about not taking the rubbish out or choosing a night down the pub in favour of a cosy night in with his partner. 'This could spark fear in men across the UK and be great news for women looking for that extra bit of love and care so that their attentions aren't swayed. 'The saying that ""the grass isn't always greener"" clearly isn't deterring women of today. They understand that anything can happen and are ensuring they have a solid back up plan should things go sour with their current man' 'With sites like Facebook and Twitter, it's easier than ever to stay in touch with an old flame. Men need to be aware of any 'old friends' that turn up out of the blue that's for sure.'","Married women are more likely have a Plan B in the background .

"Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois is not worried about fatigue over the Christmas period and has challenged his team-mates to maintain their form over the Christmas period. The Blues have seven Premier League games - starting against Tottenham on Tuesday - in the next month and Courtois knows this could be a defining period in the title race. For the 22-year-old, the period will be extra challenging as during his three seasons in Spain he became accustomed to a winter break.

Courtois jumps to fist one an effort away during a training session at Cobham last week .

'In Spain we normally played until December 22 and then had seven days free, so it’s not a big difference, it’s not a problem. 'It’s an important week with two difficult games. First [there is] a derby against Tottenham in front of our own fans and then we go away to Newcastle, which will be tough. 'It’s an important month and we will try to win as many games as we can.'
