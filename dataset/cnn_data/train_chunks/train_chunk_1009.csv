"Sophie Archer, the mother of a toddler killed by her 21-year-old boyfriend while she celebrated her birthday in New York was interviewed on This Morning today . Sophie Archer thought she was leaving her 23-month-old daughter Roxie in safe hands when she left for a three day trip to New York in March last year. But, only 24 hours into the holiday, Sophie received a call from her boyfriend Ben Raftery explaining that her daughter was on her way to hospital after accidentally falling and banging her head. In fact, within hours of Sophie's departure, Raftery had beaten toddler Roxie so badly that she died from devastating brain injuries the next day. An investigation revealed she was either . pushed or fell down the stairs and tests showed she was punched, slapped . and subjected to ‘vigorous shaking’ before she died. Raftery was jailed for . life in May this year and today Sophie, who is now expecting a baby with . a new partner, spoke for the first time about her ordeal. She explained to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Ealmon Holmes: 'It was the worst feeling in the world, we got the first flight home. When I arrived at the hospital she was on a life support machine, she was wearing a neck brace, bruised and full of tubes. She looked awful. 'Not long after the doctor pulled me to one side and said they had tried everything and there was no chance of survival.' Raftery was arrested several days after Roxie's death, but Sophie admitted that she was surprised because she still believed that her daughter had hurt herself by tumbling in McDonald's. She said: 'I didn't think he would have done anything to her.' Roxie Archer (right) died from devastating brain injuries . Sophie and Raftery had been together for . four months before she left him in charge of her daughter to take that . fateful trip. At the start of their relationship she admits she was very . happy and grateful to have him around: 'He came across as a very . charming man, everything I was looking for. I wanted somebody in my life . because I was a single mum. I was grateful to have him around as he was . so nice and loving.' Originally Roxie was due to stay with . her grandmother while Sophie visited New York to celebrate her 21st . birthday with her father, but Raftery persuaded her to leave the child with him at their shared home in Ashton-under-Lyne because he wanted to ‘bond’ with her. Defenceless: Raftery had said he wanted to 'bond' with Roxie . Sophie, now 22, told the jury who convicted Raftery: 'I . trusted him and didn’t think he would cause any harm to her. I thought . they would have bonded, they would have got on, not that anything like . this would have happened.' But in the early hours of March 10, . Raftery rang 999 and told the operator: 'My baby’s fell down the stairs. I can’t really hear breathing.' Inquiries revealed in the hours . before Roxie was taken to hospital that Raftery posted a photo of Roxie . on Facebook, with a caption saying she had hit her head on a door at . McDonalds. But the day after she . died, he edited the caption on the picture to read, ‘Aah my little . princess when she banged her head on the floor’. On This Morning Sophie admitted that Raftery had displayed some controlling and violent behaviour towards her and Roxie before the trip, but claimed that she was so brainwashed into thinking that she needed him that she ignored it. She said: 'There were a few occasions when he held her upside down by her legs and we would argue about it but he threatened to leave. (Roxie) grew less comfortable around him but I thought it was down to jealousy. 'At the start he was a really nice lad but towards the end he was horrible, very controlling, he stopped me me seeing my friends and family. I didn't see the signs though, I was brainwashed. I thought I needed him.' Raftery has never admitted guilt, maintaining that the child’s injuries were caused by an . accidental fall down the stairs at the house he shared with Roxie and . her mother in Ashton-under-Lyne. He . said: 'Roxie called me daddy the first day I met her - I had a bond . with Roxie, we were so close - I thought Sophie was the one.' Jailed: Ben Raftery has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years . But Det Supt Denise Worth from Greater Manchester Police said in May: 'Roxie was a . two-year-old little girl who should have felt safe in her own home in . the care of Raftery. He abused his position of trust and subjected an innocent toddler to an attack which left her with an unsurvivable head injury. 'We will never know exactly what happened on that day, as Raftery has always maintained that it was an accident. Roxie’s . family are devastated by Raftery’s actions and will never be able to . see [her] grow up into a young woman, see her get married and have . children of her own. 'He has now been jailed, and will have to live the rest of his life with the knowledge that he is responsible for killing Roxie.' Sophie is devastated that he has never shown any remorse and is desperate to know why he killed her little girl. She said: 'He denied everything. He didn't show any remorse. I don't know what happened that night and it tears me apart day and night that I don't know what happened to my daughter.'","Ben Raftery, 21, left 23 month-old Roxie .

"Manchester United academy director Brian McClair has refused to rule out Tom Cleverley making a successful return to Old Trafford when his loan spell at Aston Villa finishes. Despite being allowed to leave the club on loan this season by new boss Louis van Gaal, McClair has suggested Cleverley could resurrect his career at United. 'You don't know what's going to happen because he's only on loan at Villa,' McClair told ESPN FC. 'I think he's a good player. Tom Cleverley holds the ball from Aleksandar Kolarov while in action for Aston Villa against Manchester City . 'He came from Bradford when he was 12. At 16 we didn't offer him a scholarship. He stayed at school and he worked as hard he possibly could, while still at school and at the end of that two-year period, because he had developed more physically, he had a professional contract. 'He's gone on from that to represent his country and to play many games in the Premier League.' Upon joining Villa, the 25-year-old vowed to put the negativity that marred his final season at United behind him, and prove wrong those who doubted his ability. Cleverley had a season to forget under David Moyes last season as United finished seventh in the league . But the club's academy director Brian McClair has suggested Cleverley could return and be a hit at United . He said: 'You don't turn into a bad player just because someone says it on Twitter. I probably wasn't the only United player to get it last year. For as long as Man United aren't winning trophies, players will get criticised. I'm fully aware of that. I've still got a league title, 13 England caps. 'If all the players say they were high in confidence last season I think they would be lying. It wasn't just me. It was the rest of the squad too.'","Brian McClair has suggested Tom Cleverley's Manchester United career is not over, as the midfielder completes a season-long loan at Aston Villa .

"Scroll down for video . A drinking party dubbed 'Cinco de Drinko' at the University of California at Davis was abruptly cancelled after some students protested that the event was racist against Latinos. The party was scheduled for Saturday, ahead of the Cinco de Mayo holiday on Monday, which celebrates Mexican heritage and pride. Some students who had organized the party worked at the on-campus Coffee House where Friday's protest took place. A University of California at Davis students holds a sign protesting an now cancelled event called 'Cinco de Drinko' that some students said was racist against Latinos . The Sacramento Bee reported that about 100 students enacted a sit-in at the Coffee House, wearing red shirts and chanting slogans. They called for a boycott of the student-run cafe and cafeteria, successfully scuttling plans for the off-campus party. They were prompted by a Facebook page created to promote the party. It showed a picture of four male students wearing sombreros while trying to hop a chain-link fence as two female students stand nearby smiling and wearing Border Patrol uniforms, the newspaper said. 'What kind of message are you trying to send?' student Edwin Roque said, calling the party theme offensive. University of California at Davis students protesting a drinking event associated with the Cinco de Mayo holiday some deemed racist. 'There were racial depictions that were extremely insensitive, including a border fence,' UC Davis student body President Armando Figueroa told KCRA. But Jonathan Beatty also attended the protest wearing a sombrero. He said the theme was not racist, comparing it to St. Patrick's Day festivities. 'People were being overly sensitive,' Beatty said. UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi told the newspaper she believed that adding a mandatory diversity course could prevent future controversies like this one. Adela de la Torre, vice chancellor of student affairs, said an investigation was ongoing and the university's administration is considering internal sanctions for the students behind the party. Cinco de Drinko would have been the second racially insensitive event hosted by Coffee House employees in less than a month, according to the Sacramento Bee. The other party, 'Holy Land,' encouraged attendees to dress up as terrorists and religious deities, said Armando Figueroa, president of the Associated Students of UC Davis.","Party was set to coincide with Cinco de Mayo, a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride .

"A woman from Washington was caught during the rush hour using the HOV lane with a giant stuffed Costco bear sitting in the front seat as her 'passenger'. Washington State Patrol trooper Mark Francis says the woman was pulled initially for speeding as she was clocked going 74 in a 60-mile per hour zone. When the trooper approached the vehicle, they saw something else in the car. Bare-faced cheek! The Washington State Patrol says they pulled over a woman carrying a giant stuffed bear in lieu of a passenger on Monday . 'As she rolls that window down, she sees it is a bear sitting in the front passenger seat,' says Francis. The 19-year-old driver from Everett told authorities the bear wasn't in the front seat to appear as a passenger. 'According to her,' said Francis, 'there was not enough room in the back of her minivan to put the bear back there. That's what she was doing with the bear in the front passenger seat.' Despite the 'bare-faced' cheek of it all, the woman was still in violation because she was using the HOV lane without there being anyone else int he vehicle. In addition to speeding and  driving in the HOV lane, the woman also had no insurance. 'She had a grand total of an $818 citation for speeding, no insurance and the HOV violation,' said Francis.","19-year-old from Washington State claimed the bear wouldn't fit in the back .

"The vigilante dressed as Batman who frogmarched a wanted man into a police station was today unmasked as a Chinese takeaway delivery driver. Stan Worby, 39, claims he was the caped crusader who stunned officers and passers-by when he swept into the station in a costume from the 1960s TV series before vanishing into the night. CCTV footage shows the slightly . overweight superhero taking the fraud suspect to the front desk, where he calmly . waited for the duty officer and then told him: ‘Here you . are, it’s over to you now.’ Scroll down for video . Unmasked: Takeaway delivery driver Stan Worby reveals himself as the vigilante who marched a wanted man into a police station while dressed as Batman before vanishing into the night . Dark Knight rises: The man dressed as Batman stayed with the alleged crook before disappearing . The footage had earlier caused a frenzy . on the internet as viewers speculated who the superhero might be. Last night, Mr Worby claimed it was him. The man Mr Worby delivered to the station was actually his friend, Daniel Frayne, who explained who he was to the officer. After being escorted into Trafalgar . House police station at 1.35am last Monday, Frayne was arrested on . suspicion of burglary, fraud and breach of a court order. He was later . charged with handling stolen goods and fraud-related offences and is due . to appear before the city’s magistrates on Friday. Telling all: Mr Worby, 39, said the incident was a practical joke and was keen to emphasise that he isn't carrying as much weight as people have assumed as he was wearing a tracksuit underneath the outfit .

The vigilante hands over the wanted man at a police station in Bradford . Pow!: A 27-year-old man is now due at Bradford Magistrates' charged with handling stolen goods . Gotham City or Bradford City: The identity of heroic Batman remains a mystery . A police spokesman said: ‘The person . who brought the wanted man into the station was dressed in a full Batman . outfit. His identity, however, remains unknown. The Batman outfit was a . normal fancy dress costume and whoever had decided to put it on knew . the suspect was wanted by police.’ Residents on the street where Frayne . lives with his girlfriend said police had been looking for him for . several weeks. ‘They drove up and down here every day to check on the . house and we’ve not seen him around here for quite a while,’ said . neighbour Kaley Wilkinson, 27. ‘He’s a very serious-looking  guy and not the sort of person  you would think would be involved in a prank.’ 'Sense of the surreal': Stan Worby, centre, dressed as Batman, is photographed with friends also in fancy dress, including sidekick Robin . Emergency service: Mr Worby was posing as the 1960s reincarnation of Batman, played by Adam West (above) in the TV series alongside Burt Ward as Robin .

'The only thing that concerns me – . judging from the waistline and tights – is that he doesn’t look that . fit.’ City council leader David Green added: ‘Clearly, whoever this . individual is has a good sense of humour and a sense of the surreal.’ A police source said: ‘We think it’s a friend who obviously thought this would be a funny thing to do.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Man in full Batman costume brought suspect in by the scruff of his neck .

"The first video of the $300million Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic spacecraft has been released following its ill-fated second test flight. The 13,000mph unmanned aircraft of the future took off for a crucial test flight from a Californian rocket pad earlier this month. It travelled to the edge of space and was due to glide back down to Earth at roughly four miles per second but all contact was lost and the craft was thought to have crashed. First footage: The Falcon HTV-2 (circled) can be seen in the video streaking across the sky at Mach 20 shortly before it crashed into the sea . Falcon HTV-2: The aircraft can travel at 20 times the speed of sound - or 13,000mph. It is part of research effort by Darpa to one day make long-duration hypersonic flight a reality . This still from a video released by Darpa shows the difference in speed between the Falcon, soaring through the centre, a C-5 (right) and an F-18 fighter jet (left) Now video footage of its penultimate . moments has been released by the Defense Advanced Research Projects . Agency (Darpa) and while it doesn't show the craft's 'controlled descent' into the Pacific Ocean, it does give some ideas of its incredible speed. The soundless footage shows the Falcon streaking across the sky at Mach 20 on August 11. The video was made by a crew member . aboard the Pacific Tracker, the first monitoring vessel able to visually . track the Falcon's initial entry into the atmosphere. Darpa director Regina Dugan says the video, 'gives us a visceral feel for what it means to fly at Mach 20.' On the ground: This photo from Vandenberg Air Force Base shows a Minotaur IV rocket standing beside Space Launch Complex-8 in California, which the hypersonic glider was due to launch from . Epic: The mission might lead to new records, super weapons and eventually global travel at colossal speeds. The aircraft is unmanned, rocket-launched and manoeuvrable . Name: Falcon HTV-2 . Mission: To provide the U.S. Military with its first in a new generation of sub-orbital weaons. Top speed: 13,000mph or Mach 22. A MiG-25 can typically reach Mach 2.3, or 1,520mph . Length: 12ft long . Weight: 900kg . Materials: Made of experimental material that can withstand up to 3,500f (2000C) it will experience upon re-entry. Cost: $308million (£189million), so far . Payload: Potentially anything up to 12,000lbs, including a nuclear bomb. Range: Anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes . As a companion piece to the video, . Darpa also released a simulated speed comparison between the Falcon, a . C-5 and an F-18 fighter jet, which show the Falcon making mincemeat of . its competitors among the clouds. The Falcon is currently being . developed by Darpa and the Pentagon as part of research into a new . generation of weapons with the potential to strike rogue states anywhere . on Earth in under 60 minutes. However, it is hoped the craft could . one day make long-haul hypersonic flight a reality as at up to 20 times . the speed of sound it would slash the flying time from London to Sydney . to just an hour. The Falcon reaches such a high speed . partly because of its own weight descending through Earth's atmosphere, . but also because of the experimental engines on board which are designed . to run at extreme velocities. The test-flight featured in the Darpa . video was the team's second attempt at making science fiction a reality. The first test had to be aborted last year after its onboard systems . detected a fault. An artist's impression of the rocket which carried the Falcon to the edge of space . The second attempted flight lifted off . from Vandenberg Air Force Base on board an Air Force Minotaur IV . rocket, which took the HTV-2 to the edge of the atmosphere. After it separated from the rocket, it was supposed to glide over the Pacific at up to 20 times the speed of sound. The take-off went well but contact was lost with the craft at the glide phase.","Falcon HTV-2 can be seen traveling at Mach 20 - 13,000mph .

"In the middle of a brutal civil war a bronze statue of Jesus has appeared on a Syrian mountain side. The 105ft statue has taken eight years to complete, and stands on Mount Sednaya. And although its safety is not . guaranteed, it has been in place for three weeks in an area where some Al-Qaida . fighters have little sympathy for Christians. Workers preparing to install a statue of Jesus on Mount Sednaya, Syria which arrived in two pieces . Syrian Christians believe that the second advent of Christ will happen on the mountain, on the route that pilgrims took from Jerusalem to Constantinople. Backers say it is there simply because 'Jesus would have done it.' The main armed groups in the area halted fire while organisers set up the statue which was assembled from two pieces. Divine inspiration: Christians in Syria believe that the second coming of Jesus will happen at the site . Smaller statues of Adam and Eve stand close to the work which was inspired by Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer statue. The project, called I Have Come to Save the World, is run by the London-based St Paul and St George Foundation and was financed by private donors from across the globe. The plans were started in 2005, but were hit by many set backs including the deaths of key backers and the 2011 uprising against president Assad. Fighters held their fire as the statue was put up. It has been paid for by backers from across the globe . And for as long as it is there, the statue will offer some support to the region's besieged Christians. Sunni Muslims dominate the revolt, and jihadists make up some of the strongest fighting groups. Other Muslim groups along with the 10-percent Christian minority have stood largely with Assad's government, or remained neutral. Churches have been vandalised, priests abducted and last month the extremists overran Maaloula, a Christian-majority town so old that some of its people still speak a language from Jesus' time.","Statue appeared in an area where Christians are being persecuted .

"Twelve years ago James Simpson-Daniel lit up Twickenham with a string of dazzling displays which should have seen him running out on Saturday with 100 caps to his name. But James Simpson-Daniel will never run again. He is not even sure how long he will be able to play with his kids in the garden. Four shoulder operations, a shattered clavicle and four ankle surgeries since that memorable autumn of 2002 have finally done for the man they call Sinbad. James Simpson-Daniel, playing for England against the Barbarians in 2006, was forced to retire this year . The former rugby star says his retirement 'was like a bereavement' and he will be unable to run ever again . The last injury - a horrific fracture-dislocation of his left ankle sustained last November - forced him to call time on a brilliant, but ultimately unfulfilled, 13-year professional career. ‘I still haven’t come to terms with it fully,’ the 32-year-old said. ‘I went through so much rehab and got so close but in the end every time I tried to run I got this hot sensation and just had to stop. I think I went to the pub after I was told to call it a day. The tears came randomly in the middle of the night a few days later. It felt like a bereavement. ‘Day-to-day life I’m all right. I can walk my dog. I can hopefully play with the kids in the garden. But in the morning and at night I’ll be hobbling around, stiff and sore. If I have a long journey and haven’t really moved I’ll be limpy. It isn’t ideal. I’m not going to be able to run again.’ The most naturally gifted player of his generation isn’t bitter. He enjoyed 13 years at Kingsholm -playing 272 games - although he has ‘many regrets’ about an international career which eventually yielded only 10 caps. Simpson-Daniel played 272 games for Gloucester over 13 years at Kingsholm in the West Country . But he has joined a growing list of professionals forced to retire early through injury, and the severity of his last one is shocking, even by today’s gladiatorial standards. ‘I remember Tins (team-mate and friend Mike Tindall) standing over me - he was probably thinking I should have passed the ball - but the oxygen wasn’t working at the time. I could hear Tins shouting, “Get the f***ing oxygen”. ‘It was like a scene out of the film Any Given Sunday when the quarterback gets wiped out and he’s just tearing pieces of turf out of the ground. It was tough. Simpson-Daniel, pictured against Biarritz in 2009, was the most talented player of his generation . ‘I didn’t need to look down because I’d felt everything. I’d heard the ligaments pop and the bone snap. I could hear all their players murmuring about how bad it was. The bone had basically shattered and cut like a dagger through the muscle inside my leg. ‘I was so drugged up. I had about five days in hospital. I was transferred from the local Gloucester hospital to London in the back of a Range Rover in a morphine haze. That was awful. Every time the car moved I could feel the bone moving against itself from side to side.’ Desperate for one more season at the top, Simpson-Daniel and Gloucester’s medical team resorted to increasingly extreme measures to try to fix his ruined left ankle. The former England flyer poses with his dog Bertie on the stairs of his Gloucestershire home . Simpson-Daniel evades the challenge of Wales' Robin McBride during England's 43-9 win in August 2003 . ‘The final treatment I had was called Pamidronate, which is used for cancer patients,’ he said. ‘The idea is that they pump this stuff into your arm and it travels around your body and finds the damaged area of the bone and strengthens it.’ He added: ‘It’s quite an aggressive treatment and one of the side-effects is you can get properly ill. On the train home I started having flu-like sweats. I could handle that. But when I woke up the next day my whole body was throbbing. My bones were aching. ‘Then I needed a month for the treatment to take maximum effect. I waited for a month, and even when I was lacing up my boots I thought I was going to be OK. I went out and ran, wasn’t OK, and came back in a retired rugby player.’ Simpson-Daniel shone against a Barbarians side containing Jonah Lomu at Twickenham in May 2002 . If things had taken a different turn, Simpson-Daniel could have appeared against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday as a veteran star with a World Cup winner’s medal. The talent was undisputed, but his body failed him too often in rugby’s heavyweight arena. Barely out of his teens, the former Sedbergh schoolboy was drafted into Clive Woodward’s squad in November 2002 following an eye-catching display in an uncapped international against Jonah Lomu and the Barbarians. A memorable moment of trickery, allied to searing pace and a magnificent step, left Lomu floundering and Twickenham purring. The flyer glides past Lomu, who attempts to tackle him, during the non-cap international at Twickenham . A full international debut victory over the All Blacks followed, before a man-of-the-match display against Australia the following week confirmed England had unearthed a gem. A year after leaving school, Simpson-Daniel had hit the big time. ‘A few months earlier I’d been at school playing “Jonah Lomu’s Rugby” on the PlayStation,’ he said. ‘Then Clive told me I was playing against him. I was terrified. Those two games were unbelievable. To beat the All Blacks and Australia in my first two matches for England in a team of legends: it was special.’ But just hours after the final whistle against Australia, it was confirmed the sickness he’d felt in the lead-up to the game was actually glandular fever. He missed the following week’s battle with South Africa before a back injury set in and he failed to make the World Cup cut by the narrowest of margins. He (right) part-owns racehorse Monbeg Dude with former team-mates Mike Tindall and Nicky Robisnon . ‘I remember watching the final with my in-laws,’ he said. ‘I cheered the boys on but when the final whistle went I had this gut-wrenching feeling. I felt sick. I knew how close I’d come to being part of it.’ Simpson-Daniel does not know what he is going to do with the rest of his life. A part share in racehorse Monbeg Dude with friends and former team-mates Tindall and Nicky Robinson is a fun distraction, but will not provide financial security for his young family. ‘I have to accept that there will never be anything out there that mirrors the sensation you get from rugby,’ he said. ‘I don’t know how I’ll be remembered. People say I could have got more caps for England. But at Gloucester they seem to like me so maybe I’ll go down as one of the good players at Gloucester. ‘Apart from that it won’t be too long until no one knows my name. That’s the point. Unless you’re Jonny Wilkinson people forget you pretty quickly. I’ll be like every other player. Forgotten soon.’ Simpson-Daniel runs with the ball during England training in Bath back in May 2011 .","James Simpson-Daniel broke on to the England scene 12 years ago .

"Pornography is to be banned from public wi-fi networks by the end of the year, David Cameron’s children’s czar said last night. Claire Perry said the move was vital to prevent children from stumbling across adult material when using wireless internet networks in places such as cafes and railway stations – or seeing others who may be downloading it. But one of the country’s largest internet providers has threatened to throw a spanner in the works by warning that ministers’ plans to block porn from public wi-fi could be against the law. The move is intended to stop children from viewing porn online when in public . BT was accused of ‘dragging its heels’ over an agreement to filter its public wi-fi services by raising at the last minute its concerns that it could open itself to legal challenges. The company claims blocking adult material from stores which use BT public wi-fi could breach 2000 legislation which bans the interception of electronic communications. Last year the Daily Mail revealed that coffee chain Starbucks, which uses BT, had failed to filter adult material from its free wi-fi – putting children of seeing obscene porn on other customers’ tablets or mobile phones. Starbucks has now imposed a filter. But Mrs Perry, the Prime Minister’s children’s czar, said she was still hopeful that hardcore porn would be filtered out of all public wi-fi networks by the end of the year. The six largest providers of public wi-fi – accounting for 96 per cent of coverage – have agreed to put adult content block in place. BT has been accused of 'dragging its heels' about the move after they saw problems with it . High Street companies offering free wi-fi from one of the six companies, which includes BT, would then be encouraged to put the block in place to protect children using mobile phones and tablets like iPads. These shops would be able to display a ‘family friendly’ logo so parents know their children will be safe. Mrs Perry, Mr Cameron’s adviser on children, said: ‘I’m really pleased that the internet industry is committed to providing public wi-fi that is free of adult content. It is entirely appropriate and means that children can surf the web safely in thousands of different places. ‘Now we need to move fast in introducing family-friendly home internet filtering to make sure that our young people are not accessing violent and pornographic images.‘The terrible recent story of the teenage girl raped by boys who had become addicted to internet porn only underpins how important these changes are.’ Children's Czar Claire Perry said that the move was vital to prevent children from stumbling across adult material when using wireless internet networks . Last month the Prime Minister hinted that action was on the cards when he said: ‘We are promoting good, clean, WiFi in local cafes and elsewhere to make sure that people have confidence in public WiFi systems so that they are not going to see things they shouldn’t.’ The web companies agreed to raise their game at the latest meeting of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which brings together children’s charities with ministers and the online industry. However, no timetable has yet been set but it is hoped the blocks will be in place by the end of the year. The six firms are O2, Sky, BT, Virgin, Arqiva and Nomad. And minutes of the meeting, held last month, reveal that BT is dragging its heels over the changes. Anne Heal, the representative from BT Openreach, said: ‘There is considerable nervousness that filtering content could be regarded as intercepting data, and which could put providers in breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.’ The Act allows certain public bodiesto intercept data for national security reasons – but bans everyone else from doing so. BT’s argument is that filtering web use without the user’s express permission could be regarded as the interception of data. But children’s charities say the Act only applies to emails and other personal information, not the sites people are able to visit. One campaigner present at the meeting said: ‘People were completely astonished at BT’s timidity. But equally the fact that the government seem to be dragging their feet hardly inspires confidence.’ BT also raised the possibility of charging companies which use its public wi-fi service extra for imposing a filter. They said it would be on a cost recovery basis, and that they would not make a profit. But the campaigner said: ‘Filtering porn on wi-fi should be standard. Nobody should have to pay extra to do the right thing. ‘That’s how O2, Sky and Virgin do it. Yet there was a suggestion that BT were going to make it an optional, paid-for extra.’ A spokeswoman for BT said: ‘BT, along with other internet service providers, supports the objectives of the government and our customers for providing a family friendly internet through the deployment of filtering solutions for adult and pornographic content in the home and with our wi-fi partners. ‘We have merely sought clarification regarding the potential legality of a particular approach to intercepting content in order to ensure that our customers, employees and shareholders are not put at risk.’","Children's czar Claire Perry said that the move is 'vital'

"Lukas Podolski has bemoaned his lack of opportunities at Arsenal as a transfer in the winter looks increasingly likely. Speaking after Germany's 4-0 win over Gibraltar on Friday night, the striker criticised Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger for not giving him that chance at the Barclays Premier League club.

"League One leaders Bristol City were finally beaten at the 17th time of asking on Saturday as Swindon Town closed the gap with a 1-0 victory in the West Country derby. Away fans let off flares at the County Ground but it was unable to put Swindon off as they moved just four points behind City into second thanks to Michael Smith's cracking strike. The visitors had been reduced to 10 men after just two minutes - with Wade Elliott being sent off for an incident involving Jack Stephens.

Mark Yeates' late strike ensured North End's 20-match unbeaten run came to an end at Deepdale. Joe Garner had equalised for Preston after Rory McArdle's opener but Bradford rallied late to move up to 13th. Elsewhere, Sheffield United put a difficult week behind them to win their Yorkshire derby against Doncaster Rovers. Paddy McCarthy was sent off for United in a week in which convicted rapist Ched Evans was allowed to return to train with the club but Jamie Murphy's 64th-minute goal gave them a 1-0 victory at the Keepmoat Stadium. It was also a good day for Notts County, who moved up to fourth - one place ahead of United - after a 1-0 victory over Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena.

"A huge fire at the Hilton Hotel in Southampton meant Eastleigh's game against Lincoln in the Conference was postponed on Saturday - as the players boots  were inside the hotel along with medical equipment. Nobody was hurt, but the Lincoln side had some possessions damaged in the blaze which needed 55 firefighters to try and put it out.

Lincoln City posted the above picture on their Twitter page as a fire broke out at their team hotel . The players had to wait in the car park before their conference game with Eastleigh was eventually called off .

"Britons are increasingly relying on antidepressants – with the number of prescriptions soaring by a quarter in just three years. NHS figures reveal that 53million were issued last year – a record high – compared with just 42.8million in 2010, and 20.1million in 1999. Some psychiatrists say that people suffering what used to be a bout of the everyday blues are now being diagnosed with a medical condition and prescribed treatment. Soaring: NHS figures reveal a sharp increase in the number of antidepressants, such as Prozac, being handed out in Britain . There is also concern that GPs are handing out pills such as Prozac and Seroxat too freely when they should be referring patients for counselling or other therapies. Doctors say they have no choice but to prescribe medication because the waiting times for talking therapies are so long and patients are reluctant to leave without treatment. But some experts say there is little evidence that the pills even work and they can cause debilitating side effects such as agitation, tiredness and suicidal thoughts. Dr Joanna Moncrieff, an author on mental health drugs and consultant psychiatrist at North East London NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Being depressed from time to time is a universal human experience. ‘Diagnosing people with a medical disorder and prescribing a pill may appear to offer an easy answer, but it stores up more problems than it solves. As a society, our dependence on antidepressants makes us less resilient and less resourceful in the face of the everyday challenges of modern living. In my clinical experience, many people just carry on taking their antidepressant because they are too fearful to stop, and research in general practice confirms that people are taking these drugs for longer and longer periods.’ Dangers: experts have spoken out about how people using the pills can become too afraid to stop, even when they do not need them any more . Labour MP Jim Dobbin, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on involuntary tranquilliser addiction, said there were ‘serious problems’ with addiction to antidepressants. ‘We need closer regulation of this,’ he said. ‘The pharmaceutical industry is very powerful and puts  too much pressure on the medical profession to prescribe them.’ A report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre last year showed that in some parts of the UK as many as one in six adults is on antidepressants. One such area is the South Wales borough of Blaenau Gwent, where the NHS issues almost 10,000 prescriptions for different types of ‘happy pills’ each month. It is one of the most economically depressed areas of the UK and local GP Greg Graham has spoken of the problems that lead to the heavy use of medication. ‘There remains a lot of low morale, issues of poor health and lack of opportunities,’ he said. A charity has set up a drop-in centre in one of the towns, Brynmawr, for people on antidepressants to receive counselling or just have a cup of tea. It is said to be used by a ‘significant number’ of people in their early 20s. Separate data from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development shows that the UK has the seventh highest prescribing rate for antidepressants in the Western world. There are 71 daily doses for every 1,000 people, compared with 38 daily doses per 1,000 people a decade ago. In France and Germany the figure is 50 doses a day, while in Italy it is 42 doses a day. Sophie Corlett, from the mental health charity Mind, said: ‘The number of prescriptions for antidepressants issued in the UK has been rising for many years. These new figures show no sign of this trend slowing and we need to know why we are seeing persistent increases. ‘We know that people are more aware of other treatment options and many do not want to be treated with drugs but cannot, and should not have to, wait months for therapy.’","NHS figures show that 53million antidepressants were issued last year .

"Veteran TV anchor and financial reporter Maria Bartiromo ended her 20-year tenure at CNBC on an emotional note today, breaking down in tears on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Bartiromo's departure comes just days after she announced that she will be making a move to Fox Business Network. Scroll down for video . Final farewell: A tearful CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo is overwhelmed as traders applaud her as she arrives on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for her last day at the network . Special honor: The 'clap-off' tradition is usually reserved for departing traders, but the stock exchange employees made an exception to honor the veteran anchor who is leaving after 20 years with CNBC . ‘I won’t give you a long and mushy goodbye especially since I’ve been getting choked up all day,’ Bartiromo said at the end of ‘Closing Bell.’ ‘But I still must extend my love and thank you to many, as this is my last broadcast on CNBC.’ The photogenic 46-year-old TV presenter, affectionately nicknamed 'Money Honey,' joined CNBC in 1993, becoming the first journalist to report from the floor of the stock exchange. On Friday, an emotional Miss Bartiromo detailed how the stock traders greeted her with applause this morning as part of a clap-off ritual – a tradition usually reserved for departing brokers. ‘The guys on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange really have been my family for so many years,’ Bartiromo said. ‘I just love all of you.’ New beginning: Bartiromo's contract with CNBC expires November 24, after which she will move to Fox Business Network . On Bartiromo's last day with CNBC, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high, reaching 16,064.7.

"Barometer readings at Twickenham are destined to soar off the scale today, as England attempt to cope with stifling, intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous South African juggernaut. National coach Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their QBE autumn Test series. Saturday’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss. A fifth successive defeat would leave England in freefall, just when they need to be building towards next year’s World Cup. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . England gather in a huddle as Stuart Lanacaster (right) watches on at Twickenham on Friday . Owen Farrell (centre) runs with the ball during the England captain's run ahead of the South Africa match . England players sprint during training at Twickenham Stadium ahead of Saturday's international . England head coach Lancaster takes a seat as he watch the captain's run on Friday . Harsh it may be — given the calibre of the opposition during that period — but the worst losing run since 2006 would not convey the message that the tournament hosts are shaping up to mount a convincing challenge for the global prize. There has long been a tangible sense of progress and upward mobility, but this regime needs further endorsement in the shape of another landmark result. The management have been emphatically backed by their RFU employers, with contract extensions through to 2020, but they all know that judgment will be passed on the strength of what happens in the next 11 months. Lancaster spoke this week of the pressure faced by the coaches, with every decision increasingly dissected and scrutinised. It is not just those four men who have to carry the burden, far from it, especially this week. In light of the allegations of homophobic abuse aimed at referee Nigel Owens last Saturday, there will be pressure on the sell-out crowd to be vocal but respectful. And, following criticism by All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, there will be pressure on the hidden figures who edit footage for the stadium’s big screen, to avoid any home bias with their use of replays. Away from south west London, there will be pressure on officials from the IRB and Samoan Rugby Union to confirm an agreement with their players to avert the threat of strike action disrupting next weekend’s Twickenham Test. And Saturday’s contest will bring intense pressure on the Springboks too, after losing to Ireland. Their proud heritage does not permit the luxury of repeated failure, even with experimental team selections. But the pressure will sit most heavily on England’s players — those men left standing amid an injury crisis, who must earn the victory demanded to put the Sweet Chariot back on a positive course. There are certain members of the Red Rose line-up particularly in need of an upturn in fortunes. After naming his team for Saturday, Lancaster conceded that England’s kicking game must improve after the problems in that area last week. Bryan Habana (centre) passes the ball during the South Africa Springboks captain's run on Friday . Victor Matfield (centre) passes the ball as the Springboks prepare to face England at Twickenham . Tendai Mtawarira stretches on the Twickenham pitch during the Springboks' training session . The South Africa Springboks gather for a team photograph ahead of Saturday's autumn international . So the onus is on Owen Farrell to rediscover the authority in his game after an injury-disrupted start to the season, while Danny Care must share the load and sharpen his execution in his 50th England match. There will be a different type of pressure on the pack as a unit. They must maintain the superb set-piece standards of last week — especially in their line-out work — as they will be tested to the limit by the wily Springbok forwards. But in their breakdown work and ball- carrying, England must be several levels better, or they will be eclipsed and beaten. Lancaster has made it plain that two of his back- rowers are playing for their places. Tom Wood has been a stalwart and influential presence in this regime, but the blindside flanker has been told to ‘step up’ or face the threat of being replaced by James Haskell, the in-form Wasps captain. Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola has also been given a warning that his starting status is in danger. Lancaster used both carrot and stick to make his point and the 22-year-old has expressed his determination to be more forceful. Reflecting on his low-key contribution against the All Blacks, Vunipola said: ‘I felt that I didn’t impact the game as I would have wanted. I didn’t enforce my normal game. I felt I was quiet and I have definitely got to improve on that. I’ve just got to impose myself like I do at the club, and be who I am rather than tiptoeing round everything.’ Danny Care kicks the ball upfield during England's training session on Friday . Billy Vunipola looks on during an England media session at Pennyhill Park earlier in the week . Having been brought up by his Tongan family with an emphasis on respect and religion, Vunipola admitted he has to make character changes in order to improve as a player, adding: ‘It is tough because it is not in our culture to say, “Look, Mom, I am doing this”. You don’t impose yourself. You wait until you are spoken to as a kid. ‘I’m not still a kid, but sometimes I have got too much respect for older guys in the team. I said that to Stuart. I’ve just got to get on with it and impose myself better and be like, “Give me the ball. I’ll do my best with it”. It is a lot to do with growing up fast. Hopefully, I will be better on Saturday. It is fair enough that people tell me I should be better. It is international rugby. I know I’ve got to be better.’ Vunipola is not alone in knowing that standards must be raised and maintained. Care said: ‘Like Stuart said, we need an extra 10 per cent from everyone — maybe 20 per cent.’ Each home player will hope to deliver that personal improvement, in the knowledge that next week’s clash with Samoa will serve as a time for experimentation, which may leave them vulnerable in the longer term. And as a team, England must end an unacceptably long run of submission to South Africa — 11 matches without a win — as the only way to lower the soaring barometer readings.","England take on South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Four men have been detained by police as part of an investigation into the takeover of Glasgow Rangers Football Club in 2011. Gary Withey, David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse were held during early morning raids at a number of addresses across the UK.

Mr Withey worked for law firm Collyer Bristow, which represented Craig Whyte before he bought Rangers from Sir David Murray for £1 in 2011. The men were held in an operation which involved officers from Surrey Police, Cheshire Police and Thames Valley Police. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Following a Police Scotland operation on Friday November 14, four men have been detained as a result of the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers Football Club.' Rangers manager Ally McCoist said: 'Obviously I can't or wouldn't comment on a current police matter, but I would have to say I'm shocked. 'Obviously I can't pre-judge what is going to happen.

In May 2011, Mr Murray, apparently under pressure from his bankers to recoup a club overdraft of about £18million amid huge debts in his own business empire, sold Rangers. Mr Whyte bought an 85 per cent shareholding in the club £1 from the Murray Group and made several pledges in terms of future investment and paying off the club's bank debt. At the time, a large tax liability regarding the club's payments through an Employee Benefit Trust - which were later outlawed - was also in dispute. Rangers went into administration in February 2012 - less than a year after Mr Whyte took charge. Immediately after being appointed, administrators Duff & Phelps, where three of the men detained today worked, announced the club had failed to pay about £9million in PAYE and VAT since the takeover. They soon revealed that the club had paid off the debt with Lloyds Banking Group from a £24.4m capital injection from investment firm Ticketus, which was secured on the back of future season ticket sales. In June 2012, Charles Green's consortium, Sevco Scotland, bought the club's assets and business from Mr Whyte in a deal worth £5.5million. That same month a criminal investigation was launched into Craig Whyte's takeover of Rangers and the subsequent financial management of the club. It followed a preliminary examination of information passed to police by administrators. It was confirmed last year that Mr Whyte has lost a £17.7m court case with Ticketus and he has been ordered pay back the money to the ticket agency following a hearing at the High Court in London. Marty Dauer, Media Spokesperson for Duff & Phelps said: 'Duff & Phelps has become aware that three employees in the United Kingdom have been detained for questioning in connection with work performed for Rangers Football Club. 'This work was commenced while these employees were part of MCR Partners, prior to its acquisition by Duff & Phelps in October of 2011. 'Duff & Phelps has performed an internal investigation and commissioned an independent investigation of the related matters. As a result, we believe that our work for Rangers was conscientious, thorough, and properly performed in every respect.' 'The liquidator’s amended pleadings in English High Court proceedings commenced on April 8, 2011 validate the conclusions of our internal investigation and the independent investigation we commissioned. 'In addition, our assignments in this matter were comprehensively examined by the Insolvency Practitioners Association  in 2013. The IPA’s review cleared the firm of any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, affirming the position of the firm.' He added that the company has cooperated with investigating authorities and has provided reports on its role in the administration of Rangers. 2000 - Rangers begin making payments through an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT), which was set up by major shareholder Murray International Holdings (MIH). 2006 - The club's annual report reveals a £9.2million 'contribution to employee trusts', the high point of the payments. The sum was included in staff costs of £28million. April 2010 - Rangers confirm they are under investigation by HMRC over offshore payments to players from 2001. Rangers say they will 'robustly' defend the case. December 2010 - EBTs are outlawed under new legislation. May 2011 - Craig Whyte bought Rangers from Sir Daivd Murray for £1 and made a commitment to settle its £18million debt with Lloyds Bank. The tax liability was still in dispute. January 2012 - A three-day first tier tax tribunal closes in Edinburgh, following earlier hearings to determine whether Rangers are guilty of tax evasion. February 2012 - The Glasgow club entered administration over a non-payment of tax totalling roughly £14million. It emerges during the administration process that Mr Whyte paid off the Lloyds Bank debt by pledging future season ticket sales to finance company Ticketus for £25million. March 2012 - The Scottish Football Association (SFA) confirms it will investigate claims made by former Rangers director Hugh Adam that payments made to players were not disclosed to the governing body. Three days later, the Scottish Premier League (SPL) confirms that its board has instigated an investigation into the alleged non-disclosure of payments made to players by Rangers, which prompts the SFA to drop its case. May 2012 - A BBC documentary team claims 63 Rangers players and 24 staff members received EBT payments and says 53 of them were provided with 'side letters' detailing the structure of payments. The following week, Duff and Phelps, the firm hired as Rangers' administrators, provide files requested by the SPL in their investigation into undisclosed payments. June 2012 - A criminal inquiry is launched into Mr Whyte’s takeover when the Crown Office asked Strathclyde Police, now part of national force Police Scotland, to investigate the purchase and the club’s subsequent financial management. Rangers enter liquidation after HMRC rejects a Company Voluntary Arrangement proposal. Charles Green's Sevco Scotland company buys the club's assets and business in a deal worth £5.5million and begins the process of relaunching the club as a new company. July 2012 - Mr Green accepted a vote that placed his new club in Division Three. August 2012 - The SPL appoints an independent commission to probe the contentious payments. Sir David Murray denies cheating took place during his stewardship. November 2012 - Oldco Rangers win their first-tier tax tribunal appeal in principle against HMRC's demands over EBT payments. January 2013 - The SPL commission begins hearing evidence. February 2013 - Oldco Rangers are handed a fine of £250,000 for breaching rules over disclosing payments but the club avoid being stripped of titles after the commission finds they obtained no sporting advantage. April 2013 - Mr Whyte was ordered to pay £18m to Ticketus after he lost a claim against him at the High Court in London. July 2014 - HMRC's appeal to the upper-tier tribunal is largely dismissed. September 2014 - Mr Whyte was banned from being a company director for a maximum of 15 years. November 2014 - Four men arrested by police in connection to the alleged fraudulent takeover of the club.

"He spent the past seven years carefully constructing a floating eco-paradise - complete with a hot tub and Internet connection - out of 150,000 recycled bottles. But Richart Sowa, 61, started to feel the only thing missing from his idyllic life on Joyxee Island near Cancun, Mexico, was someone to share it with. The artist, originally from Middleborough, Yorkshire, met former model Jodi Bowlin, 47, from Tennessee, on Facebook last year and invited her to come and live with him on the Island. Scroll down for video . Artist Richart Sowa spent seven years creating Joyxee Island (pictured) near Cancun, Mexico, but wanted someone to share it with . Mr Sowa (left) met former model Jodi Bowlin (right) on Facebook last year and invited her to come and live with him on the Island . 'Living on my own floating island has been my dream for over two-decades,' said Mr Sowa, who has been married twice and has four children and six grandchildren. 'I've always wanted to share my life's work with a soul-mate. But I've avoided any relationship with anyone which I thought wouldn't be the real thing. 'I always loved my island lifestyle and enjoy each chance to show the beauty of the place with anyone I can. 'However, it's not the same as having that one special person in my life to share my island sanctuary with.' The floating island boasts a three storey house with kitchen, running water, electricity and Internet connection . Mr Sowa said living on a floating island has always been his dream and he wanted to share it with a soul mate . Despite being 30-yards from the shore and having a base made from air-filled plastic bottles, wood pallets and sand, Mr Sowa insists his island has all the mod-cons a lady could want. The three-storey house on the island boasts, two bedrooms, a hot tub, three shell showers, a kitchen and working Internet. It is surrounded by palm trees, mangroves, fruit trees and edible herbs and plants, which all grow from the sand and soil of the hand-made island. Jodi Bowlin was a successful model in Japan and she graced the covers of several magazines . A 100ft-long umbilical cord connects the island to the shore and provides solar generated electricity, water and internet. 'My plan is to become self-sufficient, I am a vegetarian and have many plants growing on the Island which I eat, but for more variety I go by bicycle to the nearby local shop,' said Mr Sowa. 'I have a ferry I also made from plastic bottles which can carry up to eight people to and from the shore. After her first visit to the Island, Ms Bowlin decided she wanted to make a life there -  as long as she could apply her woman's touch. 'I've been able to motivate Richart to fix the place up,' said the former model. 'The toilet works perfectly now and solar panels now provide electricity. 'He is a great carpenter so we were able to work together to ensure the structure is sound and the house is as solid as a rock. 'But the island itself gently rocks on the water, so sleeping there is like being held in your lover's arms. 'Now, we can enjoy waking up with the morning sun and enjoying a morning fruit smoothie for breakfast and fresh coffee. 'I have always been interested in architecture made from reclaimed materials and I have a love of Mexico. 'So when we met I was thinking to myself – wow, here's a man who is already living my dream life and we have so much in common.' 'I think most people would think living on a floating island is pretty strange, but I guess I have more of a liberal view on life.' Ms Bowlin was one of Japan's most well-known models and from the age of 16 to 22, she was featured on the covers of glossy fashion magazines. The contrast between her life of glamour in Japan and the physical labour involved in the upkeep of the island was a sharp reality check for the former model . Ms Bowlin (right) enjoys drinks with her fashion industry friends in Japan in the 1980s . When she first agreed to visit the ecologist on his private Mexican island, she imagined a relaxed life basking in his love nest in the tropical sunshine. But the contrast between her life of glamour in Japan and the physical labour involved in the upkeep of the island was a sharp reality check. 'My first impression of the island was that it was an upgrade from camping – luckily, I've always liked that Swiss Family Robinson experience,' she said. 'Living on the island looks like a carefree lifestyle, but there is a lot of physical labour involved in keeping it up especially in the early years before the mangrove roots weave through the base and strengthen everything. Joyxee Island is Mr Sowa's third bottle paradise, the previous two were in unprotected waters and destroyed by hurricanes . Mr Sowa, who now makes a living through music and art, has been married twice before and has four children and six grandchildren . 'A few days after I arrived, some things began to give way. It didn't feel very stable and I was worried that the house was going to fall through the island and sink. 'There were also some mosquitoes cockroaches and even a scorpion in the house because there were some areas which had not yet been finished off and properly sealed.' Joyxee Island is Mr Sowa's third bottle paradise, the previous two were in unprotected waters and destroyed by hurricanes. Undeterred by these disasters, instead of giving up his dream of living on a floating island, he rebuilt his third Island beginning with ten bags of bottles he retrieved from his second attempt which was called Spiral Island. He now makes a living from his music and art and showing visitors around his private island in exchange for voluntary donations. Despite being 30-yards from the shore and having a base made from air-filled plastic bottles, wood pallets and sand, Mr Sowa insists his island has all the mod-cons a lady could want .","Richart Sowa, 61, spent seven years building a free-floating eco-paradise .

"A frightened dog has spent 14 hours stuck in the engine of a car – so well hidden that a mechanic working on the car's motor did not notice the confused pooch was there. Spoodle Ollie was spooked by a Melbourne storm in the early hours of Monday morning when he ran away from home, seeking refuge in a dry, warm place. Later that morning, Berwick resident Therese James's car inexplicably refused to start, but she was relieved when RACV mechanics were able to fix the problem without incident. Before Ms James could drive away, she received a call which saved her neighbour's beloved pup's life. Ollie the spoodle, photographed while trapped inside the car motor on Monday. He crawled up into the car because he was spooked by a Melbourne storm in the early hours of the day . When the car owner couldn't start her car, she called a mechanic. The mechanic fixed the car without noticing that Ollie was in the car motor and he wasn't located until hours later that day . Poor Ollie buries his head in his owner Caroline O'Reilly's neck, relieved to be free after his 14-hour ordeal . Ms James was completely unaware that the missing pooch was entangled in her car's engine bay. 'Luckily my boss told me to work from home because I would've driven to work and who knows what could've happened,' Ms James told the Berwick Leader. Unbelievably, Ollie had managed to crawl up through the engine mount into the car's engine but quickly became very stuck. The four-year-old pup was located 13 hours later, when his frantic owner Caroline O'Reilly called out his name – and heard Ollie's cries coming from her neighbour's Mitsubishi Lancer. 'As I knocked and called out ... he heard me and started to cry,' Ms O'Reilly told the Berwick Ledaer. 'I looked under the car and noticed his tail hanging out when I looked under the car — he was shaking and we tried for at least an hour before RACV came out to dismantle a couple of pieces.' Narre Warren CFA First Lieutenant Travis Carter was one of seven fire fighters who released Ollie from the car . The ladies called Narre Warren CFA after trying to remove Ollie from the engine compartment for an hour. Ms O'Reilly said she had feared for Ollie's life. 'It could have been a different outcome,' she told Berwick News. 'I did start to panic a little bit, I thought he'd stopped breathing, but all was good. 'I was very relieved.' Seven firefighters were required to remove Ollie, as well as several car parts, in 35 minutes. They 'didn't have high hopes' when they were working to extract the dog. The sweet spoodle initially 'didn't look very well' due to the stress of his ordeal, but it only took a couple of cuddles and some well-deserved TLC to return Ollie to cheery self. 'When we got him out his tail was wagging, and the owner held him and he looked like a happy dog,' Narre Warren CFA First Lieutenant Travis Carter told Berrick News. 'We've had a few animal call-outs, but the engine compartment is a first for me.' Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Ms James' vehicle, with Ollie creating around $7000 worth of damage to the wiring alone, when he tried to chew his way out. 'As I knocked and called out ... he heard me and started to cry,' Ms O'Reilly said. 'I looked under the car and noticed his tail hanging out when I looked under the car — he was shaking and we tried for at least an hour before RACV came out to dismantle a couple of pieces,' said Ms O'Reilly. It's likely Ollie now is far more terrified of cars than he ever was of thunderstorms. It's likely Ollie now is far more terrified of cars than he ever was of thunderstorms.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits he failed to land all of his transfer targets in the summer window and says the club will reinvest in the squad again in January. Wenger made five additions to his squad during the last transfer window as the FA Cup holders looked to strengthen. Alexis Sanchez's £30million arrival from Barcelona was the standout signing by Wenger, but the Frenchman has admitted he felt his business was uncompleted - something he will look to rectify in the next window. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the club will spend again in January to sign another player . 'We won the FA Cup with a difficult run, but we managed to deliver the trophy and it makes us stronger, more confident and I believe we will have a strong season,' Wenger told shareholders and a selection of fans at the club's Annual General Meeting. 'We bought good players, I believe we've done remarkably well in the transfer market. We wanted one more player, but couldn't. We will try to rectify that in January. 'We have a good core of young British players, who feel the value of our club. Slowly the modern game has lost that. 'So we need your support again. I encourage you to be behind us. You are magnificent. And I'm sure we will come out this season more united and stronger.' Alexis Sanchez (left) and Danny Welbeck both joined Arsenal in the summer transfer window . The Gunners currently sit eighth in the Premier League - nine points adrift of league leaders Chelsea after seven games of the season. Arsenal lost 2-0 to the Blues in their last Premier League match and Wenger has urged fans to be patient despite their sluggish beginning to the campaign. The 64-year-old cites the poor start the club made last season before they went onto to lift silverware. Diego Costa scored Chelsea's second in their 2-0 Premier League win against Arsenal in October . ‘This is always an important part of my season, I know you are ambitious, critical and sceptical, but you are very loyal. And I'm very grateful to see the same faces because we love this club. I know I don't always please you like I love to, but we give it all to make you happy,' Wenger added. 'Let’s remember last season, we started with a home defeat and I felt a little tsunami around the club. There was pressure for us to sign players and scepticism. We showed we were united, together and ready to work hard. 'What has changed compared with a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices. We signed (Mesut) Ozil which gave us comfort. We made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that. 'It was extremely paradoxical. When we lost, we lost [heavily]. We lost five or six. If you concede the first goal in a big game 85 per cent of the time you will lose the game.' Wenger ended the club's nine-season wait for a trophy with a 3-2 FA Cup final victory against Hull in May . Arsenal's 3-2 FA Cup win against Hull in May  ended their nine-season wait for a trophy and majority shareholder Stan Kroenke believes the Wembley victory shows that the club are going in the right direction under Wenger - who recently celebrated 18 years in charge of the club. 'We are proud of what we've accomplished,' Kroenke said. 'What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.'","Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is planning to splash the cash in January .

"The recreation of one of the most famous moments from the First World War by Sainsbury's in its 2014 Christmas advert was branded both 'cynical' and 'wonderful' today. Britain's third biggest supermarket said the commercial is a 'creative interpretation' of Christmas Day 1914 when British and German soldiers laid down their weapons and met in no man's land. Sainsbury's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket's 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign. While some called it moving and brilliant others were saying it was an 'exploitative' way for a big business to advertise itself. The founders of clothing company Holroyd and Pickles tweeted: 'How do you think my great great grandfather would feel knowing his bravery had been reduced to advertising Sainsbury's?' Juliette AdAstra added her concerns, saying: 'If there's anything more tasteless and cynical than the Sainsbury's Christmas advert, I've yet to see it'. But Lydia Hamilton tweeted: 'The Sainsbury's Christmas advert is amazing, 10 times better than John Lewis' and Sam Carvalho wrote: 'Just saw the Sainsbury’s Christmas advert. That is definitely the best advert so far'. Magic moment: A British and a German soldier meet in No Man's Land on Christmas Day in the new Sainsbury's advert unveiled last night . Main characters: With fears soldiers may shoot them, the two men risk their lives to climb out of the trenches and meet each other . Special: The story of the German and British soldiers enjoying a game of football during the First World War has been spoken about ever since . The ad follows a British soldier as he hears enemy troops singing Silent Night in German and ventures into 'no man's land' before soldiers from both sides join him and shake hands. He shares a moment of friendship with a young German soldier and, as the truce ends and they return to their trenches, the German is moved to discover that his British friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket - linked the supermarket's message of 'sharing' at Christmas. Shoppers can help to raise extra money for the Royal British Legion after Armistice Day this year by buying the chocolate bar featured in the advert from Sainsbury's stores, with the profits going to charity. The advert is Sainsbury's attempt to take on the might of John Lewis, which has dominated the multi-million pound battle to win over Christmas shoppers. John Lewis has this year concentrated on the heart-warming friendship between a little boy and a penguin and its rivals are spending millions of pounds trying to outdo. Despite costing £95 the stuffed toy versions of the penguins in the advert sold out within hours online - but on Twitter today some said that the new Sainsbury's advert is as good, if not better. Ally Hunter Blair said: 'Sorry to the Penguin but @sainsburys have knocked the socks off the Christmas Advert competition!' Beginning: The four minute advert feels more like a short film as a camera sweeps over the trenches on Christmas night . Scene: The advert starts with soldiers singing Silent Night in their respective languages as snow falls on the trenches . Drama: The young Briton is deep in thought and then, to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades, decided to climb above ground . Spark: The men shaking hands leads to other troops also climbing out of the trenches to meet their foes . Greeting: The soldiers shake hands and even hug in the heartwarming advert released today and shown for the first time last night . Downing weapons: German and British officers stand shoulder to shoulder in the brief moment of peace before they returned to fighting . Friends: The men try to communicate in their different languages and the Brit shows his German counterpart a picture of his love at home . Gift: The German is moved to discover that his British friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket . Message: Sainsbury's is using a similar sentiment used by John Lewis that Christmas is about sharing and giving . With less than seven weeks to go most of the UK’s consumer giants have already launched their annual festive advertising campaigns. And by now, we know what that means. Between today and December 25, television viewers will be subjected to a barrage of elaborate feel-good adverts. Marks & Spencer shunned their previous formula of using celebrities, replacing them pair of do-gooding magic fairies. Waitrose' advert is about a shy girl baking gingerbread and an exhausted nurse coming home after finishing her Christmas shift is what Boots has concentrated on. The Sainsbury's tribute advert follows the exhibition of thousands of ceramic poppies in the moat of the Tower of London to commemorate 100 years since the start of the Great War, which has drawn millions of visitors. Charles Byrne, director of fundraising for the Royal British Legion, said: 'We're very proud of our 20-year partnership with Sainsbury's and this campaign is particularly important. 'One hundred years on from the 1914 Christmas truce, the campaign remembers the fallen, while helping to raise vital funds to support the future of living.' Mark Given, head of brand communications at Sainsbury's, said: 'This year, we wanted to reflect that theme of sharing in our Christmas campaign through the lens of one of the most extraordinary moments of sharing in modern history when, on Christmas Day 1914, British and German soldiers laid down their arms, and came together on neutral territory to share stories, mementoes and even a game of football. “The Christmas truce is an especially poignant story from First World War that has been recreated on a number of occasions and we know it resonates with many of our customers and colleagues. We’ve partnered with The Royal British Legion to ensure we tell this story with authenticity and respect and we hope it will help keep alive the memory of the fallen that made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country. 'It is also a way for us to mark the 20th anniversary of our partnership with The Royal British Legion and to help us raise additional funds for them.' The letter of a British soldier to his family corroborate claims enemy forces enjoyed a game of football on Christmas Day, a historian who advised Sainsbury's on its controversial advert has claimed. Taff Gillingham said he was 'sceptical' about helping the supermarket reconstruct scenes from the trenches for its festive commercial, fearing there was not enough evidence to prove soldiers laid down their weapons to wish each other a happy Christmas 100 years ago. His mind was changed however by a 1915 newspaper article which quoted letters from a British soldier to his family, describing the moment each side 'finished up kicking a football between the firing lines'. 'At first I was very sceptical about it. Football has hijacked the truce over the past few years,' Mr Gillingham said. 'There is a danger that all of the true history is going to be lost because people think it was nothing more than a big game of football.' The historian had previously come across an account by Sergeant Frank Naden of the 6th Cheshires describing a game of football against German soldiers in Wulverghem, Belgium, but had never found anything to support his version of events. But an article from the Lynn Advertiser in January 1915 revealed a letter, written by Corporal A. Wyatt, of the 1st Norfolks, who fought alongside the Cheshires, in which the very same account is given. In his letter home, the soldier wrote: 'We finished up in the same old way, kicking a football between the two firing lines. So football in the firing line between the British and the Germans is the truth, as I was one that played.' The letter, said Mr Gillingham, was enough to convince him of the story portrayed in the emotive advert. 'In all the years that I have been doing stuff about the truce I have never come across this account by Corporal Wyatt. 'There are several accounts of people who claim to have played football but a lot of them don't stack up. Just by complete fluke it just happened to arrive just at the right moment so we could actually corroborate it. 'So we could say, hand on heart, there was actually a game that the Norfolks and Cheshires played in. 'I was really chuffed with it because it is something I had looked for for years.' 'I knew quite a lot of First World War veterans and they would have been more than happy with it.' Look familiar? Paul McCartney fans say Sainsbury's Christmas ad is a rip-off of his 1983 pop video . Paul McCartney fans said today the new Sainsbury's Christmas advert enjoys a remarkable resemblance to a major pop video from 1983. The former Beatle spent two weeks at number one with anti-war song Pipes of Peace, and in the video he recreated the famous Christmas Day truce in 1914. In the video McCartney played the parts of a British soldier, and his German counterpart, who shake hands in no man's land, play a game of football and exchange gifts - the same sequence seen in the new Sainsbury's advert. Jonny Morris tweeted: 'Well done, Sainsbury's. You've made the video for Pipes of Peace without Pipes of Peace'. Nik Wood-Jones wrote: 'Nice try @sainsburys but for a more realistic imagining of the 1914 #Christmas Truce, I prefer #Macca Pipes of Peace!' and Rachel Borland said: 'Love the sainsburys ad but macca did it first!' MailOnline has compared images from the two films so you can decide for yourself, with the McCartney video at the top and the Sainsbury's advert at the bottom of each frame. Beginning: Both films, Pipes of Peace above, and the Sainsbury's advert below, both set out that they are set at Christmas in 1914 . Deep in thought: Paul McCartney takes a moment to look a picture of a loved one while the actor in the 2014 version looks at a box of his possessions . Powerful: Both films show the moment two young soldiers meet in no man's land and shake hands with each other . Warm: Marking the moment their conflict was set aside for Christmas was also shown in the two videos of the same event . Famous: The game of football between the two sides remains one of the most memorable moments of the 1914 story . Similar: The two videos both show the soldiers comparing pictures of their sweethearts back home . Symbolic: Both videos also showed the exchange of chocolate, which Sainsbury's believe sums up the spirit of Christmas .","Advert shows famous meeting of First World War soldiers in no man's land on Christmas Day in 1914 .

"Google has today finally released its maps app for the iPhone 5, a move certain to be welcomed by users frustrated with the widely criticised mistakes in Apple's own version. The iPhone's default maps app was previously powered by Google until Apple took over with its own software in early September and blocked users from using Google's app. But the gadget maker was bombarded with complaints for its app's errors and forced into a humiliating apology to customers that led to the sacking of the man in charge of its development. The app was even blasted by Australian police as 'potentially life threatening' after it sent users off course in the outback. Scroll down for video . On the app store: Google has finally released a version of its Maps app for the iPhone 5, after Apple's own equivalent was roundly criticised for its errors . The new Google Maps app will include public transport directions and traffic information, for which they are famous, as well as rotating 2D and 3D views and street view, according to a Google blog post. It will be available for the iPhone and iPod Touch (4G) iOS 5.1 and higher, and will work in more than 40 countries and 29 languages. Daniel Graf, director of Google Maps for Mobile, wrote on the company's official blog: 'The app shows more map on screen and turns mobile mapping into one intuitive experience. The overwhelming feeling on opening Google Maps for the first time is relief - it suddenly feels as if a part of your iPhone has been given back. Gone is the nagging doubt and foreboding that, for the navigationally challenged like myself, things would not end well every time you typed a place into Apple's maps app. Instead, Google's superb service is back - and better than ever. The app has been completely redesigned, and is slicker and more straightforward than before. There are some massive improvements, notably around directions, which are fast and simple to use - and unlike Apple's version, include public transport. There's also access to Street View, which give Google a massive advantage. In some areas, Apple does have the edge - its 3D maps, for example, are stunning, and the maps themselves look cleaner and sharper. However, in terms of day to day use, there is absolutely no question that Google wins, and by a huge margin, simply for having a vastly more developed database of places, and fewer of the embarrassing errors that have plagued Apple's service. Apple maps can't (quite) be written off, and it has improved dramatically since its launch - and will no doubt continue to do so. In a few years, it may become a true competitor to Google's product. But for the foreseeable, it's good to have Google (and my virtual sense of direction) back. 'It is designed from the ground up to combine the comprehensiveness and accuracy of Google Maps with an interface that makes finding what you're looking for faster and easier.' Lost: In one particularly bad error, Australian police warned Apple Maps could kill after it directed users looking for a city to this barren stretch of outback . On Monday police in Australia warned drivers with iPhones not to navigate with Apple Maps after users looking for one city found themselves in barren outback more than 40 miles away. Motorists following the much-criticised mapping service to the city of Mildura in the country's south-east ended up in the middle of the nearby Murray-Sunset National Park. With no nearby water supplies and temperatures in the park reaching as high as 46C, police warned the mapping error had the potential to be 'life-threatening'. Apple launched the maps service in September after dumping Google's maps in the latest version of its iPhone and iPad software. Instead, it decided to create its own, using partners such as TomTom for data, while also using helicopters and planes to create 3D maps of major cities. However, when the app was released, users discovered thousands of flaws. This led to outrage among users who flooded Twitter and Facebook with examples of Apple's flawed maps. Apple’s shares may plunge another 20 per cent as the company slides towards a ‘Death Cross’, analysts have claimed. Investors in the tech giant - the most valuable company in the world - have been ‘panic selling’ and brought the price down from its high of $705 a share in September to its current price of $547. Now there are fears that it could slump to $420 or lower amid fears Apple has run out of ideas. Analysts said that the company must avoid what is known as a ‘Death Cross’ where both long and short term prospects look grim. That will happen when a stock’s 50 day moving average goes below its 200 day moving average - a very real possibility with Apple. The California-based company has been rocked in recent weeks by reports revealing the strength of the competition from Google and Samsung. Errors noticed by users and tech reviewers included major towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon appearing to be missing, searches for Manchester United Football Club bringing up Sale United - a football club for the over-fives, and large parts of the world obscured by cloud in satellite views. The product's shoddiness prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to replace Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of Apple's mobile operating system, and Richard Williamson, the executive who had overseen the mapping team. He was even forced into issuing and humiliating apology and recommending that iPhone owners consider using Google maps through a mobile Web browser or seek other alternatives until his company could fix the problems. Google engineers started working on their new maps app before Apple's September 19 decision to evict them from iOS, Google's Mr Graf said, though he declined to be more specific. The additional tools in Google's free iPhone mapping app include turn-by-turn directions. These have long been included on Android versions of the software and Google's previous refusal to include it on the iPhone is believed to be one of the reasons Apple decided to develop its own technology. The friction that has developed between Google and Apple as they jostle for leadership in the increasingly important smartphone market also played a role in the mapping switch. Google's new iPhone mapping app also . will offer its street-level photography of local neighbourhoods for the . first time on Apple's mobile operating system, as well as . three-dimensional views, public transit directions and listings for more . than 80million businesses. The . iPhone app still lacks some of the mapping features available on . Android-powered phones, such as directions in malls and other buildings. A difficult road ahead: Apple's maps were . slammed for their poor location information and distorted images, . forcing the company into issuing an apology and fire two executives deemed responsible for the mess up . There still isn't a Google mapping app for Apple's top-selling tablet computer, the iPad, but the company plans to make one eventually. In the meantime, iPad users can access see the maps in an iPhone mode. Google's free mapping solution is likely to become one of the hottest commodities in Apple's app store, if for no other reason because of pent-up demand among iPhone owners fed up with Apple's alternative. Some iPhone owners even refused to upgrade to Apple's newest software, iOS 6, because they didn't want to lose access to the old Google mapping application built into iOS 5 and earlier versions.","Apple evicted Google from its latest generation of of devices in September .

"Anthony Trollope is one of the most celebrated novelists in the English language, a towering icon of the Victorian era who is feted by critics and adored by readers to this day. But now one of his famously lengthy works is being recast in the unlikely form of a comic book, pared down to fewer than a hundred pages of cartoon strips. The first Trollope ‘graphic novel’ is based on his relatively obscure work John Caldigate. The first Anthony Trollope 'graphic novel' is based on his relatively obscure work John Caldigate, and has been re-named Dispossession . Published in 1879, it is a story of bigamy, blackmail and betrayal set during the Australian gold rush, a very different milieu from the political and ecclesiastical intrigue of the Palliser novels and The Barchester Chronicles for which Trollope is best known. Under the new title of Dispossession, the comic book  will be published next year in time for the bicentenary celebrations of Trollope’s birth. Dispossession has the same characters and plot as the  original novel but it tells the story in a way that will surprise the writer’s legion of fans. Trollope is often to referred to as the Establishment’s favourite author, and his admirers include former Prime Minister Sir John Major, the Bishop of London Richard Chartres and Lord Fellowes, the Oscar-winning creator of Downton Abbey. Anthony Trollope is one of the most celebrated novelists in the English language, a towering icon of the Victorian era who is feted by critics to this day . Whereas Trollope’s novel ran to more than 600 pages and included no illustrations, the graphic version has just 96 pages and 576 separate images. Much of the narrative is delivered in the form of speech bubbles. It also includes 700 words of Wiradjuri, an Aboriginal language that does not feature in the original book. John Caldigate is a Victorian ne’er-do-well who graduates from Cambridge with gambling debts and begins a new life in the Australian goldfields. On the voyage he meets feisty widow Euphemia Smith, and the pair set up home in Australia. Caldigate returns to England alone after making his fortune and marries his childhood sweetheart, Hester Bolton. But his past comes back to haunt him when Euphemia turns up and accuses him of bigamy. Dr Simon Grennan, the artist and academic who has created the comic book, said he had chosen John Caldigate precisely because it wasn’t as well known as Trollope’s other novels. He said: ‘That opens up the opportunities for adaptation.’ His version includes Aboriginal and convict characters only hinted at by Trollope. Whereas Trollope's novel ran to more than 600 pages and included no illustrations, the graphic version (above) has just 96 pages, 576 separate images and much of the narrative is delivered in the form of speech bubbles . Grennan, a research fellow at the University of Chester, said: ‘Trollope set this story in New South Wales but did not make more of the miners, convicts and Aboriginals who lived there. 'I didn’t want that implausibility in Dispossession.’ Lord Fellowes welcomed the new version, which he hoped would introduce new readers to the author, saying: ‘Any road that leads to Trollope is worth taking.'","Works by novelist Anthony Trollope being recast as 'graphic' comic book .

"Former Arsenal flop Nicklas Bendtner has endured a torrid last 18 months, but the Danish striker's luck finally appears to be changing after a brace against Serbia took his recent tally to four goals in three games. After scoring twice against Krasnodar in the Europa League for Wolfsburg, the 26-year-old repeated the feat on Friday to hand Denmark a 3-1 win over Serbia. The latest success means Bendtner has now scored as many goals in his last three games as he did for Arsenal and Denmark in the whole of the 2013-14 season. Nicklas Bednter celebrates scoring for Denmark against Serbia in their 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win . The former Gunner has now scored four goals in his last three games, the same as his tally for 2013-14 . It is a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the former Gunner, who recently voiced his anger at having been made to warm the bench in north London last year. 'It was a terrible situation. My last year at Arsenal was a waste of time,' Bendtner told Tipsbladet. 'It was worthless that Arsenal did not allow me to leave. 'A club like Arsenal could easily have found someone else to play my role. They would have had no trouble finding a player who could do what they wanted me to do.' Bendtner has hit a rich vein of form for Wolfsburg and he recently scored a double against FK Krasnodar . The 26-year-old had numerous injury problems during his time at Arsenal which kept him out of the team .","Nicklas Bendtner scored twice as Denmark beat Serbia 3-1 .

"Greg Dyke controversially waded into the row over rapist footballer Ched Evans when he said it was ‘not an important issue’. Speaking on BBC’s Newsnight, Mr Dyke appeared unprepared for questions over Evans’ comeback despite being chairman of the Football Association, looking uncomfortable as he told presenter Laura Kuenssberg the issue was ‘not clear cut’. His gaffe came after Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask Sheffield United to remove her name from one of its stands if the club re-signs Evans. Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from the stand if Evans is re-signed . Dyke was speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme about convicted rapist Evans . Mrs Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if Evans is given a new contract with the League One club . Laura Kuenssberg (LK): As the leader of football in this country, should Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape, be able to play for Sheffield United again? Greg Dyke (GD): ‘I don’t want to go into that. That’s not what I’m here for. I’m quite happy to talk about this (FIFA), I don’t really want to talk about Ched Evans. ‘I think it’s far too complicated for five minutes here'. LK: But shouldn’t you be taking the lead? GD: ‘Here’s the straight forward question: Are people who go to prison entitled to come out and rebuild their lives or aren’t they? Or is what they have done so bad and they are in an industry where their image is so important and that’s the dilemma. And it’s a dilemma and it’s not clear cut. But I would rather talk about this (Fifa) if you don’t mind. LK: But it’s an important issue. GD: No it’s not an important issue. (talks over presented) It’s not an important issue. (Pause) It’s an important issue but not in terms of what we are here to talk about. LK: Do you think that people will accept that you just don’t have a view? GD: What I will talk about is when you phoned me up to ask me to come on here you asked me to talk about this (Fifa) not Ched Evans. Britain’s most high-profile sportswoman, honoured by her local team after the 2012 Olympics, said she would sever her links with the club if it hands a contract to Evans, who has been allowed to train with his former team-mates. Mr Dyke, 67, is a former BBC Director General and well-known Manchester United fan. His comments provoked immediate anger on social media sites with Twitter users calling the interview a ‘car crash’. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, tweeted: 'Just seen Greg Dyke on Newsnight. How can you not be prepared to discuss Ched Evans?' And Matthew Whitehouse, a professional coach and football writer, tweeted: ‘For a man with a history in media he really is awful when it comes to PR.’ Ennis-Hill’s withdrawal of support could now be the ‘death knell’ to any attempt by the Yorkshire club to allow Evans to relaunch his playing career. In a statement, the athlete, 28, said: ‘I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. ‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ Sheffield United is already facing a huge backlash from high-profile supporters, MPs, sponsors and rape charities. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 32, stepped down as a patron of the club on Tuesday. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Many say Evans, 25, who still protests his innocence, cannot be rehabilitated until he admits his offence. On Thursday night a source said it would be ‘inconceivable’ for the club to let him play after the comments by Ennis-Hill. They added: ‘It could be the death knell.’ Evans was released from prison after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence for raping a teenager at a hotel in 2011. Ched Evans and his fiancee, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes today near their Cheshire home .

"Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher believes Danny Welbeck's international career has been more impressive than that of Daniel Sturridge. The former Chelsea and Manchester City forward has been sorely missed by Liverpool this season, with Brendan Rodgers' side languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, but Carragher believes England are more reliant on Arsenal man Welbeck .

Sturridge has scored five goals in 16 appearances for England while Welbeck has 11 goals in 30 appearances .

'I don't want to put too much pressure on him but it looks like it is down to him because there's not too much else there at the moment.

"Novak Djokovic edged closer to the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals as the world No 1 cruised to victory against Stan Wawrinka in straight sets. Despite some early Wawrinka pressure, world No 1 Djokovic proved too strong in the end for his Swiss opponent as he won 6-3, 6-0 in 65 minutes and extended his unbeaten run indoors to 29 matches. Djokovic now goes top of Group A but he has not yet qualified for the last four with several different qualification scenarios still possible in the last set of round-robin matches. VIDEO Scroll down for Novak Djokovic: It was a really amazing performance . Novak Djokovic has edged closer to the ATP World Tour Finals semis after beating Stan Wawrinka . Djokovic defeated his Swiss opponent 6-3, 6-0 in 65 minutes at London's O2 Arena on Wednesday . The Serbian only requires one set against Tomas Berdych on Friday to guarantee his progress, although he is purely focusing on notching up another win rather than being distracted by any complicated calculations. Djokovic said: 'Nobody needs to tell me I need to win. I think I know that myself already. I try to win every match I play on. That's the kind of approach I will have on Friday.' This was the pair's first meeting since Wawrinka beat Djokovic in an epic five-set Australian Open quarter-final in January. And Wawrinka, who went on to win the title in Melbourne, showed some early promising glimpses as he broke defending champion Djokovic in the first game of the match and held for 2-0 with a stunning forehand pass.

The last time Wawrinka faced Djokovic he beat him on his way to the Australian Open title in January . However, Djokovic win 16 of the next 17 points from there to go 5-2 ahead and although Wawrinka managed to halt his opponent's momentum, Djokovic closed out the opening set on his third set point. It then took just another 24 minutes to close out the match as Djokovic turned the screw and reeled off six games on the trot, clinching victory in style with a forehand winner down the line. Djokovc said: 'I definitely didn't expect [this] but hoped that I can, again, play this way and the match result can go this way for me. However, Djokovic proved too strong for Wawrinka this time as he won the opening set in a convincing manner . Djokovic wrapped up the second set, and the match, 24 minutes later as he bageled Wawrinka 6-0 . 'After I lost the first two games, obviously I didn't start so great. I thought he played very well the first two games. But again, I wasn't frustrated. I kept my calm. 'After that, it was a really amazing performance.' Djokovic's second round-robin victory means that he can also secure the year-end world No 1 ranking if he beats Berdych.

"India is suffering a massive obesity epidemic among its middle classes, with millions of Indians now morbidly obese as a result of the Western fast food invasion. The country's economic boom means wealthy young Indians aspiring to Western lifestyles are increasingly shunning traditional cuisine and choosing to eat from American chains such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC. The Indian fast food market is already worth £7bn, and this is expected to double by 2016. BBC documentary filmmaker Anita Rani travelled to Mumbai to investigate, meeting some of India's most overweight teenagers, including Kaleb Shah, 13, who already weighs 15st and is having a gastric band fitted to prevent him overeating further.

'And they tend to be referred to as ""healthy"", meaning not underfed.' Medical professionals appear on Rani's documentary demanding the government takes a stand when it comes to selling fast food.

The companies continue to open up branches in cities and towns across the country, threatening to explode the obesity crisis into a national pandemic. And traditional street food vendors, where earlier generations fed themselves on healthier vegetarian curries and rice, are adapting; some roadside carts now sell nothing but hot dogs and burgers. Indians are increasingly turning towards Western junk food in effort to emulate affluent lifestyles, while simultaneously cutting back on physical activity . Young people consider these roadside . food options less 'trendy' than a pre-packaged McDonald's burger, and . complain that they eat typical Indian cuisine at home, so when they go . out with their friends they want to eat chips and hot dogs. Traditional street food: . Rice cakes, chutney, vegetable curry, lentils . Approx 400 calories . 10 Rupees . Western street food: . McDonald's Paneer Wrap . 800 calories . £3.50 or 335 Rupees . The . obesity crisis means also means one other type of business is booming: . plus-size clothing stores, inspired by those in America. The owner of one such store in Mumbai told Rani: 'Indians are now as fat as Americans.' With the cost of a McDonalds meal . priced at £3.50, obesity is a problem confined to the middle and upper . classes; two-thirds of Indians still live on less than £2 per day. One effect of this discrepancy is that middle class children are driven everywhere by their over-protective parents. A huge pressure on academic achievement also contributes to young people's sedentary lifestyles. One-third of children in some private schools are now obese, and all of these are likely to stay obese into adulthood. Children are shunning street vendors and opting to eat branded junk food .

"Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard faces the wrath of the Welsh management on Monday after he ‘jeopardised’ his fitness by playing against Harlequins. The 30-year-old was left out of the Wales squad to face Fiji on Saturday because of a foot injury and was wearing a protective boot when he left Cardiff on Tuesday. With Gloucester facing a front-row shortage, Hibbard was named on the bench for the Aviva Premiership fixture and came on as a late replacement in the 22-15 defeat, despite an earlier decision from the Welsh medical team that he was not fit enough to feature this weekend. Gloucester's Richard Hibbard (centre) turns his head after making a controversial late appearance . Hibbard's appearance from off the bench will leave Wales boss Warren Gatland seething . Speaking ahead of last night’s kick-off, Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde said the ex-Osprey, replaced in the Wales side by Scott Baldwin, now faces the risk of missing out on next week’s Test against New Zealand. ‘There’s a conflict,’ said McBryde. ‘He’s gone to Gloucester and ended up on the bench so something isn’t right there. You have to take responsibility for your actions, I’m sure nobody’s holding a gun to his head. ‘I understand there are injuries at the hooker position for Gloucester, but if he takes the field he jeopardises his position next week, from a fitness point of view. We will have no decision to make if we have to manage his injury again.’ However, Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys insisted his club had the blessing of the Wales management to put Hibbard on the bench. Hibbard practices a throw during the warm up at Kingsholm . He said: 'We did not have any problems with Wales. Clearly, we have no impact on Welsh selection. All I will say is that we had discussions with the Welsh management yesterday and it was agreed with the Welsh management that Richard would be sitting on the bench tonight. 'We are unaware of what changed between last night and this morning. We want Richard to be playing against New Zealand and look forward to seeing him against them. 'The starting point in all these discussions is we wouldn’t do anything that jeopardised player welfare and, as far as we were concerned, Richard was fit to play and that was agreed with the Welsh management yesterday afternoon. 'We are very surprised by this. As far as we are concerned, there was no issue. I don’t think this is something which should been made a big issue.'

"The passengers on a San Francisco light rail line were so absorbed in their phones and their tablet computers that no one noticed when a madman pulled out a handgun and waved it around several times before opening fire and killing a random commuter, police have revealed. Nikhom Thephakaysone is charged with murdering promising San Francisco State University student Justin Valdez, 20, in cold blood, without provocation on a Municipal Railway last month. Police say the CCTV footage from the rail car show that neither Valdez nor any of his fellow passengers saw it coming - even though Thephakaysone pulled out a .45-caliber pistol several times - even rubbing his nose with it in his hand once. Distracted: Police say all of the passengers aboard a San Francisco light rail car were so absorbed in their electronics that they never saw a crazed man pulled out  gun several times (stock photo) Promising: Justin Valdez was an upbeat, 20-year-old environmental activist attending San Francisco State University when police say he was randomly shot in the back of the head by a stranger he shared a train ride with . 'These weren't concealed movements - the gun is very clear,' a baffled District Attorney George Gascón told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'These people are in very close proximity with him, and nobody sees this. They're just so engrossed, texting and reading and whatnot. They're completely oblivious of their surroundings.' Valdez is perhaps the most extreme example of a troubling behavior that police say has become a public safety plague. Two out of three robberies in the San Francisco area involve thieves snatching smart phones or other electric devices. Usually the victims are clueless until it's too late and their expensive property is gone. 'Oftentimes when you interview people who get their phones stolen, when you ask them to describe where the person came from, what he was wearing, they have no idea,' San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said. Suspect: This man, later identified as Nikhom Thephakaysone, was caught on CCTV cameras flashing a .45-caliber pistol several times before he opened fire . 'Persistently positive': Friends and family say Valdez was always upbeat and an active conservationist . Dashed dreams: Valdez was the president of his high school's environmental club, where the school principal said he was very active, promising student . 'It's not uncommon to read in a police report that a person ""came out of nowhere"" or ""I didn't see where he came from.""' The . Chronicle reports that at least 1,500 pedestrians went to emergency . rooms across the country because they were distracted by cell phones. Justin . Valdez was an upbeat sophomore at San Francisco State University on his . way home in the Ingleside Heights neighborhood around 9:50pm September . 23, officials say. 'He was . one of the most persistently positive kids I ever knew,' Valdez's high . school principal Steve Osborne told the San Francisco Examiner. According . to the Examiner, Valdez was an accomplished competitive swimmer and . water polo player. He was also a passionate environmental advocate and . conservationist. Osborne said that in their last conversation, he told Valdez he hopes his own kids grow up to be as upbeat and vigilant. 'Everybody is just devastated,' Osborne said.","Justin Valdez was a sophomore at San Francisco State University and a native of Garden Grove, California .

"It does not get any bigger, better or tougher than playing the All Blacks. It tests every part of your being; physically, mentally, emotionally and, maybe even, spiritually. If you have a weakness they will identify it and exploit it. There are no hiding places. Eat or be eaten. I loved playing the All Blacks and hated playing the All Blacks in equal measure. I loved it because it was the ultimate challenge and stretched you to be everything you could possibly be. I hated it because they were so good and there was always the chance that you could get an absolute hiding. I played against the All Blacks more than I did against Australia and South Africa combined just because we always toured there every four years or so. We did this because the likes of Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan felt it was the best place for Scotland to tour due to the amount we could learn from playing rugby in a country like New Zealand. Andy Nicol (centre) knows what is like to face New Zealand having played them seven times in his career . Nicol tasted victory against the All Blacks once when turning out for a world XV . Former Scotland captain Nicol (right) said there is nowhere to hide against New Zealand . A lot of New Zealanders are descended from Scotland, the climate is very similar but, sadly, they have always been slightly better than us at rugby. McGeechan says that he thinks New Zealanders are just Scots that have learnt how to win! I do know what it feels like to beat the All Blacks though. I was lucky enough to play for a World XV in 1992 to celebrate the New Zealand Rugby Union centenary and we played the All Blacks three times in a week. I played in the first test with players like Tim Horan, Jeremy Guscott and some fellow Scots, David Sole, Gavin Hastings and Derek White and we beat the All Blacks 28-14. In fact, we battered them that day and, as it was the first time I had played them, I thought this would continue. Scotland recorded a 41-31 win over Argentina last weekend at Murrayfield . Nicol said Scotland will have to take their game up a couple of notches when they play New Zealand . I played them a further six times in my career and it is fair to say they got their revenge as we lost all six games. The sixth turned out to be my last game for Scotland in 2001 and it summed up what it is like to face the All Blacks and the same could happen today. We played very well for 70 minutes to be only 15-6 down but we had expended so much energy just to be in touch of them that we had nothing left in last 10 minutes and they ran in three tries. I was substituted with 10 minutes to go and I could barely put one foot in front of the other I was so tired. I was emptied and had absolutely nothing left to give. But it wasn’t enough, and this is why playing the All Blacks is such a challenge. The game today will be one of the fastest, hardest games the Scottish players will have ever played. It will be a couple of notches up from last week against Argentina and they will also have to face the Haka! Nicol said that it was brilliant facing the Haka before playing New Zealand and he loved the tradition . Nicol does not think it gives the All Blacks an unfair advantage and you can not let yourself get intimidated by it . I get asked a lot what was it like to face the Haka. My answer is, it was brilliant. I loved the tradition. I remember seeing it as a kid, trying to copy it and vowing, then, that I would love to face it one day. People that say it gives New Zealand an unfair advantage have never played International rugby. If you are intimidated buy a bunch of guys in black shirts singing and dancing in front of you, 60 seconds before you are about to play one of the best teams in the world, you should not be on the pitch in the first place. When the TV cameras close in to the faces of, especially, the Maori players with eyes popping and tongues hanging out, it can look intimidating but it should not intimidate the players. It inspired me and I hope it inspires the Scotland team today to get the first win against the mighty All Blacks.","Scotland face New Zealand at Murrayfield on Saturday evening .

"The last time Bostjan Cesar played against Wayne Rooney at Wembley he got a ‘stupid’ kick from the Manchester United striker which kept him out for five weeks. The Slovenia captain returns today and will shake hands with the England captain on equal terms… although he admits ‘maybe I will squeeze his a little!’ During England’s 2009 friendly with Slovenia at Wembley, Cesar tangled with Rooney in the penalty area. Rooney won England a spot-kick, despite crashing heavily into Cesar’s ankle. Frank Lampard scored and England won 2-1, while the collision meant the end of Cesar’s night and a lengthy spell on the sidelines. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England vs Slovenia: Sportsmail's European Championship preview . The incident between Bostjan Cesar (left) and Wayne Rooney during England's last meeting with Slovenia . Cesar leads his Slovenian team out as captain during an international friendly against Turkey in 2013 . The defender later accused Rooney of intentionally trying to injure him, but five years on insists he is not seeking retribution. ‘I don’t understand the referee,’ he recalls. ‘He gives England a penalty and me a yellow card, but Rooney makes a stupid, stupid foul and leaves me injured for five weeks. I wasn’t happy but now everything is OK. ‘On the pitch I am very aggressive and I enjoy the fight in physical games, but I don’t want to kill him.’ Rooney, of course, becomes the newest member of England’s 100-cap club but Cesar is also celebrating a special milestone. The 32-year-old former West Brom centre back plays his 81st game for his country, making him their most-capped player. And having played against England twice, he is convinced Slovenia can shock Roy Hodgson’s men and end up at Euro 2016 themselves. ‘The England team has changed a lot recently as there are lots of new players,’ he says. ‘These young players are very strong but when you change something it can sometimes become a problem. Not only has Cesar plied his trade in England, he also clashed with Kevin Davies (left) while at Marseille . Cesar puts a tackle in on Northern Ireland's David Healy during a World Cup qualifying match in 2008 . ‘This England team don’t have Frank Lampard, John Terry and Ashley Cole. I don’t think they are as strong as last time (a 1-0 win for England at the 2010 World Cup) and we might be able to take advantage of their inexperience.’ Slovenia, ranked 36 in the world, are second in Group E with six points from three games after beating Switzerland at home and Lithuania away — but Cesar refuses to get carried away. ‘We are hopeful of qualification,’ he says. ‘We have a very good team and this new format is really good for us, as more teams can qualify. The country is really optimistic after our last two wins and we’ll have a lot of fans at Wembley. There is more pressure on us now, but we are professionals and we like the pressure. When there is pressure we play well.’ Cesar is determined to help Slovenia register a first win over England, but it’s obvious he has a great affinity with this country. In October, Slovenia beat Switzerland to ensure a positive start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign . Cesar fouls Haris Seferovic (right) during Slovenia's Euro 2016 qualifying game against Switzerland . Ever since he spent the 2007-08 season on loan at West Brom he has come back regularly to visit friends and oversee his business venture — the Fish in a Tie restaurant in Clapham, London. He even speaks about taking English lessons once again — ‘in case I manage West Brom one day!’ But it’s our football Cesar really loves and though he now plays for Italian side Chievo he acknowledges the superiority of the Premier League. He says: ‘It is the best in the world. I’m always dreaming of playing there again — but of course I am very happy in Italy. ‘Players give so much more than in other leagues. The strikers run harder, chasing every ball, and the supporters are fanatical.’ Indeed, if Cesar does turn his hand to management in the future, he has plenty of defining moments under his belt from which to draw experience. He describes going to the 2010 World Cup as a ‘childhood dream’, and suspects his greatest individual moment might be his headed winner against eventual World Cup winners Italy in 2004 during qualification. But when the idea of scoring the winner at Wembley today is floated his way he responds with a broad smile: ‘OK, maybe that would be the best moment’.","Bostjan Cesar was injured by Wayne Rooney last time the two sides met .

"Some may associate Old Trafford more with prawn sandwich eaters than hearty singers, but this weekend's Premier League action appears to show that those inside Manchester United's stadium know how to belt out a song better than most. In the wake of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho saying he felt his side had been 'playing in an empty stadium' last weekend, debate has raged about possible reasons behind any crowd apathy. Ticket prices have been put forward as mitigation, as have all-seater stadiums and a growing number of day-trippers to grounds. Manchester United fans at the Stretford End of Old Trafford make their voices heard at the stadium . In a bid to try and see if Mourinho's words were true of other Premier League grounds, Press Association Sport armed its reporters with a the 'Sound Meter' smartphone application which would attempt to record decibel levels at this weekend's games. While this level of research can in no way be considered scientific and is nothing more than a rough guide, it does indicate that United and Crystal Palace fans made more of a din than any others by as many as six decibels, although for balance there were 30,000 more fans there than anywhere else. In the interests of fairness, all samples were taken from kick-off to the 60-second mark, the highest recorded point has been used and, as no goals were scored in this period, the decibel levels can be considered to have been generated in similar circumstances. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho recently criticised Blues fans for the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge . The recordings will be repeated at the next round of Premier League games in order to gather readings from every ground. Here are the results, with accompanying reference points from our reporters. Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Old Trafford (Attendance 75,325) Decibel level (out of 120) 84: 'It was loud inside Old Trafford at the time, with plenty of the noise also coming from the Palace fans' - Paul Hirst, chief football reporter .

"Ravel Morrison threatened to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed, a court heard. Former Manchester United midfielder Morrison, 21, is also accused of threatening to blow up her house in a course of harassment against his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor lasting four years, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard. The West Ham footballer was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of July 27 in Salford. Double charge: West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison has arrived in court to face charges of assault . On his way in: Morrison heads to court after allegedly attacking his ex-girlfriend outside a Manchester club . Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, sat in the dock at the court for the brief hearing as the harassment allegation was also added to the charges. The court heard the additional charge of causing his ex-girlfriend to fear violence would be used against her spanned the period from January 1 2010 to July 20 this year. The charge alleges he threatened to throw acid in her face, blow up her house and have her killed and other threats of violence. David Fish QC, representing Morrison, indicated the defendant would be pleading not guilty to the charges. District Judge Khalid Qureshi bailed Morrison to appear at Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on August 28. Morrison, originally from Manchester, was initially remanded in custody last week before being bailed. His bail conditions are that he lives in Canary Wharf, London, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, does not go on to the street where they live, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance, to see his lawyers or to visit for a West Ham game in the area and to return to London immediately after the match. Allegations: Morrison is alleged to have assaulted ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor (left) and her mother Parveen . Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under-21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October and was subject to a bid from Fulham in January - although the offer was rejected.

The car, in seafoam green, was bought by the then 20-year-old Mr Nummelin to help him get to and from his first job. His son Tommi told the Huffington Post that the upper radiator hose became lose and he filled the compartment with water. This in turn froze the cooling channels meaning the engine wouldn't start and Mr Nummelin had to be towed by his brother.

"Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale has heaped praise on team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, admitting that the Portuguese star is inspiring him to try and become the best player in the world. Bale, who netted Real's opening goal in their 5-1 win against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday, has settled into life at the Bernabeu quickly, establishing himself in Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded first-team. But the winger, who has flown to Wales to join up with Chris Coleman's squad, says he hopes to develop further and challenge for the Ballon d'Or, an award he believes Ronaldo is likely to retain after another year of dazzling performances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bale & Ronaldo star in epic Real Madrid Champions League kit advert . Gareth Bale posted this picture on Instagram as he left Madrid to join up with the Wales squad . Cristiano Ronaldo shows off his skills during Real Madrid's 5-1 win against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday . Real Madrid team-mates Ronaldo (left) and Bale share a joke before kick-off at the Bernabeu . Speaking to BBC show Football Focus, Bale said: 'I think Cristiano has been amazing this season. 'The amount of goals he's scored, he won the Champions League with us, and he's been playing fantastic. I can't see many people past him (for the Ballon d'Or) but I'm looking forward to seeing who wins and good luck to everybody.' As well as the chance to play for arguably the world's biggest club, Bale admits that the opportunity to line up alongside talented players like the former Manchester United forward was another key factor in his decision to leave Tottenham in the summer of 2013. He added: 'It's another reason why I came to Madrid - to learn from the best players. Seeing him (Ronaldo) in training every day, how concentrated he is on every aspect of his game and on the pitch.

Although Bale made the 23-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or, the 25-year-old knows he still has work to do if he is to be considered on the same level as Ronaldo. Asked whether he had the ambition to be crowned the best player in the world, the ex-Spurs man said: 'If you don't think that, you shouldn't really be playing football. You obviously want to win those type of trophies. It shows you're doing well. 'The main thing for me is I'm improving all the time.

"An unidentified male New York Jets fan punched a woman in the face in a post-game brawl on Sunday. The punch-up began after the Jets bested the New England Patriots 30-27 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. A man videoing the fight says the fights started with two females in the stands. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation. The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick. After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick . A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We . are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior.

"Roy Hodgson's fears about the Wembley surface appear set to be realised after the Slovenian team trained inside the stadium on Friday night and claimed the centre of the pitch was 'completely ruined'. Hodgson has been concerned about wear and tear on the pitch after a series of three American Football games in recent weeks, culminating when the Dallas Cowboys and the Jacksonville Jaguars clashed on Sunday.

More worrying for Hodgson and his England team will be the state of the turf.

"Andy Murray has avoided clear favourite Novak Djokovic in the group stages for next week’s season-end finale at London’s O2 Arena. The 27 year-old Scot, promoted to world No 6 in Monday's new rankings, was instead put in a group with Roger Federer, Kei Nishikori and big-hitting Canadian Milos Raonic for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Anyone would have wanted to be kept away from Djokovic on last week’s form in Paris, where he won every match in straight sets en route to the title, and Murray is certainly no different having now lost to him on seven of their previous eight meetings. VIDEO Scroll down to see the moment Andy secured his place in the ATP World Tour Finals . Andy Murray will be part of the eight-man field at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London . Novak Djokovic . Stan Wawrinka . Tomas Berdych . Marin Cilic . Roger Federer . Kei Nishikori . Andy Murray . Milos Raonic . With the season’s eight top players on show – minus Rafael Nadal, who is having appendix surgery – neither group was ever going to be much easier than the other but Djokovic is certainly the man to beat, and will probably have to be overcome by whoever wants to win a week on Sunday. While it may be good to avoid Djokovic early on, things were partly evened up by the presence in Group A alongside him of world No 4 Stan Wawrinka, who is the one player to have seriously fallen out of form since the US Open in September. The Swiss, who also has half an eye on the Davis Cup final versus France that follows the O2 event, has gone 2-4 in that time and is struggling to rediscover the momentum that carried him to the Australian Open final in January. Not that Federer, who heads Murray’s Group B, is any pushover and he has a record of 14-1 since Flushing Meadows, his only loss being to Raonic in the Paris Masters quarter-finals last Friday. Murray (left) lost to Roger Federer in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in Melbourne earlier this year . Novak Djokovic (right) lifts the trophy after winning the Paris Masters on Sunday as David Luiz looks on . The Canadian had been struggling before the last Masters event of the year, but reached the final in the French capital and has a record of 12-5 since New York. He and Nishikori were the last two players to qualify, with the Japanese – the first Asian-born player to make the year-end finals – getting them both across the line late on Friday night when he knocked out the final contender David Ferrer, who will be the on-site alternate along with fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez. While Murray has a good record in general against tall big servers he is 1-3 versus Raonic but 3-0 against Nishikori. His longer standing record against Federer stands at 11-11. After winning three ATP titles in six weeks Murray ought to be feeling relatively confident. Regardless of the draw, the man to beat, clearly, is Djokovic, who seems to have been inspired by the recent birth of his son Stefan.

"Germany have seen a dip in form since winning the World Cup in July and a 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Gibraltar on Friday was proof the players need to get their mind off the awards and start playing again, coach Joachim Low said. The Germans had pledged a goal bonanza against the European minnows after losing to Poland and drawing with Ireland in October. But they only netted three times - the fourth came from a Gibraltar own goal - and whistles and jeers could be heard as the World Cup winners walked off the pitch in Nuremberg. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's International Big Match Stats: Germany vs Gibraltar . Germany manager Joachim Low was unhappy with his players' performance against Gibraltar . Low said the players now need to forget about the World Cup as they move into 2015 . 'I think there were a lot of award ceremonies and celebrations,' Low said after spending much of the week with the team in Berlin, honoured by the country's president and attending a World Cup movie premiere. 'Now we need to get all of this out of our heads at the end of this World Cup year, draw a line and prepare properly for our next tournament.' The Germans, second in Group D on seven points along with Ireland and Scotland with Poland top on 10, were the only ones attacking with all 11 Gibraltar players in or around their own box. 'We did not hold our positions. True it is not always easy when you have some many people at the back. There was little space but that's where we have to have a high tempo.' Germany's Shkodran Mustafi (centre) challenges for the ball during the match against Gibraltar . Sami Khedira looks disappointed during a match that Germany were expected to breeze . 'There you need one-on-one situations but we instead stopped and played the ball back.' With German media expecting a double-digit scoreline, the four-time World Cup winners were instead lacklustre for much of the second half, running out of ideas. Instead of stretching the game over the wings to open up Gibraltar, they piled bodies through the middle in an already crowded area. 'At times there were 18 players in that middle. For some players I expected a lot more,' said Low. 'A stronger drive towards goal, more finishes because our opponent did not do much else except wait at the edge of the box. We need to be able to solve these things better.' With European champions Spain their next opponents in a friendly on November 18, Germany are eager to round off the year with a positive result against the team that had won the previous three major international trophies.","Germany beat Gibraltar 4-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night .

"A place back in the top four is within Andy Murray's grasp if he can continue his fine end to a difficult season at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. The 27-year-old slipped as low as 12 in the rankings after the US Open but winning three trophies during a run of six successive tournaments has lifted him back up to number six. Murray appears finally to have overcome the lingering effects of back surgery last year, with both his fitness and confidence levels prompting hopes he could follow his Wimbledon triumph by winning again on home soil at the O2 Arena. Andy Murray practices his serve at the O2 Arena ahead of his first game in the ATP World Tour Finals . Murray has been excellent over the past few years to qualify for the event, and is now looking to win it . He currently sits 420 points behind out-of-form Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka in fourth and, with 1,500 points up for grabs to an unbeaten champion in London, there is the potential for Murray to make significant strides. A top-four seeding for the Australian Open in January would mean Murray could not play Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal until the semi-finals. Murray said: 'I'll obviously try to finish in the top four if I can but a few weeks ago it was, 'Will he finish in the top 10?' 'I'd love to get there but it's all a process. With most things in my career, they've happened quite gradually so I'm not expecting to finish in the top four. Coach Amelie Mauresmo watches Murray practice as he looks to break back into the worlds top four . Murray is up against the top eight men in the world, with the exception of Rafa Nadal, in London . 'If I do, it would be a very good effort after the last few weeks. It's been a tough year in a lot of respects so I'll try my best to have a good event and get some good wins under my belt.' Murray's reward for battling his way into the eight-man field at the O2 is a round-robin group also featuring Federer and newcomers Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic. Murray opens the tournament on Sunday afternoon against US Open runner-up Nishikori, the man who sits immediately above him in the rankings. 'He's made big improvements this year in his game and his ranking, he's won a number of tournaments, he's had a lot of matches but also quite a few injuries,' said the Scot. 'He's played some very good tennis this year. He's a young guy and he's going to keep getting better over the next couple of years.' Kei Nishikori, Murray's opponent on Sunday, has never beaten the Scot in their three meetings . The eight players pose for a selfie, taken by Czech star Tomas Berdych, before the tournament gets underway . Nishikori, 24, has yet to take a set off Murray in three previous meetings but the most recent of those was almost two years ago. The Japanese player said: 'I think he's going to be one of the toughest opponents for me because I haven't beaten him. He beat me already three times and he's one of the toughest players on the tour. 'And especially he's from here and he's got the home crowd so it's not going to be easy for me. But I think this is a little bit of a different situation because I've been playing one of the best years of my career and beating top-10, top-five guys already. 'I don't think it's like I can't beat him so, if I can play good tennis, I think I will have some chance to win.' Sunday evening's match sees Federer take on Raonic, and victories for both Federer and Murray would set up a clash between them on Tuesday. Nishikori is confident of victory over Murray after a season in which he has played his best ever tennis . Murray admits that he has had a tough year, as he conceded after qualifying for the end of season event . Winning the group will be important to try to avoid Djokovic, who is on a 27-match winning run indoors, in the semi-finals. Murray and Federer have played each other three times at the O2 since the tournament moved to London in 2009, with the Swiss winning on each occasion. Murray cited Federer's record as one of the best indoor players of all time, but Federer said: 'I was actually quite surprised how well I've played him here in the past because I thought it was going to be hard, I thought maybe on a couple of occasions I was probably going to lose. 'But things went very well for me. I don't feel necessarily the surface is crazy helpful for me or for him, I think it's a very even court for any player. 'He plays well indoors so there's no reason for him not to do very well here. I've had a difficult head-to-head against him and clearly playing him in London is a more difficult challenge than somewhere else in the world. 'Definitely Andy wasn't himself the first few months of the year, there was no doubt it took him a while to get fully fit again after the surgery and so I'm very happy for him that he's doing so well again now at the end of the year.","Andy Murray starts World Tour Finals against Kei Nishikori on Sunday .

"With Wayne Rooney set to make his 100th England appearance against Slovenia on Saturday, he will become only his country's eighth player to be handed that esteemed golden cap.

"Niall Quinn is adamant only the strongest will be able to aim for glory on Friday evening. Those without the necessary fortitude risk being swept aside amid a maelstrom of emotion. The Irish legend anticipates the atmosphere inside Celtic Park with an almost salivating relish. He will be confined to the relative sanctuary of a television studio, but admits he dreams of still being young enough to step out of the tunnel and into the white-hot battle. Quinn views this Euro 2016 qualifier as just about the ultimate test of mentality. An international encounter imbued with all the passion, intensity and significance of any great club rivalry. Niall Quinn feels Robbie Keane is tailor-made to influence the showdown with Scotland . The potential is there for heroes to be born, for careers to find a defining moment. But there is also, Quinn warns, the capacity for the occasion to overwhelm those not ready for what lies in wait. He does not see it being a game decided by the tactical scheming of Gordon Strachan or Martin O’Neill. Rather this will be football in its most gladiatorial form. ‘It’s about adapting to what will be an explosive atmosphere, just incredible,’ insisted Quinn. ‘I’m going to be there for Sky and all of us are absolutely anticipating the energy and emotion that will fill the place. ‘What team deals with it best and keeps their heads will be a big factor. ‘It’s going to be a cauldron of fear if you let it go that way, or a cauldron of energy if you let it help you along. ‘Those who are stronger-willed and stronger-minded will come out on top. But I’ m finding it very hard to decide which team is going to do that. Celtic striker Anthony Stokes (right) could have an impact off the bench . ‘I see this as a different kind of game to any in the group so far. It’s not a normal European qualifier. ‘It is nearer Celtic v Rangers, Manchester City v United or Liverpool v Everton - that kind of intense derby occasion. It’s difficult to stress the importance of this match. It is about more than qualifying. It builds real passion and patriotic pride. ‘Whereas a lot of training for big qualifiers centres around getting videos of the opponents and maybe dealing with their No 10 or whatever, this comes with a totally different outlook. I think tactics will be secondary aspect. ‘It is man v man, like a throwback to the kind of games we had in the past.’ Ireland happen to have a man who has become iconic for doing that latter feat. Robbie Keane will be in the hunt for, quite remarkably, his 66th international goal when he returns to Parkhead following a prolific loan spell in 2010. Now 34, Keane remains an essential part of O’Neill’s plans having flattened all manner of records over the course of 137 caps. The hat-trick he netted against Gibraltar last month made him the highest scorer in the history of European Championship qualifiers. Quinn, second on Ireland’s goals list, is awestruck by Keane’s relentless consistency and feels he is tailor-made to influence the showdown with Scotland. ‘Robbie obviously knows Celtic Park well and he will love the atmosphere - full stop,’ enthused Quinn, who partnered Keane up front in the 2002 World Cup finals. Former Ireland striker Quinn will cover the Euro 2016 qualifier for Sky . ‘The bigger the atmosphere, the bigger the game, the more he can use his experience. ‘He can call upon all those positive things, memories of scoring there in the past and so on, to give himself the edge. ‘Robbie is a national treasure. He has done something extraordinary in his career, just phenomenal. ‘It beggars belief at times when you look at every other Irish goalscorer, including myself, and the amount of games we played. ‘He has got a hold of this record and driven it to a place where none of us mere mortals could dream about.’ Keane has warmed up for Glasgow in some style, scoring one and setting up three in LA Galaxy’s 5-0 rout of Real Salt Lake on Sunday evening. Being resident in California has not diminished any of his desire to represent his country. ‘When he went to America, people did ask if he would hold onto his place or whether others playing regularly in England could come in and take over,’ reflected Quinn . ‘One or two flattered to deceive, but Robbie has seen them all off with his enthusiasm.’ Scotland manager Gordon Strachan relishing Ireland clash at Celtic Park . Anthony Stokes is one of those left on the fringes by Keane’s evergreen effectiveness. Quinn was Sunderland chairman when Stokes played on Wearside – and fell foul of manager Roy Keane for off-field disciplinary issues. ‘Listen, Anthony always had quality,’ insisted Quinn. ‘He was great for Arsenal’s youth team then things got a bit more difficult for him. But he has knuckled down since and seems to be doing very well for Celtic. ‘To be honest, I’d have hoped he’d have amassed more caps than he has done. He needs to get himself into that Ireland team. ‘But that is the beauty of a game like this. If, at 0-0, Robbie comes off after an hour then those on the bench have to be ready. ‘Anthony has to believe there is a goal in him if he gets the chance – and work so hard in training that Martin points to him if a change is needed.’ Quinn feels Scotland’s opening display in Germany set the standard for a group he regards as by the far the toughest in the entire qualification process. Friday night now represents the most crucial staging post yet. ‘If someone comes away with three points, it is a huge advantage and a crushing blow for the loser,’ added Quinn. ‘I think I’ll probably dream about playing in it a few nights this week. Whether you a Scottish guy under Gordon or an Irish guy under Martin, you are under managers who have team spirit at the maximum.’","Ireland legend Niall Quinn views Euro 2016 qualifier as huge mental test .

"One in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a relationship break-up, research suggests . One in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a break-up, new research suggests. The study by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex found that women and children are those who are hit the hardest following the breakdown of a relationship. Researchers, who analysed data from the British Household Panel Survey between 1991 and 2008, also found that 19 per cent of children fall into relative poverty after their parents split. The study also found that mental health and life satisfaction declines for both men and women in the wake of a split. However, while they return to pre-split levels in the short-term, women are left struggling in the long-term with income and living standards. The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that on average, it takes two to three years for a woman’s household income to return to its pre-split levels. In comparison, on average, a man’s income rises by around 80 per cent at the time of a split and never falls back to pre-split levels. Women's income is usually helped by meeting a new partner, the study found. The study’s authors, Professor  Mike Brewer and Dr Alita Nandi, said: ‘Women and dependent children, on average, see living standards fall more than men after a split. ‘These changes are much greater for those women and children from formerly high-income couples, because the loss of the man’s earnings is in no way compensated for by higher income from alimony, child maintenance, benefits and tax credits, and having fewer mouths to feed. ‘Our research suggests that partnership dissolution has relatively short-term adverse impacts on mental distress and subjective well-being, but can have long-term negative consequences for income and living standards.’ Fiona Weird, chief executive of Gingerbread – a charity providing advice and support to single parents – said the Government must ensure that the number of single parents struggling doesn’t fall any lower. Both men and women experience a decline in mental health and life satisfaction in the wake of a break-up but while these return to pre-split levels in the short-term, women are left with lower income and living standards . She told The Observer: ‘This research chimes with what many of the single parents we work with tell us every day: that they are really struggling to pay essential bills and put food on the table. She said that fewer than two in five of single parents– of whom nine out of 10 are mothers – received maintenance from their child’s other parent, something which she said needed to be addressed urgently. ‘The Government must ensure the changes it is making to the child maintenance system don’t see this figure fall even lower,’ she added. The Government is currently examining whether family breakdown should be considered when measuring child poverty. A child is deemed as living in poverty if the family household income is less than 60 per cent of the average wage.","One in five single mothers fall into poverty in wake of a break-up, study says .

"South Africa captain Jean de Villiers believes England are the most improved team in world rugby and is expecting a fierce battle when he leads his side against them at Twickenham on Saturday. The veteran centre sees parallels between the two nations in the way both have injected new talent over the last few seasons, but also kept a core group of experienced players. 'I see a lot of similarities between their team and ours. England is the team that has evolved the most and improved the most,' De Villiers told reporters on Friday. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . South Africa star Jean de Villiers passes the ball during his country's captain's run at Twickenham . The Springboks take on England at Twickenham on Saturday after losing to Ireland last weekend . 'You look back at 2012 and the four games we played against each other, we narrowly won the first two in South Africa, drew the third and beat them by one point in the last game, so there was not much between the two teams then and I think they are a different beast now in 2014. 'They have new players coming in, but there is still experience within the squad, and the mix they have there at the moment is pretty good.' The Springbok captain suggests the challenge of meeting England away from home is second only to New Zealand for the South African players. 'Rugby was born here. Growing up in South Africa you want to play New Zealand, but also playing against England is not far behind that. It's a proud rugby nation and one of the most difficult teams to beat at home.

'Whenever we play England it's always a massive challenge and a big battle, so the focus sharpens up during a week like this, where we definitely know what we are in for. There's a lot on the line and it makes for a great game.' De Villiers is looking for a reaction from his players following their 29-15 defeat in Ireland last weekend, which would also serve as a confidence boost ahead of next year's World Cup in England. 'When it has been a result like last weekend the tensions are high at stages but I thought we controlled it well this week,' the 33-year-old said. 'If we can function well again with our first phases, because the challenge will be different and will be fierce in that department, and we can still dominate in the possession and territory, then I think we will tick the right boxes.'

"Scotland hero Shaun Maloney thanked coach Stuart McCall for being the architect of the glorious goal that sank the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park. The Wigan man savoured perhaps his finest moment in the dark blue of his country — and an unforgettable career highlight — when he curled home a brilliant shot from the fringe of the area with 15 minutes remaining. It was a sublime finishing touch to the nimblest of moves, with Maloney and Ikechi Anya working a short corner routine before skipper Scott Brown set up his former Celtic team-mate with a back-heel flick. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates after scoring the winner for Scotland against the Republic of Ireland . Scotland coach Stuart McCall (second left) celebrates on the touchline after Maloney's goal . Maloney revealed it was a routine plotted by former Motherwell manager McCall — Scotland’s third in command — during preparations at their Mar Hall training base. But the 31-year-old revealed it was very much a case of alright on the night after a series of botched attempts at the move in the build-up to the crunch Euro 2016 qualifier. ‘I was confident that we would score but maybe not in the way we did,’ admitted Maloney. ‘It was a slight variation on what we worked on in training. The way Ireland set up made us change it slightly. We worked on something similar this week and the coach has to take credit for this. ‘It was Stuart McCall, he worked on it. It came off slightly differently to what we had been planning. Stuart and Mark McGhee work pretty hard on these set-pieces and they don’t always come off. ‘It went in zero times in training! These things you practise hundreds of times and you just kind of hope that they (the opposition) switch off and it happens in a match like it did tonight. ‘You get an initial reaction when connecting with the ball, but the difference between that going in and hitting the post is millimetres. You know you have a fair chance of scoring, but it was just pure elation at the time when it went in. ‘I’ve been fortunate to score some special goals — but this is right up there and it meant the world to me and the team. It was a special moment to be part of. The Scotland fans go wild as Maloney's goal helps move them up to third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group D . ‘There wasn’t much in the game and it wasn’t overly pretty. We always felt there would be one moment either for us or Ireland that would settle the game.’ On a bruising night at Celtic Park, captain Scott Brown insisted Scotland had defied an Irish plan to knock them out of their stride — by fair means or foul. Martin O’Neill’s side thundered into challenges throughout the match, earning four bookings to the two picked up by Strachan’s side. Seamus Coleman could well have seen red for clattering through goal hero Maloney in the latter stages but Serbian referee Milorad Mazic allowed play to continue and didn’t return with a second yellow card for the Everton right-back. That kind of physical confrontation is meat-and-drink to toughened competitors such as Brown, but he expressed pride in the way the entire Scottish team stood tall. ‘I think Ireland’s gameplan was to try and stop us playing football,’ said Brown. ‘But it didn’t work. ‘We still managed to get the ball down in tight situations and play, knock nice little one-twos and create chances for ourselves. Maloney curls a low strike across goal and into the far bottom corner to clinch victory for the hosts . ‘Were Ireland lucky to finish with 11 men? I don’t know. There were a few rough tackles but I didn’t get a good eye on them. ‘Overall, it was a good night. It wasn’t the best performance in the world but we got the victory. ‘I think Ireland came up with a plan where they tried to play from back to front. They tried to impose their own gameplan but we kept trying to get the ball down and trying to play. ‘Did we deserve to win? Yeah. Definitely. I think we were the better team from start to finish. We tried to play football and I think that is what the fans keep coming along to see.’ The Scotland camp had protested pre-match that last night’s encounter was not a ‘must-win’ occasion, but Brown did not attempt to downplay the importance of the result. Poland’s rout of Georgia merely increased the need for victory, with Strachan’s side now sitting alongside Ireland and world champions Germany on seven points after four games. England visit Parkhead for a high-profile friendly on Tuesday evening before Gibraltar come to Glasgow on Euro 2016 business in March. The return match with O’Neill’s men is in Dublin in June. ‘It is shaping up to be a great group and there is still an awful lot to do,’ said Brown. The ball curls into the net as the Republic of Ireland defenders can only look on . ‘We just want to keep things going when the qualifiers start again. ‘This has been a great result in front of 60,000 people at Celtic Park. It is huge for us. ‘We have got a winning mentality and we want to continue it. We have another big game on Tuesday night against England. ‘Even though it is a friendly we want to keep the winning mentality that the manager has instilled in us. We follow his lead and we try to get the ball down to play football that entertains the fans who come along. ‘None of like to get beat and you could see that tonight in our performance. All 11 men defended at times and then we worked together to create chances. We were putting pressure on their defence and eventually it paid off. ‘We can do both sides to the game. We can defend and we can play football and counter-attack with pace.’","Scotland beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday .

"Emmanuel Adebayor  launched an extraordinary attack on Tottenham supporters this week and claimed the players are no longer made to feel welcome at White Hart Lane. The striker, who took an extra minute to come on as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat by Stoke because he decided to change his boots when he was waiting to get on, insists the atmosphere is negative. We asked Dan Kilpatrick, editor of The Tottenham Way, for his views on Adebayor's comments. Emmanuel Adebayor is the worst possible Tottenham player to criticise Spurs fans. But that’s not to say the striker doesn’t have a point. Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor  launched a scathing attack on the Spurs supporters this week . Adebayor said players would rather be away from home after fans opted to boo during the defeat to Stoke . The attacked may have a point about the Tottenham support but it's not what supporters want to hear . Even when he was scoring under Harry Redknapp and saluting under Tim Sherwood, fans could never fully embrace Adebayor. He scored against Spurs too often for Arsenal and is, unfairly in my opinion, viewed as more of a mercenary than other players in the Tottenham squad. There’s also a feeling – again unfair and perpetuated by TV pundits – that a player earning so much cash should always be performing better. With one or two exceptions, the entire squad has been abysmal under Mauricio Pochettino but Ade is often singled out, slammed for his 'lazy', 'feckless' displays ahead of other more popular players, who are just as deserving of criticism. It’s therefore no surprise Ade’s claim that the squad is afraid to play at home because of the negative atmosphere has ruffled some feathers. Tottenham have been abysmal under new boss Mauricio Pochettino and were embarrassed by Stoke . Stoke frontman Jon Walters scored the Potters' second as they clinched all three points in north London . Adebayor tried his luck with a late header against Stoke but it wasn't to be for the Tottenham striker . Fans have rightly pointed out that Ade has been rubbish away from home this season, where Spurs arguably have the best fans in the country. Supporters will not take kindly to criticism from a player who is clearly not performing to the best of his ability but, rightly or wrongly, Adebayor was named vice-captain by Pochettino and it’s now his responsibility to speak on behalf of the squad. If his comments had come from Younes Kaboul’s other deputy, Hugo Lloris, or even from one of the young, homegrown players, the reaction would have been different. Central defender Younes Kaboul leads out his Tottenham team at White Hart Lane ahead of Hugo Lloris . And even some of Adebayor’s critics will have read his remarks and nodded in resigned agreement. There is consensus among Spurs fans that the atmosphere at the Lane is on the decline, which is why the wonderful 1882 movement and others are growing in importance. Fortunately, I didn’t attend the Stoke match but by all accounts the Lane began as edgy and turned outright poisonous after Stoke’s opener. Watching on TV, there was an obvious absence of Tottenham players showing for the ball and ‘afraid’ would be an appropriate way to describe the shambolic performance. Whether this is primarily a result of Pochettino’s instructions or the atmosphere is unclear, but negatively from the terraces can hardly have helped the players. The Tottenham Hotspur players jump in unison during the warm up, but were beaten by the Potters . The Tottenham supporters (pictured observing a minute's silence) turned up in their droves to watch the defeat . Fans will point out that they have a right to boo Adebayor and Co when they don’t appear to be giving their all. But Adebayor’s introduction on Sunday was, disgustingly, booed before he had a chance to kick a ball. Paying fans have the right to express dissatisfaction in this way but it’s a bit like the right to freedom of expression; we have it, but we shouldn’t use it to be a total fool. White Hart Lane remains a fabulous old-fashioned football ground and when it’s rocking, there is nowhere better, for me, in the entire country. The current negativity is undoubtedly a chicken and egg situation and if the players show more, the fans will respond. But that’s not to say Spurs fans are entirely blameless for the club’s current struggles. Adebayor has made a good point. We just don’t want to hear it from him.

"Corry Evans expects brother Jonny to be cheering him on in front of a television screen when Northern Ireland take on Romania on Friday. Michael O'Neill's side have defied expectations in the first three rounds of Euro 2016 qualifying by taking maximum points, all without Manchester United defender Jonny Evans. The centre-half is arguably his country's most high profile player, but a combination of suspension and injuries has kept him out of victories over Hungary, the Faroe Islands and Greece, with a lingering ankle complaint also preventing him making the trip to Bucharest. Corry Evans (right) is set to be involved for Northern Ireland in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Romania . Jonny Evans will miss Northern Ireland's match in Bucharest with an ankle ligament injury . Younger sibling Corry, meanwhile, played an important role in Budapest and Athens and is expected to start again versus the second-placed Romanians. And, just as before, he is sure Jonny will be kicking every ball with him. 'Jonny is obviously really frustrated he hasn't been able to play so far in this campaign. He is desperate to get back because playing for Northern Ireland means the world to him,' said Corry. 'I know from talking to him he is so eager to meet up with the lads and be a part of it all and more importantly, help us on the pitch. 'He will be sitting at home again cheering us on and like the first three games. I know he will be the first person to text me after the game. 'It is very difficult for him at the minute because things are going so well and he wants to feel a part of it like the rest of us. Michael O'Neill's Northern Ireland side have won their first three Euro 2016 qualifiers . They currently top Group F with nine points from a possible nine gained so far . 'But once he is fit, I know he will be a major boost to our hopes of creating history by qualifying for the European Championships for the first time.' After their stunning start to qualifying, Northern Ireland need only a point this week to remain top of Group F well into the new year. For a side who finished fifth in their last World Cup group and dropped a seeding pot as a result, that would represent a huge achievement. 'Having the opportunity to remain at the top of the group until the next qualifier in March is a big deal for us,' admitted the Blackburn midfielder. Kyle Lafferty celebrates his goal and Northern Ireland's second in the 2-0 win over Greece last time out . Gareth McAuley marks his goal in Northern Ireland's win over the Faroe Islands last month . 'We want to remain unbeaten by the time we come home from Romania and a draw would be a good result. 'There's no doubting it is a massive game because Romania are second in the group and we are sitting at the top after three games. 'We are going in to every game now believing we can get a result and so far we have done.'","Northern Ireland travel to Bucharest sitting top of Euro qualifying Group F .

"Ever worried how your child would fare in the big bad world on their own? Have you wondered if they would hold down a respectable job and thrive away from the family home? Well you can soon find out - a new fake town called Kidzania is being built in Westfield shopping centre in west London that provides the experience of independent living for children aged between four and 12 years old. Kids who visit the 75,000 sq ft mini city for the day arrive via flight simulation, which has been built by British Airways and will be partly-operated by children. Kidzania is a new 75,000 sq ft fake town being built in west London, which aims to teach children aged four to 12 about careers. Kids become dentists, radio presenters and firemen to earn money that they can spend on food, shopping and beauty treatments among other things . After opening a fake bank account, the children are handed a cashpoint card loaded with 50 KidZos. They can use this cash to do things like buy food, take a bus-driven tour of the town, undergo beauty treatments or go shopping. But 50 KidZos doesn't last long, so children are encouraged to get one of the many jobs on offer to them in Kidzania in order to earn more cash. There are more than 60 jobs to choose from, including police officer, surgeon, fireman, dentist, beauty therapist. chef, smoothie maker and even tattoo artist. The fake town has a fully-functioning fire station where children learn about the importance of fire safety and are called upon to put out fake blazes . While parents pay a £28 entry fee for each child, a large bulk of the expense is also fronted by sponsors like Innocent drinks, who participate in the city by manning the operations. For instance, children will take on jobs at an Innocent smoothie 'factory' in the city, where they are taught to make one of the drinks, while also learning about different fruits from around the world. Global Radio - who owns stations including Heart FM and Capital FM - have come on board to provide a special Kidzania radio station, where children can try their hand at being producers, newsreaders, traffic and showbiz reporters, or radio presenters. Children can also take on jobs in a hospital and a dentist surgery . Jobs including nurses, doctors, surgeons and ambulance drivers at the town's hospital are available . For the wannabe petrol heads, car company Renault is hosting a pit lane experience where kids are paired into teams and trained to change the tyres of a purpose-built, scale model e.dams-Renault Formula E car, before performing the tyre change under race conditions. There is also a hospital where children can become surgeons, nurses and ambulancemen and a fully-functioning fire station, complete with working fire engines. For the more fashion-conscious, H&M is hosting a clothing design studio. Children arrive at Kidzania via a fake plane flight, which is provided by British Airways. Children can learn about roles including a pilot at the flight academy . Children can also become chefs at some of the many food outlets in the town . The town even has its own hotel, where children can learn how to manage the reception and housekeeping duties. The idea of Kidzania is for children to experience different jobs and have their eyes opened to the importance of careers, all the while enjoying themselves. Joel Cadbury, Chairman of KidZania London, said: 'It has been exciting to work with the (sponsors) on creating establishments and activities that exceed anything we dreamt of.' There are already several Kidzania towns in operation across the world, in places including Tokyo, Lisbon, Santa Fe, Istanbul and Mumbai and the London version is expected to open in March next year.","A new 75,000 sq ft fake town called Kidzania is being built in west London .

"La Liga champions Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat to bottom of the table Real Sociedad, as the Basque side ended Diego Simeone's  winning streak with a late goal from Imanol Agirretxe. The hosts, who are expected to unveil former Manchester United manager David Moyes as their new manager in the coming days, put in a much improved performance against the Champions League finalists, and in the end ran out deserving winners. Carlos Vela was the star of the show, driving his side forward and scoring a magnificent curling effort after the hosts had fallen behind. Imanol Agirretxe gets up above the Atletico Madrid defence to score the winning goal at the Anoeta stadium . Agirretxe celebrates heading Real Sociedad into the lead in the 82nd minute against the champions . Carlos Vela (centre) is mobbed by his Real Sociedad team-mates after scoring a superb equaliser . Mario Mandzukic put Atletico into the lead after tapping home Raul Garcia's inviting cross . Real Sociedad: Zubikarai, C.Martinez, Mikel, Bergara, Inigo, Granero, Agirretxe, Prieto, Vela, Chory Castro, Yuri. Subs: Rulli, Finnbogason, Rubén Pardo, Ansotegim, Zurutuza, Zaldúa, Hervías . Atletico Madrid: Moya; Juanfran, Miranda, Godin, Siqueira; Mario, Gabi, Koke, Arda; R. Garcia, Mandzukic. Subs: Tiago, Griezmann, Oblak, Ansaldi, Rodríguez, Cerci, Giménez de Vargas . Referee: Alfonso Álvarez Izquierdo . And Atletico were unable to hold on for a valuable point, in a game where they were often outplayed by a side with very different priorities in La Liga. Atletico's task was made much harder by left back Siqueira, who picked up two bookings in the first five minutes after half time, both with unnecessary tackles, to leave his side in the lurch. And despite struggling to break down the ten men of Atletico, Sociedad eventually earned the win, their first since August, when Agirretxe headed home from close range. At the heart of almost everything good the home side created was Vela. The former Arsenal forward committed defenders, played incisive passes, and was twice unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty, receiving instead a yellow card for diving and a bloodied mouth. Mandzukic celebrates giving Atletico Madrid the lead with Arda Turan and Siqueira after just 10 minutes . Enaut Zubikarai could do nothing about the goal, as bottom of the table Sociedad endured a tough start . Carlos Vela, who led the fightback brilliantly for the Basque side, is fouled by Mario Suarez and Koke . Still, neither the referee nor Mario Mandzukic's shoulder could deny him his goal, a spectacular curling strike from outside the box. It had all looked so different after just ten minutes, when Atletico took the lead. Raul Garcia's cross from the edge of the box was the sort of delivery strikers can usually only dream of. Mandzukic, arriving at the far post, had a tap in from inside six yards, as two Sociedad defenders failed to cut out the inviting ball. Arda Turan vies for the ball with Mikel Gonzalez as Real Sociedad climbed out of the relegation zone . Mario Mandzukic smashes his shoulder into the face of Carlos Vela, but it went unnoticed by the referee . Vela was left with a mouth full of blood but picked himself back up to continue an excellent performance . But Sociedad took just five minutes to hit back, and after Vela's strike they really should have gone into the interval ahead. First the Mexican was denied a penalty when Diego Godin appeared to have fouled him, before the Atletico defender performed heroics to deny Agirretxe, who had rounded the keeper but couldn't beat Godin's goal-line slide. In the end, however, it would not matter. Siqueira's stupidity left his side exposed, and Agirretxe was rewarded for a night of hard work when he headed past Moya with eight minutes to go. Raul Garcia loses out to Sociedad's Chori Castro as the hosts put in their best performance of the season .

"Real Sociedad announced David Moyes as their new manager, despite the Scot insisting he is 'slightly surprised' with the club's announcement. Though the 18-month deal is yet to be confirmed by those in the Moyes camp, there have been a fair few British managers try their luck abroad. Here, Sportsmail look at how other British managers have fared abroad throughout history. Real Sociedad announced David Moyes as their new manager, despite the Scot being 'slightly surprised' SIR BOBBY ROBSON . Perhaps the most successful British coach to have managed abroad. After guiding England to the semi-finals of Italia '90, Robson moved to PSV Eindhoven, where he replaced Guus Hiddink. Despite struggling to curb Romario's party antics, Robson led PSV to back to back Eredivisie titles. After an unsuccessful spell at Sporting Lisbon, Robson won successive Portuguese titles at FC Porto before landing one of the top jobs in European football - that of Barcelona manager. Robson won the Cup Winners' Cup and the Copa del Rey during his first season at the club, but that did not save him from the sack. Jose Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas, who both worked with Robson, owe a huge debt of gratitude to the late Englishman, as does Pep Guardiola, who played under him at Barcelona. Robson coached some of the best players in world football, including former Brazil striker Ronaldo, who described his old coach as 'a father figure' during their time together at Barca. Sir Bobby Robson is perhaps considered the most successful British manager that tried his luck abroad . JOHN TOSHACK . Another man to have been in the hot seat at Sociedad. Toshack in fact managed Sociedad on no fewer than three occasions during a management career that has taken the Welshman to eight countries. Toshack guided Sociedad to their second Copa del Rey in history 27 years ago and then went to Real Madrid. Toshack won the Primera Division in his first year after a team containing the likes of Bernd Schuster, Emilio Butragueno and a young Fernando Hierro scored 107 goals. He was sacked just 11 games into the 1990-91 season, though, and returned to Sociedad. Madrid came calling for Toshack again but he lasted just one season after criticising his players. Toshack also managed Deportivo La Coruna, Besiktas, St Etienne, Catania, Real Murcia, Macedonia and Khazar Lankaran in Azerbaijan. Now he manages Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca. John Toshack took to the hot seat at Real Sociedad on no less than three occasions during his career . ROY HODGSON . Another multi-lingual coach who has travelled the length and breadth of the world. Hodgson started his career in Sweden, winning the title on two occasions with Halmstad. He then won the Allsvenska five years in a row with Malmo before moving to Switzerland where he managed the national side after a spell with Neuchatel Xamax. After leading the Swiss to their first major championships in 28 years, Hodgson departed for Inter Milan where he coached the likes of Javier Zanetti, Youri Djorkaeff and Paul Ince to a UEFA Cup final in 1997, which they lost to Schalke. Hodgson managed Inter again and had spells in Finland, Norway and the United Arab Emirates before returning to England. Now-England manager Roy Hodgson pictured during his time at Inter Milan boss as one of his spells abroad . TERRY VENABLES . After tasting success at Crystal Palace and QPR, the Barcelona board handed Venables the manager's job at the Nou Camp upon the recommendation of Sir Bobby Robson. 'El Tel' as he became known, spent three years at Barca. He won the league in his first year at the Catalonian club and guided them to the 1986 European Cup final where they lost to Steaua Bucharest in a penalty shootout. Despite the arrival of Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes, Barcelona could not win and lost out to Real Madrid by one point in '87 and Venables was dismissed soon after. Venables resigned in shame from his only other role away from Britain, that of Australia coach. The Socceroos had led 3-1 in their World Cup play-off against Iran, but conceded two late goals and therefore missed out on France '98 despite extensive backing from the national football association. Barcelona handed Terry Venables (right) the manager's job at the Nou Camp upon Robson's recommendation . STEVE MCCLAREN . The current Derby manager went to Holland to rebuild his reputation following a disastrous spell in charge of England. The move paid off as he led Twente to their maiden Eredivisie title in his second year in charge. He was then appointed Wolfsburg coach, but was sacked just nine months later. McClaren returned to Twente for a second time but lasted just over a year before resigning due to supporter unrest. Steve McClaren led FC Twente to their maiden Eredivisie title in his second year in charge in Holland .","David Moyes is 'slightly surprised' Real Sociedad have announced the deal .

"It was Groundhog Day here — the same old, familiar plot. A narrow loss for England. Gallant failure. Defiance in defeat. Talk of positives and lessons to learn. Simmering rage, barely suppressed. Mike Brown was wrestling with the same emotions he had felt five months earlier in Dunedin, when the All Blacks’ margin of victory had been a solitary point. He spoke then of ‘failure’ and the Harlequins full-back wasn’t about to sugar-coat his assessments this time. ‘If we’re brutally honest, it is another “what if?”,’ he said, as the grimace on his face conveyed so much personal angst. ‘We’re here to win and again we’ve let it go. We’ve got to start putting these games away and there is massive disappointment at the moment.’ VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Replacements: Keven Mealamu, Ben Franks, Charlie Faumuina, Patrick Tuipulotu, Liam Messam, TJ Perenara, Beauden Barrett, Ryan Crotty . Referee: Nigel Owens (WAL) Putting a finger on the reasons why proved difficult. Brown talked about some ‘momentum-shifts’ which went against England. He conceded that ‘maybe’ his fumble from Kyle Eastmond’s pass which should have created a second try was a significant factor, although he pointed to his efforts to stem the black tide at the other end. Whatever the causes, his over- riding message was sheer dejection at the outcome. ‘One reason Stuart (Lancaster) picks the players he does is we are all competitive,’ said Brown. ‘I probably show it more than some of the other guys who keep it to themselves, but we’re all competitive and we want to win, so we are annoyed and disappointed.’ In reference to the next instalment of the QBE series, against the wounded Springboks this Saturday, Brown added: ‘We have to get over this quickly because we’ve got another massive Test next week. But at the moment I’m going to sulk because we came up short.’ In reality, despite the distorting effect of a late England penalty try, the harsh truth is that the national team came up some distance short this time.

The England team gather together to celebrate the opening try against the All Blacks . New Zealand were commanding. They squeezed and suffocated their rivals — playing the conditions expertly, while England floundered in their own half; undermined by a lack of composure and kicking deficiencies. Lancaster’s men could not escape the world champions’ grip, even when they had a numerical advantage while Dane Coles was in the sin bin. The English party line afterwards was that this contest swung on a third quarter dominated by the Kiwis but, in truth, Steve Hansen’s team had recovered from a sluggish start and found some rhythm before the break. The home side were still under the cosh after the hour mark, as they conceded one penalty that Beauden Barrett squandered and another he sent through the posts. Then came another illustration of the gulf between these teams. The All Blacks’ 72nd-minute try, scored by Charlie Faumuina, was an exhibition of wet-weather rugby as they drove and passed at close quarters until they were over the line. That summed up the clinical edge that New Zealand possess. Earlier, shortly after May justified his selection by scorching past Conrad Smith and Israel Dagg to score, he leapt to gather a bouncing kick in the opposition 22, but was unable to release Owen Farrell. Aaron Cruden dives on the  line to score the try that brought the two teams level early in the first half . Cruden takes his kick during the QBE International match  at Twickenham on a soggy Saturday in London . Owen Farrell takes a penalty  during their clash with New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon . While it is harsh to highlight such a missed opportunity, in the same situation the All Blacks would take the chance. It was the same scenario moments later, when Brown dropped Eastmond’s pass. England will not win these contests until they develop that killer instinct. Dave Attwood, the Bath lock who was magnificent on his return to the starting XV, conceded said: ‘We talk about being clean and clinical in our half and in the second half there were too many instances when we didn’t execute well enough. 'If we’re going to become world champions, we need to execute an awful lot better.’ Talk of ‘positives’ after defeat conveys a jarring message that the result is not the be-all and end-all. A spell of pressure for New Zealand saw Richie McCaw gather the ball and drive over the line at Twickenham . McCaw dives over the line to score a try despite the best efforts of England's Dylan Hartley . Yet May’s finish was dazzling, Eastmond impressed, Brad Barritt was strong and Chris Robshaw put in a herculean shift. The lineout was immaculate while the scrum reserves earned the penalty try which made the scoreline falsely respectable. Post-match speculation about a World Cup final between these nations next year seemed fanciful. The development stage stretches on, as does the losing run, which now stands at four Tests — albeit all against the Kiwis. Next up are South Africa, stung by defeat in Dublin.

"A formerly obese man has admitted joining his local slimming club was one of the best things he's ever done. Not only has it improved his health, it has also transformed his love life as he met his wife-to-be at the weekly meetings. Rob Poulton, 53, from Dudley, West Midlands, said he had given up hope of ever finding love before he joined Weight Watchers last year. He signed up for their weekly weighs-in and followed their diet plan after his GP told him he could die if he did not lose weight. Transformed: At nearly 23st (left) Rob's weight was causing serious health concerns but now he has lost 9st . Found love: Kerry and Rob met at the slimming group, originally bonding over weight-loss tips . It was at the meetings that he met Kerry Cadman, 42, from Rowley Regis, after she asked for his tips on dieting. Rob, a full-time carer, said: 'Joining the group has been one of the best things I have done. I hadn't had a relationship for 27 years, and had given up hope to tell the truth.' Recalling how he met Kerry, he explained: 'Kerry said she was having trouble losing weight and asked if we could meet for a coffee to talk about it. 'I had been in the group for around a year before I even spoke to her. I was very shy when I joined, I saw it was a room full of women so I just sat at the back and kept quiet.' Since then the pair have lost 12st 5lb between them and last month Rob popped the question. Rob's battle with the bulge started when he was 18 and he got a job in a bakery. Surrounded by tempting treats, he would snack on cakes daily and even started eating cream straight from the spout. When he tipped the scales at 22st 12lb, his doctor warned him he was a borderline diabetic and on the verge of a serious liver disease. It was then Rob knew he had to take action and joined his local Weight Watchers group in February last year. As a result of following their advice, he shed 9st 1lb in 18 months. He ditched his old diet of takeaway curries in favour of fresh fruit and vegetables and shrunk from a 50in waist to 34in. Slimmed down: Kerry, who was 15st (left) is now enjoying her new figure, weighing 11st 10lb (right) Down on one knee: Rob proposed to Kerry last month at their Weight Watcher's meeting hall (left) and the newly slimmed down pair hope to tie the knot next year . After sticking to the same plan and with the support of her husband-to-be, Kerry lost 3st 4lb. She was 15st when she joined and is now 11st 10lb. She said before she met Rob, she struggled to shift the extra pounds after snacking every day on chocolate and crisps. She initially claimed free check-ins at the club by running their shop selling Weight Watchers products. It was only when she decided to sit in on the classes that she met Rob and finally was able to slim down from a size 20 to a svelte 14. The grandmother-of-two said: 'We started going for coffees and it just went from there. I found he was a nice person, he is very thoughtful. 'I have always struggled with my weight, I was a yo-yo dieter, I always struggled to keep the weight off. 'But then Rob came into my life, he has just always been there for me, kept me strong when I was struggling and that meant I could keep going.' Exercise convert: Rob's waist has shrunk from a 50in  to 34in and he now cycles 40 to 50 miles a week . Shared success: Rob (left receiving a Gold Certificate from Weight Watchers) and Kerry supported each other through their weight loss journey . As well as following a healthy diet, Rob is now also an exercise convert. He cycles 40 to 50 miles a week, is a regular on the golf course, and goes to the gym at least twice a week. In August he did a 40 mile cycle ride to raise nearly £600 for the Acorns Children's Hospice, which has a centre in Walsall.","Rob joined Weight Watchers after  GP told him he could die due to his size .

"Ed Miliband said the idea that British Jews could be fearful of living in the UK was no longer unthinkable . Jewish parents are beginning to fear for their children’s future in Britain for the first time in a generation, Ed Miliband has claimed. The Labour leader said ‘for the first time in their lifetime’ middle-aged Jews were scared about the rise of anti-Semitism in the UK. Mr Miliband, himself the son of Jewish refugees, hit out amid growing concern over a spate of anti-Jewish attacks. Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have been on the end of vile anti-Semitic attacks, sparking calls for a crackdown on internet abuse. The Jewish Community Security Trust recorded more than 300 anti-Semitics incidents in July alone. This is the highest monthly total it has ever recorded and a 400 per cent increase since July last year. Mr Miliband said Britain had a proud record of ‘diversity, tolerance and respect’. But he added: ‘In the past few months, Britain's Jewish community has expressed growing concern about a rise in anti-Semitism. ‘There have been violent assaults, the desecration and damage of Jewish property, anti-Semitic graffiti, hate-mail and online abuse.’ Mr Miliband said the recent spate of incidents should serve as a ‘wake-up call for anyone who thought the scourge of anti-Semitism had been defeated’. He said the idea of ‘Jewish families fearful of living here in Britain’ was no longer unthinkable. The Labour leader said: ‘Some have told me how, for the first time in their lifetime, they are scared for their children’s future in our country. ‘Others have expressed a general unease that this rise in anti-Semitism could signal that something has changed – or is changing – in Britain.’ Mr Miliband said the concerns had to be taken ‘very seriously’. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband today raised fears that anti semitism, such as the attacks on Jewish graves in France, are becoming common in Britain . He said: ‘We need a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism in the UK and to reaffirm our revulsion to it in all its forms. ‘The Labour Party has always been at the forefront of fighting intolerance. We will continue to be so.’ Mr Miliband said politicians needed to use ‘calm and responsible language’ when discussing Israel. A zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms here in Britain will go hand-in-hand with the pursuit of peace in the Middle East as a key focus of the next Labour government’s foreign policy.","'For the first time' British Jews are scared for their families, warns Miliband .

"Controversial airport 'strip-search' full body scanners are to be scrapped after they failed to get approval from European bosses. Experts feared the 'naked' body scanners, which use X-ray technology to show up hidden explosives or weapons, could emit harmful levels of cancer-causing radiation. The move in Europe begs the question -- why are they still allowed in the United States? Hundreds of the devices are in use at at least 68 airports across the nation. Controversial: A demonstration of the scanners that European bosses have failed to give approval of. A full body scan is shown, left, and a screen showing the results of the scan, right . New trials of the device, which . display a 'naked' image of the person being scanned - were blocked by . the European Commission last November. But Manchester Airport, the only airport in Europe using the $130,000 machines, was told it could continue using them for another year. Now, after the machines have come to the end of their three year trial, European Commission chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use. EC bosses eventually declared the risk was 'close to zero' in a report in May -- and Manchester airport expected the technology would be approved for permanent use. But bosses were left waiting for the green light and now say they have been left with no option but to axe the 16 security machines because Brussels legislation does not allow security trials to exceed a three-year period. As Manchester airport introduced the scanners as part of a security pilot in October 2009, they will have to scrap the machines at the end of next month. The scanners have been controversial among flyers since they were introduced in force at US airports in 2010. The Transportation Security Administration began installing hundreds of the devices after the foiled Christmas Day 2009 attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound passenger jet with an underwear bomb. The TSA insists that research shows the devices do no emit harmful levels of radiation, but the issues is far from settled in the minds of many flyers -- some of whom opt for full-body pat-downs instead of passing through the machines. Last month, Long Island Rep Steve Israel said greater study and oversight of the machines was needed -- especially in cases when the broke down . In a red-tape wrangle, $1.8m will be splashed out on new 'privacy-friendly' machines at Manchest and the recruitment of an extra 55 full-time security officers, who will manually frisk passengers. The new scanners will use radio-frequency technology instead of X-ray radiation. American use: More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S . Russell Craig, spokesman for the airport, said: 'We’ve been talking to passengers literally every week and our security staff and overwhelmingly in August it was 100% thumbs-up to security at Manchester Airport. 'We’ve had visits from airport and governments from all over the world to see how we do it.' 'Today, we’re just kind of standing around scratching our heads wondering why a trial that was popular with everybody, that everybody approved of, just never got the green light from Europe.' The report from the EC's Committee in May said radiation doses were 'very low' compared with other sources such as cosmic radiation received during flights. But it did add that the long-term effects, such as cancer risks, could not be 'entirely excluded'. European Commission: EC chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use despite a report declaring the risk was 'close to zero' American academic Dr David Brenner . said he believed the scanner could deliver up to 20 times more radiation . to the skin than previously thought - potentially increasing the risk . of skin cancer. Fears were . also raised that the scanners were an invasion of privacy and some . passengers and religious groups had questioned their use. The . scanners were introduced at Manchester airport in a security crackdown . after incidents such as the attempted 'underwear bomb' terror plot in . 2009. The airport said around 10 passengers were unable to board their flight after refusing to pass through the scanners, known as 'back scatter' machines. The passenger screening programme at airports in the U.S has had . frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same . way. In reaction to this, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has . replaced the machines, which give a detailed outline of individuals' figures, for a more generic shape. On the updated machine, the passenger and the TSA worker both view the . image together which lights up on screen if it detects a problem. The need for a separate TSA officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required. The new images are said to be 'very generic' and 'focus on the privacy of the passenger'. The images of passengers are not stored or printed and cannot be . transmitted. They are deleted from the system once they have been . viewed. Those who fly are not required by law to pass through AIT screening - . but if they opt out, they will receive alternative screening, including a . physical pat-down. The TSA has continued to . defend the safety of the X-ray devices, saying they expose passengers to . the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane. They were used at Heathrow but . scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy. They have also been . tested in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and Holland. Research . has suggested that, despite the low radiation dosage, that because of . the large number of scanners in the U.S., hundreds of passengers a year . could get cancer. When there were 250 scanners in the U.S. last year, research suggested up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer. Earlier . this year it was reported that more than 600 Advanced Imaging . Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 . airports across the U.S. The . first X-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by Steven W Smith. He . sold the technology and rights to Rapiscan Systems, which now . manufactures and distributes the device. Fears . about the health risks were raised in the U.S. as far back as 1998 when . the machine known as the Secure 1000 was evaluated by a panel of . radiation safety experts brought together by the Food and Drug . Administration. They all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be X-rayed unless there is a medical purpose. The machine’s inventor told panelists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come. Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007. In the U.S. the Transportation Security Administration scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus travelers' privacy when they were first brought in in autumn 2010. The machines have also been installed in some courtrooms. In response, New Jersey's legislature issued a resolution urging Congress to review the programme. Study group Electronic Privacy Information Center then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at U.S. airports pending an independent review. In February 2011, a trial of new 'non-intrusive' body scanners started at Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C. before they were rolled out permanently in July last yer. New York's Newark Liberty International airport followed in September last year, where more than eight million passengers boarded planes in 2010.","Scanners use X-ray technology to show up hidden explosives or weapons .

"Villagers in southern China are suffering a crippling disease causing their hands and feet to slowly deform, twist out of shape and erupt with blisters – leaving doctors baffled. The bones in their limbs seem to be twisting, and in some cases, painful pustules are also appearing on their skin. Some of villagers affected have been suffering from the disease for years and have been left unable to work because of their painful joints. Villagers in southern China are suffering a crippling disease causing their hands and feet to slowly deform, twist out of shape and erupt with blisters . Many of the villagers have been left unable to work because of their painful joints . Many of the villagers have sought medical help, but doctors are baffled as to what is causing the symptoms . Medics sent to the village, in the Yalong township, southern China, identified 20 people suffering from the bizarre disease . The most popular theory is the villagers could be suffering from rare condition called Kashin-Beck disease, also known as ‘Big Bone Disease’. This is a disorder which causes sufferers to slowly develop stiff, deformed joints and shortened limbs. They become short in stature due to the death of growth plates of bones and joint cartilage. It usually occurs in children. Occurring in China, Siberia and North Korea, it is caused mainly by lack of the elements iodine or selenium in the water or food. Although toxic in large amounts,  small amounts of these elements is vital in humans for a healthy functioning body. Treatment for the disease alleviates the symptoms but cannot cure it. Chinese and Russian orthopaedists have carried out surgery on deformed joints, and physical therapy can help with moving and joint pain. Medics sent to help the villagers have been left stumped, but the most popular theory is they could be suffering from rare condition called Kashin-Beck disease, also known as ‘Big Bone Disease’. Occurring in China, Siberia and North Korea, it is caused mainly by lack of the element selenium in the water or food. Although toxic in large amounts, a small amount of selenium is vital in humans for a healthy functioning body. Health workers sent to help the villagers, in the Yalong township, on the outskirts of the city of Hechi in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, identified 20 people suffering from the bizarre disease. In most cases it is the men in the village who are affected, although there are also some women with the condition. Health care worker Doctor Li Wu, 41, said: 'In many cases this doesn't only just look bad, it also significantly affects the person's ability to work. 'For people in a rural community who have to carry out a lot of manual work it is a disaster.' For example, Luo Guiyu, 38, can now only do light housework after first discovering she was suffering from the problem 12 years ago. She said many of the villagers had sought medical help but nobody knew what was wrong with them. She said: 'Many of my neighbours have been to different health centres and hospitals but nobody seems to know what the problem is, although it's great that the experts have now come here to try and get to the bottom of it.' Doctor Wu and his team have been carrying out tests on the water and on the food that the villagers have been growing in the hope of confirming that it is Kashin-Beck disease the villagers are suffering from. There is no cure for Kashin-Beck disease, but surgery or physical therapy can help with the symptoms. However, tests are still being carried out and the experts say it is too early to say whether the rare condition, usually found in children, is definitely the cause. They are hoping they will be able to prevent further outbreaks and offer some alleviation to those already infected. Medics have been left stumped as to what is causing the symptoms - but the most popular theory is they are suffering from a rare form of Kashin-Beck syndrome, caused by a lack of the element selenium in the water .

"A mother will stand trial on charges of killing her seven-week-old daughter by placing her in a microwave oven and letting her burn to death for two minutes. As well as the murder accusation against Ka Yang, 30, from California, Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Eugene Balanon also found enough evidence to support a special allegation that she tortured her daughter, Mirabelle. Prosecutors ruled out the death penalty, but Yang faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of the murder of her child. Prison: Kang Ya faces life in prison without parole . The mother-of-four has been held since June after investigators determined her baby died of 'extensive thermal injuries' after being placed in a microwave on March 17. Mirabelle was jut seven-weeks-old when she was placed in a microwave by her mother . A pathologist testified during Tuesday's hearing that the radiation from the microwave essentially cooked the child's stomach and small intestine. Yang's defense attorney, Linda Parisi said that it was due to her client's history of seizures - which she has been suffering from for more than six years - that made her put her own baby in the microwave. She will argue during the murder trial that Yang was in the middle of a seizure and did not know what she was doing. At the time, Yang claimed she 'had a seizure and did not know what happened after that'. When they happen, she 'sees white light and then trees before hand', according to her family. Deputy District Attorney Chris Ore suggested there was no seizure when Yang inserted Mirabelle Thao-Lo into the microwave, and points at the string of lies she told police after her daughter's death. One of the things she told detectives was that she dropped her baby on a space heater when she had a seizure. Attorney: Linda Parisi, left, representing Ka Yang, who is facing charges for allegedly killing her daughter, leaves the courtroom with Yang's mother, Chuoa Yang . Scene: Yang told police she dropped her baby on to a space heater while she was having a seizure . During the three-hour hearing, during which the judge refused Parisi's request to dismiss the special circumstance allegation that Yang tortured the girl, a forensic pathologist testified the baby suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of her body. Dr Gregory Reiber said the most serious burn appeared to be a radiation . burn that penetrated her internal organs and 'cooked through' to her . stomach and small intestine. He said they were consistent with microwave exposure. He said the baby would have suffered from severe pain throughout the exposure. The prosecution allege she placed the child in the microwave because she was being irritable and fussy and holding her back from her work. A trial date has not yet been set. Yang, 30, was married at the time of her arrest and has at least two older children. She worked for a local architectural firm.","Ka Yang to stand trial for baby Mirabelle's murder .

"Drinkers should have three alcohol-free days a week if they want to avoid the risk of liver disease, warn Britain’s most eminent doctors. Current official guidance on healthy drinking limits is ‘extremely dangerous’ and must be rewritten – because it implies that drinking every day is fine, the Royal College of Physicians said. Government advice states men should drink no more than four units a day and women no more than three. New guidelines: Leading doctors now say drinkers should have at least three alcohol-free days a week . But this must also address the risks of daily drinking, doctors insisted. They told MPs the risk of liver disease, alcohol dependence and serious illness increases if people drink every day rather than taking time off. They also urged Ministers to consider imposing stricter guidelines on pensioners – perhaps as little as seven units a week for older women and 11 for older men. One unit is the equivalent of one small glass of wine (125ml) or half a pint of lager. Limits: Government advice states men should drink no more than four units per day and women no more than three . Older people’s bodies are more affected by regular drinking, which puts them at risk of dementia, depression and falls, they said. Yet pensioners are currently given the same guidelines as all adults. In their submission to MPs on the Commons science and technology committee, the doctors said: ‘Government guidelines should recognise that hazardous drinking has two components: frequency of drinking and amount of drinking. ‘To ignore either of these components is scientifically unjustified. ‘A simple addition would remedy this – namely a recommendation that to remain within safe limits people have three alcohol-free days a week.’ They added: ‘The implied sanctioning of a pattern of regular daily drinking is potentially extremely dangerous. The RCP disputes the claim that drinking every day will not accrue a significant health risk. ‘Frequency is an important risk factor for development of alcohol dependency and alcoholic liver disease.’ More than 16,000 people die from liver disease, usually caused by excessive drinking, every year in the UK. It is Britain’s fifth biggest killer and the only major cause of death increasing year-on-year. Twice as many people die of it now than in 1991 and rates have soared by 13 per cent since 2005. The British Liver Trust says liver disease is the biggest cause of premature death for women, and the second only to heart attacks for men. The first drinking guidelines in 1987 – which were written by the RCP – stated that men should drink no more than 21 units a week and women no more than 14. On top of this, everyone should take two or three days off a week. Doctors are angry that reforms to the advice in 1995 dropped this reference to alcohol-free days. ‘This in effect appeared to sanction daily or near-daily drinking, one of the key risk factors for alcohol-related harm and dependency,’ they said. ‘If the daily limit of four units was drunk with no drink-free days, this would be the equivalent of 28 units per week; a 30 per cent increase on the RCP’s guidelines.’ Habitual: Young regular drinkers are particularly at risk of developing liver disease later in life . The paper added: ‘Further studies have shown an increased risk of cirrhosis for those who drink daily or near-daily compared to those who drink periodically or intermittently.’ Young regular drinkers were particularly at risk, it said. A 2009 study showed increases in UK liver deaths ‘are the result of daily or near-daily heavy drinking, not episodic or binge drinking. This regular drinking pattern is discernable at an early age’, the paper said. Government experts expect the cost of treating people with liver disease will soar by 50 per cent in four years to more than £2billion. Middle-class women are particularly at risk of daily drinking as they often have a glass or two of wine after work, followed by more at the weekend. Lower limits should be considered for older people, as even modest levels of alcohol consumption can have a more profound effect on their bodies ‘due to physiological changes associated with ageing’, the paper said. ‘There is concern current guidelines are not appropriate for older people,’ it added. Sir Ian Gilmore, RCP special adviser on alcohol, said: ‘We recommend a safe limit of 0-21 units a week for men and 0-14 units a week for women provided the total amount is not drunk in one or two bouts and that there are two to three alcohol-free days a week. ‘At these levels, most individuals are unlikely to come to harm.’ In June, a Royal College of Psychiatrists report called for a limit of 11 units a week for men aged over 65 and seven for women of this age. The RCP quoted these suggested limits but did not explicitly endorse them.","More than 16,000 people die from liver disease every year in the UK .

"A cafe manager who displayed five bagels in the style of Olympics rings was stunned to be raided by ‘community wardens’ from the council.

They proclaimed it a breach of laws brought in to prevent businesses exploiting the 2012 Games unless they are official sponsors. O-no: Ring-shaped bagels at the House cafe in Camberwell, south London was told to take down the Olympic-themed display by southwark Borough Council . Pride: The bagels were put up ahead of the Olympic torch relay . Despite no one from the Olympics, the Government or any official sponsors complaining about the display of bread, the cafe had the book thrown at it by Southwark Council in South London. Two ‘community wardens’ swooped on the House Cafe and Gallery, in Camberwell, within 20 minutes of manager David Adams putting up the display. They claimed that putting the circular buns on show breached copyright rules. One customer said: ‘They were being quite aggressive to David, ordering him to take them down immediately and threatening him with court and fines. They said there would be very serious consequences if he did not obey them. ‘It was just some bread hanging in a window, for goodness sake!

Closer look: Images from the trailer for Aroused  which premiered last night in Los Angeles . The film follows 16 actresses, including Allie Haze, pictured, as they also take part in a photoshoot for Deborah Anderson's Aroused Project . Protection: Many in the porn industry say that condoms are unnecessary because the industry already conducts regular STD checks and that prolonged condom use causes chafing, tearing and increased risk of disease.They also say that condoms hurt their profit and drive the industry either out of LA or underground, creating even more unsafe conditions. A new law was passed in November 2012 requiring that Los Angeles porn companies ensure their actors use condoms. While over 80 percent of the U.S. porn industry is based in Los Angeles, some productions moved to other states or countries due to the condom mandate. Contracting diseases and viruses . There have been eight HIV cases among adult film performers since 2004.  In 2011, porn production halted for a week after an actor tested positive for HIV.  In August 2012, there was a 10-day moratorium on porn filming because of a syphilis outbreak among actors. A study in November found that LA porn stars have significantly higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than legal prostitutes working in Nevada. Payment: Porn is a multibillion-dollar industry but the wages of porn stars vary greatly. $150 (£97) per scene, according to a documentary Louis Theroux made on the subject. The Los Angeles Times reported that the pay rates for a female actress performing male and female scenes were $700 to $1,000 (£450-£640). Famous porn star Ron Jeremy said in 2003: 'Girls can easily make $100-250k (£25k -£160k)  per year, plus stuff on the side like strip shows and appearances. The average male makes $40,000 (£25K) a year.' Pornstars do not get a pension or health insurance. But she also found that all of the stars she met have contracted sexually-transmitted diseases from their work. Most of the actresses said they were . concerned about how others view their profession and also worried that . it could impede future job or romantic prospects.

'You don’t have to be an exceptional character in any direction to do porn. It’s a basic enterprise; anyone can do it. 'So when people expect that there’s some crazy interesting story or character behind every persona, it’s just rarely the case.' Anderson said she hoped her documentary and book will spotlight the humanity of these women and the sensuality of their work. 'They’ve . chosen to do a job that I personally wouldn’t want to do, but the fact . that they do it and they have a very business-minded aspect to that, . within them; they’re very powerful women so there’s something to be said . about that,' she told ScreenPicks. 'The . girls that I met I feel know what they’re doing and they understand the . nature of the business of sex, and that is what they are doing, and . they’re good at it.' Many of the actresses . featured in Aroused attended the film's premiere last night at the . Landmark Theatre in Los Angeles and signed copies of the coffee-table . book afterwards. But the . film did not find favour with LA Times critic Sheri Linden, who said . Aroused 'spends a lot of time admiring the surface' rather than digging . deep.

Stars: Phoebe Price, left, and Kayden Kross, right, are adult film stars featured in Aroused . Linden said the interviews with actresses provided 'not always convincing declarations of self-awareness and inner strength' and that Anderson's discussion with an industry agent was more insightful than anything else in the film. Last year, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a female porn performer's earnings in the Californian industry can range from $800 for a sex scene with another woman, $1000 for a scene with a man and up to $4,000 for more adventurous exploits. Dan Miller, the executive editor of industry magazine XBIZ told the newspaper that the most popular 250 women can expect to get regular work, filming between 100-150 scenes a year. Agent Mark Spiegler said that the average earnings of female performers have halved from about $100,000 a year to $50,000 in the last decade, though the highest earners can take home $350,000.","Deborah Anderson filmed the adult film stars for documentary Aroused .

"The Great Australian Sex Census has revealed that half of Aussies have shared a nude selfie and one in three people have made a sex tape . Aussies prove to be a raunchy bunch according to the latest sex census, which revealed that half of Australians have shared a nude snap and one in three people have recorded themselves in the act. The Great Australian Sex Census knows no boundaries when it comes to asking intimate questions, inquiring about everything from fetishes and masturbation to penis sizes, and even wandering eyes. According to this year's results, the survey found that the majority of Australians admit they would jump into bed with someone as early as the first date. When asked 'how many dates do you have with a person before you have sex with them?', 29 per cent of respondents answered only one, the answer being the most common one given by males. Women proved to be the more conservative gender when meeting a possible partner, most saying they generally required 'three or more' dates before sharing their bed, the response receiving 26.5 per cent of votes. The promiscuous revelations continued when respondents were asked how many people they have had sexual intercourse with over their entire lifetime. Surprisingly, the answer '21 or more' came a close second with 26.3 per cent of votes. It only just missed out on the top spot, which went to the answer '1-5' partners, by 1.1 per cent. Clearly embracing the age of technology, one in every two Australians fessed up to having sent someone a naked photo of themselves via their mobile -  with more women than men having sent a nude selfie, at 52.2 per cent compared to 44.8 percent. Sex tapes were also not out of the question with 30.3 per cent of people having already made one and a further 18.7 per cent of people admitting it's on their to-do list. In the fetishes category, threesomes were on 25.9 per cent of people's bucket lists, while 'rough sex' was the most commonly recorded fetish - more popular among women whom more than 19 per cent of respondents put before BDSM and role play. In terms of turn-offs, fake boobs received a scathing reception, with more than half of respondents admitting they actually turned them off. When asked 'how many dates do you have with a person before you have sex with them?', 29 per cent of respondents answered only one . The survey also reinforced some of the bedroom's gender stereotypes, including that the majority of women 'find it extremely difficult and often do not orgasm', admitted by 20.5 per cent of females. In contrast, more than 60 per cent of male respondents said they often had an orgasm within five minutes or longer. It was only fitting then, that more than one third of females were found to have faked an orgasm, while more than 70 per cent of males never have. Where each genders' minds wander during masturbation also proved to vary, with 39 per cent of men admitting they think of porn while women largely answered that they think about their partner.","The Great Australian Sex Census half of Aussies have shared a nude selfie .

"A mother who shot dead her two children before committing suicide on Monday had reportedly taken her ex-husband to court for financial support after she was forced to sell her father's watch to pay for gas and groceries. Jennifer Berman, 48, killed her son Alexander, 16, and 15-year-old daughter Jacqueline at their foreclosed West Palm Beach property in Florida after sending an email to her ex saying she was going to 'do harm' to herself and others. The children's father and Mrs Berman's ex-husband Richard Berman, 51, found the bodies when he drove to the home immediately after receiving the email. Mr Berman, a prominent realtor in luxury homes, and his wife divorced in December. Mrs Berman claimed in court documents that she was struggling financially, taking 12-hour overnight shifts as a nurse to make ends meet. The mother and her two children were due to move out of their home in the exclusive, historically-protected El Cid neighborhood next month. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jennifer Berman (right) emailed her ex-husband on Monday to say that she intended to 'do harm'.

Richard Berman (second right) with his son Alexander and daughter Jacqueline along with two other adults. In a financial affadavit Mr Berman listed his monthly expenses as $4,700 a month but an income of $2,888 . Police were alerted by Mr Berman to the tragic multiple shooting shortly after 8am. Investigators said the deaths are being treated as a murder-suicide after all three died from gunshot wounds. Mr Berman was not considered a suspect, police said. Family friend Brian McManus told WSVN that Mrs Berman had recently been going through a difficult time in her life. Mr McManus said: 'Going through a divorce, foreclosure, a lot of that stuff which, it's an upsetting thing when you're going through a divorce and having to sell the beautiful house in this neighborhood, and it's just she just seemed like she had been upset lately. 'You can't fathom, you can't understand what's going on in someone's head for things like that to happen.' Mr Berman, pictured at a party in May last year, had recently divorced from his wife. Court records show they were both in financial difficulty after the split . Last year, Mrs Berman had also petitioned a judge to remove her husband from the home because of 'emotional abuse'. The family had previously lived at another home in the historic and exclusive El Cid neighborhood which sold for $1.2million in 2010. Mr Berman is a well-known realtor in the area and deals exclusively in luxury homes. The home in which the murder suicide took place had previously belonged to Jennifer Berman's mother. The property had been in foreclosure since 2010 but was recently sold. The mother and her two children were due to move out in February. Mrs Berman had been working 12-hour shifts as a night nurse for an elderly man because she needed the money, a friend, who refused to be identified, told the Palm Beach Post. Alexander and Jacqueline Berman were accomplished musicians and attended the Dreyfoos School of the Arts in Palm Beach, Florida . 'The truth will come out': A friend, speaking for Mr Berman, said: 'Richard has been painted as a terrible father who did not care about his children.That is not true. That is so not true' Bloody scene: The Florida home where Jennifer Berman, Alexander Berman and Jacqueline Berman were found dead on January 13 in West Palm Beach by their horrified father. The five-bedroom home was in the process of being sold for $590,000 - but court records show there were two mortgages on the home totaling almost $700,000. Past times: Mr Berman used to be successful but was hit hard by the housing crash. However, court records show he gave his wife the family home in the divorce and paid $600-a-month child support . Mrs Berman lost her divorce lawyer because she could not afford to pay him last year. According to the Palm Beach Post, she asked a judge to make her husband pay alimony and child support, claiming she was forced to sell her late father's watch to buy gas and groceries. Court records from the attorney's of Mrs Berman claimed: 'The husband has not paid the mortgage on the former marital home during the entire time of the dissolution of marriage proceeding. He has not contributed to the support of the wife or of the minor children. 'In fact, he has refused to pay for toilet paper, buy food and supplies for himself and keeps them where the wife and children cannot access them.' The Bermans married in 1992 in Miami. Mr Berman first filed for divorce in 2008 but the couple reconciled. Mrs Berman filed for divorced in August 2012 but the couple remained living under the same roof for a while. Last year, Mrs Berman allegedly asked a judge to remove her husband from the home, according to the Palm Beach Post, because of 'extreme emotional abuse and fighting (verbal) in home'. The couple shared equal custody of their two teenage children. Jacqueline Berman, 15, was shot dead by her mother alongside her older brother at their Florida home on Monday . Neighbor Marian Sklodowski said that Mrs Berman had recently appeared 'upset, disappointed and confused'. 'You can notice that, from the face, from the eyes, something was strange in her face,' she added. The teens attended the Dreyfoos School of Arts and were promising musicians, their devastated friends said. Close friends and fellow musicians . said they will remember Alexander Berman for being an accomplished cello . player while his sister Jacqueline was extremely talented at the violin . and a straight A student. Grief counselors were on hand at the school to help classmates cope with the tragedy. 'At . first it was just disbelief, going through stages of grief all at once.

"Are you forever misplacing stuff like your keys, TV remote, wallet, cats or children? Help is at hand from a new invention that could make sure you can always locate these essential items - as long as you can find your phone. A U.S. tech firm has come up with Bluetooth stickers that can be stuck to your valuables then detected by a smartphone app to help you find them. Best of all, the app doesn't merely set off a buzzer to help you locate them by ear but includes a radar-like function to help you find your way your valuable possessions. Small but easy to find: The Stick-N-Find stickers are the perfect for solution for those of us who find it difficult to keep track of our various possessions, valuables and loved ones . About the size of a 10p piece, the Stick-N-Find stickers can attach via adhesive to valued possessions, pets or youngsters and send a low-energy Bluetooth signal with a range of about 100ft. So far the team behind it have developed apps compatible with both iOS and Android devices with a range of features to help users track down their stickered-up possessions when they go missing. The first function the app offers is a simple radar screen that approximates the distance - but not yet the location - of all the paired Stick-N-Find stickers in range. Unfortunately the technology does not yet allow the app to determine which direction the lost items are in, so users have to start walking while watching the screen to see whether the device they are hunting for gets closer. A second feature, which the designers call the Virtual Leash, allows users to set an alarm to sound whenever a sticker moves a predetermined distance from your phone. This feature could be used to keep track of your children at the playground, for example, or to remind you if you're getting ready to leave the house for work and forget to pick up your keys. The feature can even be reversed to help you to remember your phone by, for example, getting the sticker on your keys to buzz should you carry them too far from the gadget. A third feature called Find It helps to locate any items that are out of range by setting an alarm to sound as soon as they appear on the app's radar, allowing you to begin using it to track down the lost item as soon as you are nearby. The stickers themselves will keep going for up to a year on a watch-type battery. Range of features: The Stick-N-Find smartphone app includes a radar-like screen and Virtual Leash function . They include buzzers and flashing lights that can be activated remotely to help users track them down and one smartphone can be paired with as many as 20. The Stick-N-Find location stickers are . the brainchild of John Mitts, an engineer at SSI America which is a . product development company specialising in small electronics. He said: 'Just like everyone we lose stuff all the time so, we thought, why not design an ultra-small Bluetooth connected sticker you can stick on any device, person or animal so you can easily find them? 'So we came up with Stick-N-Find. Stick-N-Find is an ultra-small sticker with built in Bluetooth low energy with a range of 100ft, about the size of a U.S. quarter and with a battery life that lasts about a year. 'The Stick-N-Find can be paged producing both sound and light, helping you find things easily, even in the dark. 'You can stick it anywhere, like your TV remote control for instance, so you can always find it when it gets lost. 'You can stick it on your keys, your dog or cat's collar, and you can even stick it to your kids' shoes or backpacks so you can easily monitor where they are in a store or on a playground.' SSI America are appealing for funding via Indiegogo to bring their new concept to market. So far they have been promised $57,132 of their $72,000 goal, with 42 days left in their campaign.","Stick-N-Find stickers attach to valuables and sync with your smartphone to help you find them .

"General Wesley Clark is divorcing his wife after 46 years citing her ‘general indignities’ despite facing claims he is having an affair with a woman half his age, MailOnline can reveal today. In court papers seen by MailOnline, 68-year-old former NATO Supreme Commander blames his wife for the breakdown of his marriage, filing for divorce on the grounds of ‘general indignities’. Astonishingly, the court papers list Wesley Kanne Clark, Sr as the plaintiff and his wife, Gertrude Kingston Clark, as the defendant. Scroll down for video . Retired General Wesley Clark blames his wife Gertrude for their marriage breakdown, despite claims that he is having an affair with 30-year-old Shauna Mei . Social butterfly: Clark's alleged new girlfriend is a fixture on the New York social scene, pictured with Murdoch's soon-to-be ex-wife Wendi Deng, left, and friend, right . Video source www.JingLiUS.com . According to Arkansas law general indignities includes various degrees of intolerable treatment. It includes the following example list of offenses set down by the Arkansas Supreme Court: ‘Rudeness, vulgarity, unmerited reproach, haughtiness, contempt, contumeliousness, studied neglect, intentional incivility, injury, manifest disdain, abusive language, malignant ridicule and every other plain manifestation of settled hate, alienation, and estrangement’. Under Arkansas law, Clark also has to provide witnesses that his wife was guilty of such behavior. Legal experts in the state said general indignities is the most common reason given for divorces. It is comparable to the cause of irreconcilable differences that others states allow couples to cite when filing for a divorce. The petition states the couple have to settle 'real and personal property rights' Intolerable treatment: Many will find it astonishing that Clark is blaming his wife's 'general indignities' for the break up of their 46-year marriage . Arkansas is one of the few states where a reason as to be provided to show that a marriage can be ended. He is said to stay with Mei, 30, when visiting New York . Clark, a former Democratic Presidential candidate, filed for divorce on September 7th 2012 in Pulaski County, Arkansas. The petition came six months after he met 30 year old fashion executive Shauna Mei at conference in Carlsbad, California. The pair attended a symposium organised by Deepak Chopra. Clark was one of the guest speakers. They were later photographed together in the same month the divorce petition was filed when they attended the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Clark is understood to have moved out of the family's $560,000 home in Little Rock, Arkansas, soon after filing for divorce. He is said to stay with Mei, 30, when visiting New York but lives in a rented condo in Little Rock when in the state. The divorce is said to have taken his wife, who likes to be called Gert, completely by surprise. The couple have moved 32 times during their marriage as Gertrude followed her husband loyally around the world on his military postings. A close friend told Mail Online: ‘Gert is absolutely shattered by the divorce. She never saw it coming. ‘She is a very devout Catholic and the thought of  divorce is abhorrent to her. ‘She has been a loyal wife to General Clark and followed him where ever his career has taken him. She feels utterly betrayed by this.’ The court papers list Wesley Kanne Clark, Sr as the plaintiff and his wife, Gertrude Kingston Clark, as the defendant . Clark and his wife were married in Brooklyn, New York in June 1967, according to the divorce petition. They had met at a dance in New York while Clark was on leave from military duties. She was by his side during his unsuccessful bid to gain the Democratic Party nomination in 2004. During the failed 2004 election campaign Gertrude toured the US with her husband where she spoke glowingly of his military accomplishments. She told audiences that she was interested in education and health care and was described as “perfectly coiffured.” Prior to her marriage in 1967 in Brooklyn, New York, she had worked in a bank. She gave up her career in 1970 when her son Wesley Jr was born. Her husband was serving in Vietnam at the time where he was wounded after being shot four times. Wesley Jr, a 43 year old film screenwriter who lives in Los Angeles, has refused to comment on the divorce. The divorce is said to have taken his wife, who likes to be called Gert, completely by surprise . The petition states the couple have to settle ‘real and personal property rights’. Legal . experts told MailOnline the divorce should have been finalized in May . but Gertrude and her soon to be ex are in dispute over who gets the . family home. ‘The divorce has been held up over arguments over the property,’ said a friend. ‘Gertrude is refusing to back down and that is the reason the divorce has not gone through.’ Clark has not publicly commented on his latest personal life. He is in Aspen later this week as a guest speaker to talk about the role renewable energy plays in national security. Clark is one of the most respected military men in America. In 38 years of service the former West . Point graduate rose to the rank of four-star general as NATO’s Supreme . Allied Commander, Europe. He was in charge of US forces during the Bosnian campaign and led NATO forces to victory in Operation Allied Force. Since retiring from the military in 2000, he has become an investment banker, businessman, commentator, author and teacher. Clark is understood to have moved out of the family's $560,000 home in Little Rock, Arkansas . In September 2003 he launched bid for the Presidency but after failing returned to the private sector. The new lady in Clark's life was born in Mongolia ad raised in China before emigrating to the US. She worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before leaving to venture into fashion merchandising starting her own luxury sale site. One week after Clark’s divorce was scheduled for a final trial, he and Mei attended the 2013 Apex for Youth Inspiration Awards Gala on May 8. According to the New York Post they were seated together and mingled with guests including designer Phillip Lim and fashion consultant Stacy London. Clark and Mei were photographed together at the black-tie gala. The paper said hours after they contacted them for comment, a picture of them together was erased from the website of society photographer Patrick McMullan only to later reappear. Clark and Mei have refused to comment.","NATO hero, 68, facing claims he cheated on his wife of 46 years with a fashion designer, aged 30 .

"Career-focused, confident and assertive women should avoid looking for a partner with the same personality traits, a psychologist says. In her new book, The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match, Dr Sonya Rhodes says that Alpha women have never had it better, except they are looking for love in all the wrong places. Instead of trying to find a similar Alpha boyfriend, strong women should look for ‘Beta’ men; those who aren’t threatened by her success and are just as happy at home changing nappies than thrashing out a Power Point presentation. Power struggle: Alpha women are attracted to strong, assertive men just like them, but should seek a Beta male partner, says new book, The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match . ‘More and more women are making more money than men now,’ says Dr Rhodes, who has been a therapist in New York City for 30 years. ‘These are the social and economic conditions into which the Alpha woman has come into her own and, just like the Alpha man, she is strong, confident, goal-oriented and assertive.’ Dr Rhodes explains that Alpha women in the US tend to think that they’ve missed the chance of marriage because they’ve spent so long concentrating on their careers. But this is not the case. In fact, getting married later can actually have its benefits. Uncoupling: Was the reason couples Jennifer Lopez and Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs, left, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, right, split up because they are all Alphas? ‘Women are now leaving it until they are . more mature, until their career has developed and they’re in a better . place to choose their partners,’ she tells Sarah Rainey of the Telegraph. ‘They just need to start looking past the competitive, domineering Alpha male.’ She goes on to say that, despite this, Alpha women carry a negative stereotype too, in that they are bossy, domineering and controlling. ‘That is not the typical Alpha woman of today,’ says Dr Rhodes. Happy ever after: Businesswoman, artist and director Sam Taylor Wood and her husband Aaron Johnson-Wood, left, are known to have one of the happiest marriages in showbusiness. Jennifer Lopez is one of the most successful women in music and her boyfriend Casper Smart, right, is happy to let her take the lead . ‘Alpha qualities are not male or female, they are just attributes that both men and women have.’ The book, published in the UK on 22 May, promises to help you find Mr Good, not Mr Good Enough. Dr Rhodes argues that some Alpha women struggle to find the right partner because they are attracted to Alpha men but, ultimately the relationship ends in a power struggle. ‘Alpha women may believe the Alpha male is their natural partner - a breadwinner, similar to her,’ she tells the Telegraph. ‘But although they might make an exciting relationship, they don’t make a good relationship because one will always want to assert their authority.’ The Beta man, she says - one who is more laid-back, communicative, responsible and sensitive without being wimpy or needy - is better suited to an Alpha woman. A Beta man will be more respectful and supportive of his partner, and not be threatened by her confidence or success. The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match by Sonya Rhodes with Susan Schneider (HarperCollins 360, £12.99), is published on May 22 .","The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match is published in the UK next month .

People always say there comes a point when you have to pick between your face and your behind, and that trying to stay slim as you get older will leave you looking scrawny and haggard. Thankfully, I have never paid any attention to that. As far as I’m concerned, staying attractive as I’ve got older has meant keeping an eye on my figure. Yes I may look my age from the front, but I have refused to succumb to middle-aged spread and consequently have a lovely trim behind which would make any woman half my age glow with pride. I also make sure I keep my look youthful by refusing to make frumpy wardrobe choices. I’m not about to follow the route of so many women my age and start lengthening my hemline, loosening my waistband or wearing chunky cardigans. My legs and bottom have always been my best assets, so wearing something that shows them off makes me feel youthful and sexy. I’ve also learnt a few anti-ageing tricks over the years, like smoothing on fake tan regularly after exfoliating in the shower. Body lotion can only do so much, but it’s amazing how a bit of colour can distract the eye from crepey skin. Sadly, I have to do a little more than . exercise to remain this pert and perky at this age. As well as going to . Pilates classes several times a week to keep me toned, I stick to a diet . of lean meat, fish and greens. I only allow myself bread, cakes, . chocolate and wine in moderation.

But the upsides of this regime far outweigh the down. After 20 years of marriage, my husband Robert still compliments me, albeit after a slight nudge. Friends tell me he still boasts about how good I look and that secretly makes me feel very chuffed. I’ve even been mistaken for my 17-year-old daughter, Amy — from behind, I should stress.

Last week, I was in my dentist’s waiting room when I caught a young man ‘checking out’ my bottom as I got up. My behind and long legs have always been my best features and I love the fact they’re still working the same magic they did in my teens — especially when the rest of me is seriously lagging behind. It’s pretty exhausting keeping them in shape, though. Each morning for the past year, I’ve woken up and done a short exercise routine called the Tibetan Five Rites — five ancient yoga-based moves said to have been used by Tibetan monks for over 2,000 years for their energy-giving and anti-ageing benefits. You’re meant to do each move, including back bends and leg lifts, 21 times — no mean feat — to elongate your silhouette. I’m convinced doing this every day has shaved a decade off my behind. As time passes, I know looking good is not just about my figure — grooming is everything. If I have a bad hair day, I look my age from the back and front. So I take care to blow-dry my hair or put it up each day in a way that looks good from all angles, especially the back. The downside of looking good from behind is that I worry I do look much older from the front. I briefly considered plastic surgery during my 50s when I started to develop jowls. I’d scrutinise celebrities in the newspapers and magazines who’d had facelifts or nips and tucks and wondered if I should give it a go myself. Thankfully, the curiosity passed. Every morning, Erica (pictured) wakes up and completes a short exercise routine called the Tibetan Five Rites, an ancient form of yoga . I decided instead to focus on my best assets by dressing well, and not being too afraid to wear miniskirts or jeans which add definition to my bum. Like all clothes, I don’t believe denim is purely for the young. It’s all down to the fit. Although I don’t go on many dates since I divorced in my 50s, most of my male friends tell me I’m a knockout. I’d like to think they’ll be saying that for a few more years yet. Susan Dukes, 63, walks several miles a day and is an avid gardener which helps her keep in shape . Susan Dukes, 63, manages a chain of rental properties and lives in Hull. She was widowed in 2011 when her husband Russell died from cancer. She has a son Thomas, 26 . I bumped into an old school friend recently at a party. When she introduced me to her husband, he looked at his wife and said: ‘If you’re the same age, why don’t you look like her?’ I blushed, partly in embarrassment — thankfully my friend has a good sense of humour — but also partly with pride. I was wearing a figure-hugging Topshop dress, while she was in one of those shapeless smock dresses that so many women my age tend to hide in. And he was right — I did look decades younger. Even I could see it. Walking several miles a day and doing lots of bending and stretching while gardening seems to have worked for me. But I also know how to dress properly. Sheer tights with a subtle sheen help make my legs look flawless, while seamless underwear ensures  I never have unsightly underwear bulges. I’m obsessed with checking my rear view in the mirror before I leave the house and not just to make sure my body looks good — I pay a lot of attention to my hair too. I do think dressing well is important in your 60s, and I’ve learned to adapt the styles I loved when I  was younger. I wear leggings with knee-high boots and tunic tops, and short dresses — but always with tights. Bare legs can look tarty at any age but more so when you get older. Susan (pictured) cut out negative people from her life and now feels better about herself and believes it shows . I also follow a meticulous skincare regime — I cleanse and moisturise twice a day — and eat everything in moderation, particularly chocolate and alcohol. I’ve made other changes too. In the past I’ve had friends who were hard work and very draining. Since my husband Russell died, I’ve edited my circle of friends and now choose to surround myself only with people who make me feel happy, ditching the ones who are too critical or negative. I feel better about myself and it shows. Despite this, I know that I look much better from behind than the front, but I am content with that — at least my smile when I turn around is genuine. Jackie Travers, 60, is a dance teacher which she believes has slowed down the ageing process at bay . Jackie Travers, 60, is a dance teacher and property developer. She has been divorced for 15  years, lives in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and has a daughter Charlie, 27, and son Olly, 24 . At a networking event in a smart hotel last week, a man in his 40s asked my daughter and I if we were sisters. I hate to sound smug, but that wasn’t a huge surprise to me. I get complimented fairly regularly and it reminds me of the attention I received in my 20s when I was a dancer with the TV dance troupes Young Generation and New Edition. In those days, I’d often get stopped by men in the street. I teach dance classes three times a week and do dozens of squats and lunges, which seem to have kept the ageing process at bay, certainly when it comes to the lower half of my body. I’m always consciously clenching my bottom muscles — when driving the car or washing-up — to keep it as pert as possible and I also do hundreds of sit-ups and crunches every week to keep my tummy and waist taut. As a dancer, I know that posture is crucial. If you walk tall, with your shoulders back, stomach pulled in and chin up, you will instantly look more shapely and confident. In my case, the confidence isn’t faked. Men love it when a woman holds onto her vibrancy, it can be very sexy and I get chatted up by men half my age. Many women lose confidence after a divorce but I didn’t. I decided to embrace the fun of being back on the dating scene rather than fear it. Confidence is sexy, says Jackie (pictured). She embraced her return to the dating scene. I get my highlights refreshed every six weeks so there aren’t any ageing grey roots and I keep my hair  long as I think it’s more youthful that way. But the best way to keep young — apart from exercise — is to smile. Granted, you might not see it from the back, but it changes the way you feel and hold yourself.’","These women put their good looks down to exercise and dressing well .

"It was nice work while it lasted. A software developer making six-figures was fired after his bosses learned he outsourced his work to China so he could spend all day goofing off on the web, it was revealed today. The lazy but inventive worker, called 'Bob' and identified as being a mid-40s family man in a security report by Verizon, was even praised by his superiors for being 'the best developer in the building.' Beating the grind: A US-based software developer making six-figures was able to outsource all his work to China. Instead of slaving away at his computer, the man watched cat videos and surfed social media . 'His code was clean, well written, and submitted in a timely fashion, the case study said. 'Quarter after quarter, his performance review noted him as the best . developer in the building.' The man typically began his 'work' day at a 'critical infrastructure' company with a two-and-a-half-hour marathon session of surfing Reddit and watching cat videos. Here's how the software developer spent a typical workday: . After that strenuous work, the man, whose name or where he worked was not released, would take a 90-minute lunch break. Then the man, who was described as 'inoffensive and quiet. Someone you wouldn’t look at twice in an elevator', would then spend about browsing deals on eBay. After that, the long-tenured employee would check social media by posting Facebook updates and checking people's profiles on LinkedIn. Once the end of the day came, he sent out an e-mail to management updating them, presumably on the work that others had done in China at his behest. The report said he was somehow able to pull this scam off at multiple companies, earning several hundred thousands of dollars a year while paying out approximately $50,000 to the Chinese consulting firm. Beats working: The lazy worker was able to watch hours of cat videos a day, much like this one of two cats leaping around as they swat at a toy . His ruse was uncovered last year when the developer's US-based company noticed that network activity was originating in Shenyang, China. Fearing a security breach, they contacted Verizon to get to the bottom of it. The Verizon investigators noticed the suspicious activity was occurring regularly and often spanned the entire eight-hour workday. Mystery solved: Verizon investigators were the ones who discovered the software developer's tricks . They then spoke with the employee, whose credentials were being used to sustain the network connection in China, and searched his company. They found invoices for the Chinese firm and searched his web history which confirmed 'the whole story,' the report concluded.","Began day by looking at cat videos and Reddit for two hours .

"With 69.1 per cent of British adults now classified as overweight or obese according to the NHS, fat is becoming an increasingly weighty issue. But according to a new book, being overweight or obese might not be the problem most of us believe it to be. According to American cardiologist, Carl Lavie, it's not fat that's killing us - it's dieting that does the most damage. Not so bad: According to Carl Levie, it's perfectly possible to be overweight and 'amazingly healthy' In The Obesity Paradox: When Thinner Means Sicker and Heavier Means Healthier, Lavie argues that the key to good health isn't staying slender but keeping fit instead. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Lavie said: 'Fat has been demonised by our society, and our research shows fat is not always the devil. 'You can be heavy and amazingly healthy. Fitness is a lot more important than fatness.' His findings contradict received medical opinion, which claims that not only does obesity lead to type two diabetes and heart disease, it can also increase the risk of breast and colon cancer. While Lavie accepts that being overweight does make heart disease more likely, he says larger people tend to have a better chance of surviving. 'This is the obesity paradox,' he explains. ''Among the patients who have heart disease, the overweight and moderately obese are actually doing considerably better, sometimes 30 to 50 per cent lower mortality rates, than the lean people who have the same diseases. Dangerous: According to the NHS, being obese can lead to type two diabetes, heart disease and cancer . Fighting fit: According to Levie, being fit makes more difference to heart health than weight . He adds: 'In no way am I promoting obesity, but for the people who have been losing the battle of the weight, if they can at least become fit, then they can have a very good prognosis and good overall health.' While Lavie's theories are the result of spending more than a decade treating heart patients at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans, they are unlikely to sway mainstream medical opinion which emphasises the need to lose weight and the £5bn annual cost to the NHS of treating the overweight. Currently, the Government is promoting a healthier lifestyle via a five a day eating campaign and is encouraging people to cut their sugar and fat intake. And the Government isn't alone: A recent report by the National Obesity Forum found that a quarter of British adults are now obese and warned that the figure looked set to double by 2050 at a cost of £50bn to the UK exchequer. In contrast with Dr Levie's findings, Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon University Hospitals, South London, told MailOnline that obesity was ‘the greatest threat to health worldwide’. He said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol combined, and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘denial’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products. Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, added: ‘Not only is the situation not improving, but the doomsday scenario set out in that report might underestimate the true scale of the problem. 'There needs to be concerted action. We’ve seen hard-hitting campaigns against smoking and it’s time to back up the work that’s already being done with a similar approach for obesity.'","Claims were made by cardiologist Carl Lavie in his new book .

"An adult film star who tested positive for HIV - causing the porn industry's third shut down this year - was reportedly trying to book a sex shoot after finding out his diagnosis. The male star, who has not been identified but is known to authorities, attempted to book a scene with a female sex actress that would appear via webcam in the days following his positive test results, according to Radar Online. 'We can f--- but do it on cam,' he wrote in a text message obtained by industry blogger Mike South. 'Then it’s not cheating. It’s work.' The woman agreed to the shoot, however pulled out after it emerged the actor had returned a positive result during the mandated fourteen-day industry disease screening. Anti-porn acitvists protest for a 100% condom use policy in sexually explicit films in a move that is backed by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation . '[The HIV-positive actor] contacted [the actress] on December 5th at 4PM PST and suggested that they do a webcam show together on Sat Dec 7th,' South wrote on his site, adding [the actress] 'indicated that she was booked to shoot that day, but Sunday would work. [The HIV-positive actor] agreed on Sunday.' 'This is clearly after [The HIV-positive actor] would at least know that he had tested positive for something, and I find it hard to believe that 48 hours after the test he didn’t know what, but he had to know that he wasn’t supposed to be shooting, he was even marked unavailable in [the industry testing system]. 'This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable and it shows a total disregard for her life. On Dec. 6, the Free Speech Coalition, an adult film industry trade group, announced its latest moratorium on filming, according to ABC News. 'We are taking every precaution while we do research to determine if there's been any threat to the performer pool,' Free Speech Coalition CEO Diane Duke said in a statement. 'We take the health of our performers very seriously, and felt that it was better to err on the side of caution while we determine whether anyone else may have been exposed.' The male star at the center of the webcam claims is the cause of the moratorium. The news comes more than a year after Los Angeles County voters passed a ballot initiative that made using condoms in porn mandatory, however the rule was never enforced and later ruled to be unconstitutional. Porn star Cameron Bay, who has been appearing in XXX films since 2010, went public with her HIV diagnosis in August after it was revealed her boyfriend, Rod Daily, had also contracted the disease . HIV Positive: Rod Daily and his tearful girlfriend Cameron Bay talk to the press about their HIV results. There is no suggestion Daily is the star who tried to shoot a scene after his diagnosis . In online post, the coalition . explained that performers underwent mandatory testing for sexually . transmitted infections every two weeks and that the performers prefer . this to using condoms. 'Unfortunately, condoms aren't perfect,' the blog said. 'They . break. In the shoots that can take several hours, they can cause . abrasions known as condom rash which, paradoxically, can make it easier . to transmit an infection if one does break. 'For this and a host of other reasons, performers generally prefer to rely on the testing system over condoms.' Porn industry leaders have also said condoms were bad for business, leading to a decline in pornography sales. As . in previous HIV outbreaks, the industry is currently testing the . performer's on-and-off-screen sex partners to make sure that the virus . hasn't spread. It expects to have results early this week, according to the Free Speech Coalition. In August, porn star Cameron Bay tested positive for HIV, forcing a six-day filming moratorium. On Aug. 28, the industry declared all performers who worked with Bay 'tested and cleared,' but on Sept. 4, Bay's boyfriend, porn actor Rod Daily, announced that he, too, tested positive for HIV. Bay and Daily have since spoken out about unsafe industry practices. There is no suggestion Daily is the actor who tried to shoot scenes after his diagnosis. Several other porn actors have also since tested positive. 'Ultimately, it's just a big industry, and their main concern is money,' Daily said in a September news conference. 'If they do care that much about the performers, they would use condoms.'

"Philadelphia locals are furious after a local radio station's weekend concert ended with intoxicated youth peeing and publicly having sex on people's private property and in front of innocent children. Residents from the Philadelphia neighborhood Northern Liberties said that Radio 104.5's summer block party at the outdoor plaza called Piazza at Schmidts didn't have enough security guards or portable toilets. Music fans who didn't want to wait in a long line to use the bathroom decided that the world was their public toilet and so they peed on the street and in people's backyards. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Drunk concert attendees were caught having sex on people's private property and carried on for 40 minutes despite people yelling for them to stop . The Daily News spoke to resident Sibyl Lindsay, 35, who has lived in Northern Liberties for four years and decided to leave the concert early after her children were forced to witness two teenagers having sex and other teenagers peeing in public. 'I get that people pee in public. But hundreds of people peeing on your property, on your house, in front of your children?' Lindsay told the Daily News. 'Girls were just dropping their pants and peeing all over our property,' she said. 'It wasn't five, it wasn't ten — it was hundreds of people.' Lindsay claimed that there were only 8 to 10 portable toilets for hundreds of drunk party goers. She blames the radio station and the plaza for not securing the event. Lindsay's neighbor was able to film two people having sex behind condos near the plaza. With only a limited numbers of portable toilets, drunk teenagers took to peeing all over people's cars and in their backyards . According to witnesses they carried on drunkenly for over 40 minutes despite people yelling for them to stop. 'You can see my kids' castle in our yard while they were doing this,' Lindsay said. The company that owns the radio station, Clear Channel, apologized for the messy outcome of their weekend event. 'We apologize for any of our fans who may have had a less than enjoyable experience at this past weekend's block party,' said Clear Channle to NBC. 'As these shows have become more popular and larger, we've worked with our partners at the Piazza to have them increase security and facilities.' There are generally security and sanitation requirements at large events and Westminsiter Management who owns the plaza said that the radio station. 'didn't follow the requirements and standards for public events.' The next event won't take place at the plaza but will be at a waterfront venue called Penn's Landing a mile away. Lindsay along with other neighbors have asked that cleanup crews help them with their yards but she has yet to hear back. Residents also want answers as to why there were not enough police officers sent to manage the crazy scene. 'I don't care where they go, they shouldn't be in the center of any community in Philadelphia,' she said. 'They should be in a proper venue.' Locals in Northern Liberties complained lack of security and scant portable toilets at a radio station's weekend block party with hordes of young, drunk fans .","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"Conversation: Ben Sullivan, 21, was cleared of suspected rape and suspected attempted rape after police read a conversation between him and one of the alleged victims in which she admitted it wasn't rape . A girl who accused the Oxford Union president of rape admitted she consented to their relationship months before she made the allegation, it has emerged. Ben Sullivan, 21, was cleared of all suspicion after police saw an online exchange between the pair in which she vowed to make clear he had not raped her. The conversation also suggested there had been a plot to oust him from his role as president of the revered society. 'If we ignore it, it'll go away,' the alleged victim wrote in a conversation read by the Daily Telegraph. She went on to say she felt guilty about their encounter having just rekindled her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, the paper reports. And when asked if she thought it was rape she replied, 'no', adding 'I was far too drunk, that's it'. However, a year later Mr Sullivan, a third-year undergraduate, was arrested at dawn in his college room at Christ Church and was on bail for six weeks. The case sparked outrage, with calls for speakers to boycott the union and a petition - signed by high profile activists - for Mr Sullivan's resignation. Finally, last week, police informed the 21-year-old that no further action would be taken against him following an investigation into the allegations, thought to have been made by the young women more than a year ago. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'All of the evidence was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for them to make a decision about charging and they decided against.' Rape victim support campaigners are now warning of a backlash against the alleged victims, blasting the release of details of their conversation as Mr Sullivan is given a platform to defend himself. Speaking of the ordeal, he said: ‘It’s been very difficult, very harrowing. It puts things in perspective, changes your priorities to say the very least. 'I’m very thankful to everyone who has given me support - my friends, my family, and people at the union.’ A letter written by student politicians to around 30 speakers who had been booked to attend, asked them to boycott the Union, and Mr Sullivan to resign in what they called a ‘push for equality’. Scandal: The case sparked outrage, with calls for the 21-year-old undergraduate to resign . Nobel Peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, a human rights activist, Interpol secretary-general Robert Noble, the US entrepreneur Julie Meyer and David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, were all said to have pulled out of debates at the Oxford Union, citing concerns about Mr Sullivan’s arrest. But the banker’s son, who attended £22,000-a-year St Paul’s school in London, repeatedly defied calls to stand down as president while the police investigation was carried out. Student union official Sarah Pine who was the leader of the campaign to boycott the union also appeared on Newsnight and said she stood by the campaign. Mr Sullivan said: ‘I don’t doubt the organisers of the boycott have very good intentions and I do agree that sexual violence is a very serious problem at Oxford and other universities.’","Ben Sullivan, 21, cleared of suspected rape after police saw online exchange .

"Late Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi raped countless women during his years in power, according to an explosive new documentary. German broadcaster RTL is set to screen the controversial programme - which includes interviews with his inner circle - next Monday. Reporter Antonia Rados said; 'There were many women in Libya spellbound by Gaddafi who wanted to meet him. And when they did he raped them.' Victims: It is alleged that Gaddafi's female bodyguards were the targets of his attacks (file photo) The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said there was evidence that Gaddafi had instructed his troops to rape women . She said that his female bodyguards, who were supposed to lay down their lives to protect him, were also victims. A prominent Libyan psychologist Dr Seham Sergewa said he knew of at least five of his Amazonian bodyguards who were raped by him. Rape as a means of subduing the population was also passed on to soldiers and loyal militias who were provided with condoms and Viagra to encourage their assaults. In June last year Luis Moreno-Ocampo, . the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said there was . evidence that Gaddafi had instructed his troops to rape women who had . voiced opposition to his regime. Ms Rados . goes on to say in the report that many women were abused by him within . moments of meeting. And he made a point of forgiving rebellious elements . in his tribal society if they made 'gifts' of young women to him. Shocking revelations: A reporter for RTL claims there were many women in Libya spellbound by Gaddafi who wanted to meet him, but were raped when they did so .

The programme makers said they met many injured women who, along with their families, were sworn to years of silence over what Gaddafi had subjected them to . Ms Rados said she met many injured women who, along with their families, were sworn to years of silence over what Gaddafi had subjected them to.

"A millionaire's wife who blamed their pre-nup for ending her marriage was actually having an affair with her cousin's husband, it was claimed today. Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis, 39, from Long Island, famously got her pre-nup agreement overturned last month after claiming her tycoon husband Peter Petrakis coerced her into accepting it four days before their lavish wedding in June 1998. But Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis began having an affair with the Steve Houraney, the husband of her then-pregnant cousin Ailsa Houraney in 2007, according to Mrs Houraney. Scroll down for video . Claims: Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis, 37, from Long Island, claims her husband Peter Petrakis, 41, coerced her into signing the document four days before their luxury wedding in June 1998 . Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis claimed she had been forced to sign a pre-nup by her husband Peter four days before their wedding in June 1998 . Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis is said to have had an affair with Steve Houraney, pictured above, the husband of her then-pregnant cousin Ailsa Houraney in 2007 . Mrs Houraney told the New York Post that after the affair was discovered Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis, who had been maid of honor . at the Houraneys' wedding: ‘called a meeting of her and my family and . admitted everything.' Mrs Houraney said: 'I want people to know the truth. The prenup didn’t break up her marriage — she did. ‘Liz said, ""Steve and I are in love, and you’re going to have to get over it."" ‘I felt I got punked by Ashton Kutcher. It was like a bad dream. I said, ""Get over it? Get out of my house!"" ‘I don’t know why my cousin would ever . do this to me. It was very hurtful, it was a betrayal. She destroyed two families and all the kids.’ Alisa Houraney said Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis had bedded . her husband, who was the best friend of Peter Petrakis, when the . Houraneys were still newlyweds. Both Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis and Mr Houraney admit the affair, but she denies it ended her marriage, while Mr Houraney said their sexual relationship was 'probably the last nail in the coffin' of the Petrakis' marriage. Sometimes acting as her own lawyer during the proceedings Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis now heads up her own company called Divorce Prep Experts. She is seen her in a promotional video . Defiant: Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis said her husband promised to 'tear up' the document after the couple had children and vowed to put their Old Brookville home under both their names . Peter Petrakis refused to comment on Alisa Houraney’s claims. In an 'unprecedented' ruling last month,  an  appellate panel decided Peter Petrakis, 41, had 'fraudulently induced' his wife to sign and that his 'credibility was suspect.' Calling the document 'a knife in my heart from Day One,' she testified that Mr Petrakis threatened to cancel the wedding if . she didn’t sign the agreement, reported the New York Post. He made the threat even though her father already paid out . $40,000 for their reception. The agreement stated that Mr Petrakis would keep everything in his name if they split up. He had transformed a string of smoke shops into a $20 million commercial . real-estate empire. Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis said her husband promised to 'tear up' the document after the couple had children. He also vowed . to put their Old Brookville home under both their names. But Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis, who is a stay at home mother, said that he failed to carry out his promise, even after they couple had twin sons and a daughter. Peter Petrakis, left at a Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Long Island event, and right his wife Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis . On February 20, a Brooklyn Appellate Court panel unanimously affirmed two Nassau County court decisions, saying Mr Petrakis, 'fraudulently induced' his wife to sign the prenuptial agreement and found his 'credibility to be suspect.' Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis admitted having an affair with her cousin's husband but claimed it did not cause her marriage to end . Mrs Cioffi-Petrakis' lawyer, Dennis . D’Antonio said the decision 'is unprecedented, vacating a pre-nup on the . basis of a verbal promise,' even though a clause in the contract says . there were no verbal promises. 'It . resets the bar. It’s an entirely different landscape out there in . regard to prenups. I’ve been inundated with calls. Spouses who are . challenging pre-nups now have a leg to stand on,' Ms D’Antonio said. The pair will now begin divorce proceedings. Sometimes acting as her own lawyer during the proceedings Cioffi-Petrakis . now heads up her own company called Divorce Prep Experts which counsels . people divorcing with prenuptial agreements. The company promises to 'help one of the most overlooked groups in our population, those facing divorce.' In . a video posted on the website she is seen holding signs up to the . camera reading 'Divorce has robbed me' and 'I am a victim.' She also appeared on national television . after being interviewed on the Anderson Cooper show about her story and . her new business. The case will hold significance for many Americans who are fighting prenupital agreements. Long-term divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd Platt who was not involved in the case said of the ruling: 'This new case however of Elizabeth . Cioffi-Petrakis introduces a new principle in America that if there has . been a misrepresentation ie he was said to have fraudulently induced the . wife to sign the prenup on the basis that he would put the house in her . name and would make certain provision for her and did not, it will be . set aside. 'What this means is if the husband makes a promise that . induces the prenup and does not keep it, it is now open to the American . Courts to set aside the prenup.  This is very new and very . controversial.'","Elizabeth Cioffi-Petrakis claims .

"Researchers have found that the majority of male athletes spoon each other when sharing beds with their teammates. Researchers found that 97.5% of heterosexual, male college athletes have shared a bed with another man and 93.5% admit to having indulged in spooning. Researchers say the athletes even spooned with others who were not necessarily close friends. A fine Bromance: James Franco and Keegan Allen aren't alone, researcher have found. Researchers found that 97.5% of heterosexual, male college athletes have shared a bed with another man and 93.5% admit to having indulged in spooning. A recent national survey found that 29% of British adults think same-sex relationships are wrong, a sharp drop from 46% in 2000. It’s backed up by data from the Pew Research Center, which found that 74% of Americans born after 1980 believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society. The study, . published last month in the Men and Masculinities journal, was . conducted by two researchers at Winchester and Durham Universities, who . questioned 40 University athletes. 'In addition to cuddling, participants also engage in ‘spooning’ with their heterosexual male friends,' Eric Anderson and Mark McCormack wrote. 'Highlighting the prosaic nature of bed sharing for these participants, most indicated that it was not necessary to be close friends to share a bed with someone.' One of the participants said the act was simply one of friendship. 'I love a quick cuddle, just so you remember your friends are about and are there for you.' Another said: 'I feel comfortable with Connor and we spend a lot of time together. The researchers say the behavior is common among athletes as they travel and shower together, but is common among all young men - although tapers off with age. 'I happily rest my head on Connor’s shoulder when lying on the couch or hold him in bed. But he’s not the only one. The way I see it, is that we are all very good and close mates. 'We have a bromance where we are very comfortable around each other.' The researchers say the behavior is common among athletes as they travel and shower together, but is common among all young men - although tapers off with age. 'Outside of an undergraduate setting the numbers are likely to be far less,' Anderson told Vocativ. 'While we know, definitively, that it is a regular occurrence among 16- to 18-year-olds in addition to university students, it is not likely to exist whatsoever among 40-year-old men,' he says. Participants said cuddling up was simply an act of friendship. 'This is both a function of the homohysteric culture that 40-year-old men experienced in their adolescence, as much as it is a function of the fact that 40-year-old men go home to sleep in bed with their spouses.' Experts say the study reflects changing attitudes to male sexuality. 'We argue that the expansion of esteemed homosocial behaviors for heterosexual men is evidence of an expansion of changing conceptions of masculinity in contemporary culture, the researchers wrote.

Ms Pierce says she has always been on the larger size, but her weight problem became worse after developing lymphedema, which blocks the lymphatic system and causes swelling . Because Ms Pierce, who is the fattest woman in the world, has developed a medical condition called lymphedema, which has caused a huge swelling on her left leg, she no longer fits easily into a regular car. To make the 1,000 mile trip to Texas the single mother would need to hire a private ambulance, and she is currently trying to raise $5,000 to pay for it. 'A doctor in Texas willing to do patients over 600lb [is] my only hope,' she wrote on her Go Fund Me page, which is still a few thousand dollars below her target. 'The one thing that's going to save my life is gastric bypass. But I'm a single mother on disability with no one to count on besides myself,' she added. She hopes to be able to lose enough weight to be able to watch her daughter grow up, and also so she can have a dream wedding to her 22-year-old boyfriend, Tony Sauer.

The swelling that protrudes out the side of her leg makes exercise and walking difficult and has made her almost entirely house bound as she struggles to fit inside cars. She first turned to TV show doctors for help in 2012, when she released a video on YouTube pleading for someone to get her case to Dr Phil. She explained that she developed lymphedema in 2001 after falling down a flight of stairs, and then had to fight off Necrotizing Facitis, the flesh eating bacteria, in her abdomen. 'They had to cut out 40lb of dead muscle and tissue. My left side looks as though a shark took a big bite out of it,' Ms Pierce said.

"England have now lost five matches on the bounce and Stuart Lancaster's men are coming under pressure to get a result against Samoa. Consecutive defeats to New Zealand and South Africa have left the Red Rose wounded after two November internationals. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Peters analyses where England have failed to match their southern-hemisphere rivals in the autumn internationals. England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . CARRY ON CARRYING . Only South Africa have made fewer carries than England, who desperately need to add ballast to a back row short of carriers. James Haskell is the clear favourite to return to add a threat with the ball. Carries per game: . Australia 150, New Zealand 130, England 102, South Africa 100. James Haskell (centre) is a clear favourite to return to the England side in order to improve their carrying . NO DRIVING AMBITION . England have made fewer metres than any of the southern-hemisphere powers. They are not explosive enough through contact, while the passing in the threequarters is not putting players into space. Metres per game: . New Zealand 552.3, Australia 475.3, South Africa 296.0, England 292.5. England have made fewer metres this autumn then any of the southern-hemisphere sides . TAKE A BREAK . South Africa - who lost to Ireland, don’t forget - have made fewer breaks but they base their game on relentless surging power. England are establishing set-piece dominance but lack the nous and creativity to make space for their dangerous runners. Clean breaks per game: . New Zealand 11.3, Australia 6.3, England 5.0, South Africa 3.5. England are lacking nous and creativity and need to turn to someone like George Ford . PASSING THE BUCK . You can’t generate a stat for the quality of passing but it’s clear England’s has been poor. A strong rugby league influence seems to favour end-over-end style which has a less predictable trajectory than old-fashioned spin pass. Danny Cipriani is the most sympathetic distributor in the country and England are missing his passing game. Danny Cipriani (right) is the most sympathetic distributor in England but is not even in the squad . WHO TURNED OFF THE POWER? Without powerful centres Manu Tuilagi and Luther Burrell, England simply fail to go route one in the midfield. England are not powerful enough to blast through tackles so need to use quick feet and better spatial awareness to put players through gaps. At the moment they’re doing neither. Defenders beaten per game: . New Zealand 25.8, Australia 20.5, England 19.0 South Africa 13.5. England are missing the power of someone like Manu Tuilagi in the middle of the park right now . A LOAD OF TROUBLE . Just four offloads in two matches is a paltry return. The start of Lancaster’s tenure saw England commit defenders but move the point of attack from breakdown with two quick passes. A lack of offloads indicates a lack of confidence in support runners and lack of footballing ability. New Zealand are light years ahead in this department. Offloads per game: . New Zealand 17.5, Australia 9.3, South Africa 5.5, England 4.0. South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England . IT’S TURNING BAD . England are way behind New Zealand and South Africa at scavenging on the floor. The country that produced Neil Back and Peter Winterbottom seems to have forgotten the role of a proper No 7.

"England's loss to South Africa on Friday exposed a host of deficiencies in Stuart Lancaster's line-up and will force some serious discussions about selections for Samoa this weekend and beyond. Some of Stuart Lancaster's men stood up to be counted against the Springboks while others may have shown the coach enough to make him look elsewhere ahead of next year's World Cup. Of the 15 starters on Saturday in the deceptively close 28-31 loss, here's who is safe, who is set for some sleepless nights and who has to make way for the good of the team. Chris Robshaw leads England off the Twickenham pitch after their 28-31 loss to South Africa on Saturday . SAFE AS HOUSES . MIKE BROWN: Two sharp breaks and always full of intent with ball in hand. Defensively sound but would be good to see him at first receiver more. Match rating: 7/10 . JOE MARLER: Another strong scrummaging display with the Harlequins prop to the fore. Consistent and one of the few rocks in the team. Must stay. 7 . Harlequins prop Joe Marler is consistent and one the few rocks in Stuart Lancaster's team . DAVID WILSON: England cannot blame their set-piece forwards for their problems. Rock-solid scrummaging and carried well in both matches. Gets better with every Test match. 7 . Also outstanding in the scrum, David Wilson crosses for a try after an excellent drive from England . DAVE ATTWOOD: Early knock-on against Boks put England on back foot and should have put Watson away for early try. Otherwise industrious and making an excellent impression. 7 . Dave Attwood made some uncharacteristic errors but is making a big impression . COURTNEY LAWES: Huge questions over if he should have played after head knock against All Blacks. Lineout solid and work-rate high but looked tired. Could be rested against Samoans but would be on fitness, not form. 6 . Courtney Lawes' work-rate and lineout work make him an asset and won't . SLEEPLESS NIGHTS . DYLAN HARTLEY: Lineout throws again exemplary and work in tight superb but blotted copybook with a brainless stamp that led to a yellow. Bath’s Rob Webber worth trying. 5 . Dylan Hartley's strong work with the lineout and in tight was undone when he earned a yellow card . CHRIS ROBSHAW (capt): Honest and hard-working but does not seem to be inspiring his team. England were second best at breakdown again. Likely to play against Samoa but perhaps it should be at blindside. 6 . Chris Robshaw is supposed to be leading the team as captain but they aren't even winning the breakdown . KYLE EASTMOND: Early knock-on set the tone for England’s wobbly opening and will be frustrated by lack of opportunities. Lacks a kicking game but merits consideration. 6 . Kyle Eastmond's lack of a kicking game works against him but he can be dangerous when given a chance . JONNY MAY: What is the point in picking the Gloucester ace if he is hardly going to see the ball? Capable of individual brilliance but needs to get more involved. 6 . If Jonny May isn't given the ball and a chance to use his blistering speed in space he shouldn't be picked . ANTHONY WATSON: Like Rokoduguni before him, England’s inside backs failed to release the Bath flyer. Not a bad first start by any means but if Rokoduguni is fit, he could return. 6 . The inside backs are letting Anthony Watson down by not giving the Bath star early ball . BRAD BARRITT: Never anything other than committed and brave but questions over lack of creativity persist. Jonathan Joseph would offer a far greater attacking threat. 6 . Brad Barritt's immense strength is his weakness with the fearless centre offering little creativity . ALMOST CERTAIN TO GO . OWEN FARRELL: (Subbed by Ford 63min) Looked rusty and short of fitness again. Kicking from hand is below par and isn’t getting the line going. George Ford is worth a shot. 5 . Owen Farrell is short of fitness and struggling with his kicking ... George Ford's form warrants a shot . DANNY CARE: (Youngs 63) A 50th cap for the Harlequins No 9 will not be remembered as his finest. Lacked zip and pass was laboured. Youngs deserves another start. 5 . Danny Care marked his 50th Test with a performance he'd prefer to forget . TOM WOOD: Carried well but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work. England’s back row is getting outshone with alarming regularity and with James Haskell in form a change should be made. 6 . With ball in hand Tom Wood impressed, but he gave away too many penalties and lacked at the breakdown . BILLY VUNIPOLA: (Morgan 44) His worst display in an England shirt. Carried valiantly but knocked on too often. Huge future but needs a break to improve his all-round game. Ben Morgan will start next week. 4 .

"Ireland coasted to a six-try, 49-7 victory over Georgia in a Dublin clash marred by an unpunished stamp to debutant Dominic Ryan's face. The hosts were left incensed by flanker Viktor Kolelishvili bringing his boot down on back-rower Ryan's face but captain Eoin Reddan's complaints went unheeded by referee JP Doyle. Ryan somehow escaped serious injury in a scrappy first-half, before Felix Jones claimed a brace while Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo and Stuart Olding all crossed, with Giorgi Nemsadze responding for Georgia. Leinster fly half Ian Madigan impressed for Ireland with his attacking play and accurate goal kicking . Ireland hooker Richardt Strauss barges over for his team's second try as the Georgians began to tire . Simon Zebo scorches over for Ireland's third as the rampant Irish begin to overwhelm the visitors . Leinster scrum-half Reddan was waved away despite telling referee Doyle 'I have a very serious question' after Ryan received the boot to the face. Doyle responded by claiming 'I can't listen to that,' effectively rejecting Reddan's request for a Television Match Official (TMO) review. Referee Wayne Barnes called for a review following a request from South Africa captain Jean de Villiers that led to the Springboks' decisive penalty in 27-25 victory over the All Blacks last month. Munster and Ireland full back Felix Jones dives over for the first of his two tries in Dublin . Here though, Doyle was unmoved, but Kolelishvili can expect to be cited for his reckless, if unintentional act. Ireland will learn little from their routine victory in truth, with boss Joe Schmidt having made 13 changes from the side that saw off South Africa 29-15 a week earlier. Schmidt's men host Australia next weekend, with a raft of senior stars all expected to return. The hosts wasted a number of clear-cut chances in a try-less first-half, with Georgia dominating early set-piece exchanges. Madigan is well tackled as Ireland winger Zebo looks to support the Irish fly half . Munster prop Dave Kilcoyne bursts through the Georgian defence early in the first half in Dublin . Jones claims a high ball under pressure from Georgia forward Dimitri Basilaia . Full-back Merab Kvirikashvili dragged an early shot at goal wide for the visitors, before Ian Madigan posted three penalties amid Ireland wasting plenty of territory and possession. Schmidt's men should have scored following Kilcoyne's fine galloping break, and also when Darren Cave linked well with Reddan and Ryan. Craig Gilroy spilled Cave's wide pass to leave another chance begging, and Ireland turned around 9-0 to the good with Georgia scrum-half Giorgi Begadze in the sin-bin for killing the ball. Ireland quickly broke their try duck after the restart, Kilcoyne driving home for his first Test score. Munster speedster Zebo (left) is well tackled by Georgia openside Viktor Kolelishvili . Georgian lock Giorgi Nemsadze dives over for his team's only try at the Aviva Stadium . Schmidt's side racked up three more wasted chances to add to first-half frustrations, before Strauss capped a regulation driving maul to double the try count. The usual raft of replacements brought Rodney Ah You into the fray, with Mike Ross withdrawn as Ireland eyed next week's Australia clash. Connacht's Ah You threw a forward pass then conceded a quick penalty in an inauspicious arrival, allowing Georgia a foothold. Then from a penalty lineout lock Nemsadze ghosted through flimsy defence to claim a try for the visitors. Ireland flanker Robbie Diack makes a strong carry into the Georgian defence . Ulster and Ireland centre Darren Dave tries to fend off Georgia's Merab Sharikadze . Zebo ran in Ireland's third score after a scrum deep in Georgia's 22, following a yellow card for number eight Dimitri Basilaia. Lasha Malaguradze took a heavy bang to the head in the build-up to Zebo's try, receiving lengthy on-field treatment before being removed via stretcher. Jones finished a smart Ireland move next, before capping a field-length break launched by a smart turnover from debutant replacement Robin Copeland. Replacement centre Olding then glossed the scoreline still further late on as Schmidt's men completed their routine and expected victory. While Ireland negotiated this clash simply enough, Schmidt and friends know full well a challenge of an entirely different calibre awaits next weekend.","Tries from Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo, Felix Jones (two) and Stuart Olding secure victory at the Aviva Stadium .

"It’s the relationship advice that you definitely won’t find in her book. ‘Princeton Mom’ Susan Patton stole her husband away from his first wife after meeting him at work, MailOnline can reveal. Patton, 59, sparked a national conversation and won infamy for herself when she wrote an article urging young women to find a husband while at college - ideally Princeton, her alma mater - and not put their careers first. But she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past, aside . from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons. Now MailOnline can . reveal that her ex is advertising executive Steve Jaffe. It was Patton’s first day working at an advertising agency in the 1980’s when she spotted Jaffe on the job and shocked colleagues over a meet-and-greet lunch by saying: ‘I’m gonna marry that man!’ Marry Smart:  Princeton Mom Susan Patton's advice to young women is to invest the same time in finding the right man as they do in their careers. But she admits she didn't practice what she preached . Revealed! This is the ex. Princeton Mom Patten was determined to marry Steve Jaffe the moment she saw him on her first day at work in the '80's. They have since divorced . When they protested that he was already happily married, she ignored them and began a years-long process of ‘wearing him down’. Jaffe stood no chance against brassy Patton who ‘bowled him over’ - and swept his wife aside. Earlier this year she wrote a book, Marry Smart, expounding on her theory and was condemned by feminists who said that she taking women back to the 1950s. But she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past aside from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons. In interviews Patton has admitted that she did not follow her own advice, but only now can the full story be told. When she met Jaffe they were both in their late 20s and the agency they worked for was Siebel/Mohr, run by famed illustrator Fritz Siebel when the industry was in the last throes of the Mad Men age. Ouch: Patton chided her ex for not attending a prestigious ivy league college. Good-humored Jaffe made a joke of it on his LinkedIn page . Jaffe, now a pudgy, balding 60, came from the unglamorous Jamaica neighborhood of Queens in the city and attended a humble college on Long Island. Patton would later snobbily refer to it as a ‘college of almost no name recognition’. And Jaffe would later use the line in his LinkedIn profile. She herself had come from the Bronx, a tough borough of New York, and was raised by Eastern European immigrant parents who were both Holocaust survivors before she was accepted at the prestigious Princeton University. By the time Patton joined the advertising agency as an account executive, Jaffe was already well established. He was also married to his first wife, Robin, who is now 61. School daze: Patton gloats about her Princeton roots, but she was so eager to get married and have kids she settled for someone who went to a 'college of almost no name recognition' A source told MailOnline: ‘It was Susan’s very first day and she had lunch with a few of her colleagues, a get to know you kind of thing. ‘Steve was there too but he wasn’t at the table so Susan, bold as brass, tells them: ‘I’m gonna marry that man!’ ‘I think everyone was a bit taken aback. ‘His wife was really nice, a calm person. She was like a librarian - she didn’t have a chance against Susan. ‘Steve was a mellow kind of guy. He was popular with the ladies, he was easygoing. He was too passive, that was his problem. ‘It took a few years but she managed to wear him down. Steve was just too nice and so was his wife. Susan bowled them over. She wouldn’t take no for an answer’. Mama's boy: Princeton senior Alex Jaffe uses his mother's last name on his Facebook. He was recently dubbed 'the hottest guy on campus' thanks to his mother's notoriety . Jaffe moved to advertising firms Promotional Campaigns and Ogilvy and Mather before founding his own company, which he runs to this day under the name Jaffe and Partners. Patton’s decision to stick with Jaffe appears to be more functional than romantic. In an interview she said: ‘After I graduated I spent years dating men who were not nearly as good as the men in my class. ‘Ultimately I married the man I was dating when I was 31, because I was running out of time to have children.' They have two sons are Alex, 21, a senior at Princeton, where he is studying art history and Daniel, 25, who studied history at Princeton and then went to New York University Law School. He now works at a Manhattan law firm. A video from Daniel’s wedding at the swanky Water Club in Manhattan shows him getting married to a young woman named Natasha, 25, who studied computer science at Princeton and is now an analyst at Citibank. Her Princeton credentials are impeccable -  even her father Robert attended the college, where he studied mathematics. The wedding video includes a shot of Patton grinning broadly, no doubt delighted that her older son was doing what she says - and not what she herself did. Legal eagle: Jaffe and Patton's son Daniel is another Princeton grad who went on to law school. He practices in Manhattan . Patton’s reputation comes from the blunt nature of the advice in her book ‘Marry Smart: Advice for Finding the One’, which has been branded everything from ‘sexist’ to ‘slapdash’. It includes advice to women such as: ‘Potential buyers are unmotivated if offered free merchandise, i.e., it’s the lonely cow that gives away free milk’. She also blamed women if they get sexually assaulted while drunk and said the term ‘date rape’ was too ‘politically correct’. There was also this missive: ‘If you’ve struggled with obesity through most of your teen years, then maybe surgical intervention is a good idea for you’. There is little advice about what to do if a relationship ends however, so it might prove useful to see what happened in Patton’s case. A source told MailOnline that on the first day of her divorce hearing Patton was in court but told the judge to stop when he announced that proceedings had got underway. Patton said that they had to wait until Mr Jaffe arrived, but the judge informed her he was in fact already present. Patton turned and looked her soon-to-be ex and said: ‘Oh my god! He’s got so fat!’ Jaffe declined to comment to MailOnline but said in an email: ‘As tempted as I am to voice my perspective on Susan, her book and her opinions, out of respect for my sons' privacy, I will refrain from doing so.’","'I'm gonna marry that man,' Susan Patton, known as 'The Princeton Mom', told colleagues at work,  pointing to already married Steve Jaffe .

"England failed to recover from a sloppy first half at Twickenham, losing  28-31 to South Africa in their second autumn Test. Brad Barritt, Ben Morgan and Dave Wilson scored tries for England while Cobus Reinach, Jan Serfontein and Schalk Burger went over for the Springboks. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Peters gives his verdict on how both sets of players fared. ENGLAND . Brown - 7 . Two sharp breaks and always full of intent with ball in hand. Defensively sound but would be good to see him at first receiver more. Watson - 6 . Just like Rokoduguni before him, the Bath flyer was starved of the ball as England’s inside backs failed to release him. England's players celebrate after Ben Morgan scores the hosts' second try at Twickenham . Brad Barritt goes over for England's third try, but it isn't enough to prevent defeat for Stuart Lancaster's men . Barritt - 6 . Never anything other than committed and brave but those question marks over lack of creativity persist. Superb defence. Eastmond - 6 . Guilty of an early knock-on following a sharp break but will again be frustrated by lack of opportunities. May - 6 . What is the point in picking the Gloucester ace if he is hardly ever going to see the ball? Starved of the ball for the second week running. Farrell - 5 (Ford 63) Looked rusty and short of fitness for the second week running. Kicking from hand again below par and isn't getting the line going. Care - 5 (Youngs 63) A 50th cap for the Harlequins No 9 will not be remembered as one of his finest. Lacked zip and pass was laboured. South Africa's Willie Roux leaps to catch a loose ball during the autumn Test in London . David Wilson drives over the line to score England's first try of the afternoon at Twickenham . Marler - 7 (Mullen 66) Another strong scrummaging display from England with the Harlequin prop to the fore. A consistent performer. Hartley - 5 . Line out throwing exemplary again and work in tight superb but blotted his copybook with a brainless stamp that led to a yellow. Wilson - 7 (Brookes 72) England cannot blame their set piece forwards for their problems. Rock solid scrummaging and carried well. Attwood - 7 (Kruis 66) Early knock-on put England on back foot and really should have put Watson away for early try. Otherwise industrious and effective. England centre Kyle Eastmond bursts through a challenge during England's clash with South Africa . England's Billy Vunipola is brought down by South Africa duo Duane Vermeulen and Schalk Burger . Lawes - 6 . Huge questions over whether he should have played following head knock last week. Line out good and work-rate high but looked heavy legged. Wood - 6 . Carried well in the second half but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work. Robshaw (c) - 6 . Honest, hard-working and with an iron will but does not seem to be inspiring his team on the field. England second best at breakdown again. Vunipola - 4 (rep Morgan 44) Easily his worst display in an England shirt. Carried valiantly but knocked on far too often. Jan Serfontein scores the opening try of the match after intercepting a Danny Care pass . SOUTH AFRICA . Le Roux - 8 . Brilliant catch and break to set up South Africa’s first try. Looked sharp all match and rock solid in defence. Pietersen - 6 . Just like his opposite men he was starved of possession  as his side chose a more direct approach. Serfontein - 7 . Defensively outstanding and powerful carrying in the best traditions of Springbok centres. Good pairing with De Villiers. De Villiers (c) - 7 . Not as many carrying opportunities as the South African skipper would have liked but defensively he is a rock. Habana - 6 . A shame one of the world’s greatest ever wingers was not given the ball to show what he can do. England's Mike Brown is brought down by try-scorer Serfontein while Jean de Villers watches on . England's Courtney Lawes charges down a kick from South Africa's Pat Lambie . Lambie - 8 . An excellent all-round display with clever kicking from hand and tidy distribution. Goal kicking also first class. Reinach - 7 Very low error count and formed a sound partnership with Lambie. Justified his selection. Mtwawarira - 6 (Nyakane 75) South Africa’s scrum was one of the few areas that creaked as the Beast was well tamed. Strauss - 7 (Du Plessis 61) Nasty, aggressive and combative within the laws, just. A nuggety performer who made a sound contribution. Du Plessis - 6 (Oosthuizen 64) Not a brilliant scrummaging performance but a fairly solid day at the coalface. South Africa's star man was Patrick Lambie who scored three penalties, two conversions and a drop goal . South Africa's players celebrate after Cobus Reinach scores a try for the Springboks at Twickenham . Etzbeth - 8 (Botha 64) Didn’t have the sort of influence he would have wanted but remains a muscular enforcer of the highest quality. Matfield - 7 . Cynical professional foul almost cost his team dearly but ultimately returned to close out the game. Coetzee - 7 . Superb defensive display and carried the ball well too. England’s back row dominated again. Burger - 8 . A man of the match display for an opposition No 7 for the second week running does not bode well for Robshaw. Vermeulen - 8 . A powerful ball carrier who was at the thick of most things for the Springboks. Impressive and aggressive.","Stuart Lancaster's sloppy side outclassed by South Africa .

"England will go into inquest mode on Monday morning and must confront the uncomfortable truth they are showing no sign of gaining ground on rugby’s leading nations, with 10 months to go until the World Cup. On Saturday they suffered a fifth successive Test defeat — the worst losing run since 2006. This was their 12th consecutive match without a win against the Springboks, also stretching back eight years. While there was talk of a narrow margin, the scoreline once again disguised glaring shortcomings — 14 English points came against 14 men and the Boks were short of their own imposing peak. Stuart Lancaster's England team is in crisis after their loss to South Africa exposed a raft of shortcomings . England celebrate Ben Morgan's try, their second while South Africa's Victor Matfield was in the sin bin . When the numbers were even, those in white were largely unable to find ways through the green wall ahead of them. Instead of building momentum for next year’s tournament, England are struggling to maintain standards set in Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach. Defeats by New Zealand and South Africa have left them in crisis going into their remaining QBE series clashes with Samoa and Australia. Those fixtures must lead to an urgent upturn in performance and results, otherwise all talk of progress will be exposed as hollow. As it is, the situation is critical and here are the pressing issues that need to be addressed… . Cut out the errors . England are making too many fundamental errors in handling and kicking, along with all the other lapses in timing and discipline which led to missed scoring chances or penalties being conceded. Dave Attwood made a searing break in the first half on Saturday but delayed his pass and a certain try was squandered. Dave Attwood made an excellent break but his poor decision-making squandered a certain try . These are the margins. Even when conditions improved, there were too many fumbles and spills and misjudgments. New Zealand’s dominance is founded on superb consistency in their catch-and-pass skills. It is not a mystery formula; it comes down to accuracy when the heat is on. England lack that edge. Playing smart . This was a much-repeated theme during the post-match discussions. There was once again a lack of English composure and authority in terms of decision-making. Wrong options were taken by scrambled minds, stalked by doubts, as typified by Danny Care’s intercepted pass which led to Jan Serfontein storming clear to score from halfway, and Owen Farrell’s ill-advised attempt to launch a counter-attack from his own 22 early on. Players are selected in part due to their natural instincts but somehow these are being eroded in the Test environment. Better ability to read the flow of the game and adapt on the hoof is needed. England's players are helpless as Jan Serfontein races away after intercepting Danny Care's pass . Trouble at No 10 . The faith shown in Owen Farrell by the management has become dangerously excessive. It is turning into a blind spot. It appears that George Ford will start at fly-half against Samoa and his promotion is overdue. England have to consider other options and accept that their first-choice playmaker’s game is in tatters at the moment. The delay in removing him on Saturday was damaging. The Saracen was clearly in discomfort and his kicking from hand had become a grave problem. He appeared hesitant in attacking the opposition’s defensive line and releasing runners around him. It was noticeable how Ford — aided and abetted by Ben Youngs’ dynamic work — managed to create space after coming on. Owen Farrell has enjoyed the faith of the coaching staff but that has become dangerously excessive . Kicking woes . This is not just about Farrell, it is a more general concern in terms of the balance of the team and the lack of impact in this key area. England have spoken about their quest to deliver more contestable kicks, but the results remain mixed. South Africa caused trouble with a clever range of astute high kicks and chips into space, such as the one with which Patrick Lambie paved the way for Cobus Reinach’s try. Farrell and Care have struggled with their in-field kicking and England’s touch-finding efforts are a major concern. With a midfield combination of Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt, Lancaster is short of front-line kicking options. Wasted wings . Look what happened when Jonny May was given the ball in space against New Zealand — he left them in his vapour trail to conjure a superb solo try. Sadly, those moments are rare. England are simply not utilising the firepower at their disposal. May and Anthony Watson were rarely released to stretch the Springboks with their blistering pace. Conditions have played their part in the last two games — necessarily narrowing the approach — but nevertheless, the inability to free strike runners is a concern. There had been an expansion of the attacking gameplan this year, based on a clever range of distribution, but it is still all too rare that England go wide and manage to circumvent the best defences. Jonny May (left) Anthony Watson (right) were rarely given the chance to stretch the Springboks defence . Breakdown bother . The rolling maul was a productive weapon on both sides at Twickenham but England continue to suffer against teams who are more effective at rucks. The Boks won too many turnovers for English comfort as home carriers were too often isolated and support was too slow to arrive. Lancaster’s men have been unable to fight fire with fire in this regard — relying on collective force due to a dearth of established poachers. They are missing the positive breakdown impact made by Joe Launchbury and Dan Cole, among others. Dylan Hartley trudges from the Twickenham pitch after being sin-binned for stamping in a ruck . Taking ‘positives’ This phrase should be banished from the England set-up. Amid all the talk of Test defeats hurting like hell, especially those at home, there is far too much willingness to apply spin. Coaches must set the tone by refusing to take minor consolations from bad results with a view to forward-planning. A young team is chosen because it is regarded as England’s finest available line-up, in which case it must be judged accordingly. Of course there will be a background focus on preparing for the World Cup next year but in their current predicament, England’s first priority must be beating Samoa and Australia. The sole ‘positive’ on England’s radar has to be dispatching all-comers to revive their momentum. Home rule matters . The grand English plan involves Twickenham becoming a fortress ahead of the 2015 showpiece event in this country, but it’s not happening — far from it. New Zealand and South Africa expect to win in London as a matter of routine and even troubled Australia will arrive with hope later this month. Twickenham should be a fortress but major southern hemisphere nations don't fear the home of rugby . In the absence of victories, all the innovations designed to ignite the crowd at HQ and raise the volume are not really working. Players walking in from the car park inside a tight cordon of stewards and numerous flashing screens imploring England fans to ‘carry them home’ are not the factors which will terrify opponents. Twickenham is no Millennium Stadium or Ellis Park. It is no bear-pit. The only way it will become a forbidding place is by the hosts winning there and gradually building up a sense of dread in away teams.","England's 28-31 loss to South Africa was their fifth successive Test defeat .
They have now gone 12 matches without victory against the Springboks .
Stuart Lancaster's side is making too many errors and wasting the wingers .
Their faith in Owen Farrell at No 10 is becoming dangerously excessive ."
"Wasps celebrated their final Aviva Premiership game at Adams Park in style by crushing bottom club London Welsh 71-7 to move up to fifth in the table. After 12 years at High Wycombe, Wasps are moving to Coventry and they ensured it was memorable farewell with an 11-try mauling over a Welsh side who slumped to a seventh successive loss in the top flight. Ashley Johnson and Christian Wade led the way with a hat-trick of tries apiece, while Nathan Hughes (two), Saliosi Tagicakibau, Joe Simpson and Tom Varndell also crossed for the hosts. Sailosi Tagickabau scores Wasps' third try of the afternoon against a hapless London Welsh . Andy Goode converted six of those tries before Alex Lozowski took over kicking duties to add two more. Welsh, meanwhile, could only manage a single try from replacement Ben Pienaar on the hour-mark, which was converted by Will Robinson. The hapless visitors lost three players to injury in the first half so it was little surprise that they fell away to a seventh defeat since winning promotion to the Premiership, during which time they have secured only one point and conceded a mammoth 343 points. Wasps selected a very strong side with James Haskell, Wade and Elliot Daly all in the starting line-up. Welsh, meanwhile, included new recruits Chris Hala’ufia and Opeti Fonua in their match day squad with Hala’ufia at number eight and Fonua on the bench. Seb Jewell and Rob Lewis were both recalled while flanker Lachlan McCaffrey made his first appearance in six weeks. Joe Simpson scores a try despite the efforts of Seb Segmann during their Aviva premiership clash . The tone was set for a miserable afternoon for Welsh when Wasps crossed for their opening try after just 70 seconds. At a set scrum 25 metres out, the visitors lost possession on their own feed and Wasps capitalised for Hughes to crash over for the try, which Goode converted. Welsh prop Pablo Henn was also injured in that first engagement to be replaced by Shane Cahill before the visitors fell further behind when Johnson forced his way over from a close-range line-out. Wasps also suffered an early injury setback when Jake Cooper-Woolley limped off with Lorenzo Cittadini coming on before Welsh had their first chance for points, only for Will Robinson to push his penalty kick wide. Wasps scored their third try, the best of the match, with a sweeping movement in the 17th minute. Christian Wade scores his second try of the games as Wasps strolled to victory in High Wycombe . From a scrum on halfway Hughes burst away, Chris Bell made a telling contribution before Tagicakibau was left with a simple task of scoring with Goode converting for a 21-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. The visitors declined the chance to get some points on the board in favour of a couple of attacking line-outs, but their ambition went unrewarded before they suffered another blow when Hala’ufia was carried off on a stretcher following a huge collision with Simon McIntyre. After receiving lengthy attention, McIntyre was able to continue but Fonua came on for the Welsh to make his debut. Nick Scott became the third Welsh player in the opening half-hour to leave the field with an injury before Wasps had the game all-but wrapped before the interval with their bonus point try from Hughes, who collected a fumble from Jewell for an easy run in to make it 26-0 at the break. Within five minutes of the restart, the home side were over again when Daly ran straight past a weak tackling attempt from replacement Andy Awcock before giving Wade a 35-metre run to the line. Both Wade and Ashley Johnson scored three tries each as Wasps went over the line 11 times . The lively Simpson and Hughes created a second try of the afternoon for Johnson with Goode converting with an excellent touchline kick to bring Wasps up to 40 points. At that stage, Hughes and James Cannon were replaced by Sam Jones and Kearnan Myall, with Myall’s first contribution being a splendid long pass to provide Simpson with a deserved try. Pienaar gave Welsh a brief moment of celebration with his try before Wasps continued to empty their bench with Daly, McIntyre, and Goode all departing. Hughes and Johnson were the star performers for the hosts with Johnson completing his hat-trick by finishing off another line-out drive. Wade then followed suit with two late tries and there was one for replacement Varndell as their opponents were torn to ribbons.","Ashley Johnson, Christian Wade Nathan Hughes , Saliosi Tagicakibau, Joe Simpson and Tom Varndell all scored tries for London Wasps .

"Read Chris Foy's report from Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster has admitted he is feeling the heat following England’s fifth consecutive defeat on Saturday. After his side lost 31-28 to South Africa at Twickenham, Lancaster conceded: ‘Clearly the pressure is on because we’ve not achieved our objectives.’ But despite England’s woeful form, their head coach was still trying to be positive about their performances. England coach Stuart Lancaster admits the pressure is on his team after they suffered their fifth straight loss . South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England . ‘We’ve had five games against the top two sides in the world and we’ve not been smashed in any of them,’ he said. ‘In a lot of ways we’ve been reasonably dominant against them. ‘Internally there’s a very strong group working hard together and there’s no sense of the pressure affecting people.’ Nevertheless, England are poised to make changes for the third QBE Test against Samoa in five days’ time, with a leading source of concern being the form of fly-half Owen Farrell. There will be a potentially ‘nasty’ review today before urgent steps are taken to rectify the glaring deficiencies which are undermining their build-up to next year’s home World Cup. England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . England's Springbok loss comes a week after their defeat by New Zealand and 11 months before World Cup . Flanker Tom Wood said that England need to keep on plugging away with the World Cup coming up . Lancaster said: ‘I don’t think any team stops developing or learning but the clock ultimately stops at the World Cup. You also know that if you don’t win in the short term, while also trying to develop the side in the long term, then pressure can be caused by not winning consistently.’ Flanker Tom Wood added: ‘We understand we will come under a lot of pressure now. Everyone relates everything to the World Cup and puts it in that context and we just have to stay tight, keep plugging on and make sure we keep doing the basics well and preparing as well as we can.’ There have been widespread calls for Farrell to be dropped in the light of his poor form and the fact that he appeared to be in considerable discomfort on Saturday. But Lancaster said: ‘We have a lot of faith in Owen as a player and as a person. We’ll be sticking by him.’","England beaten 31-28 by South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Sentenced: Martyn Jones, 40, who had 17 previous convictions, was jailed for three years over the crash . A hit-and-run driver who left a pedestrian in a coma after mowing him down while being chased by police had been speeding because he was desperate for the toilet, a court heard yesterday. Martyn Jones, 40, whose four-year-old son was with him in the car, was jailed for three years after admitting leaving Tekie Yamani, 37, with brain injuries, fractured ribs and memory loss. At the time of the 60mph crash in the Deane area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, witnesses said the pedestrian was thrown into the air and landed up to 50ft further along the road. Jones - who had 17 previous convictions - had soiled himself and was being chased by two officers in a police van. They had noticed his erratic driving as he left a nearby McDonald’s restaurant. Katy Appleton, defending, told Bolton Crown Court that Jones suffered from difficulties with his bowel movements and wore a colostomy bag. She said: ‘He had visited his daughter and was in a distressed state. He was desperate to go to the toilet and soiled himself, which led to the very unfortunate events.’ His victim Mr Yamani, a taxi driver and father-of-three originally from Eritrea, was walking to a shop on Wigan Road to buy a phone card when he was struck by the car, on July 18 at about 12pm. Crash scene: Jones had soiled himself and was being chased by two officers in a police van in Deane, Bolton . Jones claimed to police he was unaware that he had hit a person, instead thinking someone had hit his car with a metal bar in an attempted carjacking. But he drove his blue Vauxhall Astra to a friend’s house in nearby Leigh and asked him to keep the vehicle, with the damaged windscreen covered up. The court heard that Jones’s speed was about twice the legal limit and he was seen weaving in and out of traffic and overtaking vehicles. John Hatton, who was driving a bus which Jones overtook, said it was ‘the worst driving’ he had ever seen in his career. Dangerous: Jones’s speed was about twice the legal limit and he was seen weaving in and out of traffic . Mr Yamani suffered a serious brain injury and post-traumatic amnesia, the court heard. He was in a coma for the three weeks after the accident. CCTV footage which captured the horrifying moment Mr Yamani was struck was played to the court. Jones, who lives in a £60,000 terraced house in Leigh, pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop. Recorder Stuart Driver said: ‘This was a prolonged and deliberate case of serious bad driving. ‘Your victim was a pedestrian and a vulnerable road user. You did all this while you had your vulnerable four-year-old son in the car with you.’","Martyn Jones, 40, was driving in Greater Manchester with son, four, in car .

"England were beaten 31-28 by South Africa on Saturday, extending their winless run against the Springboks to 12 games. Here, Sportsmail looks at five things we learned from Twickenham. South Africa celebrate the only try of the first half during their 31-28 victory over England on Saturday . Too many unforced errors - England must make most of pressure . It's an all-too-familiar story for England fans, but again the hosts at Twickenham dominated possession and had the majority of the territory against the Springboks. But fumbled balls, especially in the first-half, cost Stuart Lancaster's side time and time again. New Zealand would have capitalised more than South Africa too, which is a worrying thought. England made too many mistakes against South Africa and were punished for not converting chances . Time for Ford . England's kicking let them down again on Saturday, and although you can never doubt Owen Farrell's goal-kicking, it is perhaps time for George Ford to enter the fray permanently. The 21-year-old can control the tempo and has the creativity to unlock defences, even though he may not have quite proved it in his brief substitute appearance. Owen Farrell's place-kicking is exemplary but his place in the side is coming under threat . South Africa hoodoo . The Springboks are the second best side in the world, undoubtedly, but 12 games without a win against them is turning into an England hoodoo. Unlike the hosts, South Africa were clinical when they entered the opposition's 22, and were in fact only really troubled when they were a man down in the second-half. Jan Serfontein runs away for his try as the Springboks made it 12 on the bounce against England . Changes for Samoa . Three-point defeats may sound like they are narrow, but the visitors were much better than England on Saturday. It was a similar story against New Zealand, and Lancaster surely must look to freshen things up against Samoa. Marland Yarde and Ben Youngs could be options, with the Leicester half-back impressing after replacing Danny Care. Ben Youngs impressed at scrum half when he replaced Danny Care and could start against Samoa . Unfortunate debut for Anthony Watson . The young winger couldn't quite show fans what he was about at Twickenham. This wasn't helped by some lazy decision-making from Farrell early on, who flicked an inside ball towards the younster by his own corner with two South African defenders closing in. Three points would follow. With the vast amount of options to return after this series, Watson may have to wait for his next big chance on the international stage.

"One young woman made the decision to take control of her weight when random strangers began calling her fat in the street. Kim Bowman, 22, from Wirral, Merseyside, lost 5st 7lb this year through an online bikini guide and is now competing as a bikini model. At her heaviest Kim weighed 13st 4lb and was turning to junk food on a regular basis. Scroll down for video . Kim's bad eating habits and university drinking saw her weight rise to 13st 4lb and strangers called her fat on the street . Totally transforming her diet and beginning a vigorous exercise regime has seen Kim transformed into a bikini model weighing a slim 8st (right, and left on stage in a bikini competition) 'I knew my eating was getting out of control, but every time I looked in the mirror I felt sick, and then I would turn to food to comfort myself which would only make me feel happy for a short period of time' She added; 'I was really athletic when I was younger but the vicious cycle began when I went to university and I let myself go. 'I was drinking and binge eating a lot and I lost track of everything and every time I went up a dress size I would blame the clothes shop' Although Kim ripped her jeans on several occasions because of her weight gain, the moment of realisation came when she was called fat by complete strangers in the street. The transformation that Kim has undergone in just a year is quite remarkable, and she says she loves her new lifestyle . Despite the rude comments, from that moment on, Kim became determined to get her weight under control and change her unhealthy lifestyle. A friend had told her about the LDN Muscle Bikini plan which is a downloadable 80 page guide of  training and nutritional guidance. Doing a mix of exercises, Kim began to learn about nutrition and what food her body needed. 'It totally changed my perspective on food, now I see it as fuel. I'll look at a meal and see how much protein, how much carbs are in it. When I gave myself a week off I didn't even want the junk food! 'I still use the guide now and I have a trainer for competitions. I absolutely love this lifestyle - it becomes addictive,' she explains. Kim admits that before she began her diet she had no idea about good nutrition or what she should eat . The transformation wasn't easy and Kim began training seven times a week and swapped junk food for healthy meals such as spinach omelettes for breakfast, tuna burgers for lunch and chicken and goats cheese salads for dinner. This dramatic change of lifestyle resulted in Kim quickly shedding the unwanted pounds. Within a year she weighed in at 8st, fitting into a size six with a 25in waist. In the gym people began to compliment Kim about her transformation and suggested that she take part in bikini model competitions. Breakfast: Cereal bars or toast . Lunch: A sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar . Dinner:Roast dinner, take away or frozen meal like a chicken Kiev . Snacks: Constantly picking on biscuits and crisps from vending machines . Breakfast: Four egg white omelette with spinach . Lunch: Lean turkey mince burger with sweet potato and vegetables . Dinner: Tuna with rice and vegetables . Snacks: Nothing . Kim enlisted the help of a bikini model coach Lynsey Beattie who helped her prepare for her first competition where she placed in the top 5. Speaking to MailOnline about stepping out on stage in a tiny bikini Kin says: 'It was really, really scary. Probably one of the most petrifying moments of my life to be honest. 'In my mind I'm still the big girl I was before, I don't see what other people do. 'When I had visited a Body Power expo I had seen all the models and thought I would love to do that, and when people started making comments about me entering I started to think ""what's the worst that could happen? I've got nothing to lose"" 'It ended up being really empowering because everyone was so complimentary. Now I am  preparing for my next competition.'","A poor diet and university drinking saw Kim's weight reach 13st 4lb .

"The presence of strange balls of light hovering over a valley in central Norway has baffled scientists for years. Known as the Hessdalen Phenomenon, the flashing orbs can be as large as cars and have even attracted attention from ufologists. But now scientists think the unusual lights could be formed by a natural ‘battery’ buried deep underground, created by metallic minerals reacting with a sulphurous river running through it. Scroll down for video . Great balls of fire? Flashing balls of light that can be as large of cars are known as the Hessdalen Phenomenon (pictured). They have attracted attention from ufologists, but now scientists think the unusual lights could be formed by a natural 'battery' Jader Monari of the Institute of Radio . Astronomy in Medicina, Italy, has studied the Hessdalen site since 1996. He found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side . of the river running through it, and rich in copper on the other side. Monari then used rock samples from the site in Oslo to create a miniature valley and dunked them in river . sediment. He found that electricity flowed between the two rocks and . that this could light a lamp. Dr . Monari believes bubbles of ionised gas are created when sulphurous . fumes from the River Hesja react with the humid air of the valley. The . geology also forms electromagnetic field lines in the valley, which . could explain why the orbs of light move around. If the theory is proven . correct, it could open up a new way of storing energy. Some of the lights drift gently through the sky for up to two hours, while others flash white or blue and streak through the valley, disappearing in seconds, New Scientist reported. A computer engineer called Erling Strand from Ostfold University in Norway, has been looking for the physics behind the natural phenomenon since 1982, when frequent light shows captured the attention of the press and scientists alike. He set up Project Hessdalen in a bid to unite experts trying to unravel the mystery of how the mysterious orbs are formed, and was able to quickly rule out theories that the lights came from planes, vehicles or buildings. The researchers noticed a small fluctuation in the areas’ magnetic field before the formation of the lights, but when they measured radioactivity and seismic activity – both of which could cause such a phenomenon – there was nothing unusual at the site 248miles (400km) north of Oslo. An international team of experts then measured the size, shape and speed of the orbs using radar and spectral analysis to examine the elements that make up the light. Fully charged: One expert has studied the Hessdalen site since 1996 and has found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side of the river running through it, and rich in copper on the other side. The sulphurous water in the river creates a giant battery . They revealed that the lights make no sound, appear to be cool and do not leave any scorch marks on the ground, unlike ball lightning. They do however sterilise an area upon contact, killing the soil microbes. Jader Monari of the Institute of Radio Astronomy in Medicina, Italy, has studied the Hessdalen site since 1996 and found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side of the river running through it, and rich in copper on the other side. ‘If there is sulphur in the water in the middle, it makes a perfect battery’ he said. Together with a colleague from the University of Bologna, the scientists used rock samples to create a miniature valley and dunked them in river sediment. They found that electricity flowed between the two rocks and that this could light a lamp. Dr Monari believes that bubbles of ionised gas are created when sulphurous fumes from the River Hesja react with the humid air of the valley. The geology also forms electromagnetic field lines in the valley, which could explain why the orbs of light move around. ‘This electrical field creates a path that could be the ‘main road’ of the lights inside the valley,’ Dr Monari told Caroline Williams. Bjorn Gitle Hauge, an electrical engineer at Ostfold University, thinks that the energy needed to make the clouds glow could come from the charge building up. There are many other competing theories as to how the light may be formed, although the battery theory seems to be the most probable based upon current evidence. Scientists revealed that the lights of Hessdalen - which lies 248miles (400km) north of Oslo - make no sound, appear to be cool and do not leave any scorch marks on the ground, unlike ball lightning. They do, however, sterilise an area upon contact, killing soil microbes . Some experts think some sort of plasma causes the light as when a gas ionises it forms a cloud of ions and electrons – plasma – that produce light. Plasmas can be cool to touch and can also kill microbes, but they require incredibly high temperatures and a huge supply of energy to be produced. Others believe the lights are a type of ball lightning because similar balls of light spotted and analysed in China showed they were formed of silicon, iron and calcium – which are present in the Hessdalen lights, along with the addition of an element called scandium. But the Hessdalen lights do not appear when there is lightning, leading Dr Hauge to suggest another idea. He proposed that the valley’s shape, climate and geology generate a massive electric charge and that static electricity on the mountains were whipped up by strong winds. Other experts believe the lights are powered by radioactivity and the decay of radon in the atmosphere. They think the lights are made from ‘dusty plasma’ containing ionised dust particles. They will search for the presence of radon in the valley to test their idea that bubbles of the gas could erupt from the ground, pick up dust and enter the air as a glowing orb. Whatever the reason for the lights’ formation, the answer could lead to a new way of storing energy. ‘If we have some kind of installation that we could pick up charged particles and lock them inside, then you can store energy,’ Dr Hauge said.","Hessdalen lights can be as large as cars and have been spotted in Oslo .

"A seaside town got a trendy new look when some mystery knitters covered public spaces in brightly coloured crochets. Residents in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset awoke to find walls, seats, decking and statues in the seafront gardens covered in knitwear.

"Canadian pop sensation Justin Bieber may have the largest number of Twitter followers in the world - but more than half of them are fake, it emerged today. The teenage singer has 37.3million followers on the popular social network, and overtook previous record-holder Lady Gaga earlier this year. However Justin, 19, does not only hold the crown for most followers, but also the most bogus ones. Emperor's new tweets: More than half of Justin Bieber's followers are fake accounts and not real 'Beliebers', knocking off his King of Twitter crown . Only 17.8million of Justin Bieber’s Twitter followers are real accounts, a mere 47 per cent of his total number of followers, according to social media analytics experts Socialbakers. A fake account is one which has one or no followers and follow less than 50 others. It can also be one which is used to send spam tweets or one which has never tweeted at all. With less than half of his Twitter fans ‘real', Justin’s loses his King of Twitter title to previous top-dog Lady Gaga, whose authentic followers reach 19million. This is the latest blow to the young star, who has been displaying increasingly erratic behaviour, since splitting up with his actress girlfriend Selena Gomez in December 2012. Bieber faced allegations of marijuana abuse after being snapped holding a suspicious cigarette at a party in February. Fake fans: Only 47 per cent of Justin Bieber's 37.3million Twitter followers are real accounts . Irrational behaviour: Justin Bieber gets into a fight with a paparazzi outside his hotel in London after leaving his young fans waiting for two hours at a concert . During his visit to London earlier this year, he engaged in public spats with paparazzi and displayed shocking diva-like manners as he kept young fans waiting for over two hours before taking to the stage at the O2 Arena in the capital. After he was jetted out of the country, he swore to never return. Bieber's irrational actions have continued during the Europe-leg of his tour. He has been photographed in gas masks and covering his face with a blanket to avoid the cameras - in stark contrast to his behaviour in Frankfurt, Germany when he was seen walking in freezing weather without a shirt on. His most recent controversy involves a baby capuchin monkey called Mally, a 19th birthday present form a music producer friend, who was confiscated by customs in Munich. Despite an outrage from animal experts who argue 14-week-old Mally was taken from his mother more than a year too soon, Bieber is reportedly doing everything he can to get his very own Bubbles back.

"Facebook and Twitter users should make up fake names and not use their real identity, according to a senior government advisor. Andy Smith, head of internet security at the Cabinet Office, claimed using pseudonyms online ‘a very sensible thing to do’. But his suggestion sparked claims that his advice would encourage criminal activity and was at odds with advice from ministers. Cabinet Office head of internet security Andy Smith warned against using real names and birth dates online . It comes at a time when the government is considering allowing people to use their existing log-ins for social networking sites to access a new government website to apply for benefits, passports and driving licences. Mr Smith told a Whitehall conference: ‘When you put information on the internet do not use your real name, your real date of birth. ‘When you are putting information on social networking sites don't put real combinations of information, because it can be used against you.’ Fraudsters could compile personal information ‘from Google, social networking sites, from email footers, all sorts of places’, he warned. Criminals were capable of ‘bringing this information together and cross-correlating information and then they are using it against you’. Mr Smith said people should give correct information when they were filling in government forms on the internet, like tax returns. 'Outrageous': Shadow culture minister Helen Goodman, left, and her opposite Ed Vaizey, right, were critical of the idea . But culture minister Ed Vaizey said he ‘wouldn't encourage people to put false identities on the internet’ even on social networking sites. Mr Vaizey added: ‘The way of viewing this issue is that we should work with Facebook to ensure people feel secure using those sites and that there is not a threat of identity theft. ‘It's also important for the government to work with consumers, to educate consumers about the threat of identity theft and what kind of details we should and shouldn't put online,’ he told the BBC. Simon Milner, Facebook's head of policy in the UK and Ireland, told the conference he had a ‘vigorous chat’ with Mr Smith to persuade him to revise his view. Labour’s shadow culture minister Helen Goodman said Mr Smith’s comments were ‘totally outrageous’. ‘This is the kind of behaviour that, in the end, promotes crime,’ she told the BBC. ‘It is exactly what we don't want. We want more security online. It's anonymity which facilitates cyber-bullying, the abuse of children. ‘I was genuinely shocked that a public official could say such a thing.’","Cabinet Office boss warns against using real ID and birth date online .

"From crocheted boyfriends to woolly teapots, it would seem there's little that can't be created with a pair of knitting needles and a few balls of wool. But one Polish artist has decided to take things a step further and has covered an entire train with colourful crochet. And by covering the full-scale Px48 steam locomotive engine and carriages in crochet, artist Olek - real-name Agata Oleksiak - says she has pulled off her largest 'yarn bombing' to date. Hard work: It took Polish artist Olek two days working round the clock to completely cover this train in yarn . Impressed: The crochet-covered train has proved a hit with Lodz locals and will be on display until the 19th . Olek, whose previous projects include full body 'wearable sculptures' and a crocheted grapefruit, worked around the . clock for two days in Lodz, Poland to cover the train in yarn, working . with four assistants and braving cold, rainy weather to complete it. 'Yarn bombing' - also known as guerrilla knitting and yarn storming - is a type of street art that involves covering anything from trees to benches in brightly coloured knits. Although yarn bombing has been around since 2004, this is the first time that anything as big as a train has been attempted. According to Olek, the work, which will be on display until the 19th August, pays tribute to famous Polish poet Julian Tuwim, whose poem entitled The Locomotive is cherished in Poland and is being celebrated throughout the year.

Intricate: Completing the gargantuan yarn bombing operation involved two days of continuous knitting . Olek has named the work Deadly Romance to reflect how gruelling it was to complete. She explains: 'We all know this particular poem about the Locomotive by Tuwim. It is probably one of the first things I had to memorise. 'It is nice to come back to Poland to be able to create such a powerful piece. I was in London at the Animal Ball in the presence of Prince Charles in July. 'Then early the next day I took a morning flight to Poland (wearing my costume and mask from last night) to work on the locomotive. 'I had the best crew ever. They worked as hard as I always do. I called this train 'Deadly Romance' as I love it, but it almost killed me.' Completed: The vast locomotive and its carriages were thoroughly yarn bombed - despite the rainy weather .

"Created: . 13:22 EST, 13 December 2013 . A gynaecologist who stood behind a patient and groped her breasts claimed it was how he had been taught to do an examination at medical school in India. Dr Angamathu Arunkalaivanan put the woman through ‘three years of hell’ after he carried out a ‘sexually motivated’ examination during an appointment at a private hospital. The married practitioner, who goes by the name of Dr Arun, denied he was at fault and insisted it was how he had been instructed to check breasts while training in Madras. But the 49-year-old patient sought independent advice about whether the way she had been examined was inappropriate. After her suspicions were confirmed the woman, identified as patient A, contacted the police who referred the case to the General Medical Council. BMI Edgbaston Hospital where Dr Arun worked. The married practitioner denied he was at fault . Yesterday the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service in Manchester found Dr Arun, 48, guilty of misconduct . and suspended him for a year. The doctor, who has an NHS post as . consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Birmingham City Hospital, . was also found to be at fault for failing to offer a chaperone or make a . record of the breast check in the patient’s notes. The . panel was told how during the consultation in October 2010 at BMI The . Edgbaston Hospital in Birmingham, Dr Arun asked the woman to lift up her . top and bra, before cupping and squeezing her breasts with both hands . from behind. Patient A told the hearing she still ‘beats herself up’ for . allowing herself to be ‘sexually assaulted’. She . said: ‘I left the room that day and I just ... it just felt so wrong. I . could just not get the examination out of my head and I actually said, . “What just happened in there?” ’ Describing . the doctor’s response to her complaint, she added: ‘He didn’t deny . anything I said. He said that’s how he was taught in India.’ She told . the panel she was so disturbed she could not even bring herself to tell . her husband. The panel . was told that Dr Arun, who qualified from the University of Madras in . 1988, had been questioned over the incident by director of nursing Pat . Munday. He agreed with the patient’s description of what happened, but . said it was the way he had been taught at medical school. The patient was told this by Mrs Munday and offered an apology from the doctor, but felt this was not sufficient. She contacted another breast screening centre, which told her that what she had experienced was not normal, so she went to the police. Panel chairman Sandra Sturdy told Dr Arun: ‘The panel accepted that this is an isolated case and that the breast examination was clinically indicated. ‘However, the manner in which you conducted the breast examination on Patient A was clearly sexually motivated. Your conduct ... amounted to serious misconduct.’ Announcing his suspension, she said it would be ‘disproportionate’ to strike him off the medical register, which would ‘deprive the public of the benefit of your medical services’. On 6 March 2014 the High Court heard an appeal by Mr Arunkalaivanan against the findings by the panel that he had carried out an inappropriate breast examination and that he had been sexually motivated in doing so. The judge concluded Mr Arunkalaivanan had not been sexually motivated, and quashed his suspension.  However, she upheld the tribunal’s conclusion that he had carried out an inappropriate breast examination and sent the matter back to the tribunal for it to decide whether Mr Arunkalaivanan should receive a warning over the examination and his admitted failure to ensure a chaperone had been present.

It also noted that Mr Arunkalaivanan had tried to apologise to the patient and had taken steps to remedy his breast examination technique.  The tribunal decided that the public interest did not require a warning.

"Neil Lennon will move to make Kris Commons his first signing as Bolton manager in January. Lennon signed the midfielder for Celtic from Derby County for £300,000 in January 2011 and will now offer him the chance to return to the Championship with the Trotters. Despite being the reigning SFWA and PFA Scotland Player of the Year, Commons hasn’t always been an automatic pick for Ronny Deila at Celtic Park this season. Midfielder Kris Commons (centre) in action for Celtic against Hamilton Accies earlier this month . Following his omission from the starting side which exited the Champions League at the hands of Maribor, Sportsmail revealed that the player was considering his future. Deila has subsequently admitted he may have made an error by initially benching the 31-year-old that night. So far, however, little progress has been made in talks between the player and the club with regard to extending his contract beyond the current season. Lennon has admitted he could consider returning to Celtic for players as he bids to drag Bolton away from the foot of the Championship. Commons tops that list but others – including Welsh defender Adam Matthews – are known to be in his thinking. Neil Lennon pictured at the Macron Stadium on Monday after becoming the new Bolton manager . Former Scotland midfielder Commons was a revelation when he joined the Parkhead club midway through Lennon’s first full season in Glasgow, scoring 15 goals in five months. He scored just once the following campaign but bounced back with 19 goals in season 2012-13 before hitting the net 31 times last term as he swept the individual prizes for players. Commons has already indicated that he would prefer to stay in Glasgow but Lennon’s appointment at Bolton this week may prove a game-changer. Meanwhile, Commons’ Celtic’s team-mate Stefan Johansen has been forced to deny that he deliberately slide tackled Bulgaria manager Ljuboslav Penev during Norway’s 2-1 victory in Oslo on Monday night. Norway's Stefan Johansen slide tackles Bulgaria manager Ljuboslav Penev in Oslo on Monday . The Parkhead player was voted man of the match after the Group H European qualifer but sparked controversy during the game when he followed through on a challenge near the touchline and took out the Bulgarian boss as well. Johansen was booked for the incident after being surrounded by angry opponents and was later accused by Penev of deliberately barging into him. ‘I’m all right, but I’m convinced Johansen did it on purpose,’ said the manager after the match. However, Johansen insisted it was an accident, saying: ‘I slide tackled him, but it was not intentional. We shook hands immediately afterwards. Then it was okay.’","Neil Lennon will offer Kris Commons the chance to move to Bolton .

"A depressed rugby league player hanged himself just four days after his fiancée called off their engagement, an inquest heard. Anthony Hughes, 30, was set to tie the knot with Charlotte Thompson - who he had been going out with for four years - but his severe bouts of depression put too much strain on the relationship. She broke off their engagement on July 6 and four days later the devastated father-of-one texted her saying: 'I'm sorry for everything.' Later that day Mr Hughes was found dead by his mother after he had sent her a text urging her not to go to his house in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Tragic: Anthony Hughes hanged himself on July 10 - four days after his fiancee Charlotte Thompson broke off their engagement . Mr Hughes, who proposed to Miss Thompson last November, had struggled with depression for nine years after breaking up with his son's mother - but was not prescribed anti-depressants until 2011. He had twice made an attempt on his own life in the past. In 2005 he tried to take an overdose and last year he was found by police preparing to jump from a motorway bridge, but was talked down and taken to hospital. Speaking at the Bolton inquest into his death, Miss Thompson urged men suffering from depression to seek help and not be 'embarrassed' by the condition. She said: 'Anthony was amazing - a brilliant dad and a brilliant partner. He was really loving. 'But the depression did come on quickly so it was still a shock when it happened. People are still embarrassed by depression even though it is becoming more recognised now. Proposal: The couple got engaged in November last year and had been in a relationship for four years . 'It's not something to be ashamed of and men who feel as though they are suffering should go forward and get help as soon as they recognise they have a problem.' Earlier the inquest heard how Mr Hughes - a winger for Wigan St Pat's - had played rugby league for England schoolboys and worked as a sports youth development officer - alongside volunteers from the Prince's Trust. Miss Thompson said of her relationship with Mr Hughes: 'We had our problems as people do. He did have down periods and up periods with the depression which we worked through. 'There was a strain because of his problems and around the end of May we decided to have a trial separation where I moved back to my parents' house. 'Around July 6 I decided the relationship couldn't continue. I still saw him but he didn't take it well at all. I saw him and he was really upset. 'He didn't go to work that week and he was really down but I stayed with him on Monday July 7 then went to work on the Tuesday. 'He was still upset and wasn't going to work. During that day I received texts form him and some of those stated he intended to harm himself. Prone to depression: The father-of-one, 30, was said to have suffered from the illness since 2005 . 'He also threatened to kill himself during the texts. I didn't think he was being serious. 'I saw him on Wednesday July 9 and he seemed a lot more positive. He text me 6 o clock the next morning and said he had been up all night and it was as if he finally accepted the relationship was over. 'He was apologising, saying ""I'm sorry for everything"". Looking back it seems he had made the decision but he wasn't making threats like he had been. 'He rang me at about 12.20pm when I was at work. We spoke for about a minute and I said I would ring him back later. 'He paused for a while and said ""bye"" and that was it. I tried to ring him as soon as I could but couldn't get hold of him. 'He was very troubled by depression but from around November to May he had made lots of progress and was mostly back to his usual self but when we had a falling out he went right back down to rock-bottom.' Mr Hughes' mother Patricia, a pub landlady said: 'He was the perfect son. He was very active and enjoyed sports, especially rugby league. 'In his job he helped a lot of young people and found it very rewarding. His depression started around the time he broke up with his son's mum. Talented: Mr Hughes played on the wing for Wigan St Pat's rugby league team and had represented England schoolboys in the sport as a teenager . 'He became more withdrawn, his work suffered. Before that he never felt sad at any time, he couldn't process that feeling. 'He was happy-go-lucky and succeeded in everything he did but then everything just turned upside down for him.' She added: 'He and Charlotte were planning to be married but his last bout of depression came on so severely. I don't think any of us could see it coming. 'He had been getting on with his life. He came to me and it had been going on because he and Charlotte had split up which had been brought on with his depression. 'He came to see me and told me he was going to do it. He told me he was going to kill himself. We had arranged an appointment with the mental health crisis team for the earliest time we could. 'My last contact with him was a text on the day he died where he asked me not to go to his address.' Mr Hughes' GP, Dr Naveen Lokikere, said: 'We spoke about a possible suicide attempt when he had been found with a tie around his neck. 'He confirmed that he was feeling better but a further appointment was arranged. He said he had bounced back and was not feeling suicidal.' On the day of his death Dr Lokikere spoke to Mr Hughes and offered him an appointment but he failed to show up for it. Recording a suicide verdict coroner Rachel Griffin said: 'He was a popular young man with many friends, was very close to his family and was a very hard-worker. 'His most recent job as a youth development officer saw him help a lot of young people and he did considerable work to help others. 'Unfortunately Anthony had problems in his life. Depression is an illness and one that is difficult and challenging to overcome and quite clearly he had periods when he was well and in good spirits and also periods of very low mood. 'For years he battled with that illness and worked hard to combat it. 'In early July following a temporary separation and reduced contact with Miss Thompson, the relationship between them came to an end which distressed him very much and saddened him and he found it very difficult to deal with. 'This is a very tragic case as Anthony was clearly a very well-liked and well-loved young man who was instrumental in his work helping others, but sadly had his own problems to fight which he did try to.'

Burnley bought Ings for £1m from Bournemouth and now value him at around £10m but will be left asking for compensation in the summer as Ings is under 23.

"A 2-year-old Utah boy is dead after his 3-year-old sister accidentally shot him last week with a loaded rifle that was left in her family's living room after her father had used the gun earlier in the day. The unidentified boy was shot in the stomach with a .22-caliber rifle in Cache County, Utah - a rural part of the state just south of the Idaho border - about 6:40 p.m. Friday in what law enforcement officials are calling 'a tragic accident.' The boy is the fourth person killed in the U.S. this month by a gun that found its way into the hands of a child. Careless: A 2-year-old boy was killed by his 3-year-old sister while she was playing with a rifle the kids' father had left in the living room of this Utah home . 'The gun had been used earlier in the day by the victim's father and was . set down after returning home,' Cache County Sheriff's Lt. Mike . Peterson said in a press release given to KUTV.com. 'The gun was in an unloaded state but did . have live rounds in the magazine. We believe the three-year-old had to . manipulate the action enough to chamber a live round prior to the . incident occurring.' The children's mother heard the gun go off and immediately called for help. First responders - some living just a few houses away, according to Desert News - hurried to the scene and rushed the boy to a local hospital in critical condition. After undergoing surgery at Logan Regional Hospital, the boy was airlifted to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was pronounced dead. Peterson went on to say that the incident is just a tragic reminder of the dangers of not properly securing firearms. Tragic: 22-year-old Alexandra Anita Santos was fatally shot by her friend's 6-year-old son who found gun in the back seat of his mother's car . 'It really does just reiterate that weapons are dangerous and you just . need to take extra precautions with them,' Peterson said. 'You just . can't be safe enough.' It's unclear whether anyone will be charged with a crime in the boy's death - Peterson says investigators are taking statements and reviewing evidence before they pass the case on to the county attorney, who will decide whether charges will be filed. 'Where it is an accident, we're allowing the family the time that they . need to take care of what they need to,' Peterson said Friday. 'But we . will conclude the investigation. We'll find out when the weapon came . into play, how it came into play, all the details that go along with . that.' On Thursday, in Easley, South Carolina, a 6-year-old boy accidentally shot a 22-year-old woman when he fired a gun he found in the backseat of the vehicle in which the two were riding. Alexandra Anita Santos was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle when the boy - who was seated in the back of the vehicle - fired the weapon through the seat and into Santos. Senseless: 11-year-old Jamara Stevens was killed when her 2-year-old brother accidentally shot her . The boy's mother, who was driving the car, had to call Santos' family and relay the horrible news. However, she told them that Santos' ex-boyfriend - and not her son - was responsible for Santos' death. Santos' family didn't buy that explanation and are 'angry' the unidentified friend would blame the tragic incident on their daughter's ex. 'You give any kind of access to a firearm six-year-old child, somebody needs to be responsible,' Santos' mother, Cynthia Yergeau, told foxcarolina.com. 'Take responsibility, own up to what your kids did.' Earlier this month, on April 12, a 7-year-old girl was killed at a birthday party in South Carolina after a 5-year-old boy accidentally fired a gun that he thought was a toy. Jamara's mother was down the hall in this Philadelphia home when she was shot by her 2-year-old brother . Lexington County Sheriff James Metts says the boy was trying to get a toy gun out of a trunk Saturday night at a home in Gaston when he picked up a real gun also in the trunk by mistake. Deputies say the bullet went through a car, and fragments hit Juliet Lynch in the chest. She died a short time later. Metts says the real gun belonged to the boyfriend of the boy's mother and she did not know it was in the trunk. The sheriff says charges could be filed in the shooting. Police did not release the name of the boy, his mother or boyfriend. On April 5, a 2-year-old boy in Philadelphia fatally shot his 11-year-old sister while playing with a handgun that was left in a room with the two unattended children. Irresponsible: Stevens was killed by a gun similar to this one, which authorities say was left on the top of the fridge by her mother's boyfriend . The bullet hit Jamara Stevens in the chest, piercing her heart. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital shortly after. Authorities found gunpowder residue on the boy's hand, NBC Philadelphia reports. Investigators believe the gun belonged to the boyfriend of the children's mother, who had visited the home earlier in the day and left his .357-caliber handgun with an 8-inch barrel on top of the refrigerator.","The 3-year-old Utah girl accidentally shot her brother with a rifle that had been left in the living room of their parents' home .

"Some football referees can earn up to £70,000 a year - but Swedish official Jonas Eriksson may be earning more than that in annual interest alone.

Canny Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson became a multi-millionaire after selling his 15 per cent stake in a sports media rights business over six years ago for about £6m . Erkisson, who lives in the picturesque town of Sigtuna (above, file picture), just north of Stockholm, said: 'I've had a fantastic life as a businessman... but since 2011, I've dedicated myself to being a professional referee and I'm having the time of my life' Based . primarily in Stockholm, IEC has . offices around Europe, as well as in the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, distributing . television rights worldwide to TV stations and media companies. Its current programme list consists of 250 events with a total annual volume of more than 3,500 hours. The company’s archive boasts more than 5,000 events, dating back to 1993. But despite Eriksson's wealth, nothing will change his first love as he continues to officiate in his home country and across Europe. Erkisson, who lives in the picturesque . town of Sigtuna, just north of Stockholm, told UEFA in August: 'I've had a fantastic . life as a businessman... but since 2011, I've dedicated myself to . being a professional referee and I'm having the time of my life.' Jonas Eriksson shows Robert Lewandowski of Borussia Dortmund a yellow card for a foul on Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal during the UEFA Champions League match yesterday . 'All the money hasn't changed . anything, the best thing I do in my life is still refereeing football,' said Eriksson. Above, Robert Lewandowski was fortunate to stay on the pitch after he was only cautioned for an elbow during the game at the Emirates Stadium yesterday, which saw Dortmund win 2-1 . And speaking last year, he said: 'All the money hasn't changed . anything, the best thing I do in my life is still refereeing football.' The Lewandowski incident is not the first time Eriksson has courted controversy. He bore the brunt of Rangers' wrath in 2009 after waving away penalty claims in a Champions League clash with Sevilla, with Scotland manager Gordon Strachan saying after the game that the Swede 'shouldn't get another game in the Champions League... he is not good enough.' And he sparked more trouble in the 2011-12 season when he dismissed two penalty claims from Barcelona in their goalless draw with AC Milan at San Siro in the Champions League quarter-final.

"CLICK HERE to read which players could challenge Rooney's record of becoming the youngest to reach 100 caps for England . Wayne Rooney will tell the younger members of the England squad they must not be intimidated by the hostile atmosphere at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Rooney marked his entry into the 100 club with a crucial penalty on Saturday as England came from behind to record a 3-1 win over Slovenia. Focus now turns to Tuesday's international against Scotland in Glasgow. Although a friendly by name, there will be no sense of bonhomie between the two sides or the rival fans inside the famous 60,000-seater stadium. Wayne Rooney has urged youngsters to play their 'normal game' when England face Scotland . Rooney scores England's opening goal in their 3-1 victory over Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday . Rooney knows all about the white-hot atmosphere of Celtic Park. He played there twice with Manchester United and he has also watched from the stands after being given tickets by his old team-mates Alan Stubbs and Roy Keane. Given the intense rivalry between the two nations, Rooney expects the decibel levels to be even higher on Tuesday night and he therefore feels his inexperienced team-mates may need some calm words of reassurance before kick-off. 'You don't realise until you actually play there what the atmosphere is like,' the England captain said. 'The atmosphere was great when I was in the crowd, unbelievable, but you don't realise until you're on that pitch what it's like so maybe a few of them, you might need to speak to them and say: 'Listen, this is going to be hostile. Make sure you blank it out, relax, and play your normal game. Don't get involved in it.'' Rooney is presented with a 'golden cap' by Bobby Charlton (L) after reaching 100 appearances for England . England are virtually assured of reaching the Euro 2016 finals after going six points clear in their group . The atmosphere will be the polar opposite to the one inside Wembley on Saturday. Once Rooney had gained his commemorative golden cap from Sir Bobby Charlton and his two children had left the field, the 82,305 fans inside Wembley quickly fell silent. It was easy to see why. England's first-half performance was terrible - among the worst in a long while. The only time they looked like scoring was when Samir Handanovic had to stick his right leg out to deflect Jasmin Kurtic's woeful back-pass wide. Rooney has experienced the hostile atmosphere at Celtic Park as a Manchester United player . Rooney's landmark century managed to overshadow Danny Welbeck's brace that secured victory . The night before, Scotland maintained the pressure on their group rivals Poland and Germany with a hard-fought 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland. And Rooney thinks the Scots will pose a tough test for England next week. 'Scotland are doing well at the minute,' he said. 'They seem to have found a bit of form under Gordon Strachan, so we know it'll be a tough game.' England versus Scotland is the oldest fixture in international football and until 25 years ago there was an annual meeting between the two nations. Last August's action-packed friendly at Wembley, which England won 3-2, led to calls for the return of the fixture on a yearly basis and Rooney seems to be in favour of that too. 'That would be nice,' he said. 'It's obviously not down to me, but it would be good.' Shaun Maloney celebrates after scoring the winner for Scotland against Ireland in their Euro 2016 qualifier . Rickie Lambert scores during England's 3-2 victory over Scotland in last year's international friendly . Slovenia quickly crumbled on Saturday after Rooney won and converted his 59th minute penalty. Danny Welbeck scored his 12th and 13th England goals to stretch England's lead at the top of Group E to six points. Roy Hodgson's only disappointment was that his team had conceded their first qualification goal thanks to Jordan Henderson's 57th minute own goal. 'When we went a goal down it was important we came straight back and we did that,' the England manager said. 'In the end it was a very good victory. We have beaten Switzerland away and Slovenia at home and we are in a good position. Jordan Henderson's own goal to give Slovenia the lead was Roy Hodgson's only complaint . Joe Hart has been released by England and will be replaced by either Fraser Forster or Ben Foster . 'Our goal before this game was to go into the New Year with 12 points, unbeaten. 'The only disappointment is that we now can no longer boast about having a clean sheet but I suppose we still can boast that no opponent has scored against us because we put the ball in our own goal for them.' Hodgson confirmed after the match that Joe Hart had been released from the squad. With the Manchester City goalkeeper rested, either former Celtic man Fraser Forster or West Brom's Ben Foster will be given a chance to impress in goal against Scotland.","England travel to Scotland for an international friendly on Tuesday .

"This is the moment a benefits cheat who swindled £10,000 by claiming he could only walk 10 yards was caught on camera playing a round of golf. Gordon Grear, 55, told authorities he could not walk further than 10 yards due to arthritis before being secretly filmed playing 18 holes in a charity golf tournament at Longhirst Hall Golf Club, near Morpeth in Northumberland. Grear, from Blyth, Northumberland, does suffer from genuine medical problems due to his arthritis and began claiming legitimately from the Department for Work and Pensions in 1998. However, he submitted a form last year saying his condition had worsened and went on to falsely claim £9,619. Scroll down for video . Gordon Grear told authorities he could not walk further than 10 yards due to arthritis before being  filmed playing 18 holes in a charity golf tournament at Longhirst Hall Golf Club, near Morpeth in Northumberland . The 55-year-old claimed he could only walk up to 10 yards 'at best' but was seen walking unaided on the golf course in July last year. Investigators secretly filmed him covering 18 holes on the 6,446 yard golf course . He ticked a box on the form to confirm he could only walk up to 10 yards 'at best', but was caught weeks later walking nearly 6,500 yards across a golf course during the Help for Heroes fundraiser. A few weeks later, in July last year, he also went on to take part in and subsequently win The Three Castles Golf Tournament, which involved him playing on three consecutive days at Alnwick, Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh, in Northumberland. Alec Burns, prosecuting at Newcastle Crown Court today, said: 'Observations were being made of him and he was recorded playing golf. 'He did 18 holes covering 6,446 yards in just over three hours. 'The defendant also won a golf tournament, having played three consecutive day of golf.' Grear, who is married, was interviewed by investigators and said he had been told to play golf by his doctor after a knee replacement operation failed. Mr Burns said: 'He said his condition had worsened and he was in constant pain. 'He was then shown the CCTV recording and he eventually accepted he could walk unlimited with proper pain medication.' Grear said he had been told to play golf by his doctor after a knee replacement operation failed. However, he admitted he had failed to notify the authorities of change in his circumstances at Newcastle Crown Court . Grear pleaded guilty to failing to notify a change of circumstances and thereby claiming £9,619 he was not entitled to. After the case, Grear said he had not deliberately fleeced the taxpayer and claimed the form asked how far he could walk without discomfort. He said he could only walk any distance or play golf after taking strong painkillers. He said: 'There's a lot more to this than was said in court. 'I've had a back problem since a girder fell on me in a pit in 1985 and my knee was damaged playing football when I was younger. 'My knee collapsed and I fell on glass and the knee replacement went wrong, I've got a brace on my leg for the rest of my life. 'I would never deliberately defraud the taxpayer. Gordon Grear, 55, (pictured) appeared at the hearing at Newcastle Crown Court today with his wife . 'The golf event at Longhirst was for the Help the Heroes charity and I felt I had to do it. There was no golf buggy available there but I did use a buggy for The Three Castles event. 'Four surgeons told me to get exercise and I was following their advice. 'I've had 11 operations and I've got two more operations to come, on my hip and shoulder. 'I've given up golf now.' Grear was speaking after being given an 18-week suspended prison sentence with a £1,500 fine. Recorder Davies, who had remanded him in the court cells for an hour over lunch, told him: 'Offences like this are particularly serious at a time when there is an effort to reduce the expenses on the public purse and reduce benefits being paid where they should not be paid. 'When people are suffering a reduction in living standards and income, it's particularly galling for honest people to see someone like you overpaid by such an enormous sum of money. 'You couldn't complain if I sent you immediately to prison today but there is force in the mitigation that you didn't do this dishonestly from the outset and it's right to reflect in the sentence that you do genuinely have very significant disabilities and have had medical problems for many years.' Grear will now face a proceeds of crime hearing as the DWP tries to claw back the money. Jonathan Pigford, defending, said: 'This is not a man with a luxurious lifestyle and there is no suggestion he has benefitted in that sense. 'His health problems are genuine and serious, he has supplied numerous pieces of paperwork going back to 1998. 'There has been surveillance of him over four months and the crucial part is a golf tournament he took part in. He says he takes a significant amount of medication and he has been advised by his doctor to exercise. 'He now has to wear a brace on his knee permanently, having almost fallen into the path of a vehicle when his knee collapsed. 'He maintains he can't walk for 10 metres before he feels discomfort. He says, in a somewhat glib comment, that he can walk forever on the medication.'

"Joe Schmidt has exonerated referee JP Doyle from any blame over Georgia flanker Viktor Kolelisvhili's unpunished stamp on Ireland debutant Dominic Ryan's face. Kolelisvhili is expected to receive a citing after stamping on Leinster back-rower Ryan's face during Ireland's 49-7 win over the Lelos in Dublin on Sunday. Referee Doyle waved away Ireland captain Eoin Reddan's requests for a Television Match Official (TMO) review, saying 'I can't listen to that' during the six-try victory. Joe Schmidt refused to blame the referee for failing to punish Viktor Kolelisvhili's stamp on Dominic Ryan . Dominic Ryan (second left) was making his Ireland debut in the Test match against Georgia . Ireland boss Schmidt backed Doyle for not referring the incident, suggesting TMO Jim Yuille should have alerted the referee to potential foul play. 'I think the protocol is that if there is suspected foul play the TMO can intervene, he can let the referee know and then the referee can review it,' said Schmidt. 'Obviously the incident had passed, and I think by the time Eoin spoke to the referee the game had moved on a little bit, and he heard nothing from the TMO. 'So according to the protocol I think he acted correctly. There's not really much else that JP Doyle could have done. That's just the way it works. 'It's something that I know is being talked about a fair bit: they may change those protocols at some stage. 'Currently his (Doyle's) hands were tied a little bit: he didn't see it himself personally, Luke Pearce on the touchline didn't see it. JP Doyle was in charge of the encounter but acted to protocol according to Ireland coach Schmidt . Ireland's Felix Jones scores a try against  Georgia during their 49-7 win in Dublin . 'Therefore if there was an incident then that has to be dealt with by the TMO pretty much in close proximity in time, otherwise once the game goes on it's pretty hard to go a long way back. 'It didn't look great at the end of it, but I didn't see how it occurred. Rugby is a game where things can happen. It's one of those things we'll have a look at and I don't think we'll be the only ones. 'But for me I'm pretty keen just to move on from it and leave it on the pitch.' Leinster flanker Ryan somehow escaped serious injury in a first half where Ireland botched a host of try-scoring chances. Felix Jones grabbed a second-half brace, with Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo and Stuart Olding completing the eventual rout. Giorgi Nemsadze claimed Georgia's sole score in a testing day for the world's 15th-ranked Test side. Georgia's David Kacharava is tackled during the Autumn International Test at the Aviva Stadium . Ireland's Darren Cave (left) is tackled by Georgia's Merab Sharikadze during the clash . Leinster scrum-half Reddan, captaining Ireland for the first time, also refused to lay any criticism at referee Doyle, but admitted he believes world rugby chiefs may tinker with the TMO rules. Reddan said he believes the International Rugby Board (IRB) are examining whether to hand teams a number of TMO review requests per match. 'Basically I asked him to have a look at it, and he said he wasn't in a position to do so,' said Reddan. 'Dominic, his eye was sore, he just asked me to ask the ref to have a look at it. I asked the ref, he said he wasn't in a position to do that, so... 'I think the powers that be are on top of it and they are talking about it. At the end of the day he's got to make his decision based on that. 'If there's something very, very bad there maybe the assistant referee should step in, and maybe the TMO can look at it himself. That would be where I am on that. 'At the same time the game's got to flow and it's up to the referees and the powers that be to make sure that happens.' Georgia's Kiwi boss Milton Haig conceded that Kolelisvhili will now in all probability face disciplinary action. 'I certainly saw it on the replay,' said Haig. 'I know Viktor and he certainly wouldn't be doing anything like that intentionally. We'll have to wait to hear from the citing commissioner. We got taught a couple of lessons.'","Ireland coach Joe Schmidt claims referee JP Doyle acted to protocol .

"Peter Shilton thinks Wayne Rooney may struggle to beat his record of 125 England caps. Rooney became England's ninth centurion on Saturday when he captained the Three Lions to a 3-1 win over Slovenia. At 29-years-old Rooney is the youngest Englishman to reach the landmark and he is widely expected to surpass Shilton's all-time record in the next couple of seasons. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Wayne Rooney (left) receives a golden cap from England legend Sir Bobby Charlton on Saturday evening . Rooney (above) in action as a fresh-faced teenager during his England debut in 2003 against Australia . While Shilton is a big fan of Rooney, he suspects the striker's body may let him down over the coming years, and that may put his bid to surpass England's former goalkeeper in jeopardy. 'Wayne is a bulldog, he loves the game, he very rarely gets injured, he can take knocks and he could play for at least a couple of years, if not more,' Shilton told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'If it (the record) does go I will be the first to congratulate him, I still think it will be hard for him, but it's not impossible. 'When you get to the 29-30 mark mostly for strikers it's a little bit downhill, they can lose it fairly quickly. I remember Gary Lineker and Michael Owen seemed to go a little bit overnight. It's the hardest bit for him, he's not getting any younger, but if he does break it, it will be a pleasure to shake his hand and say well done.'

The England legend receives his life-time achievement award from former FA chairman Keith Wiseman . Rooney led the England fight back on Saturday with a crucial penalty as Roy Hodgson's men came from behind to beat Slovenia in their Euro 2016 qualifier. Until Jordan Henderson headed the ball into his own net, England had not conceded a goal since the World Cup, but Shilton has his reservations about Hodgson's options at the back. 'I'm a bit disturbed with us at the back, we need another two or three solid defenders,' Shilton said. Although Shilton is worried about England's defence, he insists Hodgson is the right man to lead the team forward and would not be averse to seeing the 67-year-old extend his current contract, which expires after Euro 2016. 'Overall I think we are on the right lines,' said Shilton, whose England career spanned two decades. 'We need stability, he's English, he's got a lot of experience, and I wouldn't have any qualms about a new contract.'","Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton has 125 caps for the Three Lions .

"Fly-half Owen Williams earned a 21-21 draw for Leicester Tigers with the last kick of a dour Aviva Premiership match at Welford Road. The 22-year-old Welshman kept his cool to slot his seventh penalty on an afternoon when former England fly-half Charlie Hodgson kicked seven for Saracens. The two points put Saracens in joint second place with Exeter and Bath, while Leicester go level on points with Sale and Gloucester. Fly-half Owen Williams kicked all of Leicester's points as the Tigers battled to a 21-21 draw at Welford Road . Saracens centre Marcelo Bosch was the only player to get a yellow card on a rain-soaked afternoon when, with so much at stake, neither side were prepared to take any risks and instead relied on the boots of Williams and Hodgson. Saracens led 12-6 after a hard fought first half thanks to Hodgson, who kicked four penalties from five attempts. His opposite number, Williams, did not fare so well, slotting two from four and would have kicked himself for missing one from bang in front of the posts. Charlie Hodgson was equally impressive with the boot; the veteran fly-half kicking seven penalties also . Both sides were missing key players on international duty but Leicester recalled England prop Dan Cole for his first start since neck surgery and were led by former All Black Brad Thorn, their oldest captain at 39 years and 285 days for 90 years. With so much at stake neither side took any risks and, as a result, not a single chance was created. The biggest talking point of the half was the yellow card shown to Bosch, who, along with David Strettle, picked up Leicester winger Blaine Scully and dumped him on his back. After consulting the TMO and watching several replays, referee Tim Wigglesworth sin binned Bosch but could easily have shown a yellow to Strettle too. Leicester scrum-half David Mele cops a heavy tackle from his opposite number Richard Wigglesworth . Leicester failed to take advantage and the score was 3-3 during the 10 minutes Bosch was off the field. Hodgson kicked penalties in the 10th, 20th, 32nd and 34th minutes, while Williams replied in the 23rd and 29th minutes. It was more of the same after the interval, with Williams and Hodgson swapping punches and Saracens keeping their nose ahead. All Blacks veteran and Leicester Tigers lock Brad Thorn grabs a quick drink during his side's clash . Williams slotted three penalties in the third quarter, the first a monster from 50 metres, but Hodgson hit back with two of his own and constantly pegged Leicester back with diagonal kicks to touch as the rain poured down. The second of those, in the 57th minute, came after Saracens had a chance to pull clear after winning a penalty at a scrum near Leicester's line. They could have gone for the try, either through another scrum or a line out and drive but chose the safe option of Hodgson's boot. And minutes later Leicester were back on level terms after Williams kicked his fifth and sixth penalties. Hodgson put Saracens ahead yet again with five minutes left with a simple penalty but Williams equalised right on full time with his seventh after Saracens had been penalised at a scrum, awarded after Strettle's kick had gone dead. Marcelo Bosch makes a half break through the Tigers defence but the Argentine's sin-binning proved costly .","Leicester Tigers fly half Owen Williams landed seven penalties with Saracens number 10 Charlie Hodgson added seven kicks of his own .

"British governments have historically taken an approach to the so-called ‘war on terror’ that has been distinctly un-British – crude, heavy-handed, careless of innocent people’s liberties, and as a result often counterproductive. Yet our response to the flood of British Muslims that has left these shores to fight in Syria and subsequently Iraq for an Islamic caliphate has been tentative, uncertain, almost limp. The brutal, ritualised public murder of James Foley has crystallised the psychopathic nature of what these young Britons have signed up to and in some cases actively promoted. Scroll down for video . Tory MP David Davis said British ISIS members should be stripped of the their UK citizenship . The British intelligence agencies presumably knew what was going on. Yet the Home Secretary’s response as recently as yesterday seemed lacking in both focus and urgency. Asbos for terrorists? It is hard to imagine IS killers quaking in their boots over that. So why have we done so little so far? We should target the young men who have rushed to take up arms on behalf of IS, an organisation that purports to be a state – and a hostile one at that. It is astonishing to me that this action alone is viewed as legal, let alone what they do once there. Imagine that in my youth during the Cold War, I had gone off to join the Soviet Army with the intent of taking action against NATO, or that my father had gone to join the Nazis in the Second World War. Those actions would quite properly have been viewed as treason. What these young men have done is worse. Remember that in this day and age even conventional ‘legal’ wars are essentially industrialised murder. Civil wars, and the sort of sectarian conflict we are seeing in Iraq and Syria, are even worse, littered with the self-righteous sadism that we saw in the death of James Foley. They are wars without rules. And be clear. The barbarism we saw in the murder of Foley has been replicated time and again against thousands of innocent Iraqis and Syrians. Beheadings, crucifixions, burials alive have all been carried out against people guilty of no crime, largely for the purpose of feeding the IS propaganda machine. These young men are going to Syria to take part in large-scale murder for an organisation with a $2 billion income from extortion, blackmail and theft. So if it is not illegal already – hard to believe – let us make it so. Going abroad to fight and kill for a cause hostile to Britain and its NATO allies should be against British law and should carry a very heavy sentence. But I would go further than that. Since these young men are in effect swearing allegiance to a hostile state, they should all forfeit their British citizenship – not just those who are dual nationals. Since this is an incredibly serious penalty, it should be done only after a proper public trial carrying all the public seriousness and opprobrium of a murder trial, because in many cases that is what it would be. David Davis believes by stripping  their citizenship turns the 'brief and violent holiday' to a life sentence . As the Home Secretary reiterated yesterday, lawyers would say you cannot render someone stateless. Perhaps, perhaps not. Whitehall lawyers have been wrong before. Democracies have a right to defend themselves. IS is claiming to be a state. They can issue these young men with Islamic State passports if they so wish. It is not our problem that they would have trouble getting into any civilised country with them. Neither will it be our problem any more if ISIL ceases to exist. We must face head-on the paradox that these men can burn their British passports on TV and deny their legal allegiance to Britain, yet our nation cannot say to them, in effect: ‘OK, never come back.’ The result would be that these young men would suddenly find their trip to Syria is no longer a short violent holiday but a life sentence to the lifestyle they claim to espouse, complete with Sharia law and a desert climate. We are at a moment of decision. We can change or clarify British law to make the evil actions of these young men illegal and to make the penalty fit the crime: expulsion from the society they claim to reject. We can do this in British courts and in doing so proclaim to the world that we are a tolerant society, but that we will not tolerate sadism and murder in the name of religion. Or we can fail to grasp the nettle, let some of these murderers back and try to deal with the subsequent problems. This will allow some of these men to put their new ‘skills’ to further ill use, with potentially terrible consequences for our countrymen, resulting in ethnic suspicion and the social poison that will flow from that.","David Davis claims during World War II these actions would be treason .

"Tom Wood insists England must not overreact to the pressure building after succumbing to a fifth successive defeat in Saturday's 31-28 setback against South Africa. Seven days after New Zealand departed Twickenham convincing winners, Stuart Lancaster's men were flattered by the scoreline once again as concerns continue to mount with just 10 games remaining until the launch of next year's World Cup. All five losses have been inflicted by the All Blacks and Springboks, the sport's top two sides, but in the second QBE International England wilted before opponents who performed well below their best. England flanker Tom Wood is halted by Springboks scrum-half Cobus Reinach at Twickenham . Wood (left) and head coach Stuart Lancaster digest their 31-28 defeat after the final whistle . Team selection, tactics and the dwindling levels of self-belief are being scrutinised closely with head coach Lancaster facing the strongest criticism of his 32-Test reign as head coach. Lancaster, who has presided over just two victories in 13 meetings with the southern hemisphere heavyweights, has sounded a note of defiance by declaring 'we'll not panic nor lose our nerve nor deviate from the course we're on'. It is a bold message shared by Wood as must-win Tests against Samoa and Australia loom on the Twickenham horizon. Springboks centre Jan Serfontein seized on a sloppy Danny Care pass to race away for an easy score . Owen Farrell had a difficult afternoon and could be dropped for Bath fly half George Ford against Samoa . Billy Vunipola struggled against the powerful South African pack and coughed up possession three times . 'It's not the end of the world. It's disappointing to lose in an England shirt and you never want to accept that, particularly at home,' the Northampton flanker said. 'But the fact we have lost by two really close margins in two really competitive games against the two best teams in the world doesn't mean it's back to the drawing board and that everyone is on suicide watch. 'We have to keep our heads high and keep believing in what we are trying to implement. 'We understand we will come under a lot of pressure now. The heat is going to come on from the rugby media and the rugby public. England captain Chris Robshaw stands dejected after his team fifth successive this year . 'Everyone now relates everything to the World Cup, but all we can do is stay tight as a group and keep plugging on.' Lancaster already planned to make changes against Samoa on Saturday, but there are now worrying levels of uncertainty in multiple positions with not a single player in the back line guaranteed their World Cup spot. Half-backs Danny Care and Owen Farrell were poor once again and will surely make way for Ben Youngs and George Ford, while number eight Billy Vunipola and Wood himself are likely to be missing from the team announced on Wednesday. Apart from making those adjustments on form, Lancaster is also ready to freshen up his matchday 23 as he explores other options and combinations. Only success against Samoa and Australia will salvage a modicum of respectability from the autumn, but first England must address evidence that they have regressed since the first half of June's second Test against New Zealand in Dunedin. Having drawn level at 20-20 with stirring forward-generated tries by David Wilson and Ben Morgan, they allowed South Africa to pull clear with a touchdown by Schalk Burger and a penalty and drop-goal from Pat Lambie. Brad Barritt crossed in the right corner with a minute left, but the match had already been decided as the Springboks stretched their unbeaten run against England to 12 Tests dating back to 2006. Lancaster is now facing the strongest criticism of his 32-Test reign as head coach . 'We haven't had the real clarity and composure we needed at certain times. That's what we're not doing at the moment,' Wood said. 'The All Blacks and the South Africans come with big reputations and our forward pack has rolled them at times, but we need to put ourselves in the right area of the field. 'At certain times they have turned the heat up on us and unfortunately we have been found wanting.' An inexplicably looped pass from Care to Kyle Eastmond was intercepted by centre Jan Serfontein for a gift-wrapped score that helped South Africa into an early 10-0 lead. 'It's all very well having the ball but if you are not going anywhere with it and if you are just in the midfield you are playing into their hands. It was another harsh lesson,' Wood said. 'We gave them an intercept try which in a three-point game is pretty criminal. I don't hold Danny accountable for that at all. We were just meandering in midfield. We shot ourselves in the foot with that one. 'When you have got an angry, hurt South African team, really a smart move would not be giving them targets to hit early on. 'But we just presented them targets to hit and that is their bread and butter. We're pretty frustrated and disappointed.'","England's 31-28 loss to South Africa was fifth defeat in succession .

He swiftly moves towards the corner of the room, beneath the camera, and out of sight, before leaving the room. Tongo stays on at the hotel and Dewani returns to talk to him, again asking whether there is any news about the success of 'the job', according to Tongo’s evidence. As Dewani continues to pace nervously, and according to Tongo, he talks about the previous night’s fake carjacking which ended with the Swedish bride being driven off into the night by two armed men and speculating about whether his wife is dead or not. At one point during the conversation, captured on the Cape Grace hotel’s security camera, Tongo claims he warned Dewani about police officers who were gathered just a few metres away, on the other side of the door, by pointing in their direction. It has been alleged that Dewani, a bisexual entrepreneur from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, arranged the murder of his wife Anni through Tonga. But Dewani has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnap, robbery, conspiracy to commit these crimes and defeating the ends of justice at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town. The businessman has been caught on camera approaching Tongo, who was sitting on a sofa at the hotel the newlywed couple were staying at, and speaking with him for several minutes. A cleaner can been seen on the right hand side of the frame. He exchanges a few words with Dewani and then appears to make his excuses and leave. Tongo told the court yesterday that Dewani asked the cleaner to give them some privacy and then asked 'if the job was done', allegedly a reference to a pre-arranged 'hit'. Dewani exchanges a few words with a cleaner, seen on the right hand side of the frame, who then appears to make his excuses and leave . But Dewani insisted he did not know his new wife was dead at this point and was just having a friendly conversation. As there is no sound on the copy it is difficult to know exactly what was said. The driver claims he warned Dewani during the conversation that there were cameras pointed at them. At this point Dewani can be seen looking up at the camera then quickly looking away. Dewani has denied knowing anything about a plot to kill his new bride and said they were hijacked as Tongo was driving them through Gugulethu township in his minibus on November 13. Dewani insisted he did not know his new wife was dead at this point and was just having a conversation . The driver claimed he warned Dewani during the conversation that there were cameras pointed at them . Yesterday in court, Dewani's lawyers claimed the millionaire had been framed for the murder of his wife by his driver and two hitmen after a kidnap and ransom plan turned sour. In a dramatic twist to the murder hearing, Dewani's senior lawyer told the court a convicted murderer would be called as a witness to describe how Zola Tongo boasted of making Dewani a scapegoat. Tongo, allegedly told  the 'lifer' that a plan to kidnap Mrs Dewani, 28, and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her, the court heard. Bernard Mitchell claimed that Tongo confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in October 2011. The inmate, known as Bino, approached Dewani's lawyers with the confession when Dewani was fighting extradition to South Africa to face charges over his wife's death. Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Tongo to organise the murder of his new Swedish wife shortly after they arrived in Cape Town for part of their honeymoon in November 2010. Tongo and two hitmen - Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - claim the successful businessman masterminded the plot to kill the Swedish engineer and promised to pay them £850.

A hotel receptionist granted immunity for his part in the honeymoon murder of a British businessman's new wife may yet face prosecution, a South African judge has said. Monde Mbolombo admitted he was involved in a plot to kill Anni Dewani, but was told he would not be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and illegal possession of ammunition after he gave evidence in the case of gunman Xolile Mngeni, who was himself jailed two years ago . But he was told today by judge Jeanette Traverso that he could yet be punished. 'I am not satisfied as I sit here yet - I might be at a later stage - that the indemnity granted to you by judge (Robert) Henney applies to this case as well. 'At a later stage I would ask counsel to address me on that aspect.' Mbolombo said his role was to make sure taxi driver Zola Tongo met Mziwamadoda Qwabe and to ensure the shooting took place. But he came under fire from defence counsel Francois van Zyl after the witness admitted lying about certain details in his previous statements and evidence.

"England's next QBE Test has been plunged back into doubt with Samoa’s players yet again set to strike following incendiary comments from the country’s prime minister. Samoa’s players wrote to the International Rugby Board earlier this month threatening to strike over a lack of financial transparency from their country’s governing body while complaining that their weekly pay of £1,000 was wholly inadequate. England’s players earn £18,000 a match plus hefty win bonuses. Strike action appeared to have been averted last week following behind-closed-doors discussions between players, union representatives and figures from the IRB. Samoa's players, pictured playing against Italy last week, are threatening to go on strike . England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . But next Saturday night’s clash is again under significant threat as Samoa’s players reacted angrily to being accused of ‘childish behaviour’ by prime minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, who is also chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union. ‘I’ve been in contact with the current players and I’ve been in this position myself,’ said recent international Junior Polau. ‘What the prime minister has said is him pretty much using bullying tactics. You’ve got to commend the players for trying to make a chance without getting the media involved, but it’s the Prime Minister who’s running his mouth off. There is definitely a chance the Samoa players could boycott the England game. Prime minister Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi has angered players by accusing them of 'childish behaviour' ‘Perhaps we should have done it [gone on strike] in the past. Now is the best time to boycott that game and stand up against the corruption to force those idiots out of the union. ‘No one has seen the audit from after the last World Cup. No one knows where the money has gone.’","England are due to face Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Damaging: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed yesterday inflicted a bruising legal defeat on the Home Office - six months after going on the run in a burka . An Al Qaeda trained terror suspect yesterday inflicted a bruising legal defeat on the Home Office - six months after going on the run in a burka. Using legal aid, lawyers for Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed won a ruling that his control order should be quashed. But, given the fanatic is believed to have long since fled the country, he is unlikely to learn of his ‘victory’. A fellow extremist, known only as CF, was also successful in having his order quashed - despite the fact that it had already lapsed. The case was allowed to grind on through the courts, at huge expense to the UK taxpayer, on a point of principle. The men’s lawyers say it was unfair that, when the original instruction to place them under a control order was upheld three years ago, they were not fully told the reasons why. Some of the explanation was given in secret. The Court of Appeal unanimously ruled the men should have been told at least the “gist” of the allegations against them and said their cases must be reconsidered. But Lord Justice Maurice Kay said judges had expressed doubts about allowing Mohamed’s case to proceed, once he disappeared from a mosque in west London last November. Yesterday’s judgment said: ‘We did wonder whether his appeal should be stayed in these circumstances. ‘However, we were told that, although the legal aid authorities had initially withdrawn his funding on being informed of the position by his legal representatives, an adjudication subsequently reinstated it. Disguise: Mohamed vanished from a mosque in London last November - and is believed to have now fled Britain . ‘In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that CF’s appeal would be proceeding in any event, the (Home Secretary) decided not to invite us to stay or dismiss Mohamed’s appeal. ‘With some reluctance, we allowed it to proceed.’ The Home Office said it was ‘disappointed’ by the verdict. Lawyers claim it could have implications for other cases where the government relies on secret evidence and refuses to confirm or deny claims made by terror suspects. However, the control order regime is now . defunct and its replacement - T-Pims - is not currently in operation . against any suspect. Case: Using legal aid, lawyers for Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed won a ruling that his control order should be quashed. The Court of Appeal (pictured) unanimously ruled that the fanatic's case must be reconsidered . In a separate case, Mohamed and CF are demanding up to £1million in compensation from the taxpayer in yet another human rights fiasco. Mohamed - linked to the murderous Al-Shabaab gang - was detained in Somaliland on suspicion of being overseas to receive terror training and plot attacks against western interests. His lawyers claim he was ill-treated by his Somaliland interrogators with the knowledge of British security agents.","Lawyers for Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed won a court ruling yesterday .

"England coach Steve McNamara has kept faith with the team that lost to Australia for Saturday’s must-win Four Nations clash with New Zealand in Dunedin. McNamara made two changes for the 16-12 defeat to the Kangaroos after initially naming the same team that beat Samoa in their opening game, drafting in captain Sean O’Loughlin after he completed his recovery from a leg injury and centre Dan Sarginson in a tactical swap for Michael Shenton. O’Loughlin came through his comeback match unscathed and was cleared to play on Saturday after officials decided he had no case to answer after being placed on report for an alleged trip on Australia skipper Cameron Smith. The England players line-up to sing the national anthem against Australia and are unchanged for New Zealand . Ryan Hall had a last-minute try disallowed as Australia beat England 16-12 in the Four Nations on Sunday . England must now beat New Zealand in their next game to have any chance of winning the Four Nations . Starting team: S Tomkins (New Zealand Warriors); J Charnley (Wigan), K Watkins (Leeds), D Sarginson (Wigan), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); G Burgess (South Sydney), J Hodgson (Hull KR), J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), L Farrell (Wigan), J Tomkins (Wigan), S O’Loughlin (Wigan, capt). Replacements: D Clark (Castleford), B Ferres (Huddersfield), T Burgess (South Sydney), C Hill (Warrington). Sarginson keeps his place after impressing on his Test debut. England need to beat the Kiwis by 10 points to leapfrog them into top spot on the ladder and guarantee a place in the November 15 final in Wellington. If England win by fewer than nine points, they could be overhauled by Australia, who meet Samoa in the last round-robin game on Sunday. Super League’s top referee Phil Bentham will be in charge of Saturday’s game after getting the nod ahead of Australian Gerard Sutton. Organisers caused a stir by ignoring neutrality with the appointment of Sutton for the Australia-England game and have maintained that policy with the selection of Bentham, who refereed the Grand Final at Old Trafford as well as the Australia-New Zealand game in Brisbane.

"Sheik Mohammed has dramatically reshuffled his jockey plans for 2015 by signing up William Buick and James Doyle, two of the Weighing Rooms’ brightest talents, for his Godolphin empire. Buick will ride the Godolphin horses trained by Charlie Appleby while Doyle will partner those under the care of Saeed Bin Suroor. Both jockeys will provide crossover cover when required. William Buick (left) and James Doyle are to join Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin stable . In addition, they will also ride Godolphin horses with John Gosden and other trainers which have until now run in the colours of the Sheik’s wife Princess Haya. Mickael Barzalona will continue to ride Godolphin horses trained in France but Silvestre De Sousa’s position as a Godolphin jockey has ended. Godolphin riding plans have been unsatisfactory since the ending of Frankie Dettori’s 18-year association. Shamed by last year’s Mahmood Al Zarooni Anabolic Steroid scandal, they have endured a poor 2014 in Europe with the Middle Park Stake victory of Appleby’s Buick-ridden Charming Thought their sole success at Group One Level. It is a meagre return for such a lavishly funded operation and one coming under further pressure from the increased involvement of Qatari owners in British racing. Signing Buick and Doyle is a statement of intent from the Sheik, as was spending over £20million on yearlings at the prestigious Tattersalls Book 1 sale. Buick (right) rides Renew to victory in the Visit Victoria Plate on Melbourne Cup Day earlier this month . The capture of Doyle is most surprising. He has walked away from the job as first jockey to Prince Khaled Abdullah, owner of this year’s champion miler Kingman and Champion Stakes winner Noble Mission. Doyle said: ‘I have had a wonderful season riding for Juddmonte and Prince Khaled during which I was fortunate to ride the best horse of my career so far in Kingman. ‘Noble Mission was another great racehorse produced by Juddmonte that helped bring my career forward. ‘I shall always be eternally grateful for that one-year contract which leaves me with great memories. Now I look forward to sharing riding duties with William at Godolphin and continue to achieve great things in the world of horse racing.’ Doyle (centre) and Lady Jane Cecil (left) celebrate with Noble Mission after winning The Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot last month . Buick added: ‘I have been very fortunate to have been employed by John Gosden since I completed my apprenticeship and without his faith and wise counsel I would not be in the position that I am in today to take what is, in my opinion, the most coveted position in world racing. ‘John has shown me great loyalty and given me access to Classic winners and success on a world stage. No jockey has had a better mentor. Now I am looking forward to sharing the Godolphin riding arrangements with my very good friend James. ‘Both of us have had to make hard decisions but no one has made a commitment to world racing like Sheik Mohammed and it is an honour for both of us to be invited to be a part of his team.’ Buick and Doyle flew out of Heathrow on Saturday evening to meet the Sheik in Dubai. His bloodstock adviser John Ferguson said: ‘This is yet another clear indication of Godolphin’s pursuit of excellence in both horses and humans.","William Buick and James Doyle will be joint No 1 jockeys at Godolphin .

"Is it really only a month since Alan Pardew headed into the last international break looking every inch a dead man walking, castigated by Newcastle fans campaigning for owner Mike Ashley to axe their manager? At The Hawthorns on Sunday, two minutes from the end of his fourth consecutive Premier League win —and fifth in all competitions — Pardew gazed up into the directors’ box looking for Ashley and gave him an emphatic thumbs up. ‘You can imagine everyone was pulling at him when we weren’t winning and he stuck with me and was very supportive,’ said Pardew. ‘You have to have that as a manager. You’ve got to have faith that you’re doing the right things. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew makes notes during the clash against West Bromwich Albion . Newcastle have managed five straight victories including wins against Tottenham, Man City and Liverpool . Ayoze Perez opened the scoring for Newcastle just before half-time with an audacious flick past Ben Foster . Fabricio Coloccini powers a header past Foster  after breaking free from West Brom defender Craig Dawson . ‘I’d like to think that buys you a bit of time. It bought me just enough time on this occasion.’ The last time Pardew won five games in a row, Newcastle finished fifth in the Premier League and he won the Manager of the Year award in 2012. While that might be too much to ask this season, they are up to eighth place following a quite spectacular transformation. It has been built on the back of stubborn defence — Pardew’s side have not conceded in the last 342 minutes — and the emergence of a new Geordie hero in Ayoze Perez. The Spaniard had already repaid the modest £1.5million transfer fee Newcastle spent to take him from Tenerife to Tyneside in the summer by scoring the winning goals on his previous two appearances against Tottenham and Liverpool. Newcastle celebrate in front of the away fans at the Hawthorns after Coloccini's header doubled their lead . Remy Cabella leads the celebrations as Newcastle go 2-0 up after a Coloccini header after 60 minutes . Yesterday he conjured up a quite sublime finish to set his team on the road to another victory over West Bromwich Albion. A disappointing first half was petering to a close when Newcastle moved the ball out to the right and Daryl Janmaat picked out Perez’s run with a low ball into the box. The youngster still had plenty of work to do and he produced a fantastic piece of skill, flicking the ball with the inside of his trailing right foot across Ben Foster and into the far corner. ‘That goal was worthy of winning any game,’ said Pardew. ‘The cross was good but he had to add a little bit of pace with the flick and that’s outstanding. ‘We worked hard to bring him to the club. ‘He was courted by some big clubs, in particular Porto, but he genuinely loved the way we were so determined to bring him and 54,000 Geordies every week is a big magnet.’ Fabricio Coloccini claimed the second goal just after the hour mark. West Brom failed to clear a corner and the ball was once again played to Janmaat on the right. The full back took Youssouf Mulumbu one way and then twisted back inside before curling a fantastic cross to the edge of the six-yard box where Coloccini was waiting to power a downward header inside the near post. The Newcastle players bow their heads as they observe a minute's silence before Sunday's victory . Players from both teams respect a Remembrance Day silence prior to kick-off in their Premier League match . After winning just once in 15 Premier League games before the last international break, Pardew can go into this one satisfied that he is beginning to win over at least some of his harshest critics. ‘Newcastle supporters are an extreme of any fan,’ he said. ‘When they win, they go mad and when they lose, they go mad, too. We weren’t winning games and that is my job, to win games. ‘I am not going to get carried away. ‘These young players have a lot to learn but so far so good.’ For West Brom boss Alan Irvine, however, this was a depressing step backwards after taking five points from his last three games. There was a significant lack of threat from his team despite enjoying plenty of possession and their best chance fell to Andre Wisdom 11 minutes from time when the full-back miscued horribly wide. Irvine wondered whether Saido Berahino’s first England call-up last week might have somehow contributed to a strangely subdued performance from his top scorer.Berahino, who was being watched by FA representative Mike Rigg, had an early shot turned over by Tim Krul but rarely tested the Newcastle keeper after that. Alan Pardew (left) and Alan Irvine hold Remembrance Day wreaths prior to Sunday's match at the Hawthorns . ‘He probably had his poorest game,’ said Irvine. ‘People will ask the question, including myself, if it’s a result of what has happened during the week but you can have a poor game at any time. ‘I would like to think England has given him a massive boost and today just didn’t happen for whatever reason. ‘The only pressure on Saido is to perform at his best level as often as he possibly can, but we need goals to come from all over the team. ‘We just did not play well enough.’","Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has masterminded Magpies turnaround .

"Each week Sportsmail gathers the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of Saturday. No less than five Chelsea players feature after Jose Mourinho's team beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield, though none of Brendan Rodgers' men make our list. Manchester City stumbled again but that was far from Sergio Aguero's fault, whose two goals ensured Manuel Pellegrini left Loftus Road with a point. Scroll down to find out which players make our best XI from Saturday's Premier League action. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . GK - Brad Guzan (West Ham vs ASTON VILLA) - 8 .

Queens Park Rangers defender Richard Dunne (left) put in a heroic display as they drew 2-2 with Man City . DEF - John Terry (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8 .

Never in trouble with JT around, as Liverpool found out at Anfield on Saturday. Chelsea captain John Terry is unlikely to win a popularity contest but saw off Liverpool well on Saturday . DEF - Cesar Azpilicueta (Liverpool vs CHELSEA) - 8 . Another who doesn’t get headlines but does a crucial job in Chelsea's back four.

"Gavin Henson chipped in with 13 points as Bath got back to winning ways in the Aviva Premiership with a 23-14 triumph over Newcastle Falcons. Former Wales international Henson converted tries from Stuart Hooper and Jonathan Joseph, as well as splitting the posts with two penalties and knocking over a drop goal. It was the Falcons who drew first blood, with Mark Wilson scoring the first try after 34 minutes, before Bath took control and Sinoti Sinoti's 74th-minute touchdown came too little too late. Gavin Henson kicked 13 points with the boot as Bath beat the Newcastle Falcons 23-14 at The Rec . Henson's final penalty denied Newcastle a bonus point they might well have deserved. The visitors dominated in the first quarter, using strong-running Adam Powell to good effect in the centre, but they found the Bath defence in combative mood. At the other end there was an anxious moment when Simon Hammersley and Mark Wilson let the ball bounce between them but Joseph could not quite take advantage. Bath's own aggressive defensive effort came at the cost of infringements but Falcons fly-half Juan Pablo Socino missed two very kickable penalty chances in as many minutes around the quarter-hour. Newcastle's problems were chiefly in the scrum and Bath cashed in by forcing two penalties themselves - and another from the resulting catch-and-drive, with the unrelenting pressure eventually bringing a 27th-minute drop goal for Henson. Lock Callum Green claimed a try from a line-out drive soon after but the TV match official advised he had been held up. Jonathan Joseph dives over to score one of Bath's two tries at The Rec against the Falcons on Saturday . Although the Newcastle scrum was driven into touch, they retained the put-in at the line-out and this time the catch-and-drive worked perfectly for Mark Wilson to get the touchdown. Socino's conversion was good and the visitors led 7-3. There was still five minutes to play before the break, however, and Bath showed how effective their own maul could be when Leroy Houston caught at the tail and Hooper manoeuvred his way over. Henson converted to send Bath in 10-7 ahead. Soon after the restart, Houston combined with the whole Bath front row as Nathan Catt broke clear but Hooper was hauled down and the attack was snuffed out by the scrambling Falcons' defence. They had to be alert again to deny Olly Woodburn in the right corner after Bath switched play from left to right, finally bringing their wings into play. On 53 minutes, Woodburn surged down the touchline breaking a tackle and, for once, the ball was swiftly away from the ruck. It still needed Joseph's searing pace though, as the England centre carved through to the line, with Henson converting. Scott Wilson (right) of Newcastle attempts to break through the tackle of Bath's Matt Banahan . One of the biggest cheers from the crowd of nearly 13,000 was for the appearance off the Bath bench of back row Matt Garvey for his first appearance of the season following ankle surgery. There had been very little seen of the Newcastle attack in the second half and a succession of penalties brought an inevitable yellow card for Socino. Henson kicked the 65th-minute penalty for a 20-7 lead. That finally brought a response from the visitors and the charging Alesana Tuilagi was halted from a tapped penalty before Scott Lawson burrowed over the line in the other corner. To his dismay, the TMO again ruled the ball had not been grounded but his side mauled away for nearly five minutes before winger Sinoti Sinoti was credited with the try. Bath finished on the attack, winning a penalty at a five-metre scrum and Henson denied Newcastle a bonus point.","Bath beat Newcastle Falcons 23-14 at The Rec on Saturday .

"Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has warned the club's fans they will have to get used to a more patient style of football under Louis van Gaal than they experienced during the glory years of Sir Alex Ferguson. Carrick, 33, has acknowledged a clear shift in United's tactical approach under van Gaal whose side have only scored twice in their last three games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Crystal Palace after a thrilling but chaotic start to the season which saw them beaten 4-0 by MK Dons and 5-3 at Leicester City. Under Ferguson, Old Trafford became known as The Theatre of Dreams and the fans were used to having their chants of 'Attack-attack-attack' listened to. Michael Carrick has told Manchester United fans they will have to get used to a more patient approach . Louis van Gaal has endured an indifferent start to his reign at Manchester United . But the midfielder says it will be different while van Gaal is at the club, saying the Dutchman will do things his way despite the summer arrival of attacking stars like Angel di Maria and Falcao. 'The philosophy is different in that he is happy for us to keep the ball for long spells to get in the game, and get rhythm in our game,' said Carrick. 'Whereas before, especially at home with the crowd as well, it's always been a case of trying to attack as quickly as possible with speed and penetration, and even if you give the ball away a few times, keep trying it. 'It's just a different way of approaching the game really, there is no right or wrong, just different beliefs I suppose. The Dutch manager replaced David Moyes at Old Trafford and it trying to implement his philosophy . 'It's fine for the players, we adapt, we see it every day and are learning all the time. It is more for the fans as well, to appreciate it and to be fair, they have been great. 'Sometimes when you are keeping the ball, they might think they want us to put it straight into attack. But there is a meaning to it as well, it's not like we are just keeping the ball for the sake of it. So that is something we all have to get used to. 'The manager is obviously firm in what he wants and the standards he's got. It is up to us to hit them really and if we don't, he lets us know which is fine. That is the way it should be. 'I think the secret of being a manager at that level as he has been for a number of years is to know when to have that strong aura, and when to be more friendly and approachable. You need that barrier because that is what creates the respect and get people to respond to you.' Manchester United's early-season results include a 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by MK Dons . United also conceded five against newly-promoted Leicester having led 3-1 in their Premier League contest . Van Gaal has deployed Wayne Rooney in midfield to give the team a more solid look and sees Carrick's role in front of the back four as key, though he will probably miss next Saturday's trip to Arsenal after suffering a groin strain on England duty and joining a lengthy United injury list that also includes Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo and David de Gea. It is a blow to Carrick who only recently returned after damaging ankle ligaments in pre-season training during van Gaal's first week at the club. 'It was pretty much his first day when I got injured, so it wasn't ideal!' he admits. 'The most I'd ever been out for before was five or six weeks. It is frustrating, especially the older you get, you don't want to miss much, you never know how long you've got. Not that I am looking towards the end just yet, but you never know. Carrick has suffered a groin strain while on England duty and is likely to miss the clash with Arsenal . David de Gea dislocated his finger while on Spain duty and is set for a spell on the sidelines . 'But then I've looked at it, and thought I've had a good run, I've been lucky enough through the years that I've never been out for so long. 'I just went over on the ankle. I sort of changed direction, lost my balance, my foot gave way and then, crunch. 'It was painful and then the pain went away so I almost thought it might not be that bad. Then I went for the scans and realised.' United are currently seventh in the table, exactly where they ended up under David Moyes last season, and Carrick wants to see the team climbing up the table quickly. 'We have had ups and downs but hopefully that is in the past, that is over. We don't want too many ups and downs, we certainly don't want any downs,' he said. 'We want to try and keep progressing, we feel like we are but as I said before it's results that show so now is the time we really need to get a run of results together, to build the momentum to get up that league.'

"Contrary to popular belief, bookmakers do get it wrong. The fluctuations of football manager  betting markets provide the proof. In the last week Henrik Larsson, Owen Coyle and Malky Mackay have all been quoted as favourites for the Celtic job. Larsson has since ruled himself out, Coyle is currently golfing in Tenerife and Mackay received some informal, indirect overtures via third parties last week, but has heard nothing since. VIDEO Scroll down to Look back at Roy Keane being unveiled as Ireland assistant manager . Informal chat: Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Keane has spoken with Celtic owner Dermot Desmond . New job: Roy Keane, the Ireland assistant manager, is set to be named as the new Celtic boss . Still got it: Keane on the ball during an Ireland training session ahead of Saturday friendly with Italy in London . The turf accountants got there in the . end. On Tuesday Roy Keane was quoted for the Celtic job at long odds of . 33/1. By Thursday he was even money. Martin . O’Neill confirmed something was afoot at a press conference in Dublin . ahead of Ireland’s weekend friendly with Italy. Celtic say Keane has not . been offered the job, that they are still speaking to a number of . candidates. That Keane is now the first choice of major shareholder . Dermot Desmond,  however, seems clear enough. Keane, says his Republic . of Ireland colleague, ‘has a lot to consider.’ ‘The question Roy . will be asking himself now is whether the Celtic job is a big enough . challenge for him?’ said former Parkhead boss and MUTV analyst Lou . Macari. ‘Where is the challenge? Celtic can’t do a great deal in Europe, can they? Success now is reaching the Champions League. ‘So it’s down to whether he wants it or not. If he does, then it’s a good job for him and a good appointment for Celtic.’ Discussion: Keane talks to manager Martin O'Neill as coaches Steve Guppy and Steve Walford watch on . Amongst . supporters that’s not a common view. Like Larsson, the 42-year-old . would be a ‘marquee’ capture for Desmond. He is a big name. The kind of . high-profile figure who, in the parlance of these things, might put . ‘bums on seats’. For a time at least. In 2006, the deal to take the . combative midfielder to Celtic for a final swansong after leaving Old . Trafford was done at Desmond’s behest. The Irish billionaire was also . instrumental in bringing together the Football Association of Ireland . and the managerial dream team he could now be on the verge of . dismantling. A man who likes to hear an Irish accent or two around Parkhead Desmond would regard Keane as quite a catch. Amongst supporters, however, there is less enthusiasm for Keane. An . icon at Manchester United, Keane has hardly been a roaring success in . management. His appointment, some suspect, would be a commercial . decision more than a logical footballing one. It’s three years since . Keane was last a front-line manager in  England, a miserable 21 month . stint in charge of Ipswich Town ending in the sack. ‘What are Celtic . fans worried about?’ asked an incredulous Macari. ‘Are they worried . they are not going to win the Scottish league? Because they don’t have . to worry about that. They’ll win that by 20 points whoever comes in. ‘I . don’t see where the concern is. If this happens, then it’s a good . appointment from Celtic’s point of view and it’s a good chance for Roy . to make some progress again. Most of all in Europe.’ Many of the worries over Keane concern his man management skills. Or perceived lack of. Pundits: Keane and O'Neill on air for ITV during coverage of a Champions League tie last season . Old Bhoy: Keane played half a season with Celtic after leaving Manchester United in the 2005-2006 campaign . A . loathing for the hair gel and Bentley generation of modern football . players brokered a series  of bust-ups, rows and broken  relationships . at Sunderland and Ipswich. He took the Wearsiders up in his first . season in charge. Writing in his autobiography, however, Dwight Yorke . accused his former Old  Trafford team-mate of ruling the Stadium of . Light by fear. One tale concerning the  destruction of a tactics . board is now infamous. ‘The board goes up,’ recalled Yorke. ‘And Keano . takes a running jump and smashes it over with a kung-fu kick. ‘And . then the captain (Dean  Whitehead) is next. “Captain?  Captain? Some . f****** captain you are”, he rages, slapping Dean about the head in the . process before  turning on us all. “I can’t trust any of you”.’ One . of the players who proved a constant source of frustration was Anthony . Stokes, now at Celtic. The two have since reunited on  international . duty, but you would pay a penny or two for the striker’s thoughts this . morning. When Keane quit Sunderland, Yorke sent him a text message . wishing him future success. Keane was short and succinct in reply. ‘Go . f*** yourself’ was the response. Matters barely improved at  Ipswich. Fellow Cork man Damien Delaney told of Portman Road  players feeling a . surge of relief when Keane was sacked in January 2011. Questions over . his interpersonal and diplomatic skills have been a pattern of his . management career. And despite a brief six-month spell  at Parkhead as a . player and close links with Desmond and Martin O’Neill, there is . nothing on his recent CV which screams ‘Celtic manager’. Whilst a . Parkhead player, Keane kept his family in England and seemed almost . semi-detached from his surroundings. Quizzed on a return last week he . was effusive, but non-committal. ‘They are a brilliant club, an . absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I . have got a job,’ he said. In truth, he has two. In the frame: Malky Mackay has also been considered as Celtic seek a replacement for Neil Lennon . Shortlist: Owen Coyle, last in employment at Wigan, was also considered by Celtic . A cutting, incisive analyst on ITV, Keane surprised everybody last November when he agreed to become O’Neill’s assistant. The . FAI later thanked Dermot Desmond for the role he played in making their . managerial dream team a reality. They may soon have cause to curse him . for taking Keane away. That Desmond’s close  business acquaintance and . Celtic shareholder Denis O’Brien is  effectively funding his wages . limits their ability to resist, however. Should he accept, Keane . would be expected to work with the current Celtic transfer model of . buying young and selling big. He would have a direct line to Desmond, . but would be expected to work with the chief executive Peter Lawwell and . scouting chief John Park, currently considering his own offer from . Norwich City. The dynamics of those relationships would be a source of . intrigue. In Dublin there is speculation Keane could be asked to stay . on as Ireland’s number two, dovetailing the role with managing Celtic. Whether that’s possible when  Ireland are in the same European . Championship qualifying group as Scotland is debatable. The decision . will be helped by the advice of an old sage. ‘I’d be  disappointed if he . was to go,’ said O’Neill. ‘But a club like Celtic is a very big club . and those offers don’t come around too often.’ O’Neill once spent . weeks  agonising over a move to Parkhead following a Desmond overture. He admitted as much yesterday and said: ‘Ah listen, for me that’s what I . wanted to do in 2000 when Celtic came for me. I loved Leicester City, . it was great. Celtic came along and it was what I wanted to do.’ No one, you suspect, recognises the dilemma facing Roy Keane this morning more than he does.","Ireland boss O'Neil says Keane has had informal chat with Celtic's majority shareholder Dermot Desmond .

"In different circumstances, Steven Naismith’s national anthem of choice might have been the Land of My Fathers, rather than Flower of Scotland. The talented Everton forward has emerged as a key tenet of Scotland manager Gordon Strachan’s squad. Yet, with his father having been born in Wales, he had options when it came to his allegiance as a youngster. All very topical given the issue which has dominated the build-up to Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier between Scotland and Republic of Ireland. Scotland's Steven Naismith says he could have played for Wales as his father was born there . Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy are Scots playing for Ireland. James Morrison, Russell Martin and Chris Martin are Englishmen playing for Scotland. Born and reared in Ayrshire, however, there was never any genuine prospect of Naismith accepting the invitation to become the Scotsman who played for Wales. ‘I was playing for Scotland Under-19s and my father was born in Wales, so I could have played for them — but it wasn’t something that crossed my mind,’ revealed the 28-year-old. ‘I was enjoying playing for the Under-19s and growing up it never crossed my mind that I could play for Wales. It was probably brought to my attention by them chancing their arm and thinking it might be an opportunity. ‘I always thought about playing at Hampden. But don’t get me wrong – everybody’s circumstances are different. ‘If there’s a chance for somebody to have an international career and maybe go to a major tournament, would you give that up just because you weren’t born in that country? ‘Everybody’s different and so are their circumstances. I was fortunate that I had played for Scotland since I was 17 and everybody knew about that. Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates with team-mates Naismith and Ikechi Anya in the game with Poland . ‘And I knew if I did well for my club and the international team, I would progress.’ It helped that there was no pressure from his father to have a change of heart. ‘My Dad sees himself as Scottish,’ Naismith explained. ‘He was born in Wales but he was only there for a few weeks so there wasn’t anything to debate.’ For others, the decision was less cut and dried. The furore over McGeady and McCarthy has provided the main backdrop to a game dominated by intricate sub-plots and side shows. Both players were entitled to play for Ireland by virtue of a grandparent. McCarthy, it should be said, was also ignored by the SFA for some time — a fact which can hardly be overlooked by prospective boo boys. Aiden McGeady qualifies to play for Ireland through his grandparent . Most of the English-born players in the Scotland squad are also eligible under the grandparent rule. Were the decision his, Naismith would draw the line at parents. ‘Those are the rules so if it can improve your team, and it has improved our team, we’re happy about it,’ he continued. ‘I personally think there should be a cut- off — not distant relatives. But those are the rules at the moment and every country in the world is doing it so I don’t think there’s any point in debating it. We wouldn’t have too many complaints about it.’ Asked if having a Scottish or Irish grandparent is simply too tenuous, the former Rangers player nodded. ‘I think it could get changed a bit to, maybe use the word, tighten it up a bit,’ he said. ‘That’s my view personally. Then again, who am I?’ The subject is never likely to arise in an Everton dressing room where some of his closest colleagues play for the Republic. Seamus Coleman will be detailed to mark Scotland dangerman Ikechi Anya and, in a sobering assessment for those who think home advantage will be enough to beat the Irish, Naismith says of his club-mate: ‘For me, he’s the best right-back in Europe. ‘He’s probably the most down-to-earth guy I’ve ever met in football and it’s great to see how he’s just going to be a superstar. Seamus Coleman will be the man tasked with the challenge of marking Ikechi Anya . ‘Nothing fazes him. He just goes about his business. He does everything exactly the same as when he was back in Sligo. That’s a fantastic quality to have. ‘He gets everything he deserves because he is such a fantastic player. He is so humble and works very hard to get where he is. ‘Darron Gibson (in midfield) shouldn’t be underestimated, either. They’re definitely quality players and they are going to be a threat.’ The likelihood is that Martin O’Neill will line up with a 4-1-4-1 formation geared towards throttling the life out of Scotland’s 4-2-3-1. The former Celtic manager’s emphasis on set-pieces is also familiar enough to supporters in this country. Yet Naismith sees no benefit in dwelling on what Ireland will do. Buoyed by the performances in the opening three qualifiers, the striker says Scotland now have the luxury of concentrating on their own abilities. ‘Scotland is in a fantastic position at the moment,’ he said. ‘What’s going on is really enjoyable for everyone in the squad and that’s showing in our performances. ‘The manager will highlight what Ireland’s positives and weaknesses are. But it’s mainly what we’re going to do and that’s the way it should be. ‘It’s the hardest group and we’ll need to be great all the way to get through, but we’re capable of it.’ Highlighted by Scotland legend Graeme Souness as a ‘proper lad’ who mixes quality with a ferocious work ethic, Naismith was flattered by the remarks. Yet he knows, and accepts, there is one area of his game – identified by Souness as Scotland’s achillies heel - he needs to improve. Four goals in 31 caps for his country is an improvement on Steven Fletcher’s one in 16. In comparison with Robbie Keane’s 65 goals for Ireland, however, it’s small beer. ‘On the goalscoring, all the forwards are at fault,’ Naismith acknowledged. ‘I don’t have a good scoring record for Scotland and think I should do better. ‘Fletch is probably the same and I’m sure Shaun Maloney has said he should score more. ‘In this day and age, it’s not about one guy scoring. ‘On the other hand, if we make it to the major tournament and Fletch hasn’t scored a single goal, I won’t care as long we’re there. I don’t think he’d care, either.’","Steven Naismith's father was born in Wales and the forward could have played for them .

"Spain coach Vicente del Bosque will be counting on Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas to help his country qualify for Euro 2016 despite their absence for upcoming games. Both players have excelled since joining Chelsea this summer but neither is fully fit and unable to help in Saturday's qualifier against Belarus and the friendly at home to Germany three days later. Unlike Costa, Fabregas, who has scored two goals and set up another 11 in 15 appearances for Chelsea, was included in Del Bosque's squad. Cesc Fabregas has been ruled out of Spain's games against Belarus and Germany over the next week . The Chelsea midfielder was spotted at a party at Sushi Samba in London on Tuesday . Fabregas, who has been superb this season, has a hamstring problem but shouldn't be missing for too long . However, the 27-year-old midfielder was ruled out with a hamstring problem after undergoing a check-up in Madrid earlier this week. 'We had to wait a few days to evaluate Cesc's injury and we opted for him not to continue with us,' Del Bosque said to Spanish radio station Onda Cero. 'At times we have been flexible but not in this case. 'His muscle seems all right but he complains and he is the best doctor. 'I prefer to be deceived but I cannot be distrustful. 'When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him.' Costa was left out of Del Bosque's latest selection in order to rest. The Brazilian-born striker missed four matches for Chelsea through injury after scoring his first goal for Spain in last month's 4-0 triumph over Luxembourg. 'In our previous training camp, he (Costa) complained about pain in his pelvic bone,' Del Bosque said. 'I thought it was best for him to take a break. 'It's not a sign of weakness, I don't want to confront anyone. Diego Costa is also ruled out, but the Chelsea striker hadn't been selected in the 23-man squad . Manager Vicente del Bosque said Spain weren't willing to push Costa to the limit in playing him again . 'When I gave my 23-man squad, I knew that he (Costa) was going to play with his club at the weekend. 'But we cannot push someone when they don't feel completely well. 'He is the first one that has asked us to please not forget him when I make my next squad selection in February.' Costa, who has scored 10 goals in nine Premier League appearances for Chelsea so far, is eager to shine for Spain. The former Atletico Madrid star became a naturalised player earlier this year and has found the back of the net just once in seven appearances for La Roja since. However, Del Bosque is confident Costa will have a starring role for the national team despite his slow start. 'For whatever reason, he (Costa) has not been 100 per cent with us,' he said. 'However, we cannot say that he has not given all of his enthusiasm, he has always had a desire to play. 'We haven't been lucky, he has been a slave of our lack of play. 'Had we not opted to select him (naturalise him), now we would have thrown our hands in the air. 'Seeing how Costa moves, the spaces he finds, this cannot be bad for any team. 'Perhaps he is not as technical but not all forwards need to be in order to score goals.' Defending European champions Spain head into Friday's home match against Belarus in second place in Group C with six points from three games. They are three points adrift of leaders Slovakia.","Cesc Fabregas has been withdrawn from the Spain squad .

"Graeme Souness has insisted Rangers would be a stronger, healthier club if Brian Kennedy had won the keys to Ibrox. The former boss of the Govan club was involved in two separate power bids by the Sale Sharks owner — the most recent the offer of a last-ditch loan two weeks ago. Angered by the demise of the side he managed between 1986 and 1991, Souness is unable to disguise his contempt for Charles Green, despite a late-night attempt by the Yorkshireman to sign him up for his own takeover group in 2012. Former Rangers manager Graeme Souness believes the best man lost in battle for control of Rangers . Souness (2L) won a hat-trick of league titles during his spell as player-manager between 1986 - 1991 . ‘What is it? Two years since that p**** had it?’ said Souness. ‘The guy who knocked on my door one night asking me if I would get involved in it with him. Charles Green. ‘It was late one night about 11 o’clock, my answer was no. ‘I got a phonecall about an hour before that he was coming to see me. I had been asked to see him and I had refused. ‘We went for a cup of tea at a hotel around the corner. 'You’ve got me angry now…’ Brian Kennedy has failed with two power bids to take control of the former Scottish champions . A personal friend of Kennedy, Souness was keen to return to Ibrox with Walter Smith in the event of the Edinburgh-born businessman securing the assets in 2012. He was also on board when Cheshire-based Kennedy offered a £3million loan to the Rangers board as an alternative to MASH, Mike Ashley’s investment group. ‘I had a week with Brian in Majorca three weeks ago,’ Souness revealed. ‘But if it’s not to be, it’s not to be. ‘When we met we never went into detail because, the last time, we believed we had it. Brian believed he had it - only to be let down and deeply disappointed. We even came up to watch a Rangers and Celtic game because we believed we had it. ‘I think this time around he was always thinking the worst. ‘Given the structure the way it is now, I would think that’s it finished. ‘I don’t know how Brian feels right now but I think his attitude to it has changed now the other folk are involved.’ Souness is incensed by the ongoing financial turmoil still surrounding the once great club . Rangers fans protest outside the stadium following the Scottish Cup quarter-final against St Johnstone . Asked how he feels about the ongoing financial turmoil at the club, Souness claims anger barely covers it. ‘That’s not the correct word. I’m angry about it and saddened by it in equal amounts because a lot has been allowed to happen. ‘I don’t want to get into being involved in a libel case. ‘All I would say is that if we had got it, the people there would have had the club for the right reasons.’ Asked for his views on Newcastle United owner Ashley’s tightening grip on the club following the appointment of henchmen Derek Llambias and Barry Leach to the board, Souness said: ‘I don’t want to end up in court. Rangers players congratulate Kris Boyd on his winning goal in the Scottish Cup . Manager Ally McCoist has been forced to take care of the team under increasingly challenging circumstances . ‘I wouldn’t be critical of Mike Ashley. He is a fantastic businessman who saw an opportunity at Newcastle and it’s very hard to be critical, having worked there myself. ‘I think he has done the right thing there. ‘He has stuck with his manager and it looks like he is getting the rewards of that. That’s what it needed. ‘It needs a strong owner and that’s what he is. Someone who has been supremely successful in anything he has touched. ‘I think in terms of Newcastle supporters, they should be counting their blessings rather than being critical. ‘Now if he came to Rangers and was to plough a shedload of money in there, everyone would be happy - but I don’t see that happening.’ Souness would not comment on Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's bid to take control of the club . Ashley has appointed former Newcastle director Derek Llambias (C) on the board at Ibrox . As a result of the Rangers meltdown and the subsequent fall-out Souness – who enjoyed huge resources as manager - fears Scottish football has fallen off a financial cliff and may not recover. ‘All I would say is that all the people who enjoyed their demise, if they had their time again, would they have voted the same way? ‘Celtic getting gates of less than 20,000? I think it has damaged football, hopefully not beyond repair. ‘Football goes in cycles. Over a 10-year period, they say if you lose a support, it’s very hard to get that back. ‘I don’t know if it will get back. ‘Rangers will get back to the SPL, the Old Firm games will be enormous affairs again and the passion will remain the same. ‘But will it ever get back to where it was six or seven years ago? I very much doubt it.’","Graeme Souness laments Brian Kennedy not taking control of Rangers .

"Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti will begin talks over the possibility of extending his stay at the Santiago Bernabeu in the new year. The Italian tactician is happy with his current crop of players and is content with life in the Spanish capital, according to Madrid-based newspaper Marca. Ancelotti, whose current deal expires in 2016, arrived at the European champions at the beginning of the 2013/14 season after leaving Paris Saint-Germain. He led Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup in his first season in charge. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti is expected to put pen to paper on a new contact in the new year . Barcelona track Koke and Lars Bender while Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez focus on partnership . Marca go with the headline 'Where do I need to sign?' to emphasise Ancelotti's desire to stay at the club. Sport, on the other hand, have decided to focus on Barcelona's aim to sign either Koke or Lars Bender during the summer transfer window. The Catalan giants are said to be on the lookout for a central midfielder to replace Barcelona legend Xavi. Barcelona will have to meet Atletico Madrid ace Koke's 60million euros release clause while Bayer Leverkusen's Bender is said to be worth 30m euros. Mundo Deportivo focus on Barcelona's 'new trident' of forwards. The Spanish newspaper carries quotes from Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar on how they plan to combine as an attacking trio. Meanwhile in Italy, Filippo Inzaghi has said he hopes to manage AC Milan for the next 20 years.

"Russell Martin isn’t normally one for nostalgia. While his club and country career is still moving at breakneck speed, his fear is that looking over his shoulder will only slow him down. Yet when Ikechi Anya’s name is raised in conversation, the Norwich captain can't help but briefly pause for thought. The Watford man’s presence in the Scotland squad serves as a timely reminder of the remarkable journey both have travelled to reach this point. Seven years ago, with both players domiciled at Adams Park, the inauspicious home of lowly Wycombe Wanderers, the notion that they would one day be playing international football seemed rather absurd. Russell Martin's international career with Scotland has taken off in recent months . Martin (left) in good spirits at training alongside Steven Naismith (centre) and Shaun Maloney . A late developer on the international scene, Martin moved to Peterborough and then to Norwich before Craig Levein called him into the squad three years ago by virtue of his Scottish father. For Anya, the road to international recognition has been rather more scenic: Oxford Town, Halesowen Town, Northampton and then a left-field move to Spain with Glenn Hoddle’s Academy. The B teams of Sevilla and Celta Vigo, then Granada, Cadiz and then a parachute back to the English game with Watford where Gordon Strachan was watching. And now this. Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. Old friends reunited on the biggest stage imaginable. ‘You don’t get much time in football to take stock and reflect,’ Martin said. ‘But sometimes you have to and think: “I have come a long way”. Doing that while not standing still is important. ‘But I’m well aware of how we’ve both done and how far we’ve come. I’m proud of that and glad I’ve done it this way. We played in the youth team together at Wycombe and also came through to the first team together. Then we went our separate ways. ‘It’s been great to see the journey he’s been on, to see how far he’s come. He always had ability and a lot of potential. Unfortunately it didn’t quite come through at the time. ‘He’s had to do it the hard way and he’s had a long, old journey. It was a bold decision for him to go to Spain. He went to Northampton first — I actually played against him when I was playing for Peterborough. Ikechi Anya is Scotland's brightest prospect . ‘I caught up with him then and he said he was exploring a few different things. I always kept an eye on him over there (Spain) and then when we went to pre-season we played against Hoddle’s Academy. So we always had these little moments when we caught up. ‘Not many have come through there. A few have played in the Football League but not many the way he did it by getting signed by a B team in Spain and then there was that link with the owners at Grenada, then there came the move to Watford. But it’s worked out really well for him. ‘A player like that, and how hard he worked, there was no doubt in my mind he was going to come into football at some point. It was just a question of at what level. You just hoped he got a chance to kick on and he has.’ Martin can’t help but grin while recalling his early exchanges with Anya at Wycombe when the distant prospect of representing Scotland one day was whispered about. Asked if Castlemilk-born Anya knew Martin was eligible for Scotland back then, he quipped: ‘I didn’t even know I was Scottish in those days! No, we did know. We’d had a chat about it as I was desperate to get into the Under-21s at that point but that didn’t quite happen. ‘He said he was born there as well. I don’t know if he knew about me but I knew about him. He has got quite a diverse background. ‘He’s still the same height he was then although he had bigger hair at that point. But as a person — yes — he has grown.’ Of that, there is no doubt. Just 14 month after making his debut for Scotland in a home loss to Belgium, Anya’s place in the hearts of the Tartan Army has long been secured. If his engagingly bright off-field personality is enough to illuminate a darkened room, then the moment he sped away to beat Manuel Neuer in Dortmund cemented his status and underscored what he’s capable of bringing to the table. ‘He has been brilliant,’ Martin opined. ‘He offers us something different that not a lot of players have got. He’s got electrifying pace while he’s also now added a real end product to his game. ‘I think his pace scares defenders that’s for sure. You don’t want to be coming up against someone that quick as there’s not many ways you can handle it. He scored against Germany and then produced an assist against Poland.’ Anya scored for Scotland against Germany in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier . Martin believes the man-manager skills of Strachan have much to do with Anya’s remarkable rise in a dark blue jersey and added: ‘The manager has given him so much confidence. When he does come away with Scotland you can tell he’s really bubbly. ‘He loves being involved with Scotland and you can see it with the way he plays. ‘It’s testament to how hard he works — not many work harder than him. ‘I’m really pleased for him with this success, especially having known him for so long. ‘The transformation in him has been huge over the past 10 years. ‘He always had the ability but I don’t think he had the mentality to cope with it when he was 17, 18. Which a lot of players don’t. ‘Sometimes it takes a bit longer. At that age, when you work hard and have a lot of ability, you can still be hard on yourself. ‘You need a mentor to put an arm around you and point you in the right direction.’","Russell Martin is enjoying a flourishing Scotland career .

"Nathaniel Clyne is set to make his England debut against Slovenia on Saturday as manager Roy Hodgson prepares to take Calum Chambers out of the firing line. Nineteen year old Chambers has seen his form suffer in recent weeks and looked like a player in need of a break when Arsenal were beaten at Swansea on Sunday. It has been a tumultuous few months since his transfer from Southampton, thrust into Arsene Wenger's team on a regular basis after injuries to first-choice defenders. Nathaniel Clyne (left) in action at the Under 21 Championships for England last summer, and on Tuesday training for the England senior team at St George's Park . Hodgson promoted him too in the absence of Kyle Walker and Glen Johnson but now seems set to turn to Southampton full-back Clyne against Slovenia at Wembley. Clyne has been in fabulous form for the Saints who have made a spectacular start to the Barclays Premier League season.

"David Moyes has taken a bold step into the relatively unknown by moving to Real Sociedad but there is more than enough talent, history and potential at the club to make it the perfect coaching comeback for the former Everton and Manchester United manager. Sportsmail's Spanish football expert Pete Jenson tells us why... David Moyes is back in management with Real Sociedad after his difficult tenure at Manchester United . The playing squad . In November the league table is still capable of lying and the truth is there is no way Real Sociedad are the 15th best team in Spain. They have already beaten both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid this season and the group of players that David Moyes inherits will be enough to give them a top-half finish in his first season. The club sold Claudio Bravo to Barcelona in the summer but Enaut Zubikarai is an experienced stand in. Geronimo Rulli, the big summer signing from Estudiantes in Argentina, is waiting to return from a broken finger suffered in pre-season and 23-year-old Enrique Royo is a hugely talented keeper waiting for his chance. At the heart of the defence, Inigo Martínez is still only 23 and Moyes should be able to guide him back to the sort of form that made him many people’s tip to become a fixture in Spain’s squad and earn a move to Barcelona. Yuri Berchiche signed in the summer from newly-promoted Eibar, and at 24, has a bright future at the club . Carlos Martinez, pictured here tackling Mario Mandzukic, will help provide the defensive stability for Moyes . Saturday November 22 . Deportivo La Coruna (A) (17th in La Liga) Sunday November 30 . Elche (H) (18th in La Liga) Thursday December 4 . Real Oviedo (A) (3rd in Segunda B) Sunday December 7 . Villarreal (A) (8th in La Liga) Sunday December 14 . Athletic Bilbao (H) (11th in La Liga) Around him there is stability with Alberto de la Bella, Carlos Martinez, Mikel Gonzalez all having been at the club, and very often in the same back four, for the last four seasons. De la Bella is currently out with an achilles problem but Yuri Berchiche is an able replacement who signed in the summer from newly-promoted Eibar and at 24 is another one with a future at the club. The central midfield pairing is usually Markel Bergara and former Real Madrid and Queens Park Rangers midfielder Esteban Granero but Ruben Pardo is the diamond in the rough – an Under 19 European champion with Spain he was on Real Madrid’s wish list two seasons ago but Sociedad resisted and now all it needs is for Moyes to help the 22-year-old fulfill his enormous potential. Markel Bergara (right) lines up alongside ex-Real Madrid and QPR man Esteban Granero in central midfield . In the line of three behind the striker Moyes will have plenty of talent to call upon. Carlos Vela usually plays centrally and top scored last season with 16 league goals. Club stalwarts David Zurutuza and Xabi Prieto are good soldiers who will stand up to be counted. The pair have played almost 400 games between them for the club and Prieto’s set-piece delivery will be another weapon Moyes can use to the team’s advantage. Sergio Canales is another who has lost his way but if the still-only-23-year-old midfielder, for whom Real Madrid paid £4million when he was just 18, can regain form and fitness, then Moyes will have one of the most gifted players in the division at his disposal. Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela (right) scored 16 times for Real Sociedad last season . Leading the line, Imanol Agirretxe will work hard as a loan striker and Iceland centre forward Alfred Finnbogason, signed in the summer from Heerenveen in Holland where he scored 29 goals in just 31 games, will give Moyes a more physical option. Boardroom backing . There will not be huge amounts to spend. Real Sociedad are a selling club and if Moyes manages to bring the best out in players such as Inigo Martinez and Pardo then the club will be tempted to cash in again. But what he will benefit from is one of the best youth academies in Europe. The Zubieta sports city has so often been the foundation of the club’s success. There was a time around a decade ago when the attention switched to foreign signings but the club paid the price ending a 40-year run in the top division with relegation in 2007. It took them three seasons to come back but with a team built on youth they finally won the second division in 2010 and Moyes will be entrusted as the keeper of that youth team tradition. Anoeta Stadium holds 32,000 - buoyed by Moyes' arrival the fans will rally behind them for the next home game . Manchester United (2013-14) P 51 W 27 D 9 L 15 WP 53% . Everton (2002-13) P 516 W 217 D 139 L 160 WP 42% . Preston North End (1998-2002) P 234 W 113 D58 L 63 WP 48% . History and support . The club’s Anoeta Stadium holds 32,000 and although performances were, in the main, poor last season the average was still in excess of 22,500. Buoyed by Moyes’ arrival they will get behind the team in the next home game against Elche and fill the ground for the Basque derby on December 14. Another British former manager, Chris Coleman, used to complain about how the running track around the pitch affected the atmosphere but that won't stop them creating a cauldron for their visit of their local rivals. It is Spain’s ‘friendly derby’ perhaps the closest La Liga has to the Merseyside meetings Moyes managed during his decade at Goodison Park. The Real Sociedad fans have endured a tough campaign so far, but will still be hoping for a top-half finish . Expectations . Real Sociedad were champions in 1981 and 1982 and they also finished runners-up in 2003 but times have changed and the fans know that. The annual budget is just south of £50m and financially it is not just that they struggle to live with the big two, they are also some way behind Atletico Madrid and Valencia. Playing well, competing for a Europa League place and improving the players he has will be how Moyes is judged. If he develops players and keeps the club in the top half of the first division with attractive football then he will not be questioned. No-one will expect trophies – a repeat of his results record at Everton will keep everyone happy. John Toshack coached the club for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the Copa del Rey in 1987 . Wales boss Coleman (pictured in 2007) was the last British manager to have taken charge of Real Sociedad . And topping Toshack? John Benjamin Toshack, as he is always referred to in Spain, coached Sociedad for 322 games winning 126 of them and lifting the Copa del Rey in 1987. The man he really wants to beat however is Alberto Ormaetxea, who won those two leagues. They were called the Humble Champions and even made the European Cup semi-finals. With Spain legend Luis Arconada in goal and fellow internationals Jesus Satrustegui and Roberto Lopez Ufarte in attack they took on Barcelona and Real Madrid and managed back-to-back titles. In their current state back-to-back wins would be nice – Moyes can do that with victory over Deportivo Saturday week when his adventure begins at 10pm, local time.","David Moyes has been announced as Real Sociedad manager .

"England manager Roy Hodgson has warned Andros Townsend and Rickie Lambert he cannot 'keep people on board forever' if they are not playing regular club football. The likes of veteran Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick, 33, and West Ham's Stewart Downing, 30, were both handed recalls to the squad for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley and friendly with Scotland in Glasgow, along with Arsenal forward Theo Walcott, fit again after a long-term knee injury. There was also a promotion for 21-year-old Saido Berahino to the senior squad for the first time, while fellow starlets Calum Chambers, Nathanal Clyne, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling were also included. Andros Townsend and Rickie Lambert, pictured in September, have been warned by Roy Hodgson they must be playing regularly for their clubs to be picked by England . West Ham's Stewart Downing and Man United's Michael Carrick were both called up to the England squad . Hodgson continued to keep faith with Spurs winger Townsend and Liverpool forward Lambert, who have both found regular Barclays Premier League football limited this season. The England manager, however, remains confident for now at least both men can bring something to the table. 'If I think I am still seeing enough of them at club level to believe that they are still going to be as good as they were when they came with us, I try to keep them on board, but you can't keep people on board forever. Andros and people like Rickie Lambert, they know that,' said Hodgson, who was at QPR versus Manchester City on Saturday keeping an eye on Hoops' striker Charlie Austin, not named in the England squad this time around. England boss Hodgson (centre) watched QPR's 2-2 draw against Man City at Loftus Road on Saturday evening . 'They realise, ""I can't keep expecting to get a call-up when I'm not playing enough football."" But at the moment with Andros and with Rickie, I don't think that moment has come where I shall be saying, ""You're not playing enough games from the start, I'm not using you"" because I still think when they come with us, they have got something to offer and they can make us better. 'I can't give them any guarantees, but the one thing I absolutely will refuse to do is to have a clear rule that if you play in your first team, you've got a chance of coming; if you don't play in your first team, you haven't. 'I'm not going to make it black and white. It's always going to be a grey area, but as in all grey areas, you've got to constantly analyse and assess.' Lambert, pictured following Liverpool's defeat to Chelsea, came on as a substitute at Anfield . All of the England teams at St George's Park will hold a two-minute silence during a Remembrance Day service, while Hodgson and under-21s head coach Gareth Southgate will lead an FA delegation, including selected players, to the National Memorial Arboretum. Hodgson indicated he was likely to trim down his 26-man party for the trip to Glasgow. He said: 'When that Slovenia game is finished, because I have got a big squad here, it is even possible that one or two players who played on the Saturday may not even feature at all when we go up to Glasgow. 'I might  let them go back to their clubs, that is why I have chosen a bigger squad.'","Andros Townsend and Rickie Lambert warned they must be playing regularly to be selected by national team .

"England's Under 21s credentials for Euro 2015 will be given another serious examination when they contest a glamour friendly against Germany. The FA have made a conscious decision to play better opposition in the build up to next summer’s tournament and that has been borne out with games this month against Portugal – at Burnley on Thursday– and France in Brest on Monday. And the next round of internationals in March will see them lock horns with Germany at Middlesbrough on Monday, March 30.

Sweden and Italy are also in England's group, leaving Southgate's team with a tough task to clear the group stages having failed in their previous two tournament appearances under the management of Stuart Pearce.

"For just under five minutes on Saturday, England’s supporters found their voice. With Springbok lock Victor Matfield in the sin bin, Stuart Lancaster’s side finally gave the 82,125 fans inside Twickenham hope with two tries to level the score at 20-20. Swing Low echoed around the rain-soaked old stadium but they had barely got through the first verse before it all went flat again. Just as the power failed before the match, the lights went out on England’s momentarily sparky performance. With Matfield still off, the hulking Schalk Burger muscled his way over in the right-hand corner and South Africa never looked back. VIDEO Scroll down to see where Stuart Lancaster feels England lost the game . England captain Chris Robshaw's emotion shows what the loss, their fifth successive, means to the England players .

Another consolation try seconds from time put gloss on the scoreboard but, make no mistake, for large parts of this game England were abject. If the alarm bells were ringing following defeat to the All Blacks, the sirens are screaming from the Twickenham rooftops after this loss. Five defeats in succession, albeit against the best two sides in the world, is England’s worst run since 2006. And as the countdown to the World Cup continues, there is no sign of significant improvement. For the second week running, an opposition No7 — this time Burger — won the man-of-the-match award, leaving more questions over England captain Chris Robshaw’s suitability for the openside role. For the second week running, England were second best at the breakdown. For the second week running, Owen Farrell was unable to spark his back line. For the second week running, the scoreboard told a false story. England created next to nothing when South Africa had a full complement on the field. On the few occasions they did, they bombed their chances. The first 15 minutes were truly dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery, but far from treacherous, handling conditions against a side who tackled fiercely, sat back and waited for their chances to come. And come they did. Before England knew it, they were 10-0 down and they were lucky to reach half time at 13-6. That became 20-6 just after the break when Cobus Reinach crossed for a brilliantly worked try before England briefly rallied with Matfield in the bin. But with momentum swinging, Burger and co wrestled control back and closed out the game. England had few answers. Lancaster said: ‘We got some good field position in the second half and took those chances well. In the first half we could have been a bit smarter in those conditions. It was one of those days when territory was going to be important and in the first half South Africa benefited from our errors.

Substituted after 43 minutes, the young Saracen can rarely have produced a more error-strewn display. Ben Morgan will surely start next week if the strike-threatened clash with Samoa goes ahead. Almost as soon as Vunipola was replaced by Morgan, England found some bite. Two tries in three minutes from the industrious David Wilson and then from Morgan himself gave England’s fans hope. But like so many times under Stuart Lancaster’s reign, the home side flattered to deceive, lacking the nous to beat one of the Southern Hemisphere’s big three. Just as New Zealand did last week, South Africa gripped this game at precisely the right time. Once again England were strangled as discipline disappeared and attacking quality went missing. Dylan Hartley was sent to the bin for a cynical 61st-minute stamp on Duane Vermeulen, which could easily have brought a red card from referee Steve Walsh. As it was, the yellow compounded his side’s woes and undid a lot of excellent work from England’s hooker. Indeed, most concerning for England’s coaches is that despite the set-piece being rock solid, they are failing to create chances and field position on the back of it. England out-scrummaged their opponents with ease in an area the Springboks would have expected to dominate. England’s lineout functioned well again, with Courtney Lawes enjoying a fine game in tandem with his Northampton team-mate Hartley. So what on earth is going wrong? Victor Matfield was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee Steve Walsh . Mike Brown takes a high ball and is tackled in the air by South Africa's full back Willie Le Roux . England full back Brown pushes his South African counterpart Le Roux . David Wilson crosses for England as the hosts make South Africa pay following the sin-binning of South Africa's Matfield . England's Ben Morgan twists in the tackle to get the ball down for England's second try . Another try for the England forwards comes from Morgan as the home side make the most of the one-man advantage . 1) Losing the breakdown battle. Must generate quick ball for the backs. if you won’t use them?2) Talented wingers are isolated. Why pick them . 3) Kicking game needs improvement. No territory means no points. 4) Missed chances. England must start taking the few they’re creating. 5) Talk straight. Some home truths need telling behind closed doors. In his first start on the right wing, Anthony Watson hardly touched the ball while Jonny May was also criminally underused on the other flank. England’s much-criticised kicking game was barely any better on Saturday, with Farrell unable to manoeuvre his forwards around the pitch and lacking the passing game to get the back line moving. The England No10 was completely outshone by his opposite man Pat Lambie, who kicked 16 points including a late drop goal and pulled the strings superbly for his side. Scrum-half Danny Care was ponderous around the breakdown as England’s back row were dominated and the quick ball backs desperately crave to attack the gain-line never materialised. Tom Wood carried better than in recent matches but gave away too many penalties while Dave Attwood failed to let Watson loose with the line at his mercy on 25 minutes. Same old mistakes, same old story. Lancaster may not be for turning, but England’s fans deserve so much better than this. With the World Cup looming, there’s very little to sing about. England captain Chris Robshaw converses with referee Steve Walsh during their Test at Twickenham . Dylan Hartley walks from the pitch after being sin-binned following Walsh's chat with his TMO . England lock Courtney Lawes charges down the kick of Lambie . Stuart Lancaster's side must now regroup ahead of next week's clash with Samoa .","South Africa defeated England 31-28 in their second autumn international at Twickenham on Saturday .
For the second week running, England were beaten at the breakdown and the scoreboard flattered the hosts .
The first 15 minutes were dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery, but far from treacherous, handling conditions .
England were quickly 10-0 down and were lucky to reach half time at 13-6, which was soon 20-6 after the break .
With Victor Matfield sin-binned, England hit back with tries through forwards David Wilson and Ben Morgan .

"England captain Chris Robshaw bemoaned the fact his side had to play catch up as they slumped to a fifth defeat on the bounce, losing 31-28 to South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday. The Springboks seized control early on, with tries from Jan Serfontein and Cobus Reinach giving them a 20-6 lead just after the interval. Although Robshaw's pack muscled England back into the contest with tries from David Wilson and Ben Morgan off the back of driving mauls, South Africa kept them at arm's length with a touchdown from Schalk Burger before Brad Barritt closed the gap in the dying moments. England skipper Chris Robshaw points out instructions to team-mates during their match against South Africa . Jan Serfontein wheels away in celebrations as he earns South Africa the first try of the game at Twickenham . 'I think we were a bit reactive today, we allowed them to get ahead of us and then we had to play catch up,' he told Sky Sports 1. 'We had a brilliant patch out there where we got two driving mauls going but unfortunately we allowed them to get their driving maul going too. 'It's tough to take, especially at home, but we'll have to work hard and come back next week.' Stuart Lancaster watches on as his team warm-up prior to the match at Twickenham . Pat Lambie celebrates with team-mate Jean De Villies after kicking a drop goal for South Africa . After the 3-0 series whitewash in New Zealand in the summer and the 24-21 defeat to the All Blacks last week it now means they have suffered a fifth successive defeat for the first time since 2006 - which was also the last year they managed to beat South Africa, who are now unbeaten in 12 matches against England. Like last week against the All Blacks England's set piece worked well, with two tries coming from lineouts, and the scrum was also strong, but Robshaw just feels his side are falling just short of what they are capable of. 'We are probably not doing ourselves justice. We all know the way we train and the way we want to play and we haven't put it on the pitch as well as we would have liked,' he added.","England suffered their fifth consecutive Test defeat against the Boks .

"It might have looked like the most flagrant case of tapping-up since Jose Mourinho met Ashley Cole in London’s Royal Garden Hotel in 2005 but it seems Gerard Pique’s Sunday evening meeting with his former Barcelona boss was simply the ultimate ‘Pep talk’. Pique has become increasingly exasperated by his situation at Barcelona and just 24 hours after another afternoon sitting on the sidelines in his new capacity as Luis Enrique’s fourth-choice centre back; who better to seek out for advice than Pep Guardiola. The Bayern boss was in the Catalan capital to cast his vote in the unofficial referendum on independence at the weekend and the two met and embraced in a quiet residential street close to Guardiola’s Barcelona home, the image was captured by a passing fan and soon spread throughout social media. Gerard Pique (left) shares a joke with Luis Suarez on the bench during Barcelona's game against Almeira . In Pique’s favour, most Barcelona supporters – even those that feel his form has slipped considerably since the heady days of 2009-2012  – feel that Luis Enrique is picking on his defender without justification. Barcelona’s lack-lustre midfield is crying out for Javier Mascherano to take up the conductor’s baton. That move would free-up a space in the centre of defence for Pique to return to the first team for the first time since the Clasico. Luis Enrique has denied he has anything personal against Pique. However, the images of him warming up on Saturday against Almeria only to sit back down again almost immediately as the coach made the decision to bring on Xavi Hernandez only added to the impression that all is not well between the two. Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola (right) talks to David Alaba during his side's clash with Roma last week . Guardiola gets launched in the air after his Barcelona side claimed the Champions League trophy in 2009 . And if you can’t talk to the current coach then talk to the old one, the most-decorated in the club’s history. Pique blossomed under Guardiola who encouraged his coming out with the ball from the back which was a feature of Barca’s best football and has been seen less and less in recent seasons as the gap between the Barcelona defence and the rest of the team has got slowly wider. Pique will start Spain’s European Championship qualifier against Belarus on Saturday and then against Germany in Vigo next week and the suggestion is that Luis Enrique is then preparing to give his centre-back a clean slate when he returns playing him in the run-up to the winter break. If the reunification between the two fails then January will bring plenty of suitors to Pique’s door. Although the club is banned from signing players, it still seems unlikely that Barca would sell Pique in January knowing that they are prohibited from bringing in a replacement.","Gerard Pique is currently fourth-choice centre back under Luis Enrique's regime at Barcelona .

"Four-four-two be or not to be, that is the question. The other question, of course, is can William Shakespeare help England win the World Cup? Top coaches from the best academies in England descended upon the Tudor streets of Stratford-upon-Avon to discover how acting is taught at the Royal Shakespeare Company. There were workshops about stage-fighting, lessons in voice projection, stage presence, posture and body language and they had a chance to quiz the team behind a production of Love’s Labour’s Lost, before watching them perform. Some of England's top academy coaches have been expanding their horizons to improve themselves . This much ado about coaching is all part of the Premier League’s long-term quest to develop more and better homegrown footballers by focusing on the creation of elite environments. These same select coaches have also visited British Cycling at the Velodrome, the University of Bath - training base for many Olympians - and Athletic Bilbao. Next they are off to meet the SAS and the McLaren F1 team. It is about taking them out of a comfort zone and challenging them to expand their minds beyond the confines of football. ‘Football has been happy to be comfortable,’ said Ryan Garry, who played for Bournemouth and now coaches Arsenal’s Under-13 team. ‘Other sports looked outside for information and research but football didn’t. This has opened doors for us to evaluate what we do, compare it others and refine our approach.’ The coaches took part in workshops at the Royal Shakespeare Company to improve vocal skills . All’s well that ends well at international level, too, where innovative coaching at club level is clearly rubbing off on the players of the future. England Under 20s . The England Under 20s won a Four Nations Tournament in Holland in October, beating Holland and Germany. England Under 19s . England Under 19s beat Belarus 3-0, Luxembourg 8-0 and Belgium 4-2 in European Championship qualifying in October (in Luxembourg). England Under 18s . England Under 18s beat Holland twice, 4-1 and 3-1 at Leigh Sports Village and Bury on Sept 3 and Sept 5. England Under 17s . England Under 17s won the European Championship in Malta in May. The coaches were surprised to find plenty of common ground with the actors at the RSC, who discussed stage fright, coping with audience reaction and the balancing of individual expression and direction. It was a far cry from Escape to Victory. ‘The voice coach talked about the muscles in the tongue, projecting your voice and enunciating clearly and how that affects people listening,’ explained Graeme Murty, once a full-back for Reading and Scotland and now coaching the Norwich Under-16 team. ‘The movement expert was phenomenal. She spoke about posture and the messages it sends. What style of communication am I using? How am I standing? What am I trying to project?’ At the Velodrome, they studied the training regime of double Olympic gold medallist Laura Trott and learned about the ‘marginal gains’ which have become the mantra of British Cycling. ‘It was the ultimate focus on small details,’ said Murty. ‘Does it make the bike go faster? We spoke to a cyclist on the podium programme for Rio who is taught how to eat and how to sleep. ‘We asked what happened if he missed a session and it was like: “Miss a session? What do you mean miss a session?” Normal people would call it obsessive, but it’s normal to them.’ The England Under 17s won the European Championship held in Malta in May . At Bath they marvelled at how the swimming, judo, netball and bobsleigh athletes could all spark off each other and inspire. ‘The swimmers spend 24 hours a week in the pool,’ said Jon Harley, who started a long playing career at Chelsea and has returned to the club to coach the Under-15 team. ‘What they’ve produced results-wise at Bath is incredible and it’s because of the environment they’ve created. ‘It’s a discipline. They do that and it becomes a habit. All the coaches are very open, trying to drive each other on. You could see it was a world-leading environment for sport. In football it was always about doing the bare minimum and going home.’ These young coaches have been hand-picked by their clubs to participate in the Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS), a two-year course which started last year - available to one individual from each of the 22 clubs with Category One Academy status. As well as studying elite environments, each coach is assigned four mentors, which include high-profile experts from other sports - such as former England rugby union coach Brian Ashton and athletics coaching guru Malcolm Arnold. Callum Connolly (centre) celebrates scoring for England Under 18s against Holland Under 18s in September . The whole process has been deliberately kept in the shadows to give it space to evolve slowly. It is a key element of the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) - the brainchild of Ged Roddy, the Premier League’s director of youth. ‘This is not about copying another sport or another discipline but about stepping into these worlds and exploring how they do it and plotting our own path,’ said Roddy. ‘This is English football taking control of its own destiny.’ Three years after EPPP was launched, Roddy detects subtle signs of progress. There was a call he took from a German friend amazed by the quality of young English players in a tournament he had seen. England Under 20s Chuba Akpom celebrates  scoring the winning goal to seal the Four Nations Tournament . And moments like the one in the Rose and Crown in Stratford, last week, when he and Neil Bath, Chelsea’s head of youth development, watched on television as teenager Dominic Solanke come on to make his debut in the Champions League against Maribor at Stamford Bridge. Bath’s phone buzzed with messages from Stamford Bridge keeping him informed about Solanke’s progress: warming up, taking off tracksuit, putting on pads and coming on. Youth development cannot be rushed. Slivers of satisfaction like these ones are what pass for reward. ‘We don’t know when it will tip,’ says Roddy. ‘We’re three years into a process that might take 16. Ultimately, the aim is to develop more and better players. To survive in the Premier League they must be among the best in the world.’ He is starting to believe the wheel is turning and cannot afford a backward step at this point. With some, this will rankle. Dominic Solanke (right) made his debut for Chelsea in their Champions League win against Maribor last month . Clubs exist on the mid-slopes of football’s pyramid, where the EPPP has not been well received. Some fear it will squeeze the life from those who sell to survive and encourage bigger clubs to chase players at ever younger ages because barriers have been removed and compensation figures are fixed on a sliding scale, depending on age. One thing is sure, if English football waits for its powerbrokers to reach agreement it will be too late. So they all do what they think is best. The Premier League, however, has the money - from around £8million spent by Stoke to upgrade their Academy facilities to the £200m spent by Manchester City to build a new training campus. They are committed to EPPP as a means of developing local talent in hot-house environments built for elite sports and quelling the global scramble for the next Lionel Messi, thus ending the occasional clamour for more homegrown quotas. Manchester City have built a new £200million training complex which includes 16 pitches . ‘The myth that you need to reach around the world is one we’ve been keen to counter,’ said Roddy. ‘While we always want the best talent in the world, there’s a balance to it. Bring talent in but recognise there is talent inside your own communities that can be among the best in the world. ‘Develop locally and recruit globally, but if you don’t get the environment right it doesn’t matter where they come from because you’ll fail. Physiology isn’t an issue. It comes down to coaching, environment, development of players — and that’s within our means to put right.’ The ECAS coaches have been to Athletic Bilbao, an interesting case study for development experts because they still operate a Basque-only policy and a finite talent pool, but have remained successful by blending the region’s spirit and grit with the right coaching practices. It all comes back to environment, in Roddy’s mind. That’s why he has the likes of Garry, Harley and Murty have been preparing for manoeuvres with the SAS by pretending to fight each other in the RSC’s Courtyard Theatre. Athletic Bilbao still operate a Basque-only policy of players throughout their club ranks .","England's top academy coaches have broadened their horizons to improve .

"CLICK HERE for the full match report from Anfield . No  drama. Of all the words Jose Mourinho used following Chelsea’s latest statement of intent, none screamed out more than that soundbite. Mourinho was not intending to disparage Liverpool but as the Chelsea boss explained why he never had a moment’s concern, even when his side trailed, he could not have been more cutting. Liverpool, remember, spent more than £100million in the summer after finishing second last season but the players that were brought in never had it in them to raise any anxieties in Mourinho, despite charging into an early lead. Jose Mourinho claims he was never in any doubt over the result against Liverpool . Premier League leaders Chelsea celebrate after their 2-0 victory against the Reds at Anfield . ‘I wasn’t afraid to go behind,’ Mourinho said. ‘This team is very comfortable. It was no drama for me or the team when they scored.’ Jose Mourinho enjoys his Barclays Premier League visits to Anfield. This was the Chelsea manager’s fourth win in five trips. Here, then, was the Portuguese effectively saying expensively assembled Liverpool were no threat to him on the day or for the rest of the season. As Chelsea power on towards the title, problems are piling up for Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool’s manager has seen Chelsea hurtle past his side to such an extent they have become a dot on the horizon. Liverpool are 15 points adrift after 11 matches with no chance of bridging the gap and, for the first time, frustrations among home fans bubbled over. Losing to Chelsea is bad enough but nothing grates with Liverpool fans more than the realisation that another summer has passed with the club failing to build from what should have been a position of strength. The biggest spending spree in their history is taking them backwards. Emre Can opened the scoring with his first Premier League goal for Liverpool . Brendan Rodgers was forced to endure sounds of discontent from frustrated Liverpool supporters . ‘The supporters have been given a brand of football over two years that they’ve really clung to,’ said Rodgers, when asked about the growls from the stands that accompanied his decision to substitute Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can. ‘It has been frustrating and I understand that. We brought young players in and they are taking time to gel.’ What Rodgers will realise, though, is that Liverpool fans are impatient. Had they been given the choice, they would have taken the summer Chelsea experienced, when they signed Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas to augment their squad. ‘We are a better team (now),’ Mourinho explained. ‘We got players to improve the team. Sometimes you get players to improve the squad, other times you get players to improve the team. We got players to improve the team.’ Liverpool should have done that. They chased Alexis Sanchez and made eyes at Radamel Falcao and Karim Benzema, but again they failed to land a trophy signature. Gary Cahill wheels away in celebration after scoring to bring Chelsea level . Brazilian striker Diego Costa rifles in the match winner to keep Chelsea clear at the top of the table . ‘We know what targets we wanted but for one reason or another they went elsewhere,’ said Rodgers. ‘The club have done everything they could over the summer to get the players to come here. Early set-pieces for Chelsea clearly showed Liverpool’s Alberto Moreno holding Nemanja Matic to prevent the Chelsea dangerman challenging for the ball. Taylor chose to ignore the defender’s infringements. ‘Players now...in football terms, I think they look for more. They look for all these social factors and f ootball as well. Say if someone gets offered more money to come here but they want to go to London, there is not much you can do.’ And there was not much they could do about Chelsea. Though Can put Liverpool ahead, Mourinho’s side got stronger as the game went on, looking like a team of men playing against boys. Diego Costa, scorer of the winning goal, was terrific, as was Eden Hazard, while John Terry and Gary Cahill — who equalised Can’s effort but was fortunate to escape a late handball — were magnificent. Nemanja Matic was referred to as a 'giant' by Mourinho and was also charged with giving the team talk . Dwarfing them all, however, was Nemanja Matic. ‘Please give him (the credit) he deserves,’ said Mourinho. ‘He was signed in the most difficult market for players (in January) so the second half of last season was a space of improvement and adaptation. At this moment he is a giant. Not for his size, but the way he plays.’ Among his many duties, Matic gave Chelsea’s team talk. ‘Nemanja said if we wanted to be champions we had to win,’ Cesar Azpilicueta revealed. ‘If the target is to be champions you have to come to these stadiums and get a result.’ And from first whistle to last, there was never any doubt that Chelsea would. Anthony Taylor made a great case for more technology to be introduced with his performance at Anfield. He understandably relied on goal-line technology for Chelsea’s first goal but missed two clear handballs by Gary Cahill which replays proved to be deliberate. When Cahill’s effort was carried marginally over the line by Simon Mignolet, the Goal Decision System correctly indicated a goal. I have no doubt the goal would not have been awarded without the use of the technology. Harder to understand were his decisions to wave away two penalty appeals for Liverpool, both for handball by Cahill. Taylor should not have needed replays but had they been available he would have had to award penalties.","Premier League leaders Chelsea defeated Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield .

"A quick glance at the current MotoGP standings is all you need, to see who is the current top dog in the sport. Marc Marquez is in just his second season at the pinnacle of motorbike racing, but has won 10 of 11 races and is all but certain to reclaim the world championship he won in his rookie year last term. Just having a quick glance at the standings do not do many of the riders justice however. In fact half-way down in 12th is arguably Britain’s most exciting prospect to come through the sport in recent years. Stand and deliver: Scott Redding took Sportsmail for a lap around Silverstone in a Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade . To MotoGP fans, Scott Redding needs no introduction. The 21-year-old has worked his way up the series from 125cc (now Moto3), to Moto2 and for the first time this season, MotoGP. Redding’s CV already makes for impressive reading. Originally from Quedgeley, a suburb of, Gloucester, he made history in June 2008 when he became the youngest rider of all-time to win a Grand Prix race (aged 15 years and 170 days) in the 125cc class. Last season, Redding was a front runner in the Moto2 title, winning memorably at Silverstone, and only missing out to Pol Espargaro after picking up an unfortunate injury near the end of the season. Now he is in the premier class of motorcycle racing… albeit on an open class bike which severely limits Redding’s progression during a race weekend. Another one of those quick glances at his race results this year see finishes typically just shy of the top 10. It may seem a far cry from Marquez’s winning ways but Redding is giving his Honda crew just as much to smile about as the stunning Spaniard leading the way. I met up with Redding at Silverstone in the build up to the British Grand Prix, and the 21-year-old was keen to get across that his season targets have already been hit – some as early as the first race of the season. Home comforts: With a bike draped in the colours of the Union Flag, Scott Redding took victory in the Moto2 class at Silverstone last season . No. 1: Redding's victory at Silverstone is his last to date, but the Brit's career has been on the up ever since . 2014: MotoGP . Team Go & Fun Gresini Honda . 2013: 2nd Moto2 world championship . 3 x race wins . 7 x podium finishes . 3 x pole positions . 2012: 5th Moto2 world championship . 3rd Moto2 Le Mans . 2nd Moto2 Silverstone . 3rd Moto2 Assen . 3rd Moto2 Aragon . 2011: Moto2 world championship . 2010: 8th - Moto2 world championship . 2nd - Australian Grand Prix . 3rd - Indianapolis Grand Prix . 2009: 125cc world championship . 3rd - 125cc British Grand Prix . 2008: 125cc world championship . 1st - 125cc British Grand Prix . 125cc Rookie of the Year . ‘Before we tested we were targeting top seven, top eight,' Redding said. ‘But then we realised the bike didn’t have the potential for that. After testing when Nicky [Hayden] was a second in front, we were targeting on closing the gap to him and beating him from the second half of the year. ‘But then we got to the first race in Qatar and I beat him, so my target was done. Now it’s [the target] simply to be the top open class Honda each race.’ Given that Redding is the top open class Honda in the Championship, it’s safe to say he is stretching out as much as he can from his machinery. Curiously, the Brit just trails a superior Honda in the factory ridden bike of Alvaro Bautista in the championship, and it’s at this point I sense a tinge of excitement, confidence and frustration when we start talking about his options for next year. Redding clearly believes in his abilities and I get the impression that the 21-year-old appears bored knowing he can’t compete for race wins at this stage in his MotoGP career. For Redding, the talk of a factory bike almost has him chomping on the bit and he speaks of his desire to land a factory ride – going as far as saying he would rather put his feet up at home rather than compete for another year in the open class. One for the future: Redding became the youngest grand prix winner of all time when he triumphed at Donington Park in the 125cc category aged just 15 years and 170 days in 2008 . It’s the words and attitude of a talent that truly believes he is ready for the next step as he informs me why he has the belief he is ready to step up to the next level. Redding added: ‘Honda want to have me for two years, so it’s just a matter of where and what pieces we have. We need to see because Gresini are struggling at the moment and are speaking to other manufactures so we need to see what happens towards the next few races. ‘I have a two-year contract with Gresisni so in theory I need to stay with them so it’s difficult when they are thinking of going to another manufacture because the factory bike is so expensive and I’m not going to stay on the open bike. I spoke to the team and I’m not doing that, I’d rather stay at home. ‘I want to be in MotoGP, I don’t want to be in open class or Ducati open, I want to be winning races and fighting for the podium, that’s where I want to be. I don’t want to be messing around in open. One year, that’s fine, two years – not happening. ‘I think they [Honda] were impressed with Indianapolis and Sachsenring. Sachsenring was good in the mixed conditions and at Indy it was ‘you’ve done something with this bike that no one has done yet.’ That was good for me, and I’m starting to become more familiar with the bike. Get down on it: Redding has enjoyed a fine first season in MotoGP riding on a Gresini Honda in the open class . ‘It’s been quite a big step, but I’m not full powered MotoGP so it’s like a step inbetween. It was quite a big step to go fast, fast. Finding the extra half-second was difficult and then you have the race distance. ‘It’s like two more laps than Moto2 with the faster bike and a higher level. So it’s all harder. But for me it was nice to have that extra power. ‘I would love to have more horsepower in the bike so I can at least mix it with the big guys. My strengths are brake and entry speed as well as mid-corner. I’m really strong in changing directions. ‘In Sachsenring I was quite fast. In sector 2 I was top three all weekend through the sector and the same in Texas, mixing with the factory boys so it shows in the technical areas I have the ability, but the long straights just kill us.’ Hold on: Redding was at Silverstone in the build up to the British Grand Prix, giving Sportsmail a pillion ride . Thumbs up from us: Redding poses with Sportsmail's Dan Ripley inside the garages at the Silverstone circuit . And that brings me to the reason why I travelled to the home of British motor racing to meet the rider who many hope can try at the very least bring home a first premier class win since the great Barry Sheene in 1981. Being given the opportunity to ride pillion on the back of a Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade around three shortened laps of Silverstone, I held no nerves as I climbed on to the back of Redding’s bike ready for a thrill seeking ride around the circuit. We don’t even make it to the end of the pit lane before my high enthusiasm turns to a mixture of terror and pure excitement. Looking ahead: Redding aims to continue being the top open class Honda rider in 2014 . Flying around the track while constantly breaking the 100mph mark is some experience, as is leaving your seat and almost sitting on Redding’s head every time he brakes going into a corner. The terror faded quickly as I got used to the speeds but the excitement never drained even as I spoke to Redding shortly after the ride. I almost had to pick my jaw from off the ground when the 21-year-old informed me he was pushing only a third of what he is capable of. ‘Today was more than normal! Redding said. 'These superbikes handle better with two people rather than one, believe it or not. I don’t know how much I’m pushing, I go knee down which I don’t think many people did with pillion. You’re not breaking on the limit because the riders are changing so the weight is different. ‘You can have a small girl who is about 50 kilos and you can have a guy who is 80 kilos – break in the same place and you’re gone! ‘I would say you are pushing at 30 per cent. I’m not twiddling because you want the pillions to feel the load under braking and on the throttle when you feel the bike transfer, while using all the track.’ I leave Silverstone convinced that Redding’s career is destined to only take him higher in the sport, and while he may not be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Marquez and Valentino Rossi this weekend, you certainly won’t be surprised if he is stepping on a MotoGP podium should he get his factory ride in the near future.

The 24-year-old has had a miserable start to his Anfield career with just two goals, neither of which have been in the Premier League, and criticism is growing over his contribution. With that in mind he was a surprise recall to the Italy squad but Conte, while having some sympathy for the player, wants to see for himself the state of Balotelli's game.

'Personally, I'm not going to pay attention to talk about the club,' he told a press conference as his squad gathered for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia and friendly against Albania. 'People try to exaggerate each situation and I feel sorry for him. 'Today he is here and he has to answer to me. I will judge him by what he does in the next seven to nine days. Stephan El Shaarawy (left), Balotelli and Cerci (right) listen to Conte's instructions during the session . 'I'm worried that people see Balotelli differently to the others. 'Balotelli is a normal footballer, just like the others. We don't need to differentiate Balotelli from the others, he's just one of the 23 players. 'Balotelli has significant experience with the national team, he has played at a World Cup and a European championship, but that's not enough. AC Milan striker El Shaarawy (right) has a quiet word with the Liverpool striker . 'He needs to catch my eye and I have to see if he can adapt to our type of football. 'If he can, he can play in the starting line-up, but he can also be on the bench or in the stands. 'My duty is to see how I can use them in this national team. 'This route has today provided Balotelli with the chance to show what he can be.

"In a nightclub on the Mediterranean coast, a man wearing a hat to disguise his identity slips into the DJ stand and takes control of the decks, where he plays his records until sunrise. Earlier that evening — in front of many of the same folk on the dance floor — that very same DJ had dictated a different kind of rhythm... a football match in front of 55,000 fans at Valencia’s Mestalla Stadium. Only now has Gaizka Mendieta revealed his secret in an interview which explores the football career he very nearly abandoned. Gaizka Mendieta reflects on a playing career that has taken him from Spain to Italy and England . The former Middlesbrough midfielder now works as a pundit for Sky's coverage of Spain's La Liga . Mendieta finished his playing career with a five-year spell with Middlesbrough . But it is the subject of music which hits the right note with the former Valencia, Lazio, Barcelona and Middlesbrough star, who last month played the Cavern Club in Liverpool made famous by The Beatles. ‘It has always been my passion,’ says the 40-year-old. ‘My friend in Valencia, who owned a record shop, used to DJ. If I played on Saturday I would then sneak into the club, but it was always off the record, I would wear a hat and go in disguise. I would then DJ and no-one would know it was me. I loved it. It was an escape.’ Mendieta was a platinum-standard schemer who manipulated the mood of a match with his cunning. Much like the DJ. ‘I don’t have a setlist of what I’m going to play. We take a box of vinyls and we only arrange the first few songs and then see how the mood is and what people want,’ he says. ‘When you are on the pitch you have a split-second to decide a pass, it is the same as a DJ picking the next song. It is the same feeling of tension as playing football and I do get nervous before I DJ. ‘But that is good, that’s the way I enjoy things. It is the possibility of making people happy, seeing them having fun and going mad at your choice of song. ‘I play everything from Aretha Franklin to Kings of Leon to Lou Reed. Wherever I am in the world I always find the record shops.’ Mendieta revealed that his second love away from football was spinning tunes on his decks . The former Valencia midfielder used to sneak into clubs to DJ after playing matches at the Mestalla . The Spaniard has likened playing a DJ set to reacting to the the tempo on a football field . While we had to wait until the turn of the millennium to see Mendieta in successive Champions League finals with Valencia and twice being named European Midfielder of the Year, we could have witnessed his talents at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics had his life taken a different track. ‘My story is unusual,’ he laughs, when asked about the journey which saw him become one of the world’s most expensive footballers after Lazio signed him from Valencia for £30million in 2001. ‘At 14 I stopped playing football and dedicated my time to athletics. As a kid I used to go to athletics school where we would train three times a day and study. I loved it, it’s what I wanted to do. I held the Spanish record for 2,000 metres which stood for 15 years. ‘But when I was 16 I quit and went back to football and I signed for Castellon (in the Spanish second division). To be honest, I wasn’t that good. I was a good athlete, so I would run and cover a lot of ground and then make a simple pass. ‘Look at my early games with Castellon and Valencia, I could pass the ball, but I was nowhere near the player I became. My friends used to say: “Who is this kid? He can’t keep the ball up three times!” ‘They used to joke with me but then look what happened. I worked hard and my game became more about technique than running.’ Mendieta helped Spanish side Valencia reach successive Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001 . Mendieta became one of the world's most expensive players when he signed for Lazio in 2001 . Mendieta lunges in on Real Madrid's Ronaldo during a loan spell with Barcelona in 2003 . Mendieta was one of four brothers and their dad, Andres, was a professional with Real Madrid, Deportivo La Coruna and Villarreal. His sons, however, were not born with natural talent. Chelsea goalkeeper and drummer Petr Cech is good friends with Queen drummer Roger Taylor . Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic played guitar in Croatian rock band Rawbau . Carlos Tevez was in a band in Argentina with his brother called Piola Vago . Trumpeter Nolberto Solano formed the Geordie Latinos salsa band at Newcastle . PS It goes the other way too. Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias was Real Madrid’s reserve keeper before becoming a pop star. ‘My brothers weren’t very good and I wasn’t great but I just wanted to improve so badly so I practised for days and days. I used to go to fields with my brothers and my dad to practise. I used to go in a squash court with a ball and just kick, kick, kick. My dad was really sad when I quit for athletics because he would have loved me to be a footballer. But he always supported me because both he and my mum wanted me to be happy. So they were very proud at what I went on to achieve.’ What did he achieve? Eight goals in 40 caps for Spain, the Champions League runners-up medals, a Spanish Cup with Valencia and a League Cup at Middlesbrough. So how did he end up on Teesside? ‘The chance to come to England arose in a way I didn’t expect,’ says Mendieta, whose first season at Lazio had been an unhappy one. ‘Steve McClaren and Keith Lamb, the chief executive, turned up at the training ground in Rome. ‘They told me about the new project they wanted to build. I told them I would think about it but, after a little time, I thought, “Why not?”. I wanted to be part of their plans and help them make history — which I did.’ Former England manager Steve McLaren convinced Mendieta to come to Middlesbrough . The Spaniard has no regrets in signing for Middlesbrough and has even moved back into the area . Mendieta poses with teammates after winning the 2004 League Cup with Middlesbrough . Indeed, Mendieta loved the North East so much that he only swapped it for St Albans last year, so he would be closer to his work with Sky Sports, where he is a pundit for their La Liga coverage. Mendieta, who has two daughters, is busy juggling his music, punditry and commitment to earning his coaching badges. It would, you feel, be a loss if he never returned to a training pitch, for he has learned from some of the game’s greatest, including Louis van Gaal at Barcelona. ‘He was great,’ says Mendieta. ‘Even if he comes across as quite distant and authoritative, he’s not, you can talk to him any time. ‘I remember in pre-season two of the players’ wives had given birth and we thought he would not let them go. But he told them “Go, see your family, come back when you are ready”. The 40-year-old revealed he almost chose a career in athletics over football as a youngster . Mendieta backs his former manager Louis van Gaal to be a success at Manchester United . ‘But he needs time. He likes to do things in his own way and what he believes to be the best way for the team. He will be successful. Van Gaal has the hunger for that, otherwise he would not have come. He sees Manchester United as a challenge and wants to take them where they deserve to be.’ Mendieta, then, is backing his old boss to get United in tune. As for himself? ‘If you’d asked me a few years back about management I would say no. But now, you never know,’ he says. Kind of like his next record, Mendieta will see where the mood takes him.

"CLICK HERE to read Ian Ladyman's full match report from Celtic Park . Robbie Keane has reacted after being demoted to the bench for the first time in 13 years as the Republic of Ireland fell to a 1-0 defeat by Scotland in Euro 2016 qualifying. The last time Ireland's all-time leading goalscorer started on the bench for his country was a World Cup qualifier against Estonia in June 2001, which the Green Army won 2-0. However, manager Martin O'Neill decided to use a lone striker  and preferred to start with Southampton's Shane Long at Celtic Park before seeing his side undone by Shaun Maloney's 74th minute winner. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Robbie Keane started on the bench for the first time since 2001 in Ireland's 1-0 defeat to Scotland on Friday . As Ireland looked for an equaliser Keane was brought on for Jeff Hendrick in the 78th minute at Celtic Park . The LA Galaxy striker has 65 goals in all competitions for his country but  in-form Shane Long was preferred . Speaking to Dublin radio station 98FM, the frustrated LA Galaxy striker offered his opinion on the manager's change of tactics. 'Listen, if the manger wants to play one up front I'm not f*****g Niall Quinn or Shane Long - they're better than that than I am,' he said. 'If they want to play two up front and score goals then that's my game. I'd prefer to speak about the team rather than make a big deal over who started the game. 'The manager has made a decision and you have to respect that. Playing one up front doesn't suit me. It's fairly obvious, I'm 5ft 10in so it it's not my game. The 34-year-old reflected what had been a scrappy game by claiming it mirrored typical Old Firm derbies he had played in as a Celtic player. 'The game was exactly like an Old Firm derby when I played up here; no quality, just people trying to kick each other,' he said. 'It was a scrappy affair and we knew that whoever scored the first goal was probably going to win the game.' Manager Martin O'Neill said that Long's pace was the deciding factor in his decision to bench Keane . Despite missing the opportunity to take control of Group D - Ireland dropped to fourth place and are level on points with Scotland and Germany - Keane insists that all is not lost in qualifying for France. 'Listen, by know means is this over, we can't get too down on ourselves. We're disappointed tonight but overall if we look at the bigger picture and the points we have. 'Although, when you go away to Germany and get a point you probably expect to get something out of the game here, but we didn't, he added. Keane was eventually brought on in the 78th minute by O'Neill as Ireland searched in vain for an equaliser against the Scots. Before the game the Ireland manager was full of praise for Keane: 'Robbie's been splendid for us, absolutely splendid. 'He scored a hat-trick (against Gibraltar) and he's a goalscorer,' he added. 'Shane (Long) of course scored a couple of goals at the weekend. He's in good form and looking forward to it. 'He has a little bit of pace up there and I think he can stretch them so he gets the nod. 'I'm sure that Robbie will be champing at the bit to get on the field.' Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.","Robbie Keane was dropped by Ireland for the first time since 2001 .

"Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson believes Brendan Rodgers should select Lucas Leiva in midfield because the Brazilian would add some defensive solidity. Liverpool have struggled this season to recapture the form that saw them run Manchester City close to last season's Premier League title and currently occupy 11th place in the current standings. And Lawrenson believes Lucas could be the solution to some of Liverpool’s current problems. Lucas Leiva tackles Real Madrid's Luka Modric (right) during his side's 1-0 loss at the Bernabeu last week . Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson insists that Brendan Rodgers should select Lucas in midfield . ‘Lucas is generally a 7/10 player. He isn’t going to change games, but he rarely lets you down and he knows his job,’ Lawrenson wrote in his Liverpool Echo column. ‘And if you are a team struggling for form, if you get enough 7/10 performances then you have a chance of changing from bad to good.’ Liverpool have struggled to dominate proceedings in midfield this season with Lukas restricted to three starts this term.

After all, if a player comes in and does well, isn’t that what you want? ‘I don’t see why Lucas and Steven Gerrard can’t both play in a deep-lying defensive mode.’","Liverpool have struggled this season to recapture the form that saw them run Manchester City close to last season's Premier League title .

"Eoin Reddan has admitted he refused to let himself dream of captaining Ireland as a youngster harbouring ambitions of a Test career. The 56-cap scrum-half conceded it will be 'surreal' to lead Ireland for the first time against Georgia at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Sunday.

'I'm sure he thought it was casual, but I was pretty shocked and happy to hear it. 'Maybe it's something you couldn't even let yourself dream of doing growing up. 'I always wanted to play for Ireland, but I didn't probably even ever get to dream that I might have the chance to do what I'm going to do on Sunday.'

'It will be a challenge to play against a fairly settled team when we haven't had very long together,' said Reddan. 'They are very strong in certain areas, and there are a lot of people out there expecting something different from what might pan out.

"Paris Saint-Germain reduced Marseille's lead at the top of Ligue 1 to one point after winning 'Le Classique' at the Parc des Princes thanks to goals from Lucas Moura and Edinson Cavani. PSG, who were boosted by the return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic from a heel injury he sustained in late September, remain second in the standings with 27 points from 13 games. Marseille have 28 points from 13. The Parisians struggled early on with Marseille pressing high-up and forcing their arch rivals into a string of poor passes and late tackles.

Andre-Pierre Gignac hit the upright with a bullet header from a corner in the fifth minute and two minutes later Romain Alessandrini whisked a half-volley passed the post after good work from Benjamin Mendy on the right. As the first half wore on undefeated PSG began to get a hold of the game with Marseille losing some intensity and they broke the deadlock when captain Thiago Silva surged forward, fed Cavani who set free Ezequiel Lavezzi who then crossed for Lucas to tap home after 37 minutes. Gignac should have levelled just after half-time after stealing the ball off Silva, but with just the keeper to beat he opted for a complicated chip. With Giannelli Imbula shown a straight red card with just over 10 minutes remaining, Marseille's hopes of turning the game round were over. Cavani sealed the win heading home his fifth goal in five games after a pinpoint cross from right back Serge Aurier, who had been released by 65th-minute substitute Ibrahimovic.

"Inspiration and determination helped France take revenge against Australia with a 29-26 victory at the Stade de France on Saturday as Les Bleus look set to end a miserable year on a high. Philippe Saint-Andre's team, who had conceded 95 points in three away defeats against Australia in June, were ultra focused this time around.

"For those harbouring ambitions to manage Barcelona (and for the rest of us) one Spanish paper has gone behind the scenes to reveal what it takes to be in charge of one of the world's greatest football clubs. Mundo Deportivo's cover story 'Le Cofidencial' has a detailed breakdown of the 44-year-old's average day. Enrique arrives at training around 7.30am, three and a half hours before the players, and one and a half hours before the rest of his coaches. He heads straight for his office, the same one used by Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova and Tato Martino. Unlike, his predecessors, though, Enrique shares the office with one oh his assistants. Mundo Deportivo reveal Luis Enrique's daily routine while Marca claim Isco will start for Spain on Saturday . After spending a couple of hours reviewing videos of both Barcelona and their opponents, he heads out to the training pitches with the players. Enrique has complete faith in his coaches and never interrupts when they are taking their own individual sessions. While there is order under Barcelona's manager, he does not treat the players harshly. The paper claims he commands a natural respect. One rule he does insist upon, though, is that discussing Catalonia's drive for independence is strictly forbidden. Marca, meanwhile, say Real Madrid midfielder Isco is in line for a place in Spain's starting line-up when they take on Belarus on Saturday. The 22-year-old profited from Gareth Bale's recent injury, and his impressive performances have not gone unnoticed by Vicente del Bosque. The former world champions are second in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, three points behind Slovakia and are looking to a younger generation of players to revive their flagging fortunes. La Gazzetta dello Sport say new Inter boss Roberto Mancini has become Serie A's highest paid manager . Roberto Mancini's shock return to Inter Milan is the headline story in every Italian newspaper. La Gazzetta dello Sport front page proclaims 'MANCIO IS BACK', and says that Walter Mazzarri's replacement has become the highest paid manager in Serie A. They also suggest Mancini will take the team back to playing a 4-2-3-1 and has highlighted Erik Lamela as a possible January transfer target. Mancini's first game as manager will be Sunday's Milan derby, but Gazzetta claim city rivals AC are not worried because Spanish striker Fernando Torres is a derby specialist. Chelsea fans may disagree. Fanatik's front cover carries a story claiming Galatasaray have requested talks with Lukas Podolski . Finally, Turkish newspaper Fanatik claim Lukas Podolski's time at Arsenal is drawing to close as Galatasaray step up their interest. Their article says Joachim Loew has warned the former Cologne man that if he doesn't play regularly for Arsenal he can't be picked for the national team. While Podolski has been picky about his clubs in the past, Fanatik say he has taken Loew's threat seriously and is ready to talk to the Turkish giants.","Barcelona boss Luis Enrique's daily routine explained in detail .

"Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi is ready to celebrate his 100th cap against Croatia on Sunday. The Azzurri meet Croatia in Milan where at least one of Euro 2016 qualifying Group H's 100 per cent records will go. Both have won their three games so far and look solid bets to reach France the year after next, but Sunday's clash remains an important one. Italy star Daniele De Rossi will make his 100th appearance for the Azzurri against Croatia on Sunday . De Rossi (second left) was part of the Italy squad that beat France on penalties to lift the 2006 World Cup . That is the case particularly for De Rossi, with the Roma man reaching three figures in the famous blue shirt. ""When I started playing football it was inconceivable for me to even think about reaching such a milestone,"" he told the team's official website. ""I will always have a place in my heart for this special game, especially when I can't play anymore. ""It may be that some younger players will overtake me someday, but still, this game will always be in my heart, it means that I was a part of Italian football history."" There will be no Mario Balotelli for Italy after the Liverpool man - back in the squad for the first time since the World Cup - suffered a hamstring injury in training and returned to his club. Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna is also out as a result of a similar complaint. One man tasked with ending Italy's perfect start to their Euro 2016 campaign is Croatia's Mateo Kovacis (left) Coach Antonio Conte has called up 14 new faces to his squad but none will be involved against Croatia, with their selections made with Tuesday's low-key friendly against Albania in mind. One man charged with bringing down Italy on Sunday is Inter Milan's Mateo Kovacic, who has been highlighted as a danger man by those in the home camp who know him well. ""I thank them for the praise. I think we (Croatia) are good, excellent, and have nine points and I hope we can continue at the San Siro,"" he said to Jutarnji List ahead of the clash at his club stadium. ""They may have said that because we are team-mates, but I thank them for their praise and we have nothing but praise for them. ""They will certainly be tough but we knew that already before.

"UEFA would have to consider leaving FIFA if world football's governing body does not publish in full American attorney Michael Garcia's report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, says German Football League President Reinhard Rauball.

It's the only way FIFA can restore some of its lost credibility.' Rauball was responding to German judge Joachim Eckert's ruling that exonerated Russia and Qatar of any corruption in their winning bids to host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively - a ruling that was harshly contested by Garcia.

Garcia indicated he will appeal Eckert's decision to close the case, saying it was based on 'materially incomplete and erroneous' interpretation of his own findings - 430 pages of investigative work sealed by FIFA from public scrutiny. Rauball warned if Garcia's findings are not published 'and this crisis is not resolved in a credible manner, you have to maybe also talk about the question of whether you are actually still well-served by FIFA.' Asked about possible consequences, Rauball replied, 'One option, which would have to be seriously considered, is certainly whether UEFA should leave FIFA.' He described Eckert's ruling as a 'communicative meltdown,' and said it 'shakes the foundations of FIFA in a way I never experienced before.'","Rauball says UEFA should consider leaving FIFA is report is not published in full .

"Temur Ketsbaia has stuck to his pledge to quit as Georgia manager.

"Ched Evans is engaged to his girlfriend Natasha Massey just two weeks after he was released from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker proposed to Ms Massey, who led the campaign against his conviction for raping a 19-year-old girl in his hometown of Rhyl, Wales. He spent two-and-a-half years at Wymott Prison in Lancashire before his release last month. Ched Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Ms Massey, who has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of the crime, was seen wearing a ring in a recent video the footballer made in which he claimed he was only guilty of infidelity . Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful. 'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.' It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring in the video, but it is now believed to have been a 'commitment ring' Evans gave her while he was in prison. The Sun reported on Monday that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed. A source told the paper Ms Massey was 'over the moon' and 'smiling from ear to ear'. Ms Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her . Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive. 'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose. 'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.' She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him. ‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. ‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month . Evans's own family have criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim. She said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’ His victim's father has also spoken out, demanding an apology from the footballer. He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found. ‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.' The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.","Welsh footballer jailed for five years in 2012 for raping 19-year-old woman .

"Victor Matfield has challenged South Africa to heed their World Cup warning after their defeat in Ireland. The 37-year-old lock dominated the line-out in Dublin while the Springboks pummelled Ireland at the scrum, but a host of handling errors scuppered a series of gilt-edged chances. Captain Jean de Villiers lamented the catalogue of ‘basic, grade-one’ mistakes while head coach Heyneke Meyer admitted he will know the majority of his World Cup 2015 squad by the end of the November tour. Victor Matfield looks dejected as the Springboks suffered a convincing defeat to Ireland in Dublin . Jonny Sexton, Ireland's star on the day, holds off a tackle from Duane Vermuelen in a terrific performance . But Matfield said his side must hit back against England on Saturday or face changes. ‘I think this is a wake-up call for us, there are one or two adjustments we need to make, especially in wet conditions,’ said Matfield. ‘The World Cup is still a year away and in the build-up to 2007 we had a big loss against France but we still went on to win the competition. ‘We made too many mistakes and one or two bad decisions as well.’ Referring to last month’s Springboks victory over the All Blacks, Matfield added: ‘Everyone was singing the praises of this team. One match later we are under huge pressure going to Twickenham.’ Tommy Bowe celebrates his try as Ireland put in a superb display against South Africa . JP Petersen did cross the line for the Springboks but Matfield admits they need to improve their performances . Ireland’s master tactician, head coach Joe Schmidt, had devised clear strategies to negate South Africa’s driving maul and deny the visitors any tempo. That frustrated South Africa with Rhys Ruddock and Tommy Bowe grabbing the pivotal tries and Johnny Sexton kicking 16 points. Ireland’s Robbie Henshaw (right), part of the new centre partnership with Jared Payne who was filling the shirt of retired legend Brian O’Driscoll, said: ‘To win was certainly a tough task. It is a really good start (to life without O’Driscoll).’","Victor Matfield calls Ireland defeat 'a wake-up call for us'

"England's players will be ordered to hit the Boks with a backlash at Twickenham on Saturday - to avoid a fifth consecutive Test defeat and end eight years of suffering against the world's No 2-ranked side. Stuart Lancaster's men go into Saturday's QBE series encounter on the back of four straight losses to New Zealand — knowing there is 'no hiding place' if they fall short again. Amid all the talk of the Springboks being in wounded-beast mode after their defeat in Ireland last Saturday, the hosts, including Danny Care winning his 50th cap, are ready to unleash frustrations of their own. England's Danny Care will win his 50th cap against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday . England's players gather for a team talk during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday afternoon . England head coach Stuart Lancaster watches his players prepare for Saturday's QBE series encounter . 'Of course there's going to be a backlash after the fourth defeat,' said forwards coach Graham Rowntree on Friday. 'That is being said in our camp. 'The guys are beating themselves up about it; we're beating ourselves up about it. That was at the start of the week. But you get out on the training field, start sorting things out and move forward.' The quality of the opposition will not serve as an excuse for English failure. Rowntree added: 'We've simply got to beat these teams, at Twickenham Twickenham. We keep coming close. They (South Africa) are the next big southern-hemisphere team to come to our stadium; we've got to beat them, we know that. And we'll go in all guns blazing to do that. 'The fact that we've not beaten them for X amount of years is almost irrelevant. We've just got to win this next game. There is an expectation on us, there certainly is within. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree insists England will react positively after defeat to New Zealand last week . Courtney Lawes (centre) prepares to play a pass as England's players train ahead of facing the Springboks . 'We are desperate to win. You can't hide the fact that we lost the last four games. There's no hiding place; we had some very frank discussions but you've quickly got to move on.' England scrum-half Danny Care will win his 50th cap at Twickenham on Saturday and the 27-year-old acknowledged that team development must soon give way to tangible success. 'I still think we are learning, but it will come to a time when the learning needs to stop and we need to get results,' he said. 'We have shown in patches just how good we are, but we need to turn that into 80-minute performances. The belief is there. We've got it, and we need to put it on the park.' Saracens star Brad Barritt receives a pass during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday . None of the home players have experienced a Test victory over South Africa, but visiting captain Jean de Villiers is wary of taking too much confidence from that. 'A big part of our group never experienced beating the All Blacks and we managed to do that earlier this year,' the Boks skipper said. 'It's the old thing about records; they're there to be broken. We certainly don't want them to.' But England are still wary of the South African threat after losing to the All Blacks and forwards coach Rowntree said: 'It will be a huge challenge, but we need this challenge after last week.'

"Relive Sportsmail's minute-by-coverage of England's clash against South Africa as Stuart Lancaster's side looked for their first win from the Autumn internationals. Host commentator . It may have looked close, but England were a long way behind South Africa today. The winless run is now up to 12 games against the Springboks, and surely Stuart Lancaster needs to change things against Samoa next week. 80mins: It nearly gets worse for South Africa, but La Roux knocks the ball on before celebrating scoring. 78mins: Just like last week against New Zealand, it seems as though England are going to be beaten by the clock. Seconds remain, as Brad Barritt goes over in the corner - but George Ford misses the tricky conversion. 76mins: And that, should be that. The visitors build some pressure in England's half and the ball is placed back for Lambie, who has kicked well all day, to send home a drop goal. England have been galvanised by their replacement half-backs. Ben Youngs has added tempo and energy behind the pack and George Ford has already shown his willingness to take the ball to the line and challenge the opposition at close quarters. As a result, England have started finding spaces and they have reignited the crowd. A grandstand finish is in prospect. 71mins: Sin-bin is over! Can England fight back and score that crucial try? 67mins: Perfect restart from England and 21-year-old George Ford sends the ball over the posts. 66mins: Now England could be in trouble. South Africa opt for the three points instead of kicking for the corner and Lambie holds his nerve. Significant changes - interesting with Ford now - must play territory, the chance of winning is through driving play. 64mins: George Ford and Ben Youngs on, Owen Farrell and Danny Care off. 61mins: Now it's England's turn to readjust after a dismissal. Dylan Hartley is off for stamping on an opponent, the referee saw it, but went to the TMO to check if it was worse than he thought. It was, and the hosts are a man down. 60mins: With Attfield back on, England are struggling to penetrate this backline again. Watson and Farrell have struggled today, is it time for Yarde and Ford from the bench? One of the reasons why England lost to New Zealand last week was because they failed to capitalise on having a numerical advantage when Dane Coles was sin-binned in the second half. This time, with Victor Matfield in the sin-bin, the hosts seized their chance in style by scoring two tries from outstanding rolling mauls, but Schalk Burger's riposte in similar fashion at the other end has put the Springboks back in the box-seat. 54mins: They're a man down but now it's South Africa's turn to overpower the hosts! They work a line-out towards the corner and Schalk Burger can't be stopped. Really heavy blows being landed, this is an incredible start to the second-half. 49mins: I said it was all over... what do I know! Chris Robshaw's me have really taken advantage of their, er, man advantage, and go straight through the middle yet again. Ben Morgan surges through, and three South African defenders can't stop him powering over the line. Game on, and the hosts want more! 45mins: Maybe this isn't over! Immediately after Attfield's dismissal Robshaw piles the pressure on the South African pack, and prop David Willson eventually goes over. It ended up being about nine against six there, and the crowd are back up for this one. 44mins: Attfield collapses the scrum... and we all know the referee had warned him! 41mins: Wow. 43 seconds into the second-half and South Africa may have wrapped this game up... A beautiful kick from Lambie opens up a two-on-one situation and Cobus Reinach eventually goes over for his first international try. Perfect exection, but what about the England defence? Huge mountain to climb now. Can England regroup, and mount a comeback here? It could have been worse after those opening ten minutes, but ultimately a disappointing half for England. Too many unforced errors, including one that lead to the only try, have cost them and Stuart Lancaster's side have been unable to put the visitors under any sustained pressure. The kicking game is off once again, the handling has been poor, while the decision making has prevented the few points on offer from being scored. 35mins: England win the penalty after Billy Vunipola's attacking tap and run. Not many chances so far but enough errors from either defence to see some points being scored. Handling errors just killing England so far - we have territory but again some attacking kicks needed to turn this defence. 32mins: Both sides are warned by the referee that any more collapsing of the maul could result in further action, Courtney Lawes the latest culprit and Lambie makes no mistake. Chris Foy: Steve Walsh has told the captains that there is a 'line in the sand' and the next offender will be sin-binned. 27mins: Much better spell from England, but there was a chance for more points. Attwood exploited a hole in defence and were he to unleash Watson, there was a try on offer in the corner. Instead he kept possession and the winger had to stop his run. In the end, South Africa are penalised for not releasing and Farrell gets England on their way. 22mins: Courtney Lawes charges down a kick in South Africa's 22 but the visitors are cool and kick the pool downfield despite the pressure. Need some points on the board. 20mins: Mike Brown surges through the defence to try and make things happen. but unforced errors mean England can't build up any sustained pressure. Chris Foy: England have dominated territory and possession so far in this game, using their rolling maul to good effect, but now they are in early crisis mode. The home side really need the next score or the pressure levels could engulf them. Stuart Lancaster will want to see his pack continue to use their driving game and harness Billy Vunipola's improved carrying. The irony is that they were calmly and patiently building a promising attack before Danny Care's intercepted pass gifted a try to the Springboks. So many unforced errors - four in a row from Engalnd - and it's costing us. How good are our basic skills? 1-15 poor kicking game so far, and it's wet. We have to turn them. Oh dear, oh dear. England finally get their hands back on the ball again, but Danny Care's pass is intercepted by Jan Serfontein. The centre has the whole pitch to run but is virtually unopposed; an easy try and an extremely sloppy start from England. It's converted from in front of the posts. Owen Farrell will be mighty relieved that his ill-advised attempt to run the ball out of his 22 only ultimately resulted in a penalty to South Africa, rather than a try. He tried to release Anthony Watson despite England being vastly out-numbered deep in their own territory and given the difficult handling conditions, he should have realised that it was a dangerous gamble. South Africa so nearly scored a try from turn-over ball - New Zealand would have done. 10mins: All that early pressure but a mistake has surely gifted South Africa the first points. Owen Farrell is back under his own posts to collect and could have cleared, but instead plays an inside pass to Anthony Watson despite the presence of two opposing defenders. It's turned over, and in fact Habana nearly goes over in the corner before it's dropped. They'll take the three. 7mins: Plenty of early territory for England. Kyle Eastmond tries his hand at storming through the defence with his pace but fumbles. Rain definitely a factor here, several knock-ons so far. 4mins: England deliver their own big hitting and earn themselves a penalty in their own half. In for some game looking at the two packs so far. No doubt that England are in an emotionally-charged state going into this game, judging by the sight of Billy Vunipola in tears during the national anthem. The Saracens No 8 knows he needs to deliver a big performance today and he is not the only home player under pressure to deliver. 2mins: First penalty of the game and it goes South Africa's way, near their own 22. Tough tackling from the visitors and England were struggling with their hands there, perhaps because of this wet weather. Eight years on from that last win, this is a huge chance for England to finally get one over the South Africans. We're underway with Farrell kicking off! Danny Care leads his team out at Twickenham on his 50th cap. Decent tache for Movember, too. Not long now! CHRIS FOY: Barometer readings at Twickenham are destined to soar off the scale today, as England attempt to cope with stifling, intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous South African juggernaut. National coach Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their QBE autumn Test series. Saturday’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss. A fifth successive defeat would leave England in freefall, just when they need to be building towards next year’s World Cup. Sir Clive Woodward, speaking on Sky Sports, says England 'have to win... so will win.' One thing's for sure, the kicking game will have to improve. And can Jonny May build on his performance last weekend? Kyle Eastmond against Jean de Villiers, Anthony Watson vs Bryan Habana... how do the two teams match-up? The players have arrived, the fans are in good spirit, the stage is set at Twickenham. With 13 games until the World Cup (can you believe that?) this Autumn international is crucial for both England and South Africa.

"The Faroe Islands enjoyed their finest night in their international history while Greek football fell to its knees on Friday. A 1-0 win in Athens is comfortably their greatest victory on the world stage, but the success in European Championship qualifying group F piles on the misery for the home nation. Already down and under fire after losing at home to Northern Ireland, Joan Edmundsson's 61st-minute goal could not have arrived at a more inopportune time. Faroe Islands' Joan Edmundsson celebrates after scoring against Greece . Coach Claudio Ranieri will do well to survive such a ghastly result, while deep problems in the domestic league will add to the gloom with the Hellenic Federation on Friday suspending all professional football after an alleged off-the-field attack on a referee. While a Greek inquest will now kick-off, the Faroes can celebrate a truly memorable win. This was just their 20th win since joining the international stage in 1988 and their first competitive one since 2011. Their last competitive away win came in 2001 against Luxembourg. Victories have come against the likes of San Marino and Gibraltar, though, and never against an established, top-level nation. While Greece may be falling, they were European champions 10 years ago and this win - brought about by former Newcastle United academy player Edmundsson - is a seismic one. Faroe Islands celebrate Joan Edmudsson's strike against Greece on Friday night . It was clear something unusual was in the offing as Greece laboured in the first half, where other sides would usually be scoring goals. They did not help themselves with a tepid opening, but even when they got about their opponents, they struggled to make hay. Panagiotis Kone had their first chance, heading wide from a corner, and then Andreas Samaris drove over from inside the box. Giannis Maniatis forced a first save of the game out of Gunnar Neilsen, but from distance, while Nikolas Karelis and Lazaros Christodoulopoulos were both off target. Greek impotency invited the Faroes on and two minutes before the break they went closer than anyone as Frodi Benjaminsen had a header clawed away by Orestis Karnezis. Former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri has lost three of his four games in charge of Greece . Their surprising pressure continued and Greece were happy to get in level at the break as Edmundsson also forced a fine save out of the home keeper. Buoyed by their chances, the Faroes started the second half impressively. Benjaminsen took aim from just inside the area and was set to celebrate until the ball hit the post. Greece continued to be slack and Edmundsson made Karnezis work again, and eventually the pressure told. On the hour Edmundsson connected with a ball from 12 yards out and the deadlock was broken. Greece knew they were facing a real embarrassment and Kone set about trying to make amends, but hit over when well set. Kone thudded the bar too, but the Faroes had earned their luck and their moment. Temur Ketsbaia's reign as Georgia coach looked to have ended after Group B leaders Poland romped to a 4-0 victory in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Tbilisi. Ketsbaia - who had spells in England with Newcastle and Wolves as well as playing for Scottish club Dundee - declared he would resign no matter what the final outcome at the Dinamo Arena, after just one win in their opening matches left Georgia with little hope of qualification. Poland, though, remain very much on course for booking a place for the finals in France, having defeated World Cup winners Germany in their last outing. The visitors made the breakthrough at the start of the second half, when Kamil Glik headed in from a corner, before two goals in as many minutes from Grzegorz Krychowiak and Sebastian Mila ended any hopes of a comeback. Arkadiusz Milik added a fourth in stopage time, which appeared to back up the post-match claim of Ketsbaia, appointed to the job in November 2009, that 'Georgian football is dead'. After soaking up some pressure from the hosts, Poland were denied by the woodwork twice in quick succession. Poland's Grzegorz Krychowiak (right) scores past  Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Loria . First, on 17 minutes, Miliks shot from the edge of the penalty area came back off the post, with the follow-up from Kamil Grosicki also hitting the upright - much to the relief of Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Loria. Georgia fashioned a good opening on 26 minutes when a clever backheel by Levan Mchedlidze after a thrown-in helped set up Alexander Kobakhidze for a sight of goal from just inside the box, but the Volyn midfielder blazed over. Poland coninued their dominance in the second half. Robert Lewandowski acrobative effort was tipped away by Loria, before the visitors took the lead on 51 minutes. A corner from the left was nodded back by Grzegorz Krychowiak and Glik headed it past Georgia midfielder Jaba Kankava on the line, who was afterwards booked for an attempted handball. Lewandowski drilled the ball over, before Georgia started to get a foothold back into the match as Kankava dragged a 22-yard effort just wide past diving Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Georgia's Gia Grigalava, and Poland's Arkadiusz Milik fight for the ball during Euro 2016 qualifier . Poland, though, doubled their lead with 20 minutes left. A deep free-kick from Maciej Rybus was flicked on by Glik towards the far post, where Krychowiak arrived to squeeze the ball past Loria. It was soon 3-0 when Slask midfielder Mila curled in a superb 25-yard effort after a sublime touch from Lewandowski had killed the ball out on the right touchline. Poland were denied by the woodwork once again on 83 minutes when Solomon Kvirkvelia's header bounced back off Poland forward Milik and struck the crossbar. The Ajax forward, though, got on the scoresheet in stoppage time, when he swept the ball home after Lewandowski's angled shot was blocked . Denmark's Simon Kjaer celebrates his goal against Serbia with Nicklas Bendtner (left) Denmark recovered from a goal down to beat Serbia 3-1 away thanks to Nicklas Bendtner's double and a goal from defender Simon Kjaer in their Euro 2016 Group I qualifier in an empty stadium on Friday. Bendtner equalised on the hour and struck again in the 85th minute, with Kjaer having put them in front in the 62nd, after Zoran Tosic gave the hosts the lead four minutes into the match. The game was played behind closed doors after Serbia got a two-game crowd ban for fan violence in their last home qualifier against Albania, which was abandoned after a drone stunt triggered a player brawl and a pitch invasion by Serbian fans. The result left Denmark top on seven points from four games while Serbia, who were awarded a 3-0 walkover win over the Albanians but were also docked three points and have appealed the latter part of the verdict, have one point from two games. The defeat has piled the pressure on Serbia's Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, who said he was considering quitting.","Joan Edmundsson was the hero for the Faroe Islands in Athens .

"Sale produced a dominant forward display to overwhelm London Irish's pack and claim a 36-8 triumph at the AJ Bell Stadium. Chris Noakes gave Irish a 3-0 lead via a penalty, but Sale dominated the rest of the half and scores from Dave Seymour, Dan Braid and a penalty try opened up a 22-3 advantage for the hosts. The Sharks claimed the bonus-point when they were awarded a second penalty try and, even though the Exiles scored a consolation through George Skivington, Andy Forsyth's touchdown rubberstamped the victory for the Sharks. Andy Forsyth of Sale scores a second half try during the Aviva Premiership match against London Irish . Sale Sharks scrum-half Will Cliff throws out the ball with his side leading the way against London Irish . Both teams went into this game with identical records having secured two wins from six matches, but Irish would have been more content with their start to the campaign. Brian Smith's men have already played all of last season's top-four, taking a surprise 22-19 victory over Leicester Tigers at Welford Road in the process, and they scored first here through the boot of Noakes. However, without Shane Geraghty to control proceedings from centre, who has been outstanding in their first six Premiership encounters, they were soon on the back foot. Although the Exiles escaped when Sale could not quite capitalise on a charge down kick, they weren't so fortunate a few minutes later. Instead of opting for the posts following a London Irish infringement at the scrum, the Sharks decided to go for the lineout inside the opposition 22 and it paid dividends. Despite the visitors halting the initial maul, Smith's side eventually succumbed to the pressure and Seymour went over from close range. Danny Cipriani gets stuck in to Eoin Griffin as he and his team-mates try to retreive the ball from London Irish . Cipriani uses his pace and agility to evade the clutches of London Irish winger Andrew Fenby . Danny Cipriani, continuing his fine form this season, added the extras and the hosts led 7-3. The fly-half then had a chance to extend their lead after Braid had broken through the heart of London Irish rearguard and he duly converted the opportunity as the home team moved seven points clear. Sale were now very much on the front foot and, after David Paice had received a yellow card for a cynical offence at the breakdown, they scored again, this time through Braid. With the Sharks' driving game proving destructive, Irish could not cope and referee Matthew Carley awarded a penalty try and also sin-binned back-rower Luke Narraway. To the visitors' credit, despite being down to 13 men at the start of the second period, they held out until Paice's return, but they could not resist the barrage and Carley awarded a second penalty try. Sammy Tuitupou of Sale Sharks (far left) is tackled by Chris Noakes of London Irish (centre and right) Tuitupou steps away from the London Irish players during their victory at the AJ Bell Stadium on Saturday . Even at that point it was effectively game over, although the Exiles briefly sprung into life when Alex Lewington's 50-metre burst almost resulted in a score, but an outstanding cover tackle prevented the winger from grounding the ball. With nothing to lose, Irish looked to move the ball from deep and they created opportunities before they finally touched down through Skivington. However, the final word was justifiably left to the Greater Manchester outfit as Nick Macleod broke through and off-loaded to Forsyth to go over.","Sale defeated London Irish in convincing victory at the AJ Bell Stadium .

"She's best friends with Cara Delevingne, is dating a Hollywood heartthrob and closed Burberry's SS15 show - could Suki Waterhouse get any cooler? The British model, as well as walking the runway for Burberry, has been unveiled as the new face of the brand's latest beauty offering. Suki, 22, showcases the results of the heritage label's new Fresh Glow Fluid Foundation Fluid and Fresh Glow Compact. Scroll down for video . Flawless! Suki Waterhouse has been unveiled as the new face of Burberry's latest make-up range and showcases the effects of the products in a candid campaign image . The luxury label, who broke into beauty this year, say their new products aim to leave you with an even, incredibly smooth and natural finish - just like Suki. On Monday, all eyes were on Suki, who was given the honour of opening and closing Christopher Bailey's show. Behind the scenes with Suki: The backstage imagery shows the 22-year-old wearing the new Fresh Glow Fluid Foundation Fluid and Fresh Glow Compact - plus an iconic Burberry trench, of course . Get the look: The luxury label say their new products aim to leave you with an even, incredibly smooth and natural looking finish - just like Suki, who has been apart of the Burberry family for a few years . Discovered: Suki was scouted in a pub when she was 16 and quit school to pursue a modelling career . Bradley Cooper's stunning girlfriend led the fashion pack down the runway for the show finale in a vivid printed red and pink trenchcoat. Supermodels Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne swapped places and sat on the front row - dressed head to toe in Burberry, of course - to watch their 22-year-old BFF model the SS15 collection. Insects of Britain was Bailey's point of reference and he translated this onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts, bags emblazoned with hand-drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for SS15 in every colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green. Suki showed us how to do organza for spring as she and the other Burberry girls stomped the catwalk in the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip, which were sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets. In action: Suki will try her hand at acting as Marlene in the upcoming sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent based on the book of the same name . Waists were nipped with cobweb tulle belts, creating a waspish silhouette adhering to the theme of the show, which was watched from the frow by Anna Wintour, Poppy and Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Mario Testino. Bailey, famed for his ability to reinvent the classics, reworked the iconic trench for next season in the brightest of hues with typographic prints and colourful high gloss collars. In a rare twist, models wore exclusively flat shoes, including field sneakers (which of course Cara already owns a pair of and wore to the show) and leather sliders, meaning well-heeled fashionistas can breath a much-needed sigh of relief come spring. After the show, Suki celebrated with her hunky Hollywood boyfriend Bradley Cooper but on Tuesday it was a girls' night. Leading the pack: Bradley Cooper's stunning girlfriend led the fashion pack down the runway for the show finale in a vivid printed red and pink trenchcoat .

It was a night of party hopping for Suki who attended the J Crew and Vogue bash at Winfield House in Regent's Park with stars including Anna Wintour, Victoria Beckham, Ellie Goulding and Jourdan Dunn. And as if that wasn't enough, she also made time to pop by London's EDITION hotel with her gal pals. Suki's burgeoning career began after being scouted in a pub when she was 16 - she quit school to pursue a modelling career. By the age of 19, she was modelling lingerie for Marks and Spencer and has since worked with Swatch, H&M and Pepe Jeans.

"With her quintessentially '80s coiffure and flawlessly natural make-up, Princess Diana's beauty look became one of the most iconic of our times. And now, one of her make-up artists has opened up about how Diana looked after her looks - and how women today can learn a thing or two from her. A-list make-up artist Mary Greenwell began working with Princess Diana in 1991 for Vogue’s December issue, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Mary Greenwell, a celebrity make-up artist who helped create Princess Diana's signature look, has opened up about the late Royal's beauty secrets . From there, the two women forged a close working relationship and Mary helped create the signature beauty look that the world will always remember. Speaking to Stylist magazine, Mary, who also works with Uma Thurman and Cate Blanchett, opened up about the first time she met the Princess on the Vogue shoot. Good routine: Mary explains that the late Princess was excellent at taking care of her skin and always ensured to take her make-up off before bed and apply it to a fresh face . Meeting Diana: A-list celebrity make-up artist Mary Greenwell began working with Princess Diana in 1991 for Vogue's December issue, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier . Glamming up: Even for a big event, Diana liked to keep her look natural and Mary advised her to start with a moisturiser on her skin, followed by a foundation that matched her skintone exactly and to always cover the roots of her lashes with lots of mascara . 'She was just coming into her own when we first met and had just married Prince Charles,' she said. 'Her marriage seemed solid and she was just the most divine, sweet kind lady. It was a huge privilege to work with our then future Queen.' Describing her as 'pure magic' with the 'most incredible skin', Mary told the magazine of how she managed to coax Diana away from using blue eyeliner (anyone with blue eyes should avoid blue eyeliner at all costs, warns Mary). 'Diana was always very open and willing with her style,' she said. 'I think as soon as we worked together she realised the power of hair and make-up and that is something that should never be underestimated. By anyone.' Experimental: Mary says that after their first meeting, Diana, whom she described as 'pure magic', became very open to experimenting with her hair and make-up . Artist to the stars: Mary Greenwell has worked at every fashion show and on countless glossy shoots. She also helps stars such as Uma Therman get red carpet ready . There were no secrets to Diana’s beauty, Mary explains, no crazy formulas or magic ingredients, just good care and attention. Mary told how Diana was very sensible when it came to her skin and took good care of her visage by always removing her make-up at the end of the day. She said: 'After I started working with her, Diana did everything in moderation. She cut back on drinking so her skin was 100 per cent.' Mary would start with a moisturiser on her skin, followed by a foundation that matched her skintone exactly. She would use concealer to lift the eye area and finish the look with a slick of mascara (ensuring to cover the roots of the lashes too) and a light sweep of blusher and lipsick. The make-up artist believes we should all take a few tips from Diana. 'It’s all about experimenting.  We should try new things. Whatever our age,' she added.","A-list make-up artist Mary Greenwell opened up .

"Eyelid surgery has become an increasingly popular way for Asian women to attain 'double eyelids' but a new invention promises a cheaper and less painful alternative to undergoing blepharoplasty in the operating theatre. The aim of blepharoplasty is to create . an upper eyelid with a crease (the 'double eyelid') from an eyelid . that is naturally without a crease. Fashion fans in Japan have now become hooked on a bizarre craze to give themselves these 'double eyelids' with an instant DIY facelift. Rather than pay £3,000 for cosmetic surgeons to give them eyelids with a more Western appearance, they can buy a £3.50 box of ordinary sticking plasters to give the same effect. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Teenagers in Japan have become hooked on a bizarre craze to give themselves Western-style 'double eyelids' with an piece of sticky tape they place on their lids . Many young Japanese strive to what they call double eyelids, with a crease missing from many natural Asian lids. One magazine, Scawaii Beauty, describes how cutting a semi-circular strip from a plaster and sticking it on the top of the eyelid will give a perfect Western-style crease. 'It is the godly effect we all want,' says the magazine.

Cutting a semi-circular strip from a plaster and sticking it on the top of the eyelid will give a perfect Western-style crease, claim Japanese magazines . The craze started in South Korea and has spread quickly through Japan, where teenagers think the ideal face would have big, Western-style round eyes and small Asian features. The tape is even sold on Amazon, where is it described as a 'medical grade tape designed to lift the eyelids and sagging skin around the eyes. The result is your eyes look bigger and clearer'. But the obsession has been criticised by traditionalists who say it is robbing the nation of its identity. 'How can you call yourself Japanese when you seem to be obsessed with making yourself look like something else?', writes one. Reika Kosaka, 23, who tried the tape, defended the trick, saying: 'We wear make-up, put on fake eyelashes and fingernails, add hair extensions and wear bras that make our breasts look bigger, so why not a bit of alteration of the eyelid, especially if it's only temporary for a night out on the town?'.

"Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs. Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design. A study has demonstrated how an ostrich's speed, energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals, including humans. Forget robots designed to look like humans, in the future running machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs. Scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move on two legs (illustrated) could usefully be employed in robot design . 'Birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners, with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors,' said lead researcher Dr Jonathan Hurst, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University. Running birds such as ostriches and emus are not necessarily the most graceful movers, but they save energy and avoid falling, Dr Hurst explained. 'These animals don't care that they appear a little unstable or have a waver in their gait,' he said. Working with colleagues from the Royal Veterinary College in London, roboticists from Oregon State University studied different species of birds. They used the results to develop a computer model that simulates the birds' behaviour. The experts concluded that robot design 'must embrace a more relaxed notion of stability' rather than focusing on a rock-steady gait. This was because the research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique. To hop over objects on uneven ground, each of the birds used a largely 'vaulting' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle, for example. 'The running robots of the future are going to look a lot less robotic,' said Dr Jonathan Hurst. 'They will be more fluid, like the biological systems in nature. 'We're not necessarily trying to copy animals, but we do want to match their capabilities.' 'Their real goal is to limit peak forces, avoid falling, be safe and be as efficient as possible. 'If their upper body seems to lurch around a little as a result, that's okay. 'What they are accomplishing is really quite elegant.' The research showed that a wide variety of birds with very different body sizes all employ essentially the same running technique. These ranged from quails to turkeys, emus and ostriches. To hop over objects on uneven ground, each of the birds used a largely 'vaulting' motion followed by a more crouched posture when on top of the obstacle. Unexpectedly, the scientists found that running birds do not prioritise stability in a rigid 'robotic' way. Instead, they allow their bodies to bounce around to some extent, while ensuring that they never fall. In order to stay upright, their leg movements may speed up or slow down, much like those of a scrambling rugby player. Oregon State University doctoral student Christian Hubicki, who co-authored the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, said: 'We should ultimately be able to encode this understanding into legged robots so the robots can run with more speed and agility in rugged terrain. Working with colleagues from the Royal Veterinary College in London, the scientists looked at different species of birds (turkey pictured) and used the results to develop a computer model that simulates their behaviour. In order to stay upright, their leg movements may speed up or slow down .

Scientists found running birds do not prioritise stability in a rigid 'robotic' way. Instead, they allow their bodies to move with more 'fluid' motions . 'These insights may also help us understand the walking and running behaviours of all the common ancestors involved, including theropod dinosaurs such as the velociraptor.'

"Lewis Holtby has thanked Fulham for his opportunity on loan and believes the potential of the young players at Craven Cottage will help the response to relegation from the Barclays Premier League. Germany midfielder Holtby had a limited impact on loan from Tottenham, playing 13 games, scoring once, but insisted he 'cried with the club' when the Cottagers' demotion to the Championship was confirmed at Stoke, ending their 13-year top-flight stay. 'It was fantastic to play for this club and they will always stay in my memories,' Holtby said on the club's official website. Down: Lewis Holtby was unable to help Fulham escape relegation during a loan spell from Tottenham . 'Even though we went down I had a fantastic time here. I cried with the club when we went down and Fulham will always be a part of me. 'The fans took to me and I took to them. I'm a person who plays with passion and desire. 'When you play for a club, even on loan, you have to give 100 percent dedication, you can't just go and take the money. 'You have to play football with heart and the Fulham fans deserve that.' Fulham reached the FA Youth Cup final, losing in agonising fashion to neighbours Chelsea, and Holtby believes youth can provide the foundation for future success. 'This club has a brilliant academy,' he said. 'A fresh start can see a lot of young blood come in and that can only bode well for the future.'

"A beauty blogger who has not washed her hair with shampoo for two years is claiming her hair is healthier than ever. Lucy Aitken Read, 32, ditched shampoo in the bid to get thicker, fuller and more lustrous locks after recoiling at the amount of chemicals she was lathering on to her head. Lucy went cold turkey using the ‘no-poo’ method, which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo. Scroll down for video . Natural: Beauty blogger Lucy Aitken Read, 32, who has not washed her hair with shampoo for two years is claiming her hair is healthier than ever . The movement is gaining momentum in beauty circles, with many claiming the benefits outweigh the negatives. Lucy chose to ditch shampoo on the first day of a job in the charity sector, and confesses her biggest worry was that, ‘I wanted my hair to look good’. She told the Telegraph: ‘I have always wondered whether the urban legend that if you leave your hair long enough it will start to wash itself was true or not. And when I became a mother I felt I should start looking more at what I was putting on and in my own and my children’s bodies.’ Healthy hair: Lucy uses the 'no-poo' method, which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo . Despite not using shampoo for two years Lucy has managed to create ambitious styles with her hair . The rationale behind the ‘no-poo’ method is that shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils, which prompts the scalp to generate more oils to replace them. This leaves the scalp greasy as it is overloaded with oil, which prompts us to then use shampoo. By not using shampoo, ‘no-poo’ advocates claim it returns to its natural balance, keeping the hair clean by itself. Lucy says in her book Happy Hair that the hair should be . healthier and stronger as it is less damaged than shampooed hair. Negatives: Lucy says using shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils, which prompts the scalp to generate more oils to replace them . However until luscious locks are achieved there is what Lucy calls ‘the tricky transition period’ in which the scalp continues to over-produce oils and she does admit there was a ‘smelly stage’. But she kept working at it, with the use of head-scarfs and natural remedies, and now says she has glowing auburn hair. Although she does admit she has been tempted to use shampoo:‘Once we were painting my house and I got paint in my hair and told my husband I was going upstairs to use his shampoo. He talked me down, because he knew I’d be disappointed afterwards if I did it. In the end I was able to just brush it out with a bristle brush.’","Lucy Aitken Read, 32, was unhappy with putting chemicals on her head .

"The space shuttle Endeavour has been paired once again with a space lab and storage pod it used on some missions as final preparation for its to go on display are carried out. The shuttle will become an exhibit at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. Once finished, it will become the most complete shuttle on display. The payload bay doors of the space shuttle Endeavour, housed at the California Science Center, stand open after the installation of a space lab and storage pod. The final exhibit is still four years away from being complete, according to the LA Times. But visitors to the temporary exhibit site will get a rare, brief chance to see Endeavour with both cargo bay doors open before they are closed again for more work after Oct. 21. None of the other shuttles on display have equipment in the cargo bay. Endeavour will also be the only one of the three retired shuttles that orbited the Earth — Endeavour, Atlantis and Discovery — to be posed with its nose pointing up, toward space. 'Just like it's ready to launch,' said Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the Science Center. Visitors to the California Science Center walk around the space shuttle Endeavour, on Friday, Oct. 10, 2014 in Los Angeles. In its final pose, the cargo doors will be open and people will be able to peer inside the craft, which was a workhorse during its two decades in flight. 'That's what this thing is about — bringing stuff to and from space,' Rudolph said. 'So that's why we really wanted to be able install a payload and put it up, and let people understand the function of the space shuttle a lot better.' President and CEO of the California Science Center Jeffrey N. Rudolph, poses for a photo in front of the space shuttle Endeavour . The Times said the next big steps for the Endeavour exhibit will probably happen next year, when construction of the $250 million Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center — its eventual home — begins. The museum has so far raised about $100 million of the $250 million needed to complete it. The center is expected to open in 2018.

"To appreciate society’s preoccupation with whiter teeth, one need look no further than our bathroom cabinets. From electric toothbrushes and whitening toothpastes to home-bleaching kits and flossers, perfecting our smiles puts a rather large dent in our pockets. But at around £600 professional whitening treatments are a luxury few can afford. So, can you get the same results for just £25 — without leaving your bathroom? Scroll down for video . Hollywood smile: To appreciate society’s preoccupation with whiter teeth, look no further than your bathroom . That’s the claim being made by the manufacturers of a new whitening product, who say 100 women tried it for ten days — and all saw their teeth become five or more shades whiter. The three-step Pearl Drops Pure White Whitening Kit comprises two serums — liquids in small pots with integrated brushes, rather like nail varnishes — and a toothpaste. Paint on the brightener serum and leave it on the teeth for 30 seconds, before brushing the activator serum over the top and leaving for another 30 seconds. Rinse thoroughly with cold water, then wait 20 minutes, before brushing for two minutes with the special toothpaste. And that’s it. There are no trays to sleep in, no fiddly strips, and no sitting under a laser with a rictus grin. So, how does it work? ‘There are two types of dental discolouration,’ says cosmetic dentist and Pearl Drops consultant Dr Abeer Al-Adhami. ‘These are extrinsic staining on the surface of the tooth, which can be polished off, and intrinsic staining, where the stain has actually been absorbed into the tooth and is more difficult to remove.’ Perfect smile: Pearl Drops Pure White Whitening Kit . To get rid of intrinsic staining, you need to bleach the tooth. During this process, the bleaching agent, which penetrates the surface of the tooth, reacts with the stain, making it transparent. The result is whiter teeth. But what makes this new product better than other home- whitening treatments? Professional whitening treatments tend to use the chemicals hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as bleaching agents. But, in the UK, these can’t be sold over-the-counter in concentrations that will really make a difference. Pearl Drops is using another bleaching agent — chlorine dioxide, more commonly used for purifying water — which works in the same way, and is found in some mouthwashes. The chlorine dioxide is produced when the activator serum is applied on top of the brightener serum, and remains active for about ten minutes. This breaks down the absorbed stains, while the special toothpaste helps remove the surface stains. Pearl Drops suggest repeating the process once a day for ten days for best results. It all sounds impressive, but does it really work? Marie Baron, 50, a manager in the publishing industry from South-West London, tried the new product for ten days. ‘I had a brace as a child, so my teeth have always been one of my better qualities,’ she says. An average person spends 38.5 days brushing their teeth over a lifetime . ‘But although I don’t drink red wine or smoke, because of my coffee habit — two to three strong cups a day — my teeth are not as white as I would like them to be. ‘Ten years ago, I had them professionally whitened and was really pleased with the results. But I haven’t been able to justify that sort of money since, and I’ve been wary of going somewhere cheap as you hear horror stories about your teeth being left feeling very sensitive. So how did she find the new Pearl Drops product in comparison? ‘The instructions were easy to follow and the results after ten days were amazing,’ she says. ‘According to the chart on the box, my teeth went from shade 11 to shade four, and I didn’t notice any more sensitivity. ‘I think the improvement in colour is as good as when I had them done professionally.’ Dr Al-Adhami adds: ‘Leaving it on for longer, or using it more than once a day, won’t make your teeth whiter, or speed up the process. ‘There’s a maximum amount of oxidation that can happen within any 24-hour period.’ Get a Hollywood smile without visiting the dentist: Professional teeth-whitening costs £600 (posed by model) But one dentist we spoke to is wary about this new home bleaching treatment. ‘Using the product for longer than the recommended time might damage the enamel of the teeth,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, clinical director of the London Smiling Dental Group. ‘In the past, a lot of beauty salons offered cheap whitening treatments that used chlorine dioxide. It’s an effective whitening agent, but it is also very acidic.’ She adds: ‘Patients were initially delighted with the results, but soon found that, as the protective enamel had been worn away, teeth stained more easily, leaving them darker and more sensitive. ‘Thirty seconds may not be long enough to cause the damage but, without published data showing long-term effects, I’d be wary.’ Nevertheless, Mark Wrighton, from Pearl Drops, insists there is no cause for concern: ‘The pH of chlorine dioxide is around the same as orange juice, which means having it in contact with your teeth for 30 seconds and then rinsing it off does no more harm than drinking a glass of juice every morning.’","At £600 professional whitening treatments are a luxury few can afford .

"Somewhere on a film studio’s cutting room floor is a six-minute scene showcasing the hitherto unheard and unappreciated opera-singing talents of Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Billy Connolly. Their rendering of a song from Verdi’s Rigoletto was to have been the climax of their new film, Quartet, but director Dustin Hoffman decided to scrap it — much to the relief of all concerned — because, as Connolly puts it: ‘Let’s face it, we weren’t very good.’ And Tom Courtenay adds: ‘The film is better without our singing. The irony is that all the extras in the film were real opera singers. Any of them could have sung perfectly well while we mimed. But Dustin wanted realism.’ Dustin and the Dame: Director Dustin Hoffman and his leading lady Dame Maggie Smith at the BFI London Film Festival premiere of Quartet . Hoffman — making his full debut as a director at the age of 75 — says: ‘It was all huge fun, and none of us took ourselves at all seriously. I have never enjoyed myself so much.’ The story centres on four elderly opera singers — played by Smith, 78 today, at her Downton Abbey-style best; Courtenay, 75; Collins 72; and Connolly, 70 — living out their twilight years in a retirement home for musicians, Beecham House, named after the celebrated British conductor Sir Thomas. They’re troubled by dementia, creaky joints, terminal tetchiness and bittersweet memories of the past. Smith and Courtenay’s characters, Reg and Joan, were briefly married, which doesn’t help matters. ‘All I want is nothing more than a dignified senility,’ complains Reg. Imperious Joan sneers at having to spend the rest of her days in a home associated with Beecham. ‘His father made laxatives,’ she says. ‘Seems rather apt for a nursing home.’ The four are being persuaded to sing together in a fundraiser, organised by the pompous Cedric Livingstone, played by another septuagenarian, Sir Michael Gambon, 72. Resting voice: Billy Connolly plays a retired opera singer in Dustin Hoffman's Quartet which hits the cinema on New Years Day . Hoffman had long wanted to direct a movie. His first attempt was in 1978, with Straight Time, in which he also played the leading role of a newly released criminal. ‘I got very confused with both jobs, so I fired myself from directing to concentrate on the acting,’ he says. ‘I was so traumatised that it’s taken me nearly 35 years, and almost the rest of my life, to get back in the director’s chair.’ Quartet had been in the planning stages for some time and already had a director, and a leading actor in Albert Finney, but they dropped out and the script was sent to Hoffman. Before filming, he had to tackle one major problem. As an actor, he has a fearsome reputation for standing no nonsense from directors; so has Dame Maggie. Was he scared of her? ‘I’d been forewarned that she can destroy you if you bull**** her, and I promised myself I certainly wouldn’t do that. ‘When we met, we sat on a couch and I said: “I think we have the same reputation for being hard on directors.” And she said: “Some.” I told her: “Yes, I can say the same thing.” And she was brilliant. We understood each other. ‘Mind you, she was the biggest diva of us all,’ he jokes. ‘While we all had a two-hour commute every day between London and where we were shooting in Buckinghamshire, she managed to bag herself a house less than ten minutes away from the set.’ Dame Maggie is up for a Golden Globe award next month for best actress in Quartet, and so the idea of another hit film about OAPs is very welcome. Having starred in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, about a group of British seniors who settle in India, which was well received by audiences and critics (she’s been nominated for Screen Actors Guild awards for it and Downton), she’s hoping it’s the start of a new trend. ‘There haven’t been many films made about the elderly, yet the ones that have been done have all been very successful,’ she says. This is all good for Maggie, as she’s normally the first in the queue to be offered such parts. ‘I don’t know why I’ve always been cast as an old lady — but I’m not complaining,’ she says. ‘I’m all too aware that this is a very tough business and my advice to anyone looking to come into acting is “try not to cry too much”, because it is hard and can be heartbreaking. So, to have worked as much as I have, in any role, is a real privilege.’ Always the Lady: Dame Maggie Smith, seen as Dowager Duchess Lady Violet Grantham on Downton Abbey, said she does not mind being typecast as an old lady . With Dame Maggie and Sir Tom already . cast, Dustin had to find two more actors to play the other members of . the quartet, Wilf and Cissy. ‘I asked Maggie who should play Cissy, and . without missing a beat, she said Pauline Collins.’ Dustin . had not seen Shirley Valentine or anything else Pauline had appeared . in, so he watched her in Woody Allen’s Tall Dark Stranger and was . suitably impressed. But there were a few cultural differences to . overcome. ‘I don’t think he really understood me at the beginning,’ says Pauline, who rose to fame as parlour maid Sarah in Upstairs, Downstairs. ‘I remarked that, unlike Maggie, I seemed to have spent my career “downstairs”, meaning that I was always playing parts under the stairs. ‘But he took it to mean I was always billed below the title, and he said: “After this film, you won’t be any more.” It took a while, but we totally get each other now.’ Pauline’s character, Cissy, has vascular dementia. She says Hoffman gave her free rein to interpret the role how she liked and she partly based it on her mother, who had dementia. ‘He is a dynamo and one of the kindest and most inspiring directors I’ve ever worked for,’ she says. Billy Connolly jokes: ‘On the other hand, I found him to be a complete nightmare. He threw tantrums, we had to endure long silences and he has a habit of touching you inappropriately.’ Hoffman had long been a regular at Connolly’s stand-up gigs, so the two of them were friends. ‘When Dustin asked me to join the cast and he reeled off all the other names, I thought: “Oh, Jesus, I can’t do it,” ’ says Connolly. ‘But I thought about it and remembered how much I’d enjoyed working with another big name — Judi Dench, in Mrs Brown. That brought out the best in me, so I told myself not to be a coward and I hoped Maggie and the rest would do the same for me in Quartet.’ Dustin laughs as Billy goes on to explain how he found playing the tactless, over-sexed yet loveable Wilf. ‘Dustin let me throw in my own ad-libs, which is generous. ‘It worked for me because I think people get to a certain age and feel they’re finally able to say what they want.’ Hoffman says he never had any doubts about the film’s box-office potential. ‘Quartet is no different from a film about dancers or athletes in that it’s about having an extraordinary gift that goes and then no one wants you any more. It looks at people who become invisible because of age. ‘Every member of the supporting cast really is a retired musician or singer, whose phone stopped ringing with offers of work a long time ago, even though they can still deliver. ‘These guys are 70, 80, 90 years old, yet as soon as they arrived on set, they brought such energy and verve we all felt it. Directing the film didn’t seem like a job and I don’t know if I’ll ever feel like that again. I truly lucked out. ‘Life is a game with God,’ he says, pointing to the skies. ‘It’s like saying: “Don’t be so sure that you’re gonna stop me.” To me, that’s what this film is all about.’ Quartet opens nationwide on New Year’s Day.",Dustin Hoffman on directing Dame Maggie Smith in new film Quartet .
"A Tulsa, Oklahoma, couple have gone from zero children to five in less than a year after they adopted triplets then fell pregnant with twins. After struggling to conceive, Sarah and Andy Justice went to see a specialist who told them IVF would cost them up to $60,000 and they'd still have just a 10 per cent chance of getting pregnant. So, they told Tulsa World, they decided to adopt, and after an arduous time they were matched with a soon-to-be mother. However, when Sarah took the birth mother for an ultrasound, the doctor had a surprise - not one but three babies were on the way. Scroll Down for Video .

'Wow! This is great,' thought the . couple, who knew they wanted more children but didn't want to go through . the exhausting adoption process again. 'It's everything we wanted.' The babies - Joel, Hannah and Elizabeth - were born premature but healthy nine months ago, and were still in neonatal intensive care when Sarah and Andy had their second surprise. Sarah was pregnant. Two months later, at a sonogram to find out the sex of the new baby, Sarah called Andy. 'One is a boy,' she said. 'One!?' he exclaimed.

"Most of us are happy with a toothpaste that costs a couple of pounds. But a new generation of super-toothpastes costing up to £100 a tube has emerged — with extravagant promises such as rejuvenating gums and regenerating enamel. So, is it worth splashing out? Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, who leads an expert panel of dentists that examines manufacturers’ claims to ensure they are clinically proven, gives his verdict: . BREATH FRESHENER . Dr Katz California Breath Plus, £8.95, californiabreathuk.co.uk . Part of a range by Dr Harold Katz, dubbed Hollywood’s ‘Bad Breath Guru’. Is claimed to help with the most stubborn bad breath and fight cavities. TASTE TEST: This is a dense, clear gel. There is none of the familiar foaming action of a conventional toothpaste. It glides over the teeth as you brush. It doesn’t have a bad after-taste, but nor do you get a minty-fresh mouth feel. DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘The toothpaste contains all of the usual ingredients: water, abrasive silica, which is very fine quartz that aids the cleaning process, and flavouring. ‘The only extras are xylitol — a sweetener that inhibits the growth of bacteria, which is also found in a lot of supermarket own-brand toothpastes — and flavourings, such as peppermint oil, but nothing to justify the price. ‘The claims being made are excessive. It says it gets rid of and prevents bad breath — but there is nothing I can see in there that indicates that is going to be the case. ‘This is an under-formulated and over-sold product.’ COCOA TOOTHPASTE . Theodent 300. Was £103.95, now £67.55 (biovea.com) The most expensive toothpaste on sale. It uses a patented formula with an extract found in cocoa beans, which the company says can replace fluoride. TASTE TEST: A white paste with mild minty taste. This boasts that it is ‘not harmful if swallowed’, and advises users to brush and rinse, then brush a second time and spit out the excess. If you swallow it, there is an unpleasant hint of cocoa . . . and a sudden urge to retch. DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘I can’t find any robust scientific evidence that this works. It’s fluoride-free, so I’d be surprised if it had any decay-preventing effect, which is the key thing you want out of a toothpaste. ‘In terms of spitting rather than rinsing, I would advise everyone to do that. But brushing twice? Other than telling you to use twice as much of a very expensive toothpaste, I can’t explain that. The price is utterly unjustified — 20 times the cost of a well-researched toothpaste for something fluoride-free. You’d be better off with a 25p fluoride toothpaste from Tesco.’ WHITENING TREATMENT . Dr Oliver White Smile Whitening Toothpaste, £12, spacenk.com . Dr Joe Oliver is founder of London’s Welbeck Clinic, which boasts numerous celebrity patients, including Helena Bonham Carter. This claims to use hydrogen peroxide to gently whiten teeth. It also contains anti-tartar and anti-stain ingredients intended to help teeth stay whiter. TASTE TEST: A speckled green gel with a moderate foaming action. It has a sour minty taste which, thankfully, doesn’t linger once you have rinsed. DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘Some whitening toothpastes do have an effect, thanks to abrasive ingredients that remove stains from the surface of the teeth. It is claimed this one whitens teeth using hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent. ‘Toothpastes sold in the EU can legally contain only 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide, and the chance of that amount having an effect is virtually non-existent. ‘You need to be getting at least 30 times that amount to achieve anything. There is nothing that would be costly in any way — a product at an eighth of the price is going to be as good.’ ENAMEL REBUILDER . Regenerate Enamel Science toothpaste, plus ‘boosting’ serum kit, £40, selfridges.com . Said to be the ‘first dental care system able to reverse the erosion process’. With each use, the ingredients form a fresh supply of enamel mineral which binds to the teeth. TASTE TEST: The toothpaste itself is glittery-white and the most dense of the four. It produces a strange tingly sensation on your gums, but the taste is pleasant and minty. The twice-daily toothpaste is used as part of a combination with a serum applied for three days in the month. DR CARTER’S VERDICT: ‘This one is the result of ten years of research and there are already extensive published scientific studies to support what it says the product’s doing. ‘Regenerate as a name is perhaps a little bit misleading, because you’re not going to regrow enamel. What it does is put a new coating of minerals — which appears to be virtually indistinguishable from enamel — over the teeth. ‘This is really exciting science. It is expensive but, with ten years of research and as a unique product on the market, there’s a real reason for the premium price.’","New toothpastes claim to rejuvenate gums and regenerate enamel .

"Rival agents have again raised concerns about Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock’s son working for a football agency that has close links with Selhurst Park.

Salthouse said: ‘I was working with Palace long before Neil Warnock became manager and my close connections are with the chairman Steve Parish who negotiates the transfers rather than Neil. Obviously if there is any work between us and the Palace manager, James would not be involved in any way.’ Football managers with sons working as agents has been a controversial subject since the furore surrounding the Manchester United transfer business handled by Jason Ferguson.

Sports editor Bruce Millington and Alan Byrne, CEO of troubled trade paper the Racing Post, were taken by helicopter to Newmarket races for lunch with Qatar’s Sheik Fahad, who is said to have major issues with the newspaper’s downbeat build-up to Ascot’s Champions Day sponsored by Fahad’s QIPCO investment company. Millington said the Post’s coverage was discussed but there was nothing unusual. Meanwhile, the Post are effectively boycotting the running of their flagship sponsored race at Doncaster next Saturday because of the row over the hugely increased cost of racing data that involves racetrack owners Arena Racing Company. The Post’s duty reporter may even present the trophy. Work takes place on the roof at the Olympic Stadium, which is expected to exceed budget by £50m . It is going to cost around £50million more than expected to refurbish the Olympic Stadium for tenants West Ham because of the complexity of fitting the new roof. Builders Balfour Beatty, being paid £154m to convert the stadium, are in talks with the London Legacy Development Company about increasing their fee to as much as £200m because of the extra work involved. The steel rods holding up the cantilever roof have had to be strengthened in a highly technical and costly process only previously done on North Sea oil rigs. The terms of West Ham’s 99-year tenancy from the 2016-17 season ensures conversion costs are met by LLDC, who will have to find the extra money from the contingency budget for Olympic Park construction projects. An LLDC spokesperson said: ‘This is a complex project and there are always on-going discussions about specific elements within it.’ Leeds owner Massimo Cellino was said to be behind the decision not to start Adryan against Rotherham .
