Police searching a flooded home stumbled upon a terrifying cache of weapons including 250 handguns and a bazooka. Officers in Germany visited the empty flat following reports from neighbours that water was leaking through the ceiling into their apartments. But when they got inside the soaked property they were stunned to find the private arsenal of convicted burglar Uwe Giesemann, 69. He is now on the run and police are appealing for help in tracking him down. The terrifying haul prompted the search of another property in Hannover also belonging to the 'unkempt' criminal. In total they found 250 handguns, a number of machine guns, gun parts, hand grenades, silencers, night vision goggles, a bazooka, and a large quantity of ammunition. German police made the alarming find in November, but have only just released details as they look to track down the bearded fugitive who is feared to have been an arms dealer operating out of the city for years. The cache of weapons is worth approximately £500,000 and is the biggest weapons find Hannover police have ever had to deal with. During the search they also came across £250,000 cash and a lot of expensive watches and jewellery with the total haul thought to be worth around £860,000. A police spokesperson said: 'This is one of the biggest weapons finds we've ever had.' Arsenal of guns found by police inside two properties belonging to Uwe Giesemann, a suspected arms dealer .

Sleeping through the night is the milestone that all new mothers hope their baby will reach - and millions of baby books are sold every year promising to deliver it. Now a hilarious new pastiche entitled 'How To Stop Mummy Sleeping Through The Night' is at least providing some laughs for sleep-deprived parents. The blog, imagined from a seven month old’s perspective, follows the style of manuals which order parents not to sway from their goal of getting their baby to Sleep Through The Night (STTN). Exhausting: Dealing with fractious infants can be a tough gig - especially when you're getting just a few hours sleep a night . But instead it tells babies to stick with their goal of night feeding, urging: 'It's hard to see your Mummy upset over your crying. Just keep reminding yourself, it's for her own good.' The blog imagines what a baby really thinks when at around the six month mark when many mothers are preparing to return to work and start various tactics to train their baby to sleep through. It starts: 'OK, here’s my situation. My Mummy has had me for almost seven months. 'The first few months were great. I cried, she picked me up and fed me, anytime, day or night. Then something happened. 'Over the last few weeks, she has been trying to STTN (sleep through the night). At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it is only getting worse. 'I’ve talked to other babies, and it seems like it's pretty common after Mummies have had us for around six months. 'Here’s the thing: these Mummies don’t really need to sleep. It's just a habit. Many of them have had some 30 years to sleep and they just don’t need it anymore. So I am implementing a plan.' Singer Adele (left) and actress Anna Paquin (right) will empathise with the plight of other new mothers . Just as sleep training advocates like Gina Ford use cheerleading tactics to buoy on exhausted parents it continues: 'CONSISTENCY IS KEY!! If you let her STTN (sleep through the night), just once, she will expect it every night. 'I KNOW IT'S HARD! But she really doesn’t need the sleep, she’s just resisting the change.' It also pokes fun at one tactic called 'shhh pat' - a softer approach from Tracey Hoggs a.k.a The Baby Whisperer, which is used by parents uncomfortable with controlled crying, and it claims dads are a soft touch. 'Sometimes my Mummy will call for reinforcements by sending in Daddy. 'Don’t worry, Daddies are not set up for not needing sleep the way Mummies are. They can only handle a few pats and shhing before they declare defeat and send in the Mummy.' The post – which has 50,000 likes on Facebook has caught the imagination of tens of thousands of mothers, who have exclaimed that the is so accurate that it could have been penned by their own baby. The sleep-stopping plan is even given a name – the Crybaby Shuffle. No joke: Being kept awake by a crying baby for weeks on end is hard - but at least new mothers will be able to smile at the blog . One laugh out loud section reads: 'I cried for any reason I could come up with. My sleep sack tickled my foot. I felt a wrinkle under the sheet. My mobile made a shadow on the wall. I burped, and it tasted like pears. I hadn’t eaten pears since lunch, what’s up with that? The cat said 'meow'. I should know. My Mummy reminds me of this about 20 times a day. LOL. 'Once I cried just because I liked how it sounded when it echoed on the monitor in the other room. Too hot, too cold, just right - doesn’t matter! Keep crying!! 'I like to give Mummy . false hope that listening to the rain puts me to sleep so sometimes I . pretend to close my eyes and be asleep and then wait until I know Mummy . is settling back to sleep to spring a surprise cry attack. 'If she . doesn’t get to me fast enough I follow up with my fake cough and gag . noise that always has her running to the crib. 'It took a while, but it worked. She fed me at 4am. Tomorrow night, my goal is 3:30am. You need to slowly shorten the interval between feedings in order to reset your Mummies internal clocks.'

Many readers commented on the post saying they identified with it only too well. Krishna Misra wrote:'OMG! This is exactly my son! Thanks for making it clear we are not alone!

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 14 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 14 May 2013 . A U.S. diplomat was expelled from Russia on Tuesday after the Kremlin's security forces said that he tried to recruit a Russian agent. The FSB counter intelligence service claimed Ryan Christopher Fogle was caught red-handed seeking to recruit a Russian . intelligence officer. The Russian agency displayed evidence that they claimed to have found on Fogle including wigs, packets of cash, a knife, map and compass, and a letter promising millions for 'long-term cooperation'. Scroll down for video . Seized: Ryan Christopher Fogle was arrested and taken to FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, Moscow, and later handed over to the U.S. embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . Capture: A man named as Ryan Fogle sits at the receiving office of the Federal Security Service in Moscow on Monday . The FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, identified the diplomat as Fogle, a third secretary at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, detaining him briefly overnight. It alleged Fogle was a CIA officer trying to recruit a Russian counter-terrorism officer who specializes in the volatile Caucasus region in southern Russia, where the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects had their ethnic roots. Fogle was handed over to U.S. Embassy officials, declared persona non grata and ordered to leave Russia immediately. He has diplomatic immunity, which protects him from arrest. The State Department would only confirm that Fogle worked as an embassy employee, but wouldn't give any details about his employment record or responsibilities in Russia. Some officials also referred inquiries to the CIA, which declined comment. Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade. While relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident. Arrested: The U.S. diplomat - suspected by Russia of being a CIA agent - was named as Ryan Christopher Fogle . Seized: The FSB claimed a third secretary in the political section of the U.S. Embassy had attempted to recruit a Russian secret services official . The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul to appear on Wednesday in connection with the case. McFaul said he would not comment on the spying allegation. Russian officials expressed indignation the U.S. would carry out an espionage operation at a time when the two countries have been working to improve counterterrorism cooperation. 'Such provocative actions in the spirit of the Cold War do nothing to strengthen mutual trust,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Russia's Caucasus region includes the provinces of Chechnya and Dagestan. The suspects in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings - Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his elder brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a manhunt  are ethnic Chechens. Tamerlan spent six months last year in Dagestan, now the center of an Islamic insurgency. U.S. investigators have been working with the Russians to try to determine whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev had established any contacts with militants in Dagestan. Despite the end of the Cold War, Russia and the United States still maintain active espionage operations against each other. Last year, several Russians were convicted in separate cases of spying for the U.S. and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences. But Tuesday's case had espionage elements that seemed more like Spy vs. Spy than Ludlum and le Carre. Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Russian state TV showed pictures of a . man said to be Fogle, wearing a baseball cap and a blond wig, lying . face down on the ground. The man, without the wig, was also shown . sitting at a desk in the offices of the FSB, the Federal Security . Service. Two wigs, a compass, a map of Moscow, . a pocket knife, three pairs of sunglasses and envelopes of 500 euro . notes (each bill worth $649) were among the items the FSB displayed on a . table. The FSB also produced a typewritten . letter that it described as instructions to the Russian agent who was . the target of Fogle's alleged recruitment effort. The letter, in Russian and addressed . 'Dear friend,' offers $100,000 to 'discuss your experience, expertise . and cooperation' and up to $1 million a year for long-term cooperation. The letter also includes instructions for opening a Gmail account to be . used for communication and an address to write. It is signed 'Your . friends'. 'If this is genuine, then it'll be . seen to be appallingly bad tradecraft - being caught with a . ''How-to-be-a-Spy 101'' guide and a wig. 'He would have had to have been . pretty stupid,' said Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University . who studies the Russian security services. Samuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King's College London, called the evidence bizarre. Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . 'I wouldn't have thought that spies . gave each other written instructions,' he said in a telephone interview. Greene also noted that the FSB had displayed Fogle's official . diplomatic ID, suggesting he was carrying it along with the spy . paraphernalia when he was detained. 'Maybe this is what the CIA has come . to, maybe the propaganda folks in the Kremlin think we are this stupid, . or maybe both,' he said. A five-minute video produced by the . FSB and shown on state TV showed a Russian official speaking to what . appear to be three U.S. diplomats who had come to pick up Fogle in the . FSB office. The official, whose face is blurred, . alleged that Fogle called an unidentified FSB counterintelligence . officer who specializes in the Caucasus at 11.30pm on Monday . He then said that after the officer . refused to meet, Fogle called him a second time and offered 100,000 . euros if he would provide information to the U.S. The Russian official said the FSB was . flabbergasted. He pointed to high-level efforts to improve . counterterrorism cooperation, specifically FBI director Robert Mueller's . visit to Moscow last week and phone calls between President Obama and . Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'At a time when the presidents of the . two countries are striving to improve the climate of relations between . the two countries, this citizen, in the name of the U.S. government, . commits a most serious crime here in Moscow,' the official said. State Department spokeswoman Jen . Psaki confirmed that an officer at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was . briefly detained and released. Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' 'We have seen the Russian Foreign . Ministry announcement and have no further comment at this time,' said . Psaki, who was in Sweden with Secretary of State John Kerry. Little was immediately known about . Fogle. A third secretary is an entry level position at the State . Department, the lowest diplomatic rank in the foreign service. Putin has stoked anti-American . sentiments among Russians in recent years in what is seen as an effort . to build support at home. He also appears to have a genuine distrust of . Russian nongovernmental organizations that receive American funding, . which he has accused of being fronts that allow the U.S. government to . meddle in Russia's political affairs. Hundreds of NGOs have been . searched this year as part of an ongoing crackdown by the Russian . government. Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Galeotti said the public exposure of . Fogle suggests a political purpose behind the detention. He said these . kinds of spying incidents happen with some frequency, but making such a . big deal of them is rare. The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, . 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of . pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the . country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In . the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter . of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was . shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One . of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an . American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. 'More often, the etiquette is that . these things get dealt with quite quietly — unless they want to get a . message out,' Galeotti said. 'If you identify an embassy staffer . who is a spy for the other side, your natural impulse is to leave them . be, because once you identify, you can keep tabs on them, see who they . talk to and everything else.' 'There's no reason to make a song and dance, detain them, eject them,' he said. Greene said Fogle's detention should . be seen as part of Putin's confrontation with the opposition and not as . something likely to have a major impact on U.S.-Russia relations. 'I think this is mostly for domestic . consumption in Russia so that people say, ''look at these naughty . Americans trying to meddle in our internal affairs and spy on us,''' Greene said. 'But everybody's got spies everywhere so I don't see this . as a major issue.' In Washington, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell also said the incident was unlikely to hamper U.S.-Russia relations. 'I'm not sure I'd read too much into . one incident one way or another,' he told reporters, and pointed to . Kerry's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sweden on . Tuesday evening. 'We have a very broad and deep . relationship with the Russians across a whole host of issues, and we'll . continue to work on our diplomacy with them directly.' Alexei Pushkov, who heads the . international affairs committee in Russia's parliament, wrote in a . Twitter post that the spy scandal would be short-lived and would not . interfere in Kerry and Lavrov's discussions aimed at bridging deep . differences over the civil war in Syria. 'But the atmosphere is not improving,' Pushkov commented.

A leading Republican blamed President Obama and his administration for 'outing' the Pakistani doctor who helped locate Osama bin Laden and who has now been sent to prison for 33 years. Representative Peter King, the New York congressman who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, pointed to White House administrators for identifying Dr. Shakil Afridi to Pakistani authorities. 'They put him out there,' Mr King said in light of the doctor's prison sentence for treason by the Pakistani government. Treason: Dr Shakeel Afridi, pictured left, was jailed for 33 year in Islamabad for helping the U.S. find Osama bin Laden by setting up a vaccination programme that led him collect DNA from the Al Qaeda leader's children . 'This has been handled very poorly right from the time of the raid,' Mr King told Fox News. 'They disclosed his identity.' The sentence is viewed by Western officials as punishment for humiliating the nation which claimed not to know it was  harbouring the Al Qaeda leader. Pointing the finger: Representative Peter King says that the Obama administration revealed the doctor's identity, effectively leading the Pakistani authorities to him . Dr Shakil Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS last May. It sparked a major rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. A furious Pakistan felt the covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror. American officials have already started rallying on the doctor's behalf, urging the Pakistani government to overturn the sentence which is said to include hard labor and extensive fines. 'What Dr. Afridi did is the furthest thing from treason. It was a courageous, heroic and patriotic act, which helped to locate the most wanted terrorist in the world,' Senators John McCain and Carl Levin wrote in a joint statement. The Republican Mr McCain and Democratic Mr Levin both serve on the chamber's Committee of Armed Services. It is not clear if Dr Afridi knew who the target of the investigation was when the CIA recruited him, or what DNA he actually collected in the fake hepatitis B vaccination programme. Dr Afridi was accused of having taken half a dozen cooler boxes without authorisation. Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan, his house was sealed and all assets frozen. A commission recommended a charge of conspiracy against Pakistan and high treason.US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta confirmed in January that Dr Afridi collected DNA in an effort to help locate Bin Laden but added he ‘was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan. For them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism is a real mistake’. Dr Afridi had no right to  legal representation, to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. He must also pay a £2,300 fine or serve a further three-and-a-half years in jail. US Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton has called for  his release.

A leading racing trainer will face charges of giving his horses steroids tomorrow after the sport was engulfed by a huge doping scandal. Mahmood Al Zarooni will appear before a disciplinary panel of the British Horseracing Authority after samples taken from 11 of his horses were found to have contained traces of anabolic steroids. Al Zarooni trains the horses for the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed, and faces losing his licence if he is found guilty. He bizarrely claimed yesterday that he did not know what he was doing was wrong as the sport was engulfed by one of the most significant alleged doping scandals in recent history. The 37-year-old Godolphin trainer has officially been charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing. The hearing will be held at 2.30pm at BHA headquarters in London. Samples were taken earlier this month from 45 horses trained by Al Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks Stables, Newmarket. Subsequent analysis revealed 11 of them contained ethylestranol and stanozolol, which are prohibited substances. The BHA said today that Al Zarooni had admitted giving banned substances to a further four horses - Comitas, Sashiko, Vacationer and Tearless. Those horses were under the care of the Newmarket trainer, but had not been subjected to testing. Ladbrokes said they were refunding £200,000 of bets on horses which have tested positive for banned substances, in a move to reassure punters. Other bookmakers also pledged to refund ante-post bets which are placed a long time before the race. Normally punters lose their money if a . horse is forced to pull out, but bookmakers have agreed to refund wagers . because of the scandal. Scroll down for video .

Scandal: 2012 St Leger winner Encke was trained by Al Zarooni who will tomorrow face disciplinary charges . INSIGHT by PETER SCUDAMORE, National Hunt Great . One of the bleakest episodes for British racing,Godolphin and, more especially, SheikMohammed there’s no other reaction to the anabolic steroids found in 11 horses trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni. British racing likes to think of itself as one of the world’s cleanest — we feel superior as the US allows raceday medications. While British racing hasn’t become a hotbed of drugs, to have one of its biggest players embroiled in the biggest drug scandal I canremember is a body blow. International flat racing is hugely important but it is nothing if you lose confidence that the sport is clean. Few people in flat racing will dare to say too much about Godolphin asthe huge majority are tied financially into the Sheik’s empire, but they must be seen to face rigorous investigation and scrutiny from the authorities — or fail to rebuild their reputation. Al Zarooni didn’t just commit the most heinous act for a trainer on a whim. Maybe he felt forced to turn to drugs to secure success. Sheik Mohammed has been hailed as a great leader — those qualities are needed more than ever to save his racing empire’s reputation. Among the horses that tested positive was unbeaten 1,000 Guineas hopeful Certify. Between them, the 11 have won more . than $2m (£1.31m) in prize money. Certify has now been banned from taking part in the race on May 5, in a hugely embarrassing . development for Al Zarooni’s Godolphin stable boss Sheikh Mohammed bin . Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. Three other thoroughbreds owned by the . stables - Desert Blossom, Artigiano and Restraint of Trade - have also . been banned from the classics. The . gravity of the situation was reflected in a statement from Godolphin . racing manager Simon Crisford yesterday. He said: ‘This is a dark day for Godolphin. We are all shocked by what has happened. ‘His Highness Sheik Mohammed was absolutely appalled when he was told . and this is completely unacceptable to him. We will await the outcome of . the BHA inquiry before taking any further internal action. ‘Sheik Mohammed has instructed me to begin an urgent review of all of . our procedures and controls. That is already underway and we will take . advice from the BHA in completing it.’ Al Zarooni is one of two British-based . trainers responsible for the horses of powerful owners Godolphin, the . brainchild of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed. The trainer apologised yesterday - but said he did not realise what he was doing was wrong. Racing scandal: The future of Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, pictured left, is now in doubt after the discovery of drugs at the stable owned by Dubai ruling Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum . ‘I deeply regret what has happened,' he said. 'I have made a . catastrophic error. Because the horses involved were not racing at the . time, I did not realise that what I was doing was in breach of the rules . of racing. ‘I can only apologise for the damage this will cause to Godolphin and to racing generally.’ Speaking to BBC Radio 5 . Live, David Mountford, chief executive of the British Equine Veterinary . Association, said: 'The rules are fairly clear, and I think most . trainers would be aware of those rules. The use of anabolic steroids in . training is banned in UK racing. 'It's . obviously being taken very seriously by all concerned. And I would . expect if, as looks likely, people are found guilty of breaching the . rules, they would be treated severely.' None of the Al Zarooni horses to test positive can currently run.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott and Sean O'hare . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 12 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:45 EST, 12 February 2013 . An Australian man committed suicide in a high-security Israeli jail in 2010 after being held for months in great secrecy, Australia's ABC channel said on Tuesday, throwing new light on a case that has rattled Israel. The unsourced ABC story named the man, known previously only as 'prisoner x', as Ben Zygier. It added that it ""understood"" the 34-year-old from Melbourne had been previously recruited by the Israeli spy agency Mossad. There was no official comment on the story in Israel. ABC claims 'Prisoner X', who is thought to have taken his own life in Ayalon prison in 2010, was Australian citizen Ben Zygier . Ben Zygier was secretly imprisoned in Israel's Ayalon prison in Ramla in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin, ABC reported . However, within hours of the report surfacing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office summoned Israeli editors to ask them not to publish a story 'that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency', Israel's Haaretz newspaper said. 'The emergency meeting was called following a broadcast outside Israel regarding the incident in question,"" Haaretz said, giving no further information. Shortly afterwards, all reference to the Australian report vanished from Israeli news sites - including Haaretz itself. Meretz party leader Zahava Gal-On, responding to the move, said: 'The phenomenon of journalists volunteering to censor information at the request of the authorities is patently undemocratic. 'I had hoped that this would have ended decades ago. In a democracy, censorship is justified only out of security considerations, subject to the High Court, which ensures that it is justified and that there truly is immediate certainty of harming [national] security.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office asked Israeli editor's not to publish a story 'that is very embarrassing to a certain government agency' Such a gag order is highly unusual in Israel, where state military censors normally allow local media to quote foreign sources on controversial incidents - such as an alleged attack on Syria last month by the Israeli airforce. Ben Zygier, who used the name Ben Alon or Ben Allen after moving to Israel, was secretly imprisoned in Ayalon prison in Ramla in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin, ABC reported. The 34-year-old was reported to be the son of Geoffrey Zygier, the executive director of the Victoria Jewish Community Council and one of the leaders of the Melbourne Jewish Community. Ben Zygier was married to an Israeli woman and had two young children. He gave his occupation as lawyer but secretly worked as a Mossad agent. He had reportedly spent a number of months in the Prisoner X cell before he was found hanged. Exactly what he did to end up in prison remains unclear. ABC reported that the man attended Jewish schools in Melbourne's south east before studying law. His parents refused to be involved in the investigation. ABC said that Zygier's imprisonment was so secret that not even his guards knew his name. However, word got out at the time of a mysterious prisoner and human rights groups wrote to the state to demand more information. 'It is insupportable that, in a democratic country, authorities can arrest people in complete secrecy and disappear them from public view without the public even knowing such an arrest took place,' the Association for Civil Rights in Israel wrote in June 2010. When Israel's Ynet website announced Prisoner X had been found dead inside a cell that was regularly watched and supposedly suicide-proof, the story was quickly removed because of a gag order. ABC said Zygier had moved to Israel 10 years before his death and changed his name to Ben Alon. It gave no reason for his imprisonment, speculating only that it would have had to concern espionage and sensitive state secrets. Funeral notices from Australia show that Zygier's body was flown back to Melbourne at the end of December 2010 for burial.","Prisoner locked up in Israeli 'jail within a jail' thought to have been Australian .

A 91-year-old World War 2 vet is fighting to prevent his own daughter from evicting him from his home in Zaleski, Ohio. When John Potter was battling serious illness in 2004 he handed his general power of attorney rights to his daughter Janice Cottrill. Unbeknownst to Potter, she used that power to convey the deed to the one-story home he built 56 years ago to herself. World War 2 vet John Potter, 91, is battling to prevent his own daughter evicting him from his home in Zaleski, Ohio . Potter built his one-story home himself some 56 years ago . When Potter learned of the deed transfer in 2010 he switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, now 35. She hasn’t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home. Potter has already attempted to sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the deed to herself illegally. He initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Potter. Jaclyn Fraley, 35, hasn¿t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to place her grandfather in a nursing home . Early this year Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his 'existing lease' Early this year, Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his ‘existing lease.’ Fraley said her grandfather and her mom argued over visitation rights for Potter's autistic son Joe, who Cottrill took over custody for in 2008. ‘I laid awake at night trying to figure out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so angry at me,’ he told WCMH. With an eviction hearing due to take place on June 12, time is running out for the aging vet who fought against the Japanese in the Pacific and also worked as a train dispatcher for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. Potter turns 92 later this month and his grand-daughter says she would love to be able to give him back the rights to his home for his birthday . In a bid to try and raise the money to buy Potter his home back, granddaughter Fraley has launched a campaign on GoFundMe.com, the crowd-fundraising site. She has set a goal of raising $125,000 and so far just over $40,000 has been raised in 29 days. 'John Potter just wants to live what remaining life he has left in the home he built with his wife, in which he raised his family, and has lived for the last 56 years,' Fraley wrote on the site. Potter turns 92 on May 23, and Fraley said she homes she can give his home to him for his birthday so he can stay there for the rest of his life.

A brutal murderer freed early from prison to kill a second time was today put back behind bars - and a judge told him: ‘You will never be released again.’ David Cook, 65, was jailed for life in 1987 for strangling a woman Sunday school teacher with a dressing gown cord in a robbery. But he was released after 21 years of his life sentence to move to a village 100 miles away - only to kill again. Double killer David Cook: He will now never be released from prison . Cook strangled neighbour Leonard Hill, 64, by using a TV flex in his own home during another robbery in a desperate search for cash. A court heard the violent death of Mr Hill had a ‘chilling similarity’ to his strangulation of teacher Beryl Maynard in 1987. And yesterday Cook was jailed for a second life term with and told there is no chance of ever getting freed again. Judge John Griffith Williams QC told him: ‘This is the second murder you have committed. ‘The seriousness of this offence is extremely high and I have to impose on you a whole life order. You will never be considered for release.’ Evil Cook killed Good Samaritan Mrs Maynard after she befriended him while he was in prison. But he robbed and killed her at her home. And then more than 20 years later, he befriended new neighbour Mr Hill - before robbing and killing him in a similar way. The judge told him: ‘You are a pathological liar who will tell any lie to further your self-interest. ‘You lied after murdering Beryl Maynard and you lied after murdering Leonard Hill. ‘Leonard was an anxious and shy man. He described you as a good man just like Beryl Maynard who befriended you while you were in prison. ‘You murdered her for small gain and you took the same advantage of Leonard Hill when you needed money. ‘Leonard Hill was particularly vulnerable and you knew he could not stand up to you. You invited him into your bungalow where you killed him for gain. Victim Leonard Hill was described in court as 'anxious and shy' ‘This was carried out in a chillingly deliberate way. He rendered him unconscious, trussed him up and strangled him.’ Cook has previous convictions for robbery in the 1980s when he tied up his victims using tape, wire and cords. He befriended Good Samaritan Mrs Maynard, 37, while in jail for the series of robberies. He replied to an advert for prison penpals in a Christian magazine while in jail. On his release Mrs Maynard invited him to her home in Reading, Berkshire, for dinner. But months later he forced his way into her house and strangled her to death before stealing her money. He was jailed for life in 1988 for her murder - but released back into the community in 2009 on ‘life licence’ under the probation service. Cook moved to Rhymney, South Wales, where he was befriended by next-door neighbour Mr Hill. But he then allegedly murdered Mr Hill in a robbery after running up £5,800 of debt. Cook ransacked his neighbour’s bungalow before hiding his body in his own home. He then went to the village pub to buy drinks with money stolen from Mr Hill. Prosecutor David Aubrey QC said: ‘This was a brutal, determined and merciless killing. ‘When he killed Leonard Hill he had been released from prison on life licence, having been convicted of the murder of a woman in Reading in 1988. ‘He beat Leonard Hill unconscious or semi-conscious, he then bound and gagged him using a pillow case and then throttled him until he was dead.’ The court heard how he later rang his support officer Nicholas Hopkins 12 days later to say: ‘Hi Nick, it’s David here. ‘Could you give me a ring because I have done something terrible? I have killed my neighbour.’ Cook admits killing Mr Hill but denies murder. He claims he lost control and killed Mr Hill after he made a sexual pass at him by touching his genitals. But police inquiries into Mr Hill’s background showed no history of him being gay. They found numerous newspaper cuttings of topless models and 170 magazines containing pictures of naked women. Mr Aubrey added: ‘Cook has a history of lying, fabrication, and deceiving others to get his own way and to cover up what he has done. ‘The suggestion that Leonard Hill had touched him was a cynical and deliberate lie to seek to excuse what Cook had done.’ A jury found Cook guilty of murder yesterday after retiring for just an hour. Claire Burton, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, said later: ‘David Cook has been convicted of a most horrific and violent murder. ‘Leonard Hill was a quiet, non-confrontational and unassuming man who posed no threat to anyone - least of all David Cook. ‘His murder was the calculated act of a callous and brutal attacker. ‘I would like to pay tribute to the excellent investigation work carried out by Gwent Police on this case. ‘Their thorough approach enabled us to build an extremely strong prosecution case against David Cook, leading to today’s conviction. ‘Whilst we welcome the fact that David Cook has been brought to justice, we should not forget that the family and those close to Leonard Hill, as well as all those affected by the actions of David Cook, will have to live with the consequences for years to come.’ The grieving family called for a full investigation into how Cook was handled by the probation service after being released. Mr Hill’s sister-in-law Carol Hill said she was ‘disgusted’ at how Cook was moved next to Mr Hill and said : ‘I need lots of answers.’ Mrs Hill, who lives in Spain, said: ‘He should never have been put there.’ ‘It seems Cook only had one way of dealing with any kind of problem and that was with violence. ‘There’s an inquiry going on now and it’s the probation service I desperately need them to look into. ‘I feel they are utterly responsible and they know that.’ She added: ‘The failings lie with, firstly, whoever did the risk assessment when Cook was let out of prison, because in 2008 when he escaped from an open prison he was deemed to be dangerous. ‘I need to know whether the probation services knew he had all this debt. I need lots of answers.’ Wales Probation Trust, which has ordered a serious case review, offered its ‘deepest sympathies’ to the family. A statement added: ‘The review will look at how all the agencies in this case have worked together and will seek to identify whether there is any learning for the agencies individually or collectively in managing high-risk offenders. ‘It would be inappropriate for us to comment further until the review is completed in order not to prejudice the outcome.’","David Cook, 65, was jailed in 1987 for strangling a woman Sunday school teacher .

"By . Jill Reilly . UPDATED: . 09:00 EST, 1 February 2012 . Prince William has been branded a 'conqueror' by Argentina ahead of his deployment to the Falkland Islands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot. The comment came with tensions running high over the disputed islands, which Buenos Aires calls Las Malvinas. Yesterday the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that one of the Royal Navy’s most advanced new warships is being sent to the area. Strong words: Prince William has been branded a 'conqueror' by Argentina ahead of his deployment to the Falkland Islands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot . Britain is sending the £1billion Type 45 . destroyer Dauntless on a seven-month deployment to the South Atlantic . while Buenos Aires ratchets up pressure over sovereignty of  the . islands. The vessel, which bristles with fearsome anti-aircraft weapons, will . patrol the coastline during celebrations to mark the liberation of the . islands 30 years ago. However, the MoD stressed that the March mission was routine and a Royal Navy spokesman rejected suggestions the decision to send the ultra-modern destroyer to the region represented an escalation of the UK’s position. 'The Royal Navy has had a continuous presence in the South Atlantic for many years. The deployment of HMS Dauntless to the South Atlantic has been long planned, is entirely routine and replaces another ship on patrol,' he said. Heightened tensions: Argentine president Cristina Fernandez and David Cameron have recently engaged in a diplomatic war of words over the sovereignty of the islands . Tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen. Following Argentina's remarks, General Sir David Richards the Chief of the Defence Staff denied that sending the Duke to the Falkland Islands was designed to provoke the country . In December, the Mercosur grouping of countries, which includes Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, announced that it would ban ships sailing under the Falkland Islands flag from docking at their ports. David Cameron and Argentine president Cristina Fernandez have previously accused each other of 'colonial' behaviour. Referring to the deployment of HMS Dauntless and William’s tour of duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot, Argentina’s Foreign Ministry last night said it 'rejected the British attempt to militarise (the) conflict.' It also expressed regret that an heir to the throne would arrive wearing 'the uniform of a conqueror.' 'Governments should avoid the temptation of falling into a discourse ... that aims to distract public attention from belt-tightening economic policies,' the ministry said in a statement. Argentine official Sebastian Brugo Marco last year said the country could not ignore the 'political' implications of William’s deployment. 'It is one more provocative act that shows Britain’s military presence in a zone of peace where there is no armed conflict,' he said. Following his remarks, the Chief of the .

General Sir David Richards dismissed the claims, saying: 'I can absolutely tell you it wasn’t and isn’t designed to be.' Prince William, a Flight Lieutenant with the RAF, will deploy to the remote outcrop in the South Atlantic for six weeks to fly search and rescue helicopter missions. Gen Richards stressed the Duke of Cambridge's deployment was routine for an RAF Sea King pilot, pointing out Prince Harry was sent to Afghanistan as a forward air controller in 2008. It has also emerged that UK foreign minister Jeremy Browne will be visiting the islands in June to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the war. Mr Browne yesterday told the Commons the Government had resisted Tory calls for the Falkland Islanders’ right to self-determination to be written into a new UK law. He insisted legislation was unnecessary as he stressed the islanders’ ability to decide their own future was 'non-negotiable.' Tory MP Guy Opperman had called for the islanders’ right to determine their own future to be enshrined in UK law.

A diabetic schoolgirl's trip to Spain has been ruined after she was told days before the journey that she can't go abroad with her classmates - because her school aren't insured to help with her condition. Lucy Harrison, 12, was due to join her classmates from Forge Valley Community School in Sheffield on a five-day break to Granada in southern Spain next week, in a trip that her parents had paid for last year. But this week, just nine days before the holiday, Lucy's parents say they were told by the school that she could not go after all because the school did not have the right insurance and staff were not allowed to administer medication if the girl fell ill. Going nowhere: Lucy Harrison, 12, left, and right with father Stephen, 40, and the insulin pump she relies on . Lucy's father Stephen Harrison, 40, of Sheffield, said: 'I don't think it is acceptable - it is so unfair. 'All her mates are going and Lucy said ""Why can't I when everybody else can?"" 'I had to tell her it was because of her diabetes. This is discrimination. 'Isn't it hard enough having to deal with diabetes and then be singled out saying she can't go as though she is different to other children? 'The staff member said the school wasn't insured and also they can't touch Lucy if she has a hypoglycemic attack. All they can do is give her painkillers and a plaster. 'The risk assessment for this should have been done months ago, not nine days before the flight.' Lucy was due to fly to Granada in southern Spain, famous for the Moorish Alhambra palace . Lucy, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of five, takes regular insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Forge Valley Community College offered to refund the family or cover half the cost of one parent travelling with Lucy, but Mr Harrison, a former professional snooker player who now coaches children in the sport, said he could not have taken the time off work to accompany Lucy at such short notice. He said the family was encouraging Lucy to cope with her condition, but said the school should do more to help with such a common condition. 'Lucy is just getting to grips with her diabetes. We want her to be able to manage it independently,' he said. 'She can't be the only person in school with diabetes. The school should have a policy in place.' No-one at Forge Valley Community School was available for comment today.","Lucy Harrison, 12, was due to join classmates flying to Granada next week .

A rock band that split in 1965 has reformed almost 50 years later - after discovering one of the members wasn't dead after all. The Hustlers lost touch after breaking up in 1965 and even wrongly thought that one of the members had died. But the group, now thought to be the country's oldest rock and roll band with all its original members, is back and playing gigs. Then: The Hustlers, pictured in 1963, lost touch after breaking up in 1965 and even wrongly thought that one of the members had died . Now: The group are now back and playing gigs together almost 50 years after they split up . The group formed in Brighton in 1960 and played at youth clubs around Sussex but split five years later as several members were getting married. The band includes lead singer Tony Burchell, 72, lead guitarist Barry Gillam, 73, bassist Richard Pearce, 69, Pete Dresch, 70, and drummer Ken White, 67. Over the years the friends lost touch and when lead singer Mr Burchell celebrated his 50th birthday he tried to contact the others on a radio station in Brighton. A caller phoned in and claimed that drummer Ken had passed away. However, 22 years later, the band members found each other on a 1960s Brighton bands' website only to realise that Mr White was very much alive and well. Bassist Mr Pearce, an upholsterer from Netley, Hampshire, was delighted when the group got back together.

The group played its first gig back together at the Ye John Selden pub in Worthing and is playing a variety of venues along the south coast.

Rock 'n' roll: Bassist Richard Pearce and drummer Ken White are two of the original members of the band, which first formed in 1960 . 'We enjoy ourselves and hope the audience does too.' The band performs covers of classic rock and roll hits of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as songs by Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Cliff Richard.

The last of the Dambusters has spoken for the first time how he celebrated the squadron's heroic raid - with a nice cup of tea. Almost 70 years after the night-time bombing attacks, Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, 91, told of the daring raid over occupied territory that dealt a decisive blow that crippled the Nazi war effort. George was festooned with a raft of medals including a Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in 617 Squadron's daring 1943 blitz on the Nazi-controlled dams along the Ruhr Valley in Germany, destroying their hydro-electric source of power. The last Dambuster: Squadron Leader Johnny Johnson, 91, at home in Bristol with his many medals . The Dambusters: (L-R) Johnny Johnson, Donald McClean, Navigator, Dave Batson, Front gunner, Joe McCarthy, Skipper, Bill Radcliffe, Flight Engineer and Len Eaton Wireless Operator . Widower George, who lives in Bristol, was a sergeant at the time of the raids, conducted under the name Operation Chastise, which smashed the Mohne, Sorpe and Eder dams. He said: 'We were about half an hour late because our plane had a hydraulic leak and we had to swap. 'We took off at 22.01, and flew in over Sorpe dam in brilliant moonlight. We had to get the aim right - we went in six or seven times and I'd shout 'Dummy Run'. Married bliss: Johnny Johnson with his wife Gwyneth on their wedding day 3rd April 1943 . 'It was a totally different dam from the other dams. It was impossible to fly low over, so it had to be a drop, not a spinning bomb.' Piloted by Joe McCarthy, the plane nicknamed 'T for Tommy' was one of five planes that made it to the dam, which was the most difficult of the three targets to crack. It took bombardier George and his crew nine attempts to fly at a perilous 30ft, before the bomb, codenamed Upkeep, was finally loosed, seconds before they had to pull up to avoid smashing into the hillside behind the dam. He said: 'I could see where to drop and shouted 'Bomb Gone' to cheers of 'Thank Christ' from the crew who were yelling for me to get the bomb out. 'At 00.46 on May 17 we dropped our bomb with 8,500lb of explosives.' George added: 'There was a spout of water 1,000ft high. We circled and the dam crumbled about 10yards wide. 'But it didn't seem as if the other five aircraft had been there. We needed six bombs to crack the dam and the water would do the rest.' After smashing the dam, the heroic airmen flew their Lancaster bomber over the Mohne Dam, which has been blown by another plane in the same daring raid. The Sorpe dam was badly damaged by the daring night-time raid, orchestrated by wing commander Guy Gibson and bouncing bomb inventor Barnes Wallace. George said: 'I will never forget the sight. It was like an inland sea with all that water overflowing. 'It gave us a lot of satisfaction when we heard over the radio that the Eder had been breached as well.' The whole crew: All of the Dambuster raid crews, Johnny Johnson is top 2nd from left . Hero: Johnny describes the difficulties he experienced that day and the effect the loss of his friends had . It was only when they flew back to RAF Scrapton in Lincolnshire that the brave crew realised they had been hit several times by an armoured train on their way to the dams, and the pilot's chair was pockmarked with bullet holes. He said: 'I was tired and exhausted - I went to the mess and had bacon and powdered scrambled egg and a cup of tea. It tasted good.' The five-hour raid came at a heavy price - 53 of the 133 brave airmen, hand-picked for the secret mission, did not come home. George said: 'The waitresses in the sergeants' mess were all in tears as so many places were empty.' The . brave airman married sweetheart Gwyn, a phone operator in the Women's .

He said: 'I feel honoured and proud to have been lucky enough to take part in that raid. 'It proved to Hitler and the Germans what they thought was impregnable could be destroyed by the RAF.'","George 'Johnny' Johnson was a sergeant during the raid .

Ed Miliband has been named as one of the most influential Jewish people in the world, despite continuing difficulties in the opinion polls.

Mr Jordine told PC Porter: 'There's no need to be cheeky officer, I pay your wages.' The officer claimed Anthony Jordine had pushed him into a shop window, causing it to break in Brick Lane, east London (pictured) PC Porter then radioed Cooke and another officer, PC Bob Golding, who were in a nearby bagel shop, asking for assistance. 'It appears he turns his back on the group he has been dealing with. He steps back into his own vehicle.' Cooke and PC Golding chased Mr Jordine down Brick Lane into Bethnal Green Road and later Chiltern Street, said Mr Connolly. 'He is then taken hold of. He will say he was assaulted.' Mr Jordine was taken to the police station and arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and criminal damage, jurors heard. The two allegations were further investigated . In his statement, Cooke claimed Mr Jordine told him 'f*** you' and ran off, adding: 'I lunged for him and caught hold of his wrist. 'The subject twisted out of my grip and pushed me off balance, causing me to fall and slam into a door window.' Mr Connolly added: 'He described these events in a way that the prosecution say isn't how it happened, in order to falsely cause Mr Jordine to be arrested as a suspected criminal. 'Mr Jordine was interviewed and once the CCTV was seen, the view was taken, sensibly you may think, that there wasn't an allegation properly made against him. 'He was put on police bail which was cancelled. 'As a result of seeing that Mr Jordine didn't, on the face of it, assault the officer, the investigation was diverted to the police officer himself.' Cooke claimed the incident happened in a 'split second' with what he feared was an 'unknown threat'. He described the push as a 'misunderstanding of words', saying that wasn't what he really meant'. Whatever contact there was had been brief, Cooke claimed, insisting his account was truthful, honest and reliable. 'Is there just air between these two men, and if there was, could Mr Cooke honestly have had the view that he had been assaulted by Mr Jordine, that he caused him to go into that window?' Mr Connolly added. 'Or is it that he decided to make up a false story flowing the events, because that is the prosecution case. 'This is not a mistake or misunderstanding, he made a conscious choice to fabricate an account of what happened.' Wearing a pinstriped suit, a white shirt and a purple tie, Cooke spoke only to confirm his identity. Cooke, from Colchester, Essex, denies doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of justice. The trial continues.

Britain and France have finally found something they agree on – that the French are the most arrogant people in Europe. That’s the verdict of a sweeping new US survey about the attitudes of European countries towards each other. Not surprisingly, many national stereotypes are reinforced in the poll. Britons not only find their neighbours across the channel the most arrogant, they also believe them to be the least trustworthy. In true contradictory fashion, the French vote themselves both the most arrogant and the least arrogant country in Europe. The Germans are almost universally judged the most trustworthy, although eyebrows may be raised at the only dissenter, Greece, which saves that accolade for itself despite its financial meltdown. Britain, along with Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic and Poland, sees Germany as being the least compassionate. The UK is seen in that less flattering light by the French and the Germans. Self-congratulation is common in the survey conducted among more than 7,600 people in eight European countries by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre. In fact, people of every nationality . consider themselves to be the most compassionate people in Europe. The . British also consider themselves the least arrogant. Notably, . the Italians vote themselves as the least trustworthy people, but the . most compassionate, which is exactly the opposite of the way they view . the Germans. Cheers to that! The Germans are almost universally judged the most trustworthy . David Cameron didn’t exactly come out of the poll smelling of roses, scoring a 37 per cent approval rating among the British public. But he can take some comfort from the fact that he was second only to Germany’s Angela Merkel in the chart showing how European nations rated their own leaders. As well as a 64 per cent positive rating . in her own country, the German Chancellor also earned a 73 per cent in . France and 58 per cent in Britain for her handling of the EU financial . crisis. Not surprisingly, the Greeks gave her just 10 per cent. David Cameron scored a lowly 37 per cent approval rating among the British public . And while the British public may have its qualms about the prime minister,  50 per cent in France think he’s doing a decent job and 58 per cent of Poles are impressed. However, according to Pew, beyond that, Mr. Cameron’s support is weak: Just 25 per cent of the Germans and 17 per cent of the Greeks give him a good grade. And in some countries, the prime minister’s marks have declined since 2012: by 14 points in his own country and by 9 points in France. French President Francois Hollande fares even worse. Just 33 per cent of his own people and 30 per cent of the British and the Greeks say he is doing a good job. Based on research in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic, the US research centre concludes that the EU is ‘the new sick man of Europe.’ The proportion of Europeans with a favourable view of the EU has plunged from 60 per cent last year to 45 per cent now, says the poll. While the UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic country, but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months, slipping only two points to 43 per cent. Britons quizzed in the poll are split evenly at 46 per cent on whether to pull out or stay in the EU. By contrast, France’s backing for the union has plunged in 12 months from 60 per cent to 41 per cent. ‘The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else,’ said the report. ‘The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe,’ it adds.","Britons believes themselves to be least arrogant in survey .

An £8million cinema and leisure complex residents of a market town campaigned to get built is to be completely dismantled six months into the project because it is less than a metre out of place. The new Cineworld Cinema in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, will be torn down and rebuilt after an embarrassing design error left it too close to existing houses. Work on the six-screen cinema, known as the Rowley Arts Centre, began at the end of November - six years after residents voted for the leisure facility. Coming down: Six months after work started the £8million cinema complex being built in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, it is being torn down because it is in the wrong place . Starting again: This artist's impression shows what the new site will look like, and local people have campaigned for years to get it built . It was due to open in September but this decision, which has been agreed with the Developer Turnstone Estates, will delay completion by four months until next January. Construction work had already been delayed whilst the contractor Britannia and developers waited for today's decision. Turnstone had submitted a revised planning application after it came to light that parts of the buildings were being positioned marginally closer to the site's north wall than was planned. But the application will now be withdrawn and the project rebuilt to accord with the consented scheme. 'We have taken the unprecedented step of halting the existing work and having parts rebuilt to assuage any concerns that adjoining landowners may have,' Chris Goldsmith, of Turnstone, said. 'Although we are only talking about a few centimetres we believe that this is the best solution for all concerned and avoid further delay of these much wanted facilities. 'All involved have acted in a thoroughly open and professional way, for which I am very grateful.' Blunder: The project has been built out of place and is too close to these houses, so is therefore being constructed without planning consent . Steve Wiener, of Cineworld, said: 'This is unfortunate news but the good news is that we are still on track to opening our cinema in St Neots, albeit now early in the new year.' Paul Halfpenny, of Britannia Construction, added: 'This situation results from an error in design information provided to us by our lead design consultant. 'This inaccuracy, which was present from the earliest stages of the scheme, sadly wasn't picked up by any members of the client, design or construction teams. 'As soon as the miscalculation was identified we have dealt quickly and efficiently to ensure that our client's instructions are fully complied with, along with our contractual obligations to discharge in accordance with the planning consent.' Delay: Pulling down the structure, which was started last year, will now not be completed until 2014 . Residents and town councillors in St Neots have been campaigning for around 10 years. In 2006 Peter Rowley, a US-based millionaire with links to the town, donated about £1 million for a leisure facility in St Neots. Residents were consulted and in 2007 said they favoured a cinema. The development, which is being built on the site of a former recycling centre, will consist of a six-screen cinema, four restaurants, three flats, a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes.","Builders started on site six months ago but were putting it too near houses .

Body-mounted cameras could help police on the beat to convict more criminals, Theresa May said yesterday. The widespread use of small recording devices pinned to officers’ lapels would encourage more guilty pleas once offenders are confronted with footage of their actions, the Home Secretary said. They also ensure that time-consuming ‘vexatious’ complaints by known yobs against officers are promptly dismissed, she added. The Home Secretary said body-mounted cameras would help police convict more criminals. Pictured, Metropolitan Police officers with cameras attached to their hats . Thousands of police are already routinely using the devices, but Mrs May endorsed their roll-out across every force in England and Wales. Her comments were welcomed by rank-and-file police groups, who said cameras helped convict drunken yobs who denied violent or abusive behaviour when hauled to court. However, privacy groups said the cameras could undermine trust between the police and the public and branded them an ‘underhand surveillance tactic’. Emma Carr, deputy director of  privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The use of body-worn cameras has the potential to seriously undermine trust between the police and members of the community. ‘It is far from clear why the police need this kind of equipment, and  the police should concentrate their efforts on engaging with the local community to tackle the issues of anti-social behaviour rather than resorting to underhand surveillance tactics.’ Lightweight lapel cameras can record several hours of footage and sound and be switched on and off by officers when needed. The lightweight cameras are already used by five police forces in the UK . Home Secretary Theresa May said cameras can increase the number of guilty pleas . Five English forces – Hampshire, . Northamptonshire, Sussex, Thames Valley and Avon and Somerset – are . already using them. They are also used in Scotland. Mrs May told the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth: ‘Evidence from Scotland suggests that evidence from body-worn cameras can increase the number of early guilty pleas to the extent that 90 per cent of suspects confronted by that evidence plead guilty early. ‘They can also help by eliminating vexatious complaints from known troublemakers – something I know causes a lot of unnecessary stress and wastes too much time.’ Steve White, deputy chairman of the Police Federation, said cameras were useful when dealing with drunken yobs who then arrived at court ‘suited and booted’ and disputed officers’ accounts. ‘The cameras provide best evidence for police officers and make clear to the court what actually happened,’ he said. In her speech, Mrs May also condemned police officers who bring ‘frivolous’ legal claims against the public and warned that the fear of being sued could make citizens reluctant to dial 999. It is ‘simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit’ she said – a reference to the case of Norfolk PC Kelly Jones who planned to sue a garage owner after tripping on a kerb while responding to a 999 call. Mrs May also confirmed plans to prevent officers resigning to avoid disciplinary measures and agreed to publish the names of those who have been dismissed for misconduct. Claims that police were downgrading offences were dismissed – with the national crime survey used as evidence that crime is now at an all-time low. And proposals to give whole-life jail terms to cop killers were met with applause. ‘To attack and kill a police officer is to attack the fundamental basis of our society,’ she said.","Offenders more likely to admit their actions if recorded, Theresa May said .

As many as 60 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have vowed not to go to a festival this year because of a hike in ticket prices. The average festival-goer is now in their mid-30s as younger audiences have been priced out of the market, meaning they cannot attend festivals like Glastonbury (pictured) To attend a festival in the UK, music fans must now expect to pay £423.01 on average for tickets, transport, food and drink and camping gear. And research revealed fans attending Scotland's T in the Park festival are the oldest at 37 years seven months old on average. Those attending Glastonbury are the second oldest music fans at 36 years eight months, followed by the Isle of Wight at 36 years one month old. The findings of the study, by publishing brand MSN, suggest that it is those with more disposable incomes who are able to go to festivals. Younger music fans, like these at Glastonbury festival, claims that the soaring costs for a ticket means that they can no longer afford to see their favourite bands . The price of a Glastonbury ticket has almost doubled in the last decade, from £105 in 2003 to £205 this year. What's more, there has been an increasing trend towards older and more established headline acts. Nearly half of festival goers (43 per cent) say they are most excited to see acts that have been around for at least a decade. Interestingly, of the headlining acts at 2013 UK festivals, only Mumford & Sons released their debut album within the last five years. Of the older acts due to headline this year, Eminem is at Reading and Leeds, Rolling Stones are at Glastonbury, and the Stone Roses at Isle of Wight.

The average age of the musicians in the 10 most anticipated headliners in 2013 is 39 years eight months. The research, which involved 2,000 UK adults, revealed a breakdown of the costs a festival entails. On average, a festival-goer will spend just over £100 on their ticket, £80 on food and drink and £70 on camping gear. Meanwhile, to get to and from a music event a fan will tend to fork out £60. Of those fans who aren't attending a festival this year, 55 per cent say they will take a foreign holiday or go to an international music festival instead. But, one in ten Brits are not fazed by the price increase and would even be prepared to spend £800 on attending a festival. Graduate student Kirsty Archer, 21, from London, said: 'My friends and I were thinking of going to the Latitude festival in Suffolk this summer.

'I've worked out even with flights, accommodation and spending money, I'll still get change from the price of the ticket alone.' James Hurley, MSN music editor, said: 'Festivals have always been seen as a key part of youth culture, but the study shows this is no longer the case. 'Not only are people in their 30s now dominating the UK's main festivals, the majority of headlining artists are long-established veterans. 'With a UK festival costing an average of £423.01, it's hardly surprising to see younger music fans are finding themselves priced out.'","Music fans must now expect to pay £423.01 on average for tickets, transport, food and drink and camping gear .

She said: ‘Companies like Amazon should pay their fair share of tax . based on their economic activity in this country and the profits they . make here. ‘Its behaviour is not only unfair, it . is anti-competitive, putting British businesses that do pay their proper . tax at a disadvantage.’ Tax avoidance campaign group UK Uncut said: 'It's an absolute disgrace that Amazon is paying such tiny amounts in tax. 'The Government should be clamping down on tax avoidance rather than slashing the welfare state, privatising the NHS and cutting legal aid for ordinary people. 'This shows us yet again that the Government is making a political choice rather than an economic necessity.' Amazon sells one in four books bought in the UK and has been accused of 'laying waste to the high street' Amazon, which sells one in every four . books bought in Britain as well as a huge range of other goods, has . previously been accused of ‘laying waste to the high street’. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, called the figures a 'joke' Last year, Amazon sparked outrage when . it emerged that it, and other multinational corporations such as Google . and Starbucks, avoided millions in UK taxes. In 2011 Amazon paid just £1.8million . despite raking in sales of £3.4billion in the UK – a figure it tried to . keep secret until MPs demanded it reveal the information. The Public . Accounts Committee called all three firms ‘immoral’ for leaving . taxpayers to pick up the bill while they made vast profits. Amazon’s UK sales in 2012 rose by . almost 30 per cent to £4.2billion, but at the same time it received . £2.5million in grants, its accounts show. Part of this money came from Scottish Enterprise because of Amazon’s warehouse in Dunfermline in Fife. Around £1.5million came from an EU grant to build a road to its Swansea warehouse. A petition by local booksellers and . with 166,000 signatures calling on the Government to ‘stop Amazon’s tax . dodge’ was handed in to Downing Street last month. Frances Smith, who runs two . independent Kenilworth Books shops near Warwick and was one of the . organisers of the petition, said: ‘It’s just not fair, they are playing . by their own rules.’ A spokesman for Amazon said: ‘Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within. ‘Like many companies, Amazon has received assistance in relation to major investments in the UK.’","Margaret Hodge, chair of Public Accounts Committee, said figures a ‘joke’

Admission: Star jockey Frankie Dettori has confirmed he took cocaine, just as his six-month racing ban came to an end . Shamed star jockey Frankie Dettori today admitted for the first time he took cocaine, just days before he returns from a six-month racing ban. In his first television interview since his 'one night of madness' last year, the 42-year-old Italian said he was 'ashamed and embarrassed' he was caught taking the Class A drug. He was banned from horse racing after cocaine was detected in his system at Longchamp racecourse, in Paris, on September 16 last year. Authorities have now cleared him to start again on Monday, at Leicester, with the first race on the card called the Welcome Back Frankie Maiden Stakes. 'I’m very ashamed and embarrassed, and . paid a very big price for it, you know. I spent six months not doing the . thing that I love, racing,' he told Channel 4 News. 'Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness . and I fell for it and I’ve only got myself to blame. I can’t blame . anybody else. 'The embarrassment of when it come out, I had to hide in my house for a . week. The paparazzi outside. The embarrassment of telling the children, . you know.

During an interview to be broadcast tomorrow, he spoke about the impact on his private life and his future in racing.

Diversion: While he was banned, Frankie Dettori took part in Celebrity Big Brother, pictured alongside Rylan Clark and Claire Richards . He said he had only himself to blame for the six month ban, but claimed his misdemeanour was due to his fear of being pushed out of the spotlight. Popular: Frankie Dettori arrives with wife Catherine son Leo and daughter Ella for a film premiere at the height of his fame . He said: 'It got to the stage where I wasn't flavour of the month any more and the love was gone.' It was a huge blow to the household name sportsman who shot into the public imagination in 1996 with a ‘Magnificent Seven’ wins at Ascot. He frequently makes public appearances with his wife, Catherine, and their five children, who live near Newmarket, Suffolk. He was awarded the MBE in 2000 and in 2002 became a team captain on the BBC show A Question of Sport, but quit the following year when he was apparently stung by a question from a participant as to when he had retired from riding. Earlier in his career, in 1993, Dettori . was given a police caution after being caught with a small amount of . cocaine in his pocket in London. In . his autobiography he admitted that he become a ‘tearaway, a night-club . wolf, a drugs dabbler who was perilously close to seeing his career go . permanently off the rails’. In . a BBC Newsnight programme he also admitted taking diuretics, chocolate . laxatives and even Lasix, to keep his weight down, before the Jockey . Club outlawed them in 1998. Frankie Dettori was cleared to return to action on Monday, and the Italian was at the British Horse Racing Authority (BHA) in London yesterday when he completed the final round of tests and examinations imposed upon him by the sport's regulator.

Successful: Frankie Dettori receives his prize from The Queen after winning the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on Daylami at Ascot in July, 1999, one of many wins for the jockey . Dettori has been the subject of urine testing and 'non-notified' testing over the last four weeks. The shock test came shortly after it was announced his 18-year association with Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin operation was ending. Dettori, who has been riding for a clutch of trainers, is expected to come back at Leicester's evening meeting in five days time. Unbridled joy: Frankie celebrates his seven out of seven with a flying dismount from Fujiyama Crest . Frankie . Dettori will forever be etched in Turf legend for what he . achieved on an unforgettable afternoon at Ascot in 1996. On Queen Elizabeth II Stakes day, with the BBC cameras rolling, he went through the card with seven winners from seven rides - his 'Magnificent Seven'. It was a historic occasion within the sport, but it resonated in the big wide world, too, securing a special place in popular culture for the Italian jockey. The cumulative starting price odds for anyone who had the good fortune to back the winners - and plenty did - were 25,095-1, though 'early bird' prices suggest the true odds against it happening were 235,834-1. Dettori began by winning the Cumberland Lodge Stakes (Group Three) on Wall Street (2-1), and followed that when Diffident (12-1) scrambled home by two short heads in the Diadem Stakes (Group Two). Both horses were owned by his Godolphin paymasters, who also provided his mount in the day's feature Group One race, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Mark Of Esteem was sent off a 100-30 chance and put up a career-best performance in beating crack filly Bosra Sham by one and a quarter lengths. Bookmakers were getting twitchy by now, and Dettori did little for their heart-rate by landing an easy victory in the Tote Festival Handicap on John Gosden's 7-1 chance Decorated Hero. With the yankees already in the bag, Fatefully (7-4) won the next race, another handicap, by a neck in the Godolphin colours, and number six came up when the Ian Balding-trained juvenile Lochangel (5-4) led all the way for victory by three-quarters of a length in a conditions event.And so to the remarkable seventh race. As punters heaped money on Dettori's mount Fujiyama Crest, bookmakers slashed the odds - and prayed for it to be defeated. Dettori bounced him out of the stalls and was soon in front, playing catch-me-if-you-can, and as they turned into the final straight he was still there as the crowd's roars reached frenzied proportions. Pat Eddery delivered a fierce challenge on Northern Fleet, throwing everything into the finish, but Fujiyama Crest held on by a neck. Dettori returned to the winner's enclosure among delirious racegoers and shell-shocked bookmakers, while off-course the number crunchers were totting up losses to the industry of about £30million, with William Hill over £8m down and Ladbrokes even more. The day was immense for Dettori, both for his unique place in racing history and for his image outside it. Little wonder then that when the opportunity arose to acquire a special memento of the day, he took it - and bought Fujiyama Crest.","Former champion jockey took drug on 'night of madness' last year .

Campaign group UK Uncut Legal Action today lost its High Court challenge over the legality of the ‘sweetheart’ tax deal between HM Revenue and Customs and Goldman Sachs. A judge was told the 2010 deal, worth up to £20million, was allowed to proceed to avoid ‘major embarrassment’ to Chancellor George Osborne and the tax authorities after the bank became ‘aggressive’ and allegedly made threats. UK Uncut asked Mr Justice Nicol, sitting in London, to declare that HMRC's decision to let the deal go through was legally flawed and involved a breach of statutory duty. Defeat: Campaign group UK Uncut Legal Action today lost its High Court (pictured) challenge over the legality of the 'sweetheart' tax deal between HM Revenue and Customs and Goldman Sachs . The judge ruled the deal was ‘not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue’ but it was not unlawful. Tax authority lawyers defended the settlement, saying it was among five big business deals declared ‘reasonable’ by a 2012 report of the National Audit Office (NAO). UK Uncut says it is wrong to allow rich companies to avoid paying millions in tax while the Government imposes tough austerity measures on the poor and ordinary taxpayers are pursued for every penny. Murray Worthy, a director of UK Uncut Legal Action, said after today's hearing that he was disappointed with the ruling. Evidence: A judge was told the 2010 deal, worth up to £20million, was allowed to proceed to avoid 'major embarrassment' to Chancellor George Osborne (pictured yesterday) and the tax authorities . But he added: ‘This case has shown that the Government's tough talk on tax is just that - talk not substance.’ Defeat: Murray Worthy, the director of UK Uncut, outside the High Court in London today . Dave . Hartnett, then permanent secretary for tax, initially shook hands on . the Goldman Sachs deal on November 19 2010 following a long-running . dispute over National Insurance contribution payments dating back to the . 1990s. Lawyers for UK Uncut put before the . High Court in London an email and a witness statement they submitted . showed that Mr Hartnett overruled legal advice, the HMRC's own . guidelines and its internal review board to ensure the deal went ahead. Just . over a week after the handshake, the Revenue's high-risk corporate . management board attempted to block the deal, just as the Chancellor . announced that the top 15 banks in the country had signed up to a new . code of conduct related to tax. An email from Mr Hartnett on December 7 . 2010 described how Goldman Sachs allegedly ‘went off the deep end’ after the board decision and threatened to withdraw from the . Government's bank code of practice, first published in December 2009. The . email warned: ‘The risks here are major embarrassment to the ChX . (Chancellor of the Exchequer), HMRC, the LBS (the large business service . of the HMRC), you and me, not least if GS withdraw from the code.’ The . witness statement from Mr Hartnett, who retired as head of tax last . summer following strong criticism of the Goldman Sachs deal from the . public accounts committee, said the bank withdrawing from the code . ‘would have embarrassed the Chancellor’. Base: James Eadie QC, appearing for HMRC (whose London headquarters are pictured), accused UK Uncut of taking legal action 'to pursue politics by other means' Ingrid Simler QC, appearing for UK . Uncut, argued that the deal breached HMRC's statutory duties, and an . ‘aggressive’ bank had been ‘rewarded’ for several years of failing to . pay tax it owed, causing ‘real disquiet among the taxpaying public’. In his judgment, the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, said Dave Hartnetthad taken into account ‘the potential embarrassment to the Chancellor of the Exchequer if Goldman Sachs were to withdraw from the tax code’ when he decided to approve the Goldman Sachs settlement. The judge said: ‘HMRC accepts that was an irrelevant consideration and should not have featured in his decision-making process.’ But ‘maladministration and illegality’ were separate issues, said the judge, and the settlement itself was not unlawful. The judge listed other mistakes made by the Revenue as he observed: ‘The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue. ‘The HMRC officials who negotiated it had not been briefed by the lawyers who were litigating against Goldman Sachs. ‘They relied on their belief or recollection that there was a barrier to the recovery of interest on the unpaid National Insurance contributions (NICs). That was erroneous. ‘HMRC accepts now that there was no such barrier. The officials who negotiated the agreement overlooked the need for approval from the Programme Board in relation to an agreement over £100 million. ‘HMRC now accepts that they should have appreciated this. Because the officials did not have this requirement to mind, they said nothing about it to Goldman Sachs and created the impression that the agreement was a done deal by the end of the meeting on 19th November. ‘HMRC accepts that was an error. Furthermore, HMRC did not appear to have taken a contemporaneous note as to the agreement which was reached on 19th November. ‘That allowed a degree of uncertainty to prevail for a time as to what precisely had been agreed. ‘In the end that has been resolved but in the course of the hearing, HMRC accepted that it would have been a good idea for a contemporaneous record to have been kept.’ She . said the exact amount lost to the Revenue was not known but was at . least £5million to £10million, and the Commons Public Accounts Committee . had received evidence that it could be up to £20 million. James Eadie QC, appearing for HMRC, accused UK Uncut of taking legal action ‘to pursue politics by other means’. HMRC . said in a press statement: ‘Large business tax settlements are a vital . part of how HMRC secures tax revenues for the country and without them . Britain's public finances would be seriously damaged.’ Anna Walker, campaigns director of UK Uncut Legal Action, said: ‘Obviously, while we are deeply disappointed that this deal has not been declared unlawful, the judge's ruling that top HMRC officials played politics with major tax deals to protect (Mr) Osborne's reputation is a major victory in exposing the truth behind these secret deals. ‘Despite not having won the case today, we still feel that this judgment has demonstrated that the Government is making a political choice to cut legal aid, public services and the welfare system, rather than take action to make corporate giants... pay their fair share of tax. ‘This case has exposed the lengths the Government will go to to look tough on tax avoidance and has been vital in holding the Government to account for its shameful actions.’ Solicitor Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, which represented UK Uncut Legal Action, said: ‘This is a disappointing decision but it has been an extremely important case to fight. It has forced HMRC to reveal the process by which it reached a deal with Goldman Sachs, a settlement which let the bank off an estimated £20 million tax owed. ‘Without this legal action HMRC would have succeeded in keeping secret the fact that the settlement was in part motivated by saving the blushes of the Chancellor rather than collecting the tax due to the public purse. ‘We hope through this litigation that HMRC has learnt from its mistakes in the past and will ensure that such sweetheart deals, like that reached with Goldman Sachs, do not happen in the future.’ Jim Harra, HMRC's director-general for business tax, welcomed the ruling. ‘The . High Court's comprehensive dismissal of UK Uncut's claim puts to rest . the fallacy that HMRC is soft on large businesses,’ he said. ‘HMRC . has an exemplary record in relentlessly challenging those who avoid . tax. We have recovered £34 billion in additional revenues from large . businesses in the last seven years. Bank: Dave Hartnett, then permanent secretary for tax, initially shook hands on the Goldman Sachs deal on November 19 2010 following a long-running dispute over National Insurance contribution payments . ‘The High Court's judgment confirms . what HMRC has always said: that while we made errors in settling the . Goldman Sachs dispute, we made the right settlement in the . circumstances, and that our decision was both proper and lawful. 'The High Court's comprehensive dismissal of UK Uncut's claim puts to rest the fallacy that HMRC is soft on large businesses' Jim Harra, HMRC director-general for business tax . ‘This . issue has been rigorously and repeatedly scrutinised - by the Public . Accounts Committee, by a retired High Court judge on behalf of the . National Audit Office and now by the High Court itself. ‘The public can have confidence in our governance processes, which we have strengthened, providing greater levels of scrutiny, transparency and role separation. ‘In its definitive judgment, the High Court has now drawn a line under the Goldman Sachs issue. ‘HMRC can now get on with the critical job of working to ensure that all individuals and companies, big and small, pay the tax they owe to fund the UK's essential public services.’","Judge told it was allowed to proceed to avoid embarrassing Chancellor .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:13 EST, 15 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:01 EST, 15 May 2013 . Upbeat: Sir Mervyn King announced that 'a modest and sustained recovery' is on its way . Britain's economic recovery 'is in sight' following the worst  downturn since the depression of the 1930s, the Bank of England Governor said yesterday. In a welcome break from six years of persistent gloom, Sir Mervyn King announced that 'a modest and sustained recovery' is on its way. He forecast that growth will be 'a little stronger', up 1.2 per cent this year rather than the previously-forecast 0.9 per cent. And inflation will be 'a little weaker' at 2.9 per cent by the end of the year, rather than 3.1 per cent. He cautioned, however, that inflation is likely to remain above the Bank's target of 2 per cent for at least the next two years. Sir Mervyn, who retires next month and was presenting his 82nd and final Inflation Report, said it was 'the first time' he had been able to make such an upbeat overall prediction 'since before the financial  crisis'. He said: 'This hasn't been a typical recession and it won't be a typical recovery. Nevertheless, a recovery is in sight.' He also said that the interest rate of 0.5 per cent is likely to stay at its historic low for another four years. Last night George Osborne welcomed the improved economic outlook. In a speech in London to the CBI, Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Chancellor dismissed critics of his austerity programme who are calling for borrowing to be increased. He said: 'Now is not the time to lose . our nerve. Let's not listen to those who would take us back to square . one. Let's carry on doing what is right for Britain. Let's see this . through.' Sir Mervyn's remarks on interest . rates represent good news for homeowners with a mortgage, but will be a . blow for pensioners who depend on savings. In March 2009, the Bank cut . the base rate to 0.5 per cent, but the inflation report revealed the . market expects it to stay at this level until at least 2016. Welcome break: Sir Mervyn, who retired from the Bank next month, was presenting his final Inflation Report . Sir Mervyn said: 'Markets expect bank rate to remain below 1 per cent for a further four years.' Asked if he felt sympathy for the harsh impact on pensioners, Sir Mervyn, who has just turned 65, said he has 'great sympathy'. Unlike the vast majority of pensioners, he has a pension pot worth around £5.4million and can look forward to a pension worth around £200,000 a year. Sir Mervyn said he is 'certainly not . happy' that the base rate will continue to be stuck at such a low level, . which is the longest period of frozen rates in peacetime. Yesterday's . report reveals how the financial crisis has 'led some pensioners to . seek work because of the fall in their savings income'. A record of . nearly one million people are still working despite being 65 and over. 'Let's see this through': Last night Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the improved economic outlook . Simon Rose, from campaign group Save . our Savers, said millions of pensioners and other savers had been . clinging to the prospect of higher rates as 'the light at the end of a . really dark tunnel'. Inflation remaining high despite the downward revision will add to the pressure on pensioners. It has been above target since November 2009. Stephen Gifford, director of economics at the CBI, said the inflation report 'supports our view that the UK is on a rocky road to recovery'. However, workers are being hit by the worst pay rises for more than a decade. The average worker is getting a rise of just 0.8 per cent, while inflation is 2.8 per cent. The 0.8 per cent wage growth for the quarter from January to March is the lowest recorded by the Office for National Statistics under its current method of calculation, which was introduced in 2001. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the consultancy Markit, said: 'It suggests that widespread job insecurity is discouraging people from asking for pay rises.' A record 13.8million women are working. Over the past year an extra 240,000 women have got a job, many only because the family finances are being squeezed. As a result, the number of women staying at home to look after their children has dropped to close to an all-time low of two million. The average worker is earning the same as they were a decade ago, according to independent think-tank the Resolution Foundation. The Bank's GDP projections do not estimate yearly GDP growth to rise much above 2% in the next few years. The Bank's projections for CPI inflation see price rises surging to over 3% later this year, before dropping back. It said the average salary, including both full and part-time workers, is £23,088. In 2003, a worker was earning £23,000, if the figure is adjusted for inflation. Overall, the ONS said employment, which had been rising strongly in recent months, has started to drop. It is down 43,000 between January and March to a total workforce of 29.7million. Unemployment is rising, increasing by 15,000 during the same period to a total of 2.5million. Ministers said there are more job vacancies today – 503,000 – than there have been at any point since the financial crisis began in 2008. The economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of 2013, avoiding the third recession since 2008, the Office for National Statistics said - but evidence has emerged that the second dip might not have been an official recession.

"By . Paul Revoir Tv Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:27 EST, 15 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:02 EST, 15 May 2013 . Popular: Audience figures show Chris Evans has almost doubled his lead over Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw . He was hired to win over a younger audience, but it seems Nick Grimshaw is having the opposite effect. Hundreds of thousands of listeners have been switching off his Radio 1 breakfast show – and turning over to Radio 2 rival Chris Evans instead. The latest audience figures show Evans has almost doubled his lead over the Radio 1 programme since this time last year. Yesterday Evans, the former wild man who has found happiness in his third marriage and fatherhood, was celebrating trouncing Grimshaw in the latest quarterly results from Rajar, which measures radio audiences. The former Big Breakfast host appears to be attracting most of the disaffected Radio 1 listeners and posted record results of 9.8million in the three months to the end of March. This is a jump of 600,000 from 9.2million in the same period of 2012 and also up on the previous quarter. The figures show that the decision to claw back younger listeners to Radio 1 by replacing 39-year-old Chris Moyles with Grimshaw, 28, in September last year has had a disastrous effect. The DJ, who is known to revel in his celebrity party lifestyle, has lost more than a million listeners who were tuning in to Moyles a year ago. Grimshaw’s ratings have plummeted to 5.8million a week – leaving what is thought to be the biggest ever gap between the two stations’ breakfast audiences. He also scored Radio 1’s fewest listeners for the slot since Sara Cox hosted the show in 2003. Battle for Breakfast: Chris Evans leads the way when it comes to morning radio - with 9.8m listeners . Even the Today programme on Radio 4 is now regularly beating the Radio 1 programme, securing 6.9million listeners in the latest set of results. Yesterday the corporation put on a . brave face on the drop in listeners for Grimshaw and also for the . station generally, which fell by almost 900,000 to 10.3million. It said the ‘new Radio 1 schedule, aimed at a younger audience’ was ‘still bedding in’ Struggling: Nick Grimshaw has lost a million listeners who were tuning into his predecessor Chris Moyles . . The BBC claimed that although the audience was smaller it was ‘more focused on a younger demographic’ with its highest proportion of 15 to 24-year-old listeners since 2010. Helen Boaden, director of BBC Radio, said Radio 1 was ‘in good health’. She added: ‘The brand new schedule continues to bed in at Radio 1 and we remain confident that it will emerge strongly from a period of transition.’ A BBC Radio source said the department had ‘anticipated the drop’ and that changing the make-up of the audience was 'not going to be painless'. They added it had been deliberate plan to try and encourage older Radio 1 listeners over to Radio 2, which appeared to have worked. The station was forced by the BBC Trust to make more efforts to lower the age of its audience amid concerns it had not been attracting enough young listeners, who are meant to be its target audience. Grimshaw, who has also been given his own BBC3 TV series, failed to land a nomination for the breakfast show of the year title at the Sony Awards earlier this week. Evans' unprecedented figures help propel Radio 2 to a record 15.3million listeners a week - a five per cent jump from the same period last year. Radio 3 continued a ratings revival with both its overall and breakfast show figures showing an increase. The figures also showed that listening to digital radio has continued its modest increase, now accounting for 34.3 per cent of listening, up from 33 per cent the previous quarter. At the same time listening to AM and FM went down slightly by about two per cent to 60.5 per cent.","Evans posted record results of 9.8m in the three months to end of March .

Jailed: Kay Wilson pocketed almost £75,000 of taxpayers' cash by claiming she was too ill to work and could barely get out of bed after suffering three strokes . Wilson, who pocketed almost £75,000 of . taxpayers’ cash, was jailed for benefit fraud by a judge who told her . she had seen it as ‘easy money’ . She claimed disability living . allowance and severe disablement allowance while holding a string of . jobs between 2003 and 2011 and earning up to £20,000 a year, . Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. Wilson, of Wetley Rocks, . Staffordshire, started claiming benefits after suffering a severe stroke . in 1993, saying it would take her 20 minutes to walk ten yards with a . stick and she was prone to falling. On a renewal form in 1998 she stated . she had suffered three strokes in the previous five years and had . difficulties getting out of bed and dressing herself. But Wilson carried on claiming . benefits when she started working at Leek Golf Club, where she  lived . with her husband, in November 2002. She then moved on to other jobs before starting work as a sales administrator at Stoke-based Wrights Pies in November 2008. Benefits: Wilson was still being paid £9,000-a-year in disability living allowance and severe disablement allowance when she was working between 2003 and 2011 . Wilson was earning between £15,000 and £20,000 a year while receiving more than £9,000 a year in handouts, the court heard. While working there, she stripped off . with workmates in 2011 for a calendar to raise cash for local charities.

Fried chicken fans in the Gaza strip have been thrown a lifeline by a delivery company which is smuggling KFC though secret supply tunnels. The Al-Yamama company is running consignments of the Colonel's secret recipe, carried by hand through a network of tunnels under the border with Egypt. But buckets of legs, wings and breasts are not such a bargain in the occupied Palestinian territories: it comes at three times the normal cost. Taste of freedom: A deliveryman carries bags of KFC food through an underground tunnel beneath the Gaza-Egypt border . Secret recipe: Portions of KFC fried chicken are now being smuggled into Gaza thanks to an enterprising delivery company . While a family meal costs around £80 Egyptian pounds ($11 U.S.) from the el-Arish KFC restaurant in the Egyptian North Sinai, the price of getting it into Gaza is a further 100 Israeli Shekels ($30). The delivery company says the higher price is due to the transportation and smuggling fees. Al-Yamama company accountant Mohammed . Al-Madani explained the delivery men face a series of obstacles in . bringing the food to Gaza. These include Hamas security men inspecting the boxes, . an unreliable taxi service on the Egyptian side, and the possibility the Israel might send warplanes to bomb the tunnels. But it seems there is no shortage of punters eager to get their hands on the unique blend of 11 herbs and spices. Luxury: While the price of a KFC family meal is about $11 in Egypt, getting it in Gaza costs a further $30 . Demand: Since late last month, Al-Yamama has made four KFC to Palestinians . Mr Al-Madanisaid explained how the business started by chance. 'We ordered and arranged to bring some meals for us and they arrive after four hours,' he said. The company then posted a picture of the fast food on their website, and soon the orders began flooding in. Since offering the service the late last month, they have made four deliveries of KFC food, each consisting of around two dozen meals. Aboud Fares, a 22- year-old student, told the Xinhua news agency: 'It's delicious even as it's not hot.' Fast food deliveries are just one the 1.7million residents of Gaza can keep their spirits up under an occupation which has turned it, in the words of the UN's humanitarian chief, into 'a large open-air prison'. Today tens of thousands in the territory marked the 65th anniversary of their mass displacement in the war over Israel's 1948 creation, holding rallies to commemorate the 'nakba,' or 'catastrophe'. That's the term they use to describe the displacement, when three-quarters of a million Palestinians fled the fighting or were expelled from their homes by advancing soldiers.

One of the youngest victims of the Oxford paedophile ring has accused Oxfordshire County Council of lying about the support it has offered to her and her family. The girl, who was first abused at 13 by the gang, who threatened to cut the head off the baby she had by one of them, says she was repeatedly let down by social services, despite their claiming they were 'closely involved' in supporting her. The accusation comes as seven men were found guilty at the Old Bailey of a catalogue of offences including conspiracy to rape, child prostitution and trafficking over an eight-year period in the university city of Oxford. Police and social workers have apologised to their victims for failing to rescue the vulnerable schoolgirls who were plucked from the streets and care homes to be drugged, raped and sold into prostitution. Scroll down for video . The girl said she was ignored by social services, despite their director Jim Leivers claiming he'd supported her . Brothers Anjum Dogar (left) and Akhtar Dogar (right) have been convicted of offences involving underage girls . Zeeshan Ahmed (left) and Kamar Jamil (right) were among those convicted yesterday at the Old Bailey . Two sets of brothers, Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, and Mohammed Karrar, 38, and Bassam Karrar, 33, were convicted along with Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 27. The woman, known as Girl C to protect her anonymity, said that her adoptive mother begged social services for help in 2004 but agencies failed to help. Two years later the council agreed to put her in a temporary care home, but by then she had fallen under the control of the gang, who plied her with crack cocaine.  She said that when she tried to talk to . staff at the care home, she was told the . conversation was 'inappropriate'. Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . In an interview with The Guardian, Girl C said: 'The council put out a press release claiming they had offered wraparound care to all the girls and their families, but the first we heard from them in five years was a letter on April 13 from Jim Leivers [director for children, education and families at the council], where he says he's been 'closely involved in providing support' to me. 'That's a complete lie. My family have had no support or offers of help at all from Oxfordshire. Nothing. Not at any point. Not even a phone call.' She said the last contact she had with Oxfordshire County Council was five years ago when her mother begged them to help stop (Girl C) getting into trouble, and said that they ignored her then and ever since. Girl C told police she was attacked by Bassam Karrar in a guest house in Oxford in November 2006 while he was said to be high on cocaine. Officers found the girl in the basement 'extremely distressed, crying and shaking'. Brothers Bassam Karrar (left) and Mohammed Karrar (right) were found guilty at the Old Bailey . Assad Hussain was cleared of raping Child A but convicted of having sex with a child . She told police she had been held against her will, drugged, raped and repeatedly smacked in the face. The 14-year-old girl was taken to a police station where photographs were taken of her injuries. But she later dropped her complaint after pleas from another girl who was seeing Karrar at the time. A spokesman for the council said: 'We are sorry the abuse was not stopped sooner. One of the elements of the Serious Case Review will be an investigation of the support offered to the girls by agencies including social services. 'Our offer of a meeting with Girl [C] and her family was very sincere and similar offers to the other girls have been accepted. We want to do everything we can to help all the girls rebuild their lives and our door is open to Girl [C] and her family.' Yesterday, fighting broke out in the dock at the Old Bailey after two other defendants - Mohammed Hussain, 25, and a man who cannot be named for legal reasons - were cleared. Zeeshan Ahmed struck out at Mohammed Hussain before being bundled out of the dock by officers. The admissions of failure from the authorities came as it became apparent that police missed several chances to catch gang members before they were finally arrested. Some victims relived their ordeals during the four-month trial, describing how they were groomed, beaten, betrayed and sold into prostitution around the country. Joanna Simons, the council's chief executive, apologised to the girls. She said: 'Oxfordshire County Council would like to pay tribute to the bravery of the witnesses that lin giving the evidence that led to the convictions that have been secured in court... 'We would like to publicly apologise for not stopping this abuse sooner and to reassure everybody that we have learnt a huge number of lessons in terms of how to tackle this type of abuse and that we are now taking decisive action to stop it happening again in Oxfordshire.'

Jailed: Crooked magistrate Simon Price, 45, masterminded a £1m VAT fraud to clinch multi-million property deals for his construction firm . A crooked magistrate who masterminded a £1m VAT fraud which helped him secure multi-million pound property contracts was jailed today. Simon Price, 45, was presiding over fraud and criminal cases whilst secretly creating bogus documents to make his construction firm look more profitable than it was. The fraudulent scheme with his long time business partner, who Price knew from childhood, helped clinch major deals to build properties in Lancashire. But clients were left with partially-finished developments in the Preston and Kirkham areas after Price's company Ice Blue Developments went into liquidation in 2011. Price - who served as a JP in Preston between 2004 and 2009 - was caught out following a routine inspection by taxmen when concerns were raised about the company's VAT returns. Documents were unearthed showing he and fellow company director John Smith had falsified invoices to claim VAT which was not owed. It resulted in more than £1m of taxpayers cash being paid out to them between September 2008 and December 2009. Price and Smith, also 45, had known each other for 35 years having been altar boys at their local church at the age of 10 and were godparents to each others children. Smith was best man at Price's wedding, but they fell out over the scam and have not spoken since. At Manchester Crown Court, Price, formerly of Lytham, now of Gretton, Gloucs, pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue and 25 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud. He was jailed for 40 months and disqualified from being a company director for six years. He resigned from the bench in 2010. Smith, of Catforth, near Preston, who . was also a director at Jack Smith Builders was convicted of cheating . the public revenue and eight counts of making or supplying articles for . use in fraud. Magistrate: Preston Magistrates Court in Lancashire where Price served as a JP between 2004 and 2009 . He was jailed for three-and-a-half years in prison and disqualified from being a director for five years. Speaking after today's hearing, Simon De Kayne, assistant director criminal investigation at HMRC, said: 'This pair made incredibly crude attempts to falsify invoices and financial guarantees in a circle of fraudulent transactions. 'It was a complete cut-and-paste regime that unravelled as soon as HMRC officers investigated their business activities. 'The proceeds from the fraudulent VAT . repayments were diverted into their bank accounts in an attempt to . stave off their company's and own domestic debts. Partner: Father-of-three John Smith was jailed for three-and-a-half years for his part in the scam . 'The fact that Price was an acting magistrate at the time of the fraud makes it more shocking.' Earlier the court heard how Smith had studied building at Preston college and Price embarked on a career in design. Father-of-three Smith took on Jack Smith Builders, which had been established by his great grandfather, and in 1999 when he was approached to help build student accommodation in Preston he turned to Price for help. The project was a success and in 2003 they went into business for the development of land at Ashton Methodist church under the name Ice Blue Developments, with offices in the area. They then took on developments on the site of a disused petrol station in Freckleton, Preston, and secured a £3m contract for 20 apartments in Kirkham with New Fylde Housing. But victims of the pair included the New Progress Housing Group and student housing company Cosmopolitan. Work had started in September 2011 on a project with Cosmopolitan Housing with expected completion in August 2012. The company then became insolvent in December 2011 and work stopped, which meant university students who had expected to move in time for term were unable to. Cosmopolitan said this resulted in a loss in revenue of around £368,000. Smith and Price had their homes and offices searched. Price's laptop, which had drafts of false invoices from various firms on it, was seized. These include doctored invoices for building services received and faked correspondence from banks, solicitors and other institutions. The investigation uncovered letter headings from legitimate businesses that had been manipulated to create false documents. Examination of their email accounts showed Price and Smith referring to 'mickeying' up documents to suggest that Ice Blue was a reputable company and in good financial order to tender for contracts with local housing associations and to apply for bank loans. Sentenced: Manchester Crown Court, where Price and Smith were jailed and disqualified from being directors . Passing sentence Judge Patrick Field QC told Price: 'This was a saga which brought misfortune and significant damage on many others and you were the principal actor' in the frauds. 'I find you were very much in charge. You were responsible in the creation of the overwhelming majority of documents. 'You were very much in control of the monies fraudulently claimed from HMRC. It is clear that had this fraudulent scheme succeeded the reward would have been substantial. In mitigation for Price, defence lawyer Miss Lisa Robert, said: 'He has lost everything. For the first seven months of 2012 he and his wife were living as a family homeless, from pillar to post. 'For a number of years he and Mr Smith's friendship remained constant - but they are now sat next to each other in a dock separated by a few feet and the chasm that is now between them is one which cannot be breached.'","Simon Price created bogus documents to make firm look more profitable .

This is the moment that a U.S. Embassy worker is arrested by Russian Intelligence services - who waste no time in pulling off his cap with a flourish to reveal a floppy blond wig, allegedly proving that he is a 'CIA spy'. Looking more Austin Powers than James Bond, diplomat Ryan Fogle was thrown down and . handcuffed in a night-time sting on Monday by the FSB secret service – formerly . the KGB. He faces expulsion from Russia. In the 48-second clip posted on YouTube, a Russian agent removes the American's beige baseball cap to reveal an ill-fitting blonde wig. It sits at an awkward angle on his head, revealing his real dark hair below. Scroll down for videos . Just call me James... blond? Russian intelligence services parade the 'CIA spy', named as Ryan Christopher Fogle, for cameras on Monday . Revealed: The Russian agent removes the floppy blonde wig from the alleged American spy who is accused of trying to have Russian agents defect . Spy games: The alleged spy's ill-fitting wig is exposed during the swoop in Moscow . Moments later, Fogle is marched to a waiting car in Moscow surrounded by burly men. Russian intelligence services say that the 'spy' offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue-checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Arrested: The US diplomat - suspected by the Russian of being a CIA agent - was named as Ryan Christopher Fogle. He was arrested last night in Moscow . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . Last night spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Meanwhile, U.S. secretary of state John . Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are due to meet in . Sweden today after successful talks earlier this month. Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade. While . relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in . both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010. The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US . intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees . of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’ Many details remained shrouded in . mystery last night. It is not known whether the target was part of the . sting operation or if they have been arrested. Russia’s haste to make the news public . could mean either that the attempt was so audacious that it shocked . leaders, or that hardliners have seized on it to stop a move towards . detente with the US.

Tia Sharp's mother today said her relationship with her mother, . the schoolgirl's grandmother, 'had never been stronger' despite their . tangled love life with killer Stuart Hazell. Natalie Sharp, 31, also denied she was to blame for her daughter's murder after allowing the 37-year-old convicted drug dealer to babysit her, saying . criticism of her parenting was 'water off a duck's back'. Ms Sharp had a fling with Hazell for around two weeks in 2003 . after meeting him in a South London pub her mother Christine Bicknell, . 47, worked in at the time. Four years later Ms Bicknell began a relationship with . Hazell, knowing that he had been convicted of serious offences and had served time in prison. It was these relationships that allowed the child porn obsessed window cleaner to gain access to the schoolgirl and eventually kill her at home in August last year. Today, Natalie Sharp said she and her mother are still close and the murder 'has made us stronger. Not that we could have got any stronger.' Natalie also said her mother Christine Bicknell, who was Hazell’s partner, was also struggling to come come to terms with what happened. She said: 'We speak about it all the time. She’s in the same place as I am, just trying to get our heads round it. Because when you grow up, you believe the monster, the bad man, is in an alleyway, the bad man is the scary man, but in this it was the bad man’s got a smile.' Ms Sharp said she had trusted Hazell '100 per cent' with her children and that she had not known of his violent streak. 'He was like two different people,' she told Daybreak. 'The person I . thought we knew was soft and gentle and friendly, there wasn't an inch . of bad bone in him.' In a statement read to Hazell’s Old . Bailey trial she vehemently defended her decision to allow Tia to spend . the night alone with him on the night he killed her, insisting he was . not somebody she ‘dragged in from the street.’ Natalie Sharp told ITV's Daybreak this morning she would have one question for Hazell if she visited him: 'Just - ""why?"". But then, is he going to answer the questions? Then I want to put my hands around his throat.' Ms Sharp said justice 'will never be done' for Tia and that she wants Hazell to be 'beaten, brought back and beaten again'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

His criminal past included convictions for racially aggravated . common assault in 2002, dealing cocaine in 2003 and possession of a . machete in a public place in 2010, for which he was jailed for 12 . months. Deception: Last August Christine Bicknell went out on the search for Tia with Hazell, wearing t-shirts with her face on it (pictured together at a candlelit vigil), not knowing he was the killer of her granddaughter . ‘I knew . Stuart had been in prison before, but I took him as I found him,' Ms Bicknell had said. ‘He seemed like the perfect guy. He was affectionate, great with the . kids, good around the house with the  housework. He wasn’t good in the . bedroom. He never seemed interested in sex.’ In the weeks before the murder, he repeatedly photographed and filmed Tia as she slept and videoed her as she rubbed cream on her legs in her underwear. Police also found searches including the terms ‘naked little girlies’, ‘illegal under-age incest pics’ and ‘schoolgirl abuse’ on the web browser of his mobile phone. The 37-year-old smothered Tia in the early hours of August 3 last year after being left alone to babysit her while Miss Bicknell worked overnight at a care home. He photographed the schoolgirl’s naked body before wrapping it in sheets and bin liners and hiding it in the loft, where it was found a week later during the fourth police search of the house. Ms Sharp said today: 'If we were a posh family I'm sure they'd have found her quicker'. Mr Justice Nicol told Hazell as he jailed him for 38 years yesterday: ‘All that lay ahead of her – a career, loves and family of her own – will now never be'.

Even after Stuart Hazell was arrested for killing the 12-year-old, . Christine Bicknell said she loved him and she described Tia as ‘mouthy’ adding that ‘you couldn’t force her to do anything’. She had also clung to Stuart Hazell as police searched for the . 12-year-old not knowing the convicted drug dealer had murdered her and . hidden the body in the attic. ‘I let my baby down and I will never be able to get over that. I spent . five nights in that house being cuddled and comforted by the man I . loved, praying for Tia to come home safely,' she told the Daily Mirror. ‘Her mum, Natalie, even came round and stayed with us because we were . holding each other together.

'I'm still sick now when I think about it. I slept right underneath her all that time,' she told The Sun. Heartbroken that her granddaughter Tia Sharp had disappeared, Christine Bicknell looked for care and support from the man she had 'loved with all my heart'. Ms Bicknell, 47, said she had no reason to suspect that Hazell was involved in the schoolgirl’s disappearance. ‘When Tia went missing it didn’t cross my mind that she could be dead,’ she said. ‘I always thought she was coming home.

Rule change: Migrant workers from Romania and Bulgaria will soon be eligible to work elsewhere in the economy . The cost of British-grown fruit and vegetables could soar by 15 per cent because of a shortage of migrant farm workers, government advisers warned yesterday. A third of the country’s 67,000 seasonal farm jobs are filled by Romanians and Bulgarians, who are not allowed to work elsewhere in the economy. But that restriction will be lifted in January, so citizens of the two countries will be free to take up jobs in hotels, restaurants, coffee shops and care homes. The Migration Advisory Committee said ministers faced a choice between allowing a new wave of migrants from outside the EU to replace them, or seeing prices rise. The cost of celery, strawberries and salad leaves could leap by 10 or 15 per cent, advisers said. The committee said it did not believe British workers would be prepared to take the farm jobs. Chairman David Metcalf said the way the benefits system works meant a person working long hours in a field could receive as little as £100 extra per month. They would also face the problem of having to return to benefits, as most work lasts for only six months each year. Temporary curbs were imposed on Romanians and Bulgarians in 2005 to protect the British labour market, but they expire in December and, under EU laws, cannot  be extended. The present Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme allows 21,750 Romanians and Bulgarians to come into Britain for half the year. When this ends, Professor Metcalf said farmers expect many of them to move to other roles because of the ‘intensity’ of harvesting. The jobs can be physically demanding, with workers bending down 4,000 times during a typical eight-hour  celery-picking shift. The academic added: ‘The Poles have graduated to jobs in hospitality, and into the care sector and construction. One could see the Romanians and Bulgarians doing something similar.’ The present EU labour rules allows 21,750 Bulgarians and Romanians to come into Britain for half the year . Professor Metcalf said it was up to ministers to decide what to do next. One option, which the National Farmers Union is urging the Government to pursue, is to introduce a new seasonal agricultural workers scheme for migrants from countries such as the Ukraine or Croatia. This would help to keep down  the cost of British food, but would create a significant political headache for a government committed to reducing migration. The workers would mostly be coming into the Tory-dominated shires.  The impact of the new rules is not expected to be felt immediately, but the report said prices were likely to rise within one or two years. It gave the example of one firm, which charged an average of 75p for an iceberg lettuce between 2007 and 2012. In 2008, when there was a shortage of staff, this leapt to 86p. Professor Metcalf said that if the labour supply ‘dwindled’ when Romanians and Bulgarians get full EU rights in January, operators may have to ‘drive wages up’ to secure staff. He said: ‘In those circumstances, therefore, it’s possible that supermarkets would charge higher prices.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are grateful for the MAC’s report and note its conclusion that there is little evidence the supply of seasonal labour will decline in the next one or two years. ‘We shall consider the MAC’s advice very carefully. But in general we want to encourage employers to recruit from the resident labour market where possible.’","Romanians and Bulgarians make up third of Britain's seasonal farm workers .

Mr Darling said the party must come clean about what it would spend in 2015/16 once the Government’s spending review is completed on June 26. Mr Darling said: ‘We won’t know the baseline of the Government’s spending limits until the June spending review. But we will during the course of this year have to set out the parameters.’ The Labour grandee added the party was already spelling out detailed spending plans two years before the 1997 election to ‘establish in the  public’s mind what our priorities were . . . So  people can see your direction of travel.’ He warned voters need to see plans for growth. ‘My fear is we could be bumping along the bottom for an entire decade if not longer,’ he said. Mr Darling spoke out as Labour MP Frank Field called for a ‘U-turn’ on welfare to please Labour voters dissatisfied with welfare handouts. He said: ‘I think what we need to do is set out the sort of welfare state and the level of benefits we would be willing to pay for. ‘It would be the biggest U-turn we’ve done on the strategy that we employed over the period of the last Labour government.’ But challenged over why he thought Mr Miliband was not doing better – with the Labour lead down to single digits in some polls – Mr Darling offered only faint praise. ‘I think that Ed has been a lot more successful than people gave him credit for when he was first appointed,’ he told journalists at a lunch in Westminster. Spending: With less than two years before the general election, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are under pressure to say what they would do with the nation's finances . Mr Darling, who had running battles . with Gordon Brown during the dying days of the Labour government, also . refused to be drawn on the tense relationship with his former friend. Asked . how many times they had spoken since Mr Brown was forced out of Downing . Street three years ago, Mr Darling suggested it was few, if any. He . said: 'I have never provided a running commentary on any conversations I . may or may not have had.' This week there has been renewed speculation that Mr Balls could be moved from the Treasury brief ahead of the election. Mr Darking is fronting the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence, which will be wound up after the referendum in autumn next year. Asked if he would like a return to the Labour frontbench, Mr Darling suggested the backbenches were not for him, adding: ‘At the moment I am totally focussed on the referendum between now and October 2014 and after that I will see where I stand.’ He promised to ‘maintain an interest in wider affairs’ . During a wide ranging speech, Mr Darling set out an alternative economic plan, backing a third runway at Heathrow, calling for more housebuilding and rejecting the idea of privatising the nationalised banks too soon . He warned that five years after the financial crisis which began on his watch, there was little sign of improvement with the Tories forced to take comfort from not falling into a triple dip recession. ‘My fear is we could be bumping along the . bottom for an entire decade if not longer - look at what happened in . Japan,’ Mr Darling said. He blamed a ‘lack of confidence’ among . businesses. Tense relations: Asked how many times he had spoken to Gordon Brown since leaving power in 2010, Mr Darling said only that he would not provide a 'running commentary . In the Budget this year the government announced a £130billion mortgage guarantee scheme to kickstart the housing market. But Mr Darling warned it risked creating a new housing bubble because it will force up prices without increasing supply of homes. ‘The risk is if you put in measures which make it easier to buy… but you don’t do anything about the supply of housing you simply put the prices up. We have enough experience in this country of what bubbles can do. ‘I would have preferred if George Osborne had done something more to speed up the supply of housing rather than doing something which will undoubtedly make some people feel better. ‘I think the result is if you look at London where people struggle to rent and to buy, simply putting more money into the system after an existing stock seems to me to be asking for trouble.’ He added that the South East of England we need extra runway capacity, and defied Mr Miliband;s policy to back the idea of Heathrow expansion. He said Boris Johnson’s plan for a new airport in the Thames Estuary is a ‘complete nonsense’.","Ex-Chancellor says voters need to know Ed Miliband's 'direction of travel'

Theresa May has today warned police there is a risk the public will be scared to dial 999 if they fear being sued by officers responding to emergency calls. The Home Secretary told the Police Federation national conference that she wanted to stop 'frivolous' claims being made by officers. WPC Kelly Jones triggered a furious backlash after it emerged she was suing a garage owner in Norfolk after tripping on a kerb while investigating a burglary. Compensation warning: Theresa May addresses the Police Federation annual conference today in Bournemouth where she warned there is a risk the public will be scared to dial 999 if they fear being sued by officers . The officer, 33, is also demanding compensation from Norfolk Constabulary for a knee injury sustained in an accident in a police car. The case prompted Mrs May to order a review of police compensation amid fears it may be deterring victims of crime from coming forward. In the latest example of police suing taking legal action for accidents at work, it emerged today that an unnamed South Yorkshire officer was awarded £8,000 compensation by their employers after slipping on ice and snow. Addressing the annual Police . Federation conference in Bournemouth, Theresa May also pledged to change . the law so criminals who kill police officers face minimum whole-life . jail terms. Receiving a more restrained reception . than last year, when she was confronted by heckling and calls to resign, . Mrs May also announced further prosecution powers for the police so . they can bring charges against minor shoplifters. Payouts: Theresa May, with Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, warned about the risks of a compensation culture in the police following a number of high profile claims . 'I know that the vast majority of you . are dedicated public servants of the best kind. But when a police . officer sues a member of the public because they slipped on private . property – that is simply not the sort of attitude police officers . should exhibit,' she said. 'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don't make frivolous claims. 'Not least because it would be quite wrong if people become reluctant to call the police for fear of being sued.' Last . month it emerged PC Richard Seymour is suing a burglary victim after he . allegedly tore his Achilles tendon when he fell into a drain while . investigating a break-in in Surrey in 2012. He is suing for ‘loss of overtime’ during his six-month absence from work despite being on full pay. Outrage: WPC Kelly Jones took action against a garage owner after tripping on a kerb while responding to a 999 call . Today it was revealed an officer in South Yorkshire was awarded £8,162 after breaking a leg and damaging ligaments when slipping on black ice. Another worker received £1,000 after suffering a laceration putting a plug into a socket and two firearms officers received payouts after they were hit by spent cartridges during training. An officer was given £1,500 after a colleague accidentally shut a van door on his hand. Details of payouts worth £21,412 made to officers over a two-year period were released under freedom of information laws. Legal action: The garage where WPC Jones slipped on a kerb while responding to a burglary call . A police officer in South Yorkshire was awarded more than £8,000 compensation after slipping on ice, it emerged today. Since 2011, 14 payouts have been made to officers for injuries suffered at work, new figures have revealed. They included:- . Since 2011, 34 staff at South Yorkshire . Police have lodged compensation claims against their employer and 20 are . still outstanding. Addressing the conference today, Mrs May also said the Government is to . propose that the starting point for anyone convicted of the murder of a . police officer in the line of duty should be increased to whole life . without parole from a current minimum of 30 years. Receiving a round of applause from . officers in attendance, Mrs May said: 'The murder of a police officer is . a particularly appalling crime. To attack and kill a police officer is to attack the fundamental basis of our society.' She added: 'That is why I can . announce today that, subject to consultation with the Sentencing . Council, the Government will change the law so that the starting point . for anybody who kills a police officer should be a life sentence without . parole. 'We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.' There have been 12 direct killings of . police officers in the course of duty since 2000 - including the murder . of Pcs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in Greater Manchester last year. Mrs May said she wanted to increase . the number of police-led prosecutions to empower officers to deal with a . wider range of offences where people plead guilty. In the last year, police officers . have been given control over the prosecution of offences including drunk . and disorderly to criminal damage - rather than handing a file to the . Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). She said: 'I know that dealing with . the CPS on minor offences wastes a great deal of your time, and I know . how frustrating that can be. 'That’s why I can announce today that . I will increase the scope of police-led prosecutions to include . shoplifting of goods worth £200 or less. 'That means up to another 50,000 . prosecutions being led by the police - cases that will be dealt with . faster and more effectively.'","Home Secretary said she wants to stop officers making 'frivolous claims'

Adverts aimed at under-12s could be banned under new laws to prevent the commercialisation of childhood being considered by the Labour party. Raunchy pop videos which ‘degrade’ women and access to porn for children could also be targeted under Swedish-style reforms examined by Jon Cruddas . Ed Miliband’s policy chief promised more support for new dads, including paid time off to attend ante-natal classes and allowing them to stay overnight in hospital after their partner gives birth. Britain could follow Sweden in banning adverts aimed at under-12s under new laws being studied by the Labour party . In a speech on family policy, Mr Cruddas said the economic crash had heaped pressure on mothers and fathers. ‘Too often that has meant women dropping out of the labour market, and men unable to spend time with their children.’ He warned the majority of men ‘feel fathers are undervalued’ and struggle to cope with parenting in the 21st century. New dads feel 'less informed than their partners and less competent to care for their baby', Mr Cruddas warned. Jon Cruddas, Ed Miliband's policy chief, said too many fathers feel under-valued . He added: ‘Parents do not want advertisers targeting children, or pop videos depicting degrading images of women. ‘And they don’t want their children accessing pornography on the internet. ‘The commercialisation of childhood creates a status seeking consumer culture in which children judge one another by what they own.’ Labour is to examine how to ‘empower parents to decide what content their children see online’. The policy review will include studying family laws in Sweden, which has banned advertising to children under 12, Mr Cruddas said. More also needs to be done to include fathers in bringing up their children, even before birth. Dads would get new rights written into law, if Labour wins the next election. Mr Cruddas said: ‘More and more men want to be involved fathers. Fathers should be able to share involvement in their child’s school life and healthcare. ‘They should have rights enshrined in employment law; for example, we will look at paid leave to attend antenatal sessions and hospital appointments during pregnancy.’ Many public services think involving fathers is ‘not important’, viewing all fathers as a posing a ‘risk’ of ‘violence against women’. New dads feel 'less informed than their partners and less competent to care for their baby', Mr Cruddas warned . Mr Cruddas added: ‘We need a “whole family” approach which assumes, where it is safe, that a child needs a relationship with both parents. ‘Being a good father is about more than earning a living for the family. ‘Men want fulfilling home lives and women want fulfilling working lives but policy still pushes mothers into the home and fathers into work. The majority of men feel fathers are undervalued. ‘They work the longest hours in Europe and yet 82 per cent say they want to spend more time with their children. ‘Fathers are good for children and shared parenting is good for mothers.’ More support is also needed for mothers to cope with the aftermath of childbirth, he said. 'The era of thinking that we have done our job caring for mothers once they are through the physical experience of childbirth is long gone.'","New dads offered more support including paid leave for ante-natal classes .

The family of a British schoolgirl who died at a doctors’ clinic in India fear she could have been ‘murdered’ by medics intent on harvesting her organs. Gurkiren Kaur Loyal’s parents took her to see doctors in the Punjab when she began suffering from dehydration 11 days into her first foreign holiday. Her father, Santokh Ghatoara, and mother, Amritpal Kaur Loyal, claim that their eight-year-old daughter was ‘fine’ until she was given a mystery injection. This is the last picture of Gurkiren Kaur Loyal, front, with her parents and brother before she died in India last month aged eight in what her parents believe was a failed attempt to illegally harvest her organs . Gurkiren was described as a 'bright and bubbly' pupil at her primary school in Handsworth, Birmingham . Yesterday they told how, within . seconds of receiving the jab, Gurkiren’s ‘eyes rolled back into her head . and her face drained of colour’ before she collapsed and died. ‘I knew . they had killed her on the spot,’ said her mother. Mr Ghatoara, a 57-year-old postal . worker, and his wife were so fearful that their daughter’s organs could . be taken and sold on for transplant that they insisted on taking her . body back to a relative’s home. The body was kept for four days in a . freezer borrowed from a local Sikh temple before it was taken to a local . hospital. There, a ‘medieval’ post-mortem examination was carried out. Gurkiren’s parents had been told they . would not be allowed to fly their child home without one. During the . post-mortem, Gurkira’s organs were removed and have not been returned. The Birmingham coroner, Aidan Cotter, . has told the family that without them, or the Indian post-mortem report, . he is at a loss to determine a cause of death. A spokesman said staff were making inquiries into the whereabouts of Gurkiren’s missing organs. Gurkiren's father Santokh Singh Loyal and mother Amrit Kaur Loyal are demanding answers over her death . Gurkiren had gone to a clinic in Punjab seeking treatment for simply dehydration when she died suddenly . Her parents had taken her to the Moudgill clinic in Khanna, Punjab, after she began vomiting and complaining of stomach pains. She was diagnosed with dehydration and . placed on a drip, but after 30 minutes the doctor appeared with the . syringe. After collapsing, Gurkiren was taken to Khanna Nursing Home . hospital ten minutes away, where she was pronounced dead. Miss Loyal, a supermarket worker from . Hockley in Birmingham, said: ‘We were just talking to Gurkiren when a . doctor’s assistant came up carrying a pre-filled syringe and reached for . the cannula in her hand. ‘I asked what was the injection for, . but he just looked at me blankly and injected her. Within a split-second . Gurkiren’s head flipped back, her eyes rolled in her head, and the . colour completely drained from her. I knew they had killed her on the . spot.’ The schoolgirl had been on holiday with her parents and her 17-year-old brother, Simran, when she died . Gurkiren's mother said after her daughter was given a mystery injection, 'her eyes rolled in her head' She added: ‘We have read about a trade . in organs in India and we fear the doctors may have been after . Gurkiren’s organs. That’s why we would not leave her body unattended . after she had died.’ The trade in human organs has long . blighted Indian society. Despite being outlawed since 1994, there . remains a flourishing black market – with as many as 2,000 human kidneys . sold each year. Wealthy foreigners have driven the demand, with many . poor or illiterate Indians willing to donate in return for payments . equivalent to a year’s salary. The family say Dr Pardeep Moudgill, who ran the clinic, disappeared following the tragedy and did not return messages. Gurkiren’s parents said Indian police . seemed uninterested in investigating. A Foreign Office spokesman said: . ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Punjab on April 2, . 2013.’ Last night, Dr Moudgill and the . Rajendra Hospital in Patiala, where the post-mortem examination was . carried out, were unavailable for comment.","Gurkiren Kaur Loyal, eight, died in Punjab on April 2 during family holiday .

A 33-year-old banker has been jailed for seven years after sexually assaulting two girlfriends with a lacrosse stick, in a sickening attack that he also filmed. New Yorker Daniel Brown, who earned $120,000 a year at Sovereign Bank, pleaded guilty to  rape, aggravated sex abuse, assault and stalking in February. His victims, professionals in their 20s, had agreed to him filming their sexual encounters at his West 57th Street apartment in 2010 and 2011, which then turned unexpectedly violent. Jailed: Daniel Brown, 33, is sentenced at Manhattan Supreme Court for his sickening attacks on two girlfriends . When police raided Brown's apartment they found at least 100 videotapes documenting the violent encounters. The women can be heard screaming in pain on the tapes, as they were assaulted by objects including Brown's lacrosse stick. 'You ruined my Thursday night!' Brown can be heard shouting in one videotape. The woman contacted the police separately. The first came forward after about a year of repeated abuse. Both women had continued to date Brown despite the attacks. Guilty: Brown admitted the assaults after police found about 100 videotapes of the violent encounters . One of the women said Brown had punched her, smashed her face into a mirror and rammed his fist down her throat to make her throw up. When Justice Charles Solomon at Manhattan Supreme Court asked him if he had anything to say for himself Brown kept his head down and said: 'No thank you.' The former banker, who has been in custody since 2011, must register as a sex offender and serve ten years' probation when he is released.","33-year-old from New York filmed sickening attacks on the women .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 09:36 EST, 14 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:44 EST, 14 May 2013 . Britain has plunged down a league table measuring international standards of living. In a sign of the hard times facing families, the Office for National  Statistics said the UK has dropped from fifth in 2005 to 12th in 2011. The league table of the world’s wealthiest nations, using the latest available official figures, is based on how much money households have after paying their taxes and what they can afford to buy with their spare cash. Fall: Britain has fallen down the household league table from fifth in 2005 to 12th in the new 2011 table . While Britain used to be beaten only  by America, Luxembourg, Norway and Germany, it is now trumped by a much longer list of countries including Switzerland, Australia, France, Belgium, Sweden and Canada. While average incomes have risen in Britain, they have increased by more  in rival nations. At the same time, the price of goods has risen by a higher  margin in Britain – meaning we can buy less with our salaries compared with  people in other countries. The ONS’s research is based on what it calls each person’s ‘actual household  disposable income’. This is defined as their total income – not only their salary but also other items such as interest on their savings – minus their tax bill. It also includes the value of any free ‘benefits’ received from the Government, such as NHS treatment and education. But the total figure is then adjusted to take account of the prices of goods and services in each country. Plunging economic fortunes: David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne were today hit by the news that Britain has slipped down the global family income league table, caused by the economic crisis . In Britain, the average disposable . income for 2011 is given as £18,291, which has risen slightly from 2005, . when it was £17,069. But in other countries it has risen much faster, pushing the UK  down the league table as it has been rapidly overtaken. Based on research by the Organisation . for Economic Co-operation and Development, which measures economic and . social well-being around the world, the ONS report said the UK’s . downfall was primarily fuelled by the collapse in the ‘purchasing power’ of households. The ONS said: ‘Between 2005 and 2011, the price of goods and services in the UK has increased relative to other countries. ‘As a result, although household . income in the UK has grown, when compared to other countries that income . doesn’t stretch so far. This goes some way in explaining why the UK . ranks relatively lower than it did in 2005.’ It comes as a separate report, from . the Halifax bank, warned that millions of families are ‘at full stretch . financially’ and are being hit by a ‘squeeze’ forcing many to ‘cut back . where they can’. Around one in two ‘admitted they would find it difficult to cope if their monthly outgoings increased by up to £99’. Others are even more hard-pressed, . with their finances so finely balanced they would be tipped over the . edge with just a £24 increase in monthly bills. Anthony Warrington, director of . personal current accounts at Halifax, said: ‘Rising prices are putting . disposable income under increasing pressure. Jobless: This table shows unemployment rates in the OECD states in 2011. The UK went from 12th place in 2005 to 21st in 2011 . Comparison: This table shows GDP per head in all the major economies. The UK is ranked 14th in the table of 30 states . ‘With essentials such as mortgages and . rental payments, food and energy bills taking up the  largest chunk of . household spending, it leaves some households with little room for . manoeuvre.’ Frances O’Grady, general secretary of . the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘The combination of recession and . austerity has taken its toll on household finances, with income levels . in the UK falling behind many of its European neighbours. ‘Even before the recession, household spending in the UK was far more reliant on debt than in other advanced economies. ‘In order to address this as a country . we need to obsess less about housing bubbles and focus instead on . securing decent pay rises and creating better-paid jobs.’","British family incomes fell relative to other leading economies .

Now actress Julie Walters has blamed continuing ageism in the industry for her absence from our screens. Yesterday she asked: ‘Where’s Anna Ford?’ Shaming the industry: Julie Walters, 63, has blamed continuing ageism in the industry for newsreader Anna Ford, 69, remaining absent from our screens. Miss Walters, 63, said: ‘There are lots of women around my age in film, theatre and TV – producers, writers, directors and even some camera operators, in addition to actresses. ‘We’ll always have to campaign against why, for instance, older men on TV news programmes tend to be paired up with younger women. ‘Where’s Anna Ford? is what I say. But it is changing and gradually evolving. There is still ageism in our industry and we have a long way to go, but it’s getting better.’ Miss Ford, now aged 69, is not currently appearing on TV. The outspoken feminist famously threw a glass of wine over Jonathan Aitken after he controversially sacked her from now-defunct channel TV-am. 'Ageist BBC': Anna Ford, pictured presenting BBC1's One O'Clock News, left the corporation in 2006, claiming she was being sidelined due to her age . Miss Ford has also attacked  novelist Martin Amis, calling him a ‘whingeing narcissist’ who has embroidered his past for fame. She quit the BBC in 2006 aged 62, claiming she was being  sidelined because of her age. In 2011, after BBC veteran David Dimbleby, then 72, was offered a five-year, £3.5million contract, Miss Ford questioned whether a woman would get such a deal. She said: ‘I wonder how these charming dinosaurs such as Mr Dimbleby and John Simpson  continue to procure contracts with the BBC, when, however hard I look, I fail to see any woman  of the same age, the same  intelligence and the same rather  baggy looks.’ Miss Walters said she too has seen the number of film scripts she receives dwindle and the types of roles she is offered narrow. In an interview with Yours magazine, the star of Educating Rita, Mamma Mia! and the Harry Potter films added: ‘I’m glad I wasn’t born beautiful! My career was never based on my looks. ‘I was never considered suitable to play the “Juve Lead”, as we used to call it in the theatre. Older actresses can panic when they feel their looks are fading but it shouldn’t be like that; concentrate on what’s inside instead.’ And it appears to be working for her, with three films out this year and a new project for which she is about to sign a contract.","Actress blames 'ageism' for newsreader Anna Ford's absence from TV .

The Bank of England fears that its top officials have been victims of a spying operation by US financial news agency Bloomberg, it emerged last night. Senior members of the Bank, including Governor Sir Mervyn King, could have been targeted by employees of the news group to find out what stock market information they had been looking at on the company’s computer terminals. Reporters could use such information to predict economic decisions that affect millions of people, such as printing more money or keeping interest rates down. Access: The Bank of England fears its top officials were spied on by the financial news agency Bloomberg . Security concern: Senior bank staff, including Governor Sir Mervyn King may have been targeted . The revelations, slammed as ‘reprehensible’ by the Bank, come as central banks around the world are conducting inquiries to establish whether they have also been victims of the invasion. Already, the Wall Street Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan – the country’s central bank – have said they believe they may have been targeted. Reporters could also have spied on stock market data viewed by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the most powerful man in the financial world. In a highly unusual and strongly worded statement, a Bank of England spokesman said: ‘The protection of confidential information is vital here at the Bank. What seems to have happened at Bloomberg is reprehensible. 'Bank officials are in close contact with Bloomberg, who have provided assurances to ensure that this does not happen again. We will also be liaising with other central banks on this matter.’ Bloomberg has admitted some reporters accessed private information. World worries: The European Central Bank believes it may have been targeted . Spy claims: Stock market data viewed by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve Board chairman, may also have been spied on . In a message on the company’s website, . editor-in-chief Matthew Winkler said: ‘Our reporters should not have . access to any data considered proprietary. I am sorry that they did. The . error is inexcusable.’ Although it has a news agency, Bloomberg makes its money by renting the £13,000-a-year terminals to banks and traders. They offer access to instant movements of global stock markets and a host of other real-time financial information. Each user must log on but Bloomberg has admitted allowing reporters to snoop on information looked at on the machines – which could include central bankers. Bloomberg said it had allowed journalists ‘limited’ access to sensitive and private data viewed by bankers. The snooping first came to light last week after Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs complained that journalists had tried to glean information from the data. However, it is not thought any bank will be willing to part with the terminals, so vital are they to trading operations. Although Goldman is not expected to sue, it is thought that the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data protection agency, could bring civil charges against Bloomberg. Last night, an ICO spokesman said: ‘We’re aware of this issue and will be learning more about what has happened, before considering what action, if any, needs to be taken.’ Founded in 1982 by Michael Bloomberg, now the mayor of New York, the privately owned group prides itself on its integrity. With more than 315,000 subscribers in 174 countries, it has established a near-stranglehold on the financial market. It also employs more than 15,000 people in 192 locations, including 2,400 reporters who publish more than 5,000 stories a day from 146 bureaus. Last year, the company, whose profits are taken into a trust and donated to charitable causes, reported annual revenue of more than £5billion. Although Mr Bloomberg still owns a significant stake in the company, he was forced to put the firm into a trust when he entered politics. The US government has been accused of flouting the American constitution after it secretly seized two months of phone records from journalists’ numbers. The Associated Press news agency denounced the Justice Department’s operation as a ‘massive and unprecedented’ intrusion. It said the seizure included outgoing calls from more than 20 numbers assigned to journalists in New York, Washington and Connecticut. The government has refused to say why it demanded the records, but they cover April and May last year when AP reported a CIA operation in Yemen to foil an Al Qaeda plot to place a bomb on a US-bound airliner. A criminal investigation into the leak is already underway.","Bank fears Governor Sir Mervyn King may have been targeted .

A Saudi arrested at a Detroit airport for carrying a pressure cooker in his luggage is a victim of a misunderstanding by overzealous U.S. customs agents, the man's lawyer said. Hussain Al Khawahir, 33, was detained after arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport  on a flight from Amsterdam on Saturday. 'I'm afraid that some overzealous agents . were looking for anything,' said James Howarth, who is representing Mr Al Khawahir, said. 'They see a pressure cooker and say, ""This is a . man who has to be detained"".' Pressure cookers packed with explosive powder and shrapnel were set off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, in an attack that killed three people and injured 264. Departure: Hussain Al Khawahir was travelling from Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam when he was stopped in Detroit for carrying a pressure cooker . Mr Howarth said many people from Saudi Arabia travel with pressure cookers to cook lamb. 'Carrying a pressure cooker in America is not against the law,' he added. On May 11, Mr Al Khawahir was . questioned about two missing pages from his passport and the pressure . cooker he had in his luggage, according to a complaint filed by federal . prosecutors. He said initially he brought the . pressure cooker from Saudi Arabia for his nephew, a student at the . University of Toledo in Ohio, because they are not sold in America. He later said that his nephew had . bought a pressure cooker, but it was cheap and broke when he tried to . use it, according to the complaint. Mr Al Khawahir is charged with offering false information to customs agents, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Mr Howarth spoke to reporters at a hearing on Tuesday to determine whether Mr Al Khawahir would be released on bond. His lawyer said he asked that the . hearing not proceed because it was clear Mr Al Khawahir would continue . to be detained by U.S. customs authorities whatever the outcome of the . hearing. Final destination: The Saudi was stopped by Customs agents at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and questioned about missing pages in his passport . A May 28 date was set to determine whether U.S. prosecutors have enough evidence to bring the matter to a federal court. The missing pages from Mr Al . Khawahir's passport were near the back of the book and were not likely . to have been important, Mr Howarth said. Mr Al Khawahir had told agents he did not know how the pages had . been removed, and said the document had been locked in a box that only . he, his wife, and three children have access to in his home, according . to the complaint. Mr Al . Kwawahir was read his Miranda rights, which he said he understood, and . he invoked his right to remain silent, according to the complaint. He said that if Mr Al Khawahir had been carrying a different kitchen appliance, his competing statements about it . would not be cause for alarm. 'If he had made a mistake about an . electric skillet, he would be in Toledo today,' Mr Howarth told . reporters. Toledo is about 60 miles south of Detroit. Tool of terror: Twisted metal belonging to a pressure cooker used in the deadly Boston marathon bombings of April 15 . Mr Al Khawahir faces up to five years in federal prison if he is found guilty of giving false information to the U.S. agents. Customs and Border Protection officials and the FBI declined comment on Mr Al Khawahir's case. His nephew also says the case is a misunderstanding, and that the pressure cooker his uncle was bringing for him was so he could cook lamb. Nasser Almarzooq, told The Associated Press on Monday that he'd asked his uncle, Hussain Al Kwawahir, to bring him a pressure cooker because the ones he bought in the U.S. didn't work. Mr Almarzooq said he was concerned about his uncle and had not been told anything since his Saturday arrest. His uncle had been coming to visit him for a couple weeks. Mr Al Kwawahir is accused of using a passport with a missing page and making false statements about why he was traveling with the pressure cooker.

Dorothy Daly spent £15,000 and four years investigating her son's death in Greece eventually proving the negligence of the lorry driver who killed him . A mother who refused to accept the lies of a Greek lorry driver who killed her son on holiday has finally seen him jailed after a four-year campaign for justice. Stefanis Konstantinos claimed Glen Daly lost control of his moped and slid under the wheels of his truck in Crete in June 2009. Greek police believed him and said the death of 24 year-old Glen, who was on holiday with best friend Tony Atkins, was an accident. But Glen's mother Dorothy, 55, turned detective and unravelled a web of lies that her son's killers had woven. Her quest for the truth began after Mr Atkins, 28, told her how the lorry had dangerously pulled in front of them. Konstantinos, 46, then leapt from his cab to clear Glen's bike out of the way before driving off without calling for help. Determined Dorothy, a mother-of-three, begged the British and Greek authorities to re-open the case but says she was simply abandoned. She launched her own investigation - which cost her £15,000 - from her kitchen in Grays, Essex. She began with a staggering 500 phone calls and appeals in the Greek press to track down the doctor who helped her son at the scene. Konstantinos had told police the medic was foreign - but Dorothy proved his first lie by discovering that she was Greek. She then took the decision to re-examine her son's dead body herself and saw that he had no scratches or injuries apart from the head injury that killed him. That showed that Glen - himself a lorry driver - had been killed in a head-on crash, and not by sliding off his moped. Konsantinos was discredited further still . when Dorothy found he had lied with local shopkeeper Georgios Tsolakaki . to cover his tracks.

Tsolakaki had told police he had no idea who had delivered ice-cream to him 15 minutes before the crash - but delivery records showed Konsantinos's name. Dorothy, who also has one grandchild, eventually amassed a dossier detailing 24 flaws in the killer driver's account and persuaded Greek prosecutors to reopened the case. And last month Konsantinos was finally . convicted of negligent homicide and fleeing the scene of the crash and . jailed for 23 months in prison. Dorothy, a full-time carer, said her family would now be able to grieve for the first time. She said: 'It makes me feel sick to . think that the driver got out of his van and instead of helping Glen . just moved the bike and drove off. Mrs Daly was desperate to prove that Konsantinos was responsible for her son Glen's (pictured) death - and even examined his body to prove her theory . 'He should have called the ambulance and police. But instead he removed evidence to try and protect himself. 'I promised Glen that day that I would not let it get swept under the carpet. We never wanted compensation we just want justice for our son. 'I was desperately trying to get someone . to help me or take an interest in the case, but I kept getting the door . shut in my face.

'People expect you to move on after four years, but we are stuck in the day it happened as - until now - we had no resolution. 'We have not had any time to grieve properly so now hopefully the process will start.' Dorothy has now asked the Essex coroner to change the verdict in Glen's inquest from a narrative verdict of a road traffic collision to unlawful killing.","Dorothy Daly, 55, launched investigation into son Glen's 2009 death in Crete .

Smiling: Simpson managed a smile and a waist-high wave with his shackled hand as he entered a Las Vegas courtroom . The . 65-year-old Simpson is in prison for leading . five men in the armed robbery-kidnapping of the two sports memorabilia . dealers. Since Scotto's . wedding, his marriage has collapsed and he underwent three . emergency surgeries for life-threatening intestinal ailments. 'You don't think about it, but this has taken a toll on a lot of people,' Scotto said. Simpson's lawyers are claiming that . his trial lawyer for the robbery case, Yale Galanter, gave such bad trial advice and had such . conflicted interests that Simpson deserves a new trial. Simpson . claims that Galanter told him he didn't need to testify . because prosecutors failed to prove their case, and that he didn't tell . him about a plea offer by prosecutors that would have gotten him a . minimum of two years in prison. His co-counsel said Tuesday that Simpson became so dependent on Galantar during the armed robbery trial that the former football star would have done anything his lawyer advised - including passing up the chance to testify. Defense: Simpson confers with defense team member Dustin Marcello. He is currently serving a nine-to-33-year sentence in state prison as a result of his October 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping charges . Yale Galanter (pictured above) allegedly gave Simpson bad legal advice during his trial in 2008, leading to Simpson's conviction, the former NFL football star claimed in his 94-page petition for a new trial . 'I could advise O.J. all day long, and he was very respectful of me,' Gabriel Grasso told the court. 'But if I advised him of something different from what Yale said, he would do what Yale said.' It was Galanter's decision not to have Simpson testify in the trial, Grasso said. The 65-year-old Simpson was later convicted and sentenced to 33 years in prison for the crime. Simpson takes a drink after the judge allowed him to take one of his handcuffs off . Under questioning from prosecutor H. Leon Simon, Grasso acknowledged the trial judge, Jackie Glass, specifically asked Simpson if he wanted to testify. 'O.J. did say he did not want to testify,' said Simon, Clark County's chief deputy district attorney. 'Mr. Galanter told him, `This is the way it's going to be,'' Grasso said. He said Simpson's confidence in Galanter was born of his successful representation of the former Hall of Fame football player in a road rage case after Simpson moved to Florida following his 1995 acquittal on murder charges in the deaths of his ex-wife and her friend. Simpson was acquitted of all the road rage charges. Galanter, the Florida lawyer who is the . focus of Simpson's motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel has . declined to comment until he takes the stand Friday. Chit-chat: O.J. Simpson, right, talks to his defense attorney Patricia Palm during a break . Galanter, the Florida lawyer who is the focus of Simpson's motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel has declined to comment until he takes the stand Friday. Grasso, a prominent Las Vegas criminal lawyer who signed on to help his old friend, Galanter, with Simpson's defense on robbery and kidnap charges, ended two days on the witness stand by softening his assessment of Galanter's skills. 'I feel he's a capable attorney,' he said. 'Now that I know how things turned out, this wasn't his best case.' 'Was Mr. Galanter trying to sell O.J. down the river,' asked Simon? 'No,' said Grasso. He pointed to Galanter's cross-examination of a key witness as 'sterling' and 'awesome.' Remember when? Simpson reacts as he is found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman in 1995 . Acquit: Simpson was famously found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend in 1995, and a pivotal point in the trial came when he put on a pair of bloody gloves that did not fit him . Galanter, who came under searing attack for his tactics during Grasso's testimony Monday, also was criticized by the lawyer who represented Simpson in a Santa Monica, Calif., case that resulted in the celebrity defendant getting back the personal items he had set out to retrieve from two collectibles dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room when he was arrested in 2007. Attorney Ronald P. Slates testified by telephone from Los Angeles about his victory in gaining custody of Simpson's neckties and footballs. 'Did you know Yale Galanter?' asked Simpson attorney Patricia Palm. 'Yes,' he said. 'He would show up in court to take credit for what he didn't do.' Simpson, who will be 70 before he is eligible for parole, has filed a writ of habeas corpus, his last chance under state law to prove that he was wrongly convicted and win a new trial. Testimony: O.J. Simpson's 43-year-old daughter (right) testified on Monday that her father was drunk the weekend that he allegedly pulled off an armed heist at a Las Vegas hotel . Not his first time: Former football star . has been arrested more than six times, including one in 1994 (left), . 2001 (center) and 2007 (right) Latest stint: Simpson clearly gained weight . between his last trial (left) and had another mugshot taken today as his . appeal begins and he is noticeably more grey (right) After his acquittal on the murder charges, Simpson was found liable for damages in a civil wrongful death lawsuit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Palm suggested in questioning Grasso that Glass erred at trial when she allowed prosecutors to mention Goldman in court several times even after she ruled that there would be no mention of the Los Angeles case, which was deemed irrelevant. Nineteen separate reasons for reversal are being considered in the weeklong hearing. Got off: The innocent verdict in his 1995 murder case came as a shock to many of the 100 million people who stopped to watch the verdict live . June 12, 1994: Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were killed at Brown's apartment. OJ Simpson was charged with both of their murders. June 17, 1994: Police allowed Simpson the chance to turn himself in at 11am, but he did not end up in custody until after 8pm following a multi-hour chase in a White Ford Bronco. January 24, 1995: Opening statements for the murder trial begin, and the trial becomes a media spectacle, dubbed the 'trial of the century'. October 3, 1995: Simpson was found not guilty on all of the counts against him. An estimated 100 million people tuned in to hear the verdict being read, and the case had such a following that then-President Bill Clinton had to be briefed on possible rioting that may break out following the verdict. February 5, 1997: Simpson was found guilty of the wrongful death of his ex-wife and her friend in civil court, and ordered to pay $33.5million in damages. September 1, 1999: The state of California files a tax lien against him for $1.44million due in back taxes. February 2001: Simpson is arrested for simple battery and burglary, but acquitted on the charges in October.

Donald Trump took to the witness stand in court today after being accused of wooing investors into buying condos with the promise of profit-sharing, then reneging on the promise after the sale. The property developer who found fame for firing incompetent contestants on The Apprentice found himself in the line of fire, as the plaintiff's attorney sought to demonstrate to the jury that Trump and his companies had engaged in a 'bait-and-switch'. The civil trial is centered around Trump's namesake 92-storey skyscraper, two blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile in Michigan Avenue. Court date: Donald Trump arrives at Dirksen Court to testify in a civil case about Trump Tower in Chicago . Shelly Kulwin, the lawyer for Jacqueline Goldberg, sought to establish that Trump was a hands-on manager, while Trump said he was a big-picture executive. 'The primary thing is to build a great building,' Trump told jurors, leaning into a microphone and speaking calmly and steadily. 'You can't fool people.''That's an interesting infomercial,' Mr Kulwin responded. He later told the judge that Trump was not answering his questions, adding: 'He's giving a speech.'Trump's testimony is said by both sides to be key to the trial's outcome. He could remain on the stand for days, talking about the development of the luxury Trump International Hotel & Tower. Witness stand: Trump's testimony is said to be key to the civil trial in Chicago . The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by Ms Goldberg, 87, who in 2006 agreed to buy two condos for about $1 million each at the skyscraper. The building, which has more than 300 hotel rooms and nearly 500 condominiums, is in a prime location along the Chicago River. The lawsuit that alleges breach of . contract and deceptive practices seeks the return of a $500,000 deposit . Ms Goldberg made for the properties and other unspecified damages. Her lawyer portrayed the sale of the . condos as a bait-and-switch, where Trump and his executives sought to . make the properties more attractive investments by telling prospective . buyers they would reap a percentage of profits from banquet hall . rentals, food sales, laundry, parking and other services. Trump's stardom and real estate successes were also touted in condo sales pitches.In his opening statement, Mr Kulwin said: ' ""Who better to go into the hotel business with than Donald Trump?"" she thought.'. One reason Trump summarily cancelled the . profit-sharing plan, Mr Kulwin said, was because he had failed to . entice a corporate tenant to rent several floors of the building, . cutting into the tower's potential profit. The profit he had promised to make condos a more attractive investment he now needed for himself, Mr Kulwin said. When . Ms Goldberg completed her purchase in 2006, Mr Kulwin alleged, Trump . and other executives knew the profit-sharing offer would be withdrawn. Luxury: The case centres around the 92-storey Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago . It was only formally withdrawn in 2009, however, a few months before the tower's grand opening, he added. 'They made a deal and then they said, ""Surprise! No deal"",' Mr Kulwin said. Stephen Novack, Trump's attorney, said that Ms Goldberg was a sophisticated, longtime investor who signed documents explicitly giving Trump executives the power to revoke the profit-sharing offer if they saw fit. In an apparent bid to deflect any blame from Trump, Mr Novack sought to counter the portrayal of Trump as a hands-on executive, in his opening statement. 'Donald Trump delegates most decisions,' Mr Novack said, noting that he had 2,500 employees. 'It would be . impossible for him to be in the details of each project.' Switched on: Property developer Trump found fame firing contestants on the TV show The Apprentice . He insisted the decision to change the profit-sharing provision was someone else's and it was one that Trump agreed to only later. After an hour of testimony The Chicago Tribune said Trump left the city's Dirksen U.S.Courthouse, giving a thumbs up to reporters and saying: 'I love Chicago.' He is due to return to the stand Wednesday morning. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Civil case centers on luxury Trump Tower in Chicago .

The man accused of killing iconic missing child Etan Patz will today learn whether he will face trial over the six-year-old's murder. Pedro Hernandez apparently confessed to abducting and choking the boy, who was on his way to school when he disappeared in Manhattan in 1979. But his lawyer now says he made a false confession thanks to mental illness, and argues that there is not enough evidence to put him on trial. Killing: Pedro Hernandez, right, told police he was guilty of murdering missing child Etan Patz, left . A judge in New York is due to rule today on whether or not the case should be thrown out. Hernandez, 52, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, was arrested last year and told police he had killed Etan in a store where he was working. But his lawyer Harvey Fishbein has said that the suspect is schizophrenic and bipolar, and made a confession full of questionable claims only after almost seven hours of police questioning. 'No evidence or witnesses have been found corroborating any of the few facts' in the confession, Mr Fishbein wrote in papers filed with the court last month. Iconic: Etan was one of the earliest missing children to make national headlines when he disappeared in 1979 . The Manhattan district attorney's office insists that Hernandez's confession is legitimate, as he talked to police willingly and the details in it are credible. New York law states that a suspect can be convicted based solely on a confession as long as there is evidence that a crime was in fact committed. 'The evidence before the grand jury amply supports the offences charged,' prosecutors wrote in a filing a few months ago. Etan became the first nationally famous missing child when he disappeared while walking to a bus stop in his SoHo neighbourhood. Scene: This is the site of the bodega in SoHo where Hernandez claims he killed Etan in 1979 . He was one of the first children to have their faces printed on milk cartons in an unsuccessful attempt to find him. Last year, investigators dug up the streets near where he vanished, but did not discover any trace of his body. However, the increased publicity led to Hernandez's arrest after it was claimed that he had previously told people that he once killed a child in New York City. The suspect told police he had seen Etan at the bus stop and lured him to a local bodega where he worked by offering him a soda. Hernandez said he had then choked the boy to death, put his body in a box and left it in a pile of trash nearby.","Six-year-old went missing in Manhattan on his way to school in 1979 .

A prolific burglar who stole more than £100,000 worth of jewellery from the London hotel suite of former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been jailed. Jamie Filan, 33, who is believed to be an Arsenal fan, took items including a Cartier pendant, earrings and a ring worth £51,450 that Mourinho had given to his wife, Matilde. She was staying in the suite at the five-star Wyndham Grand Hotel along with their 16-year-old daughter, Tita. Mother and daughter were out shopping at the time of the raid, while Mourinho was away on business. Filan used a service lift to get into the penthouse suite, bypassing tight security. His £106,600 haul also included a Bulgari white gold watch and earrings worth £30,450, a £14,900 Van Cleef and Arpels gold bracelet and a Tiffany 18ct white gold diamond cross pendant, worth £2,450. He also stole an iPad worth £500, an Apple Macbook Pro valued at £1,829, and an Ermenegildo Zegna coat, worth £1,850.He packed the goods in a Louis Vuitton suitcase belonging to the Mourinho family, before ‘coolly’ asking the hotel concierge to book him a taxi and strolling out. It is believed Filan deliberately targeted Mourinho’s suite at the hotel in Chelsea. The soccer boss is currently at Real Madrid, but he is strongly tipped to be about to return to the London club. Filan’s Facebook page includes several photographs of him wearing an Arsenal shirt, as well as one of him in a Manchester City shirt and an image of Barcelona’s stadium. All are rivals to Mourinho’s past and present clubs. Filan was on licence when he carried out the raid, after being released earlier this year from a sentence for a domestic burglary. He has 19 previous convictions for 49 offences, 21 of which were theft. In 2007 he was jailed for five years after running over and killing dental nurse Michelle Dever in Lancing, West Sussex. He was released early, in June 2009, . and caused outrage after boasting on Facebook about jet-skiing, . quad-biking and nightclubbing in Ibiza while on licence. Jamie Filan, left, took jewellery including gems football manager Jose Mourinho had given to his wife, Matilde . The court heard Filan had managed to get into Mourinho's penthouse suite at the hotel via a service lift . Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told . Southwark Crown Court, in South London, that the robbery, in March, had . left the Mourinho family ‘extremely distressed’. Filan, who has numerous aliases . including ‘Jimmy Dormer’, was caught a fortnight later after he targeted . a suite at the exclusive Four Seasons hotel in Park Lane. He stole items including an iPhone 4S . and two bottles of perfume, but security staff caught him the following . day after he returned  to try his luck with a different room. Mr Zinner . said: ‘He targets premises specifically because of the prospect of rich . pickings and his preference is to steal from hotel rooms where there are . high-value items. ‘This wasn’t a lucky burglary, there . is a very strong inference that the defendant was aware Mr Mourinho and . his family were staying in the room and that he specifically targeted it . for the rich picking he would have obtained. ‘He has a complete cavalier attitude in that he re-offended within two weeks of a major burglary.’ Filan, who was born in Ireland  and has since lived in London and Peterborough, pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary. Judge John Price told Filan, pictured, that he was a 'persistent burglar' who knew what he was doing . Filan admitted two counts of burglary and was jailed for 31 months at Southwark Crown Court yesterday . Sentencing him to 31 months in prison, . Judge John Price said: ‘This was a planned entry and an expensive hotel . suite.

Filan, who was wearing a black tracksuit, appeared to be on  the verge of tears as the sentence was passed.

The boy told police he found his sister Leila Fowler dead after an intruder broke into their home on April 27, sparking a 15-day manhunt in Valley Springs. But Leila's brother, who has not been identified because he is a minor, has now been charged with second degree murder following his arrest on Friday.

Attorneys Mark Reichel and Steve Plesser, from the firm representing the 12-year-old, have said he is doing 'as well as can be expected in these really difficult times', according to a report on abcnews.com. They said they plan to ask the court to allow the boy to return to his family. His father said earlier this week that he would believe his son was innocent until shown evidence to prove otherwise. 'Until they have proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him,' Barney Fowler said. 'If they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest family,' he added.

They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor. 'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Mr Fowler said. He . echoed comments made earlier on Monday by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, . who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's . arrest. Justin said the . family is 'in a fog' over the boy's arrest that has rocked the . community of Valley Springs. The . arrested boy had appeared at a vigil for his sister on April 30, along with . brother Justin, who was photographed with the name 'Leila' written on . his forearm. Defending her son: A day before a 12-year-old boy was arrested for the stabbing to death of his 8-year-old sister, Leila Fowler, his mother Priscilla Rodriquez described him as 'protective' of his younger sibling . Aaron Plunk, a neighbor of the family, said the arrest was staggering but he could rest easier now. He said he and his family had been extra vigilant about locking windows and doors, even though the street was being closely guarded by deputies. ‘I think we were the safest house in the county,’ Plunk told the Modesto Bee. Calaveras Unified School District made counselors available on Monday at all schools. Police released no information about . what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 . attack. Following the crime, investigators did a door-to-door sweep of . homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Divers also searched two nearby . reservoirs in search of clues. Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs when he claimed he had encountered an intruder . Leila's brother told police he found . his sister's body and encountered an intruder in the home while their . parents were at a Little League game. He described the man as tall with . long gray hair. A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home . but she later recanted the story. Police said there was no sign of a . burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized . several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, . stepmother and siblings. Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz . said authorities spent more than 2,000 hours on the investigation before . they arrested the boy at 5:10 p.m. Saturday .

The dramatic opening scenes of the hit James Bond film Casino Royale has been recreated - entirely out of Lego. Every single shot from James Bond's famous gun barrel pose to the brutal bathroom fight scene starring Daniel Craig has been perfectly replicated in the three minute 29 second clip. The video was produced by 26-year-old Lego enthusiast who runs the online community for 'everything Lego' called Bricktease. Scroll down for video . The opening scene: A car pulls up outside a building in Prague in the black and white clip - just like in the original Casino Royale film . Lego man: The MI6 officer head to office in the building lift - unaware James Bond is waiting for him . Waiting game: The MI6 agent then spots James Bond played by Daniel Craig, pictured in Lego form, sitting in the office . It took him three weeks in total to make the clip using stop motion animation to retell the story of the opening sequence, scene by scene, against the sound reel from the actual film. Just like in the movie, Bond is sitting in a chair in the dark waiting for a MI6 section chief he has been tasked with killing. It even includes the flashback to Bond's first kill - a gritty bathroom brawl ending with Bond's assailant drowned in a sink - before he kills his current target. And despite being made out of Lego, the clip - which is all in black and white just like the movie - retains the mystique of the original film. Writing on www.bricktease.com, the creator of the Lego clip said: 'I started work on Casino Royale about three weeks ago. Confrontation: James Bond accuses the MI6 agent of leaking secret information for money in the clip which has identical camera angles to actual film . Attention is in the detail: The clip, which took three weeks to complete, even features James Bond's flash back of the first man he killed . Lego art: The 26-year-old creator of the clip - who founded the website Bricktease - used stop motion animation to make the video . 'I spend a fair bit of time going through the video and working out what scenes and camera angels there are, and plan my work to suit, so I don’t waste any time. 'I spent about two or three weeks actually filming, when I had a spare hour or two I would find a short scene or shot and do that. 'I find that planning it all out really helps me work quickly and efficiently.' Asked how he made the clip, he added: 'Practice. If you see some of my very first videos, they are pretty amateur. Wobbly camera, dodgy movement of pieces etc… over the last few videos I have been trying to get as smooth as possible. And I still have a long way to go!' He added that he always strives to use Lego as much as possible - such as the clear bricks representing the water in the sink. Graphic: Clear Lego bricks are even used to represent water as James Bond attempts to drown his assailant in the bathroom sink . Set up: When the clip reverts back to the office, the MI6 agent attempts to shoot James Bond, but he has removed the bullets from his gun . Now a 007: James Bond then shoots the agent before another quick flashback to the bathroom where he shoots his first ever a kill . Iconic: The famous gun barrel fills the scene as the James Bond theme tune starts to play . He continued: 'I have a personal preference that I want the videos to be as immersive as possible. So you don’t see anything that isn’t Lego unless you absolutely have to. 'It is really hard to get lips moving that looks realistic, so I am avoiding it for now. But I will one day work out how to do it (and do it well).' The video has greeted with delight by Bond and Lego fans alike with 364,857 people having watched it on YouTube. Despite calls for Bricktease to make an entire Lego version of the film, he admitted he didn't have enough actual Lego to do that. But he added he will be making a new clip every single month this year.

But an Equality Bill - which would make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation - was yet to be ratified, The Independent reported. The church leader, from the Independent Methodist Church, who made the decision has now denied being homophobic, the BBC reported.

The MoD today recovered two 2ft-long unexploded bombs which were seen being casually carried along by two men who found them washed up on a beach. The pair were pictured with the two potentially deadly rusty 120mm tank shells slung over the shoulders. Onlookers watched as the men strolled past them with the explosives that date back to the Cold War. Shell-shocked! The walkers were photographed taking the tank shells away from a Dorset beauty spot . It is believed the unidentified pair may have seized the bombs to try and later cash in as scrap metal. The MoD confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been 'swiftly recovered'. The shells were found washed up at Warbarrow Bay, Dorset.  The area is part of the 7,000-acre Lulworth Military Range used by the Army for tank firing practice. A woman who took the picture of the pair on her mobile phone, said: 'I thought they were carrying rugs at first but as they walked past I saw they were enormous shells. 'I was with somebody who used to be in the Army and he said that because their ends were intact, they were unexploded. 'I was really scared. As they were walking past, my little girl was alongside them. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank . Despite the copious signs about the military firing range, the pair risked death by taking the shells . 'I just think they're a pair of idiots.' Another person said: 'What a couple of twits. If you see anything like this you should always call the police, not cart it on home.' A member of the public posted on a local internet message board that the men were candidates for the Darwin Awards, a tongue-in-cheek term for people who take themselves out of the gene pool via death. However, another poster commented: 'What's the problem? One man's scrap is another's treasure.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank or a Wombat anti-tank rifle used by the Army in the 70s and 80s. The MoD confirmed today following an urgent appeal that the shells had been 'swiftly recovered' He said: 'These shells have swiftly been recovered and we would like to urge the public using the ranges to keep to the designated pathways and remember that it is potentially extremely dangerous to touch any military material they may find. ‘We take the safety of the public extremely seriously and all pathways at Lulworth Ranges that are open to the public are cleared of military debris, including shells, before access is permitted. ‘A number of signs have been placed on-site warning members of the public of the dangers of venturing from authorised pathways and removing shells.

Britain faces paying an extra £770million to Brussels this year after being outvoted by other members of the European Union. David Cameron had vowed to take the axe to the EU budget for future years and oppose ‘unjustified’ increase demanded for this year. But the UK was outnumbered when finance ministers from across the EU backed a plan to increase the budget by £6.2billion. Finance ministers from across Europe have backed the budget increase for this year . It means governments imposing austerity across will have to find millions more to hand over to Brussels, including £770million for the UK. It is a major setback for Mr Cameron at a time when he is under pressure over his promise to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. The Prime Minister is adamant that he can renegotiate a new deal with Brussels, before putting it to a nationwide vote. But he was unable to stop the new raid on national budgets to plug a shortfall in the EU to settle unpaid bills. It means the UK will pay a total of £14.7 billion this year. Conservative MEP and former European Commission chief accountant Marta Andreasen said yesterday that it ‘made a joke’ of the recent budget agreement and ‘sets a terrible precedent.’ She said: ‘It seems bizarre to me that Germany, renowned for its strict approach to finances now wants to reward EU institutions who throw taxpayers’ cash around like confetti, with an initial 7.3bn euro (£6.1bn) top up and more to come. ‘When the European Commission can snap its fingers at complaint MEPs and finance ministers and instantly obtain vast amounts of cash it sets a terrible precedent…what isn’t funny is the price to be paid by this action. European citizens already suffering harsh austerity, will once more have to pick up the bill.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the result was a 'huge defeat' for David Cameron . The UK government expressed its dismay at the decision to press ahead with the rise. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘When countries and citizens across Europe are having to make difficult decisions with their budgets, Europe itself should practice what it preaches with its own budget,"" said a Treasury spokesman. ‘This amendment was unjustified, which is why Britain opposed it.’ Only Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Austria backed Britain in trying to oppose the budget rise. But Germany and France withdrew opposition. Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, said: ‘What timing, what irony. On the day Cameron is offering a meaningless promise of a referendum, he gets an iron fisted rejection from Brussels. ‘This is another huge defeat for him at EU level, and shows the possibility of EU reform is non-existent.

An authoritative study of the emotional and mental cost of the conflict discovered 95 troops who fought in the South Atlantic had committed suicide since 1982. But while grim, the findings undermined the claim made by The South Atlantic Medal Association in 2002 that more Falklands veterans had taken their own life than the 255 soldiers who died on the battlefield. Ex Para Stephen Hood, pictured here drinking after the battle of Goose Green, was found dead in his car in January . Police believe Hood, who was found six miles from his home, died of carbon monoxide poisoning . The South Atlantic Medal Association . had said in 2002 it was ‘almost certain’ the number of suicides exceeded . the conflict death toll. But campaigners insisted it still . proved more needed to be done to tackle post-traumatic stress disorder . and mental illness caused by horrors of war. Commodore Andrew Cameron, chief . executive of veterans’ mental health charity Combat Stress, said: ‘The . number of Falkland war suicides this study reveals is too many . ‘Indeed, any suicide which is directly linked to service in the Armed Forces is too many. ‘But what this study does, for the . first time, is help us understand the needs of veterans and impact of . psychological injuries long after the guns fall silent.

In January, ex-Para Stephen Hood – who featured in iconic film footage celebrating victory at the battle of Goose Green – was found died six miles from his home in Rhyl, North Wales. The father-of-two went missing as news bulletins were featuring the latest demands by President de Kirchner for Britain to surrender the Falklands. Television reports included the Goose Green footage of Hood and fellow paratroopers. He was shown smiling at the camera and drinking from a bottle of Bacardi. The same clip featured in the 2006 film This Is England and The Iron Lady, the 2011 film about former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Hood served with 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, and previously in Northern Ireland.

The Ministry of Defence announced in . 2010 that it would investigate the circumstances of 21,432 Falklands . veterans three decades after the war. The aim was to find out whether suicide rates were more common than in the general population. The study, up to the end of December . 2012, found that 1,335 Falklands troops had died, compared to an . estimated 2,079 deaths if they had experienced the same mortality rate . as the general UK population. It meant the veterans had a 36 per cent . lower risk of dying. Of those Falklands veterans, 95 - or 7 per cent - had killed themselves or a coroner had recorded an open verdict. That meant the veterans were 35 per cent less likely to kill themselves than the general population over the three decades.

You had only to cross the threshold of the small rented West Country cottage where Dawn Aubrey-Ward lived with two of her daughters to appreciate the extraordinary extent of her devotion to animals. Two huge dogs, a Great Dane and a Dogue de Bordeaux, would bound up the hallway to greet visitors. A pair of cats would leap onto anyone who settled down on the living room sofa. On the fridge, next to photos of her beloved horse, were newsletters for countless pet rescue centres and shelters which the 43-year-old divorcee had donated to — and volunteered at — for her entire adult life. Elsewhere were photos of Aubrey-Ward fulfilling a long-held ambition by qualifying as an RSPCA inspector in 2008, and a certificate from the charity commending her rescue of an endangered lamb several months later. Not so long ago, the framed mementoes were among this vivacious animal lover’s most treasured personal possessions. But then her relationship with the RSPCA soured. Now, following a tragic course of events, they bear witness to an ugly controversy that raises sobering questions about Britain’s best-known animal charity. Yesterday, it emerged that Aubrey-Ward, who also had two grown-up children, had been found hanged at the home in Matlock, Somerset. She was discovered by a young family member on May 8. Her death came five months after Aubrey-Ward, who was no longer an RSPCA employee, had stuck her head above the parapet to publicly accuse the charity of unnecessarily killing animals. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, published in late December last year, she had described her horror, during her time as an RSPCA inspector, at having to euthanise what she called ‘healthy animals’. The decision to blow the whistle on her experience came as figures revealed that the charity puts down 53,000 animals a year — almost half of the number it takes in. The interview sparked widespread controversy. But the RSPCA responded by publicly attacking Aubrey-Ward’s character and integrity. In a statement published on its website in early January, and widely circulated among animal rights extremists, the charity suggested she was a liar primarily motivated by malice. Praised: Dawn Aubrey-Ward is given a certificate for rescuing a lamb while working for the animal welfare charity as an inspector . ‘Please be aware that Dawn Aubrey-Ward is a disgruntled former employee of the RSPCA who was subject to a disciplinary investigation for alleged theft of animals. She left the organisation with matters still pending,’ it began. Over the days that followed, Aubrey-Ward went on to endure a torrent of abuse on Twitter and Facebook, telling friends that she was struggling to cope with the tide of hate mail, death threats, and abusive telephone calls. On her own Twitter feed, she claimed that the RSPCA had ‘ruined my life’ and said that its PR statement was ‘evil’. Weeks before taking her life, she complained of feeling ‘bullied and harassed’ and admitted that she was suffering from ‘severe depression’, describing it as ‘hardly surprising’ given the pressure she had been put under. In a message on her Facebook page the day before her body was found, she declared: ‘That’s it, I give up, I am unemployed, broke, struggling and allegedly “damaged”.’ Linda Varney, a close friend, believes the ‘damaged’ comment refers to the RSPCA’s depiction of her as a liar. ‘Dawn was going through hell,’ says Varney, who  runs a cat sanctuary. ‘It was  cruelty, plain and simple. It was horrendous. We are totally shocked by her death. In my opinion, the people who drove her to this have blood on their hands.’ Animal lover: Ms Aubrey-Ward, 43, was found hanged at her home in Somerset last week . Another long-standing friend, Rose . Jay, described her victimisation as ‘appalling’, adding: ‘The last time I . spoke to her, she was feeling very low. She was short of cash, was . close to having to move home, and couldn’t get work, because potential . employers Googled her name and found all sorts of nastiness. ‘She . was very brave and spoke out for what she believed in, but she confided . in me that she had received threatening emails from people who didn’t . like what she had said. It really upset her.’ Yesterday, the RSPCA would only say: ‘We are saddened to hear of Dawn Aubrey-Ward’s death. Our thoughts are with her family at this very difficult time.’ Aubrey-Ward had joined the RSPCA as a trainee in 2007, securing what she had always regarded as a dream job. Yet after a brief honeymoon period, she started to find herself at odds with superiors. ‘Dawn was a lovely person, who adored animals,’ says one friend. ‘But she could also be a touch scatty, and sometimes didn’t do things exactly by the book. It started to upset her bosses.’ Aubrey-Ward is understood to have been particularly troubled by the number of animals RSPCA inspectors were required to euthanise. ‘She was desperate to avoid killing animals, particularly healthy ones,’ says the friend. ‘At times, she  re-homed them with other animal welfare organisations, rather than follow strict RSPCA procedures she felt would eventually lead to them being put down.’ That upset superiors, who allegedly began issuing regular complaints about wider aspects of Aubrey-Ward’s conduct. She was disciplined for failing to follow guidelines about storing ammunition for the captive bolt gun used when euthanising animals. Allegations: Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity . ‘I had accidentally put four bullets in my pocket,’ she later claimed. And . she was rebuked for refusing to issue a formal ‘caution’ to a . devastated pensioner whose cat had contracted emphysema and was dying in . his lap. ‘The RSPCA …  see . every case as a chance to prosecute, to generate publicity for . themselves,’ she said about the case. Her career came to an end after . she was reprimanded for the theft of a tortoise, which she claimed to . have taken home for safekeeping. After . a year of negotiations, she resigned. Around the same time, in 2010, . her boyfriend, Robert Colclough, was found dead. He also faced . redundancy, and was troubled by their financial prospects, although the . coroner recorded an open verdict. Aubrey-Ward discovered Robert’s body at their home. Friend Vicky Thomas said: ‘She never got over Rob’s death. The problems with the RSPCA came not that long afterwards and she just couldn’t cope any more.’ His death, along with her departure from the RSPCA, is believed to have led to a nervous breakdown. Aubrey-Ward consulted an employment lawyer and later claimed the charity offered her a pay-off. But she was required to sign a ‘gagging clause’ to prevent her publicly discussing her time at the charity. She allegedly declined, hoping to bring what she saw as the organisation’s deficiencies to a wider audience. That process began in December, when she gave the interview to The Mail on Sunday. Afterwards, the RSPCA published its statement attacking her integrity — and then the abuse began.‘You sold out!’ read one typical attack on Twitter, along with: . ‘How much were you paid?’ When Aubrey-Ward replied that she had neither sought nor received payment for her story from the newspaper, the Twitter user called her ‘foul’. So began a downward spiral that ended in her death last Wednesday. Astonishingly, her death is just one of several individuals who have been in conflict with the RSPCA. In 2010, a Shetland pony breeder from Cumbria called Alan Brough took his life after the charity confiscated his animals. Later that year, a gamekeeper called Graham Key killed himself after being convicted of firearms offences following a raid on his home. And in 2012 Stephen Brown, a pig farmer being investigated by the RSPCA, shot himself in a field. In yet another case, which bears an eerie similarity to Aubrey-Ward’s, a female RSPCA inspector called Dimity Crowley was paid £30,000 by the charity after saying she was driven to attempt suicide by ‘bullying’ and ‘sexual harassment’. Friends of Aubrey-Ward detect a pattern. ‘Dawn was a wonderful woman,’ says Jonathan Rich, a barrister who knew her well. ‘I am proud to have been one of her many friends, and so sad to be saying she is yet another person who has been in conflict with the RSPCA then died by their own hand. I think this charity needs to have a very long hard look at itself.’ A coroner will take evidence on her death in the coming months. Meanwhile Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, a prominent figure in animal welfare circles and a friend of Dawn’s, last night called for a government inquiry into the RSPCA’s behaviour. ‘It takes immense bravery to speak out when you think something is wrong — and while an organisation needs to be able to defend itself, it needs to be very careful it doesn’t overstep the mark and crush genuine people possibly making valid points,’ she said. ‘We will never forget Dawn and I’d like to feel sure she wasn’t bullied by a charity that should be all about prevention of cruelty. ‘Only an independent inquiry can achieve that.’","Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, blew the whistle in a Mail on Sunday interview .

An elderly woman with Alzheimer's and dementia was trapped overnight on a minibus after she was forgotten by a council driver, a court heard yesterday. Joan Cook, 88, spent 14 hours on the bus at a depot in Luton, Bedfordshire after being forgotten by Susan McLaughlin, 43, the jury was told. She was found the next morning sitting calmly in the same seat behind the driver's seat, Luton Crown Court was told . Mrs Cook and another women had been collected from the Hockwell Ring Day Centre in Luton on April 29 last year and should have been dropped off at her sheltered flat in Farley Hill, on the other side of town. The other woman, Margaret Harkin, was dropped off by McLaughlin, but instead of heading to the Jill Jenkins home afterwards she drove straight to the depot in Kingsway, Luton. Laura Blackband, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Cook was left in the van. She had no food, no water, no heating, no light and no toilet and no mobile phone. 'She was 88 years old and suffering from dementia.' McLoughlin had finished paper work in the van before leaving Mrs Cook and went into the depot where she wrapped a present for a colleague and then left for home. Mrs Cook had been left in the van at a quarter to five in the evening and was not discovered until a quarter past seven the next morning. McLaughlin, of Luton, pleaded not guilty to a charge of neglect, contrary to Section 44 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The prosecutor told the jury of six . men and six women that McLaughlin had worked for Luton Borough Council . since 2007.Her job was to transport vulnerable elderly people and . children with special needs. The . council policy was that the driver would be assisted by an escort, but . if no escort is available the drivers' job would be to double up. Mrs Cook was left in the van with no food, water, heating, light or toilet, the prosecution said . Ms Blackband said: 'It was not a big job to look around the van to see who is on it. 'On 29 April Susan McLauglin was working a full day's shift. Towards the end of the day at around 4pm she went to pick up Margaret Harkin and Joan Cook. 'They were picked up from the Hockwell Ring centre and were to be taken back to their care homes. 'Susan McLaughlin took Mrs Harkin back to where she was living. 'At that stage she was supposed to take Mrs Cook to where she was living, but she went to the depot and left Mrs Cook in the van. 'It is not a huge vehicle. Mrs Harkin was on the window side close to the door. Mrs Cook was opposite her on the second row by the window behind the driver. 'Quite why Susan McLauglin failed to observe Mrs Cook one can only imagine. It is a clear case of neglect.' Regrettably, she said nobody at Mrs Cook's care home had noticed she was not there until the morning. She was discovered at a quarter past seven sitting calmly in the same position, where she had been all night. When McLaughlin turned up for work in the morning and was told what had happened she was said to be 'dazed, shocked and upset.' She was asked to drive Mrs Cook home, which she did. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Driver Susan McLaughlin 'forgot' about Joan Cook, 88, and left her on bus .

"England manager claims he has limited pool of homegrown players to select from . Hodgson questions 'Englishness' of Premier League . Three Lions boss says there are no English players at some games he attends . By . Neil Ashton . PUBLISHED: . 05:04 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 17 April 2013 . Roy Hodgson fears for the future of the England team because of the number of foreign players in the Barclays Premier League. Hodgson claims he is selecting his squad from a decreasing pool of talent because of the number of overseas stars in the top flight, and worries the national team will be dragged into a World Cup play-off after last month’s poor performance against Montenegro in Group H. Hodgson, who succeeded Italian Fabio Capello as the country’s coach last May, said: ‘I go to quite a few games these days and there are no English players. One has to be very careful talking about the Premier League and the Englishness of it because two thirds of the players are not English. We have one of the lowest numbers of homegrown players and that must put us at a major disadvantage to other nations.’ Limited: England boss Roy Hodgson has bemoaned the lack of homegrown players in the Premier League . Read Neville's Mail on Sunday column here . Hodgson was at Old Trafford to watch . six English players start for Manchester United and three for Manchester . City last week. But he is still at a disadvantage compared to the other . major leagues in Europe. Just . 34.9 per cent of the players in the Premier League are eligible  for . the national team, compared with 45 per cent in Germany’s Bundesliga and . Italy’s Serie A, 58 per cent in France’s Ligue 1 and 59 per cent in . Spain’s La Liga. The demand . for foreign talent even gripped Hodgson during his spell in charge at . West Bromwich Albion before he replaced Capello at the end of last . season. Leading the way: Hodgson claims two-thirds of Premier League players - like Manchester City duo Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero - are not English . In his final game as manager at  the Hawthorns, a 3-2 home defeat against Arsenal, he picked only two English players. Billy . Jones and Liam Ridgwell are both eligible to play for the national . team, but neither are considered good enough to break into the current . squad. Despite Hodgson’s concerns, there are moves in place to safeguard . and protect the national team. More . than £340million is being invested by the Premier League over the next . five years in development projects across all levels of the game. The . Elite Player Performance Plan has also been designed to produce more . homegrown players because of the genuine fears about the quality of . English talent. Talking point: Hodgson's comments mirror the sentiments expressed recently by his assistant Gary Neville . United we stand: Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney are two regulars in Hodgson's England squads . The influence of foreign players has also affected the make-up of the PFA’s annual Team of the Year. When . the award started in 1974, nine of the players voted for by fellow . professionals in the old First Division were English. That trend . continued until Argentina playmaker Osvaldo Ardiles became the first . overseas player to be named in the Team of the Year in 1979. The . Premier League era has had a massive influence on the nominations and . now it is rare for more than four English players to be named. Last year there were four, but in 2011 Joe Hart and Ashley Cole were the only English players in the team. This . year there are concerns  that Leighton Baines, who has been outstanding . for Everton this season, may be the only Englishman named at next . Sunday’s awards. Wayne . Rooney, who is still a key member of Hodgson’s squad, is the last . English player to have won the PFA Player of the Year award in 2010.

"By . Eleanor Harding . PUBLISHED: . 17:58 EST, 14 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:24 EST, 15 May 2013 . Critic: Griff Rhys Jones attacked plans to install one of the UK's largest solar farms in the Suffolk countryside . He has spent the past few years championing the great British countryside. So when developers announced plans for an enormous solar power farm near the home of Griff Rhys Jones, they should have expected a fight. The 59-year-old comedian yesterday attacked proposals for a £20million renewable energy plant in the area of Suffolk where he lives with his family. Calling the plans ‘cavalier’ and ‘willy-nilly’, he said they would ruin the unspoilt rural area for generations to come. He is the latest personality to speak out over so-called ‘green’ initiatives to build solar and wind farms in rural beauty spots. ‘This sort of planning cannot be done in this ad hoc way,’ he said. ‘They need a much more considered approach. 'This is an area of outstanding natural beauty. We cannot license an industrial plant to be built willy-nilly on any farm. ‘To be this cavalier with this sort of development is foolish. We will be despoiling the countryside for limited results. ‘If areas as beautiful as this can be built over so quickly, this is something we will live to regret.’ Rhys Jones made his name in 1980s satirical comedy Not The Nine O’Clock News, but is now better known for his love of rural  Britain, most recently with last year’s documentary series Britain’s Lost Routes. His series Three Men In A Boat highlighted the treasures of the Thames.He lives next to the picturesque Stour river at Holbrook, around two miles from the site of the proposed solar power farm. The solar panels, which would provide power for up to 5,400 homes, would occupy 94 acres of farmland beside the Alton Water reservoir beauty spot at Tattingstone near Ipswich. The developers said they chose the site because it was not near to houses – but locals have pointed out that it would be visible from popular rambling routes. Rhys Jones said he is not against . renewable energy in principle, but believed such developments should not . be approved at the cost of ruining areas of natural beauty. Protesting plans: The new £20m plant, which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of CO2 emissions annually, is to be build near Griff Rhys Jones' home in Holbrook, Suffolk . He added: ‘Filling an area the size of 50 football pitches – which is open to view on three sides from public rights of way – with 72,000 three-metre high plastic panels simply cannot be a sensible way to use our best-quality agricultural land in a highly attractive landscape. ‘The area is heavily used for leisure and recreation and very close to Alton Water. There are brownfield sites five miles away that would be better suited. ‘I am totally opposed to it. I hope the council sees sense and opposes it.’ Last year he criticised the ‘hypocrisy’ of wind farms, calling them ‘green tokenism’. Babergh District Council is due to consider the plans for the solar farm, which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of CO2 emissions annually, today. The area is designated by the council as a special landscape area and officers are recommending that a decision should not be made until June 12. Tim Purbrick, commercial director of green energy firm Hive Energy which wants to build the farm, said: ‘I am surprised Griff Rhys Jones does not support the plans. ‘If he wants people to buy his DVDs, they will need electricity to play them and we have a problem in this country with many power stations about to reach the end of their lives. We now have an opportunity for renewable energy in this country.’ He said the site was ‘particularly suitable’, adding: ‘The field would be fully screened from the residents’ visibility and a significant amount of electricity would be supplied to them.’","Comedian call plans for solar plant near his Suffolk home 'willy-nilly'

"By . Paul Harris . PUBLISHED: . 18:40 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:40 EST, 12 March 2013 . Ten years of lies and betrayal came to a dramatic conclusion last night when Chris Huhne was finally put behind bars. The former Cabinet minister’s spectacular fall was complete when a prison guard led him in handcuffs to start an eight-month sentence. The prosecution said the 58-year-old millionaire had tried to cheat justice with a ‘scandalous’ legal defence. Vicky Pryce, who Huhne persuaded to take his speeding points and later divorced, was also given eight months for the same offence of perverting the course of justice. Last taste of freedom: Huhne leaves his London home and heads to court yesterday with his lover Carina Trimingham. He was given eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice . Describing her as ‘controlling, manipulative and devious’, Mr Justice Sweeney highlighted her revenge campaign that ruined her cheating husband’s career. He told the pair: ‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’ Addressing Huhne, he said: ‘You have fallen from a great height albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place.’ The former Liberal Democrat MP, who once harboured hopes of taking Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s job, had lied ‘again and again’ in what was a ‘flagrant offence’ of its type, he added.Huhne’s barrister said the catastrophe had torn his family apart. ‘He is a man laid bare,’ said John Kelsey-Fry QC. ‘He has two things left to which he can sensibly hope to cling. The support of his partner and loyal friends and the hope of a reconciliation with his children.’ The end: Former energy secretary Chris Huhne arrives at Southwark Crown Court yesterday to be sentenced for perverting the course of justice . He insisted however the politician was no bully and had not tried to impose his will on his family. Once a powerhouse couple – a senior politician and a leading economist – Huhne and Pryce looked more like strangers on a bus when in the dock yesterday. Their eyes failed to meet and they did not exchange a word. They sat 4ft from each other. The case was conducted at huge public expense and Huhne is estimated to have spent up to £500,000 on his defence. Yesterday it emerged that the Crown Prosecution Service is trying to recoup £117,558 in prosecution costs, £79,015 for Huhne and £38,544 for Pryce, plus an extra £31,000 from Huhne for a previous attempt to get the case thrown out. He is fighting the costs order. Mr Kelsey-Fry said Huhne will pay costs that are ‘just and reasonable’ but questioned the prosecutions version of how events unfolded. ‘Mr Huhne would not for a moment cave at paying just and reasonable costs attributed to him for this case,’ he said. ‘He would not want to be in any sense a burden on the public purse, bearing in mind his defence.’ Despite the dubious record of becoming the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed, Huhne has already launched a PR initiative apparently aimed at limiting damage to his image. In interviews hours before he was sentenced at London’s Southwark Crown Court he said he regretted not owning up earlier and accepted the judge’s conclusion that he ‘lied and lied again’. He agreed his political career was ‘very clearly over’.  In another interview, he maintained that jail was ‘a fairly small bit of the total penalty’ but admitted ‘lawmakers can be many things, but they cannot be lawbreakers’. Dubious honour: Huhne becomes the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed . Remarkably, he said he had hoped Pryce – described in court as fragile and a broken woman – would be acquitted instead of convicted at her jury trial. ‘I didn’t want her to go to jail,’ he said. ‘I told the kids and everybody else that. Revenge eats you up. It does worse things to you than to the person you are attempting to attack.’ The case came to a close just one day short of ten years from the moment a speed camera caught Huhne’s BMW doing 19mph above a 50mph limit on the M11 between London and Stansted. It might have begun with a simple motoring offence but it led to a desperately risky and ill-founded attempt to weasel out of a driving ban, compounded by lies, complex legal wrangling and an arrogant belief by both Huhne and Pryce that they would get away with it. They didn’t. Huhne comes into contact with a photographer's lens as he arrives at court. He tried to avoid a driving ban by falsely claiming his ex-wife was driving his car more than a decade ago . What Huhne might not have bargained for was the vengeful determination of a woman scorned – Pryce’s repeated attempts to expose her philandering husband by spilling details to the press of his criminal secret over the speeding fine. Nor, perhaps, did he imagine he would be ‘laid bare’ in a case that went ahead against his spurned wife for her part in the deception after he finally pleaded guilty, and she didn’t. Yesterday he made a public apology in court claiming he ‘felt awful’ about dragging people he loved into what he described as ‘this gruelling experience’. In legal mitigation it was clear that Huhne did not want to say anything derogatory about his ex-wife. Perhaps significantly, the sole allegation he did reject was a claim from her that he forced her to abort one of their children, part of the evidence she gave from the witness stand. Court artist sketch of Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce being sentenced at Southwark Crown Court in London yesterday . Both defendants wore black as they stepped separately into the dock. Pryce had a red rose in her bag from an admirer outside court, plus a double pack of tissues. Huhne read from papers given to him by his legal team. Their 26-year marriage ended more than two years ago after the exposure of his affair with Carina Trimingham, his 47-year-old PR adviser. The tall brunette sat a few feet from the dock alongside Huhne’s father Peter, visible to her lover but out of sight of Pryce. Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘To the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process, it is that now, finally, you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence. Rose for a prisoner: Vicky Pryce gets a rose from an elderly well-wisher on her way into court for sentence yesterday . ‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’ The judge said Huhne had lied to avoid prosecution for the offence – then compounded those lies by insisting Pryce had not taken the points for him, pleading not guilty, and by trying to get the case thrown out under abuse of process. ‘Whereas the truth, as you well knew throughout, was that Vicky Pryce had taken the points for you and you were guilty,’ the judge said. Both Pryce and Huhne are expected to be released from prison after only two months with a tag and a strict curfew.","Decade-long saga ends as disgraced politician is jailed for eight months .

The man who pointed a gun at a photographer in front of Pippa Middleton is a senior adviser to one of the world's leading small arms manufacturers, it emerged today. Lawyer Romain Rabillard, 36, was pictured aiming what looked like a semi-automatic pistol as he drove his convertible Audi through Paris. Others travelling in the car on Saturday have described the gun as a 'children's toy', claiming that the whole incident was a 'joke and a funny game'. Lawyer: Romain Rabillard, who pointed a gun at a photographer in front of Pippa Middleton, recently advised Heckler & Koch on a multi-million pound refinancing deal . Ladies' man: Mr Rabillard has this week taken time off work and disappeared from his £2,000-per-month rented penthouse in central Paris . A Heckler & Koch pistol that looks similar to the 'gun' Mr Rabillard pointed at a photographer on Saturday . But a source at the German arms . manufacturer Heckler & Koch today confirmed that Mr Rabillard . represented them in legal matters. He . recently advised them on a multi-million pound refinancing deal, . regularly meeting with Heckler & Koch representatives in France and . Germany. The firm is well . known for its range of USP semi-automatic pistols, which are used by the . military, police forces, security firms and private individuals who . need to defend themselves. The . revelation follows claims that the French police were told to scale . down their investigation into the threatening of a photographer because . of Pippa's involvement. Mr Rabillard has, meanwhile, taken time off work, and disappeared from his £2,000-per-month rented penthouse in central Paris. Mr . Rabillard, who was called to the Paris bar in 2005, technically faces a . prison sentence of up to seven years if prosecutors can prove that the . weapon is real. Even if it was a fake gun - or one modified to fire blanks - Mr Rabillard could be jailed for up to two years. He . has been 'lying low' since pictures of the incident were published, . said a close friend, and was today absent from his desk at Shearman and . Sterling, the American law firm based on the Champs Elysee. Mr Rabillard, who is single, is part of a fast-living set of Parisians who have grown close to Pippa in recent years. He . is frequently seen driving around the city in his convertible Audi, and . attends friends' parties in London, on the French Riviera, and in the . Alps. Gun drama: With Pippa Middleton in the front seat, driver Romain Rabillard aimed what looked like a semi-automatic pistol as he drove his convertible Audi through Paris on Saturday . Taking aim: As the others laugh and smile, the driver of the car Pippa was in points the pistol directly at a photographer . In recent publicity photographs he is shown dressed as a boxer and as a pouting gigolo with a chest wig and dark glasses. A . photo taken at a particularly wild party shows a wild-eyed Mr Rabillard . dressed in his boxer shorts and an open shirt after downing a glass of . spirits. 'Romain is a very hard working lawyer, but he absolutely loves to let his hair down,' said a close friend in Paris. 'He's . always planning holidays and weekends away, and ends up being the life . and soul of the party. Calling him a wild man would be about right!' The . emergence of Mr Rabillard's name comes as police in the French capital . said they were ordered to 'downscale' the enquiry into the Pippa . incident following 'an intervention from London'. Today they said the case was a 'low priority' - prompting accusations of a cover-up. 'If the suspects involved were ordinary kids from the estates they would have been brought in by now,' said one officer. 'As . it is this case is being dealt with at a very high level. Lots of . meetings have taken place to discuss the sensitivity of the issue, and . there has been an intervention from London.' Retail therapy: Pippa had made a last-minute dash to the shops before hopping into Mr Rabillard's convertible . 'Wild man': Mr Rabillard was today described as a hard worker who loves to let his hair down in his spare time . France . is currently on heightened security alert after Islamic terrorist . Mohammed Merah used a handgun to murder seven people in the south-west . of the country last month. Two . men were also arrested in the Paris area at the weekend in connection . with four murders carried out with a pistol in the nearby Essonne . department over the past five months. On . Friday, Pippa, whose sister is Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, . attended a lavish fancy dress party to celebrate the 30th birthday of . Arthur de Soultrait, a Paris fashion entrepreneur. Arthur . can be seen sitting in the back of the Audi wearing a blue baseball . cap, alongside a man believed to be his younger brother, Marcy de . Soultrait. Marcy de .

The incredible images were taken this year on a trip to Brazil with friends who call themselves the Moab Monkeys - after the famous Utah desert - and includes some of the world's top slackliners. Andy, from San Francisco, USA, said: 'I'm really confident with my abilities on the slackline so when I stroll across it almost doesn't look that hard. 'The better you get the more effortless it looks so people sometimes struggle to understand the technical aspect and the skill behind it. 'It's really painful to balance on the tops of your ankles like that and takes years to build up the strength needed be able to do it. 'A lot of the time doing what I do means if I lose balance I either catch the line or die - it's that simple but it makes you feel free having so little choices up there.

After the Tube train had disappeared into the tunnel, you could still find Dr Margaret McCollum sitting on the platform bench, lost in thought. A few minutes later, another train would arrive. 'Mind the gap!' said the voice on the loudspeaker to disembarking passengers, and Dr McCollum smiled... and still she stayed. For although that announcement became familiar to millions travelling on the London Underground at Embankment station, the voice had a special significance for Dr McCollum, a recently widowed GP. Scroll down for video . Poignant moment: Margaret McCollum for her late husband Oswald Laurence's voice at Embankment . The voice was her husband's, and in countless, poignant moments since actor Oswald Laurence died in 2007, she has remained on the platform just to hear him speak. Then last year, Transport For London finally brought the curtain down on Mr Laurence's only remaining stage – the northbound Northern Line platform at Embankment – in favour of a bland, digitised announcement. Dashing: Actor Laurence Oswald - 'Mr Gap' But the delightful love story that threw Dr McCollum and Mr Laurence together for 15 'blissfully happy years' is about to get a happy ending. As the Daily Mail reported on Saturday, TFL bosses are working to return Mr Laurence's voice full-time to Embankment after Dr McCollum wrote to them asking for a recording of her husband's announcement. It first aired in the late 1950s but few had any idea who Mr Laurence was; fewer still what he looked like. Until today, that is, after the Mail tracked down his widow and uncovered the identity of the man whose voice made him 'Mr Gap'. 'He was never very far away in my head and in my heart,' she said. 'And knowing that I could go and listen to his voice was simply wonderful. It was a great comfort. 'I would go and sit on the platform, and sometimes miss a couple of trains just so I could hear it. Although he could do accents, it was his natural speaking voice – clear, precise, authoritative. 'His announcement didn't say 'please' – it was perfectly minimalist. So that was what I would do, right up until last November, until one day, I heard a different voice.' Dr McCollum, now 65, wrote to TFL to ask for a recording of the announcement, and to her delight, a CD arrived just before Christmas. 'Blissfully happy': Dr McCullom and Mr Laurence were together for 15 years, having meet in 1992 . Then London Underground's unpublicised plan to reinstate Mr Laurence at Embankment was revealed after it was broadcast once again on Thursday. Train buffs and internet sites excitedly reported Mr Gap's return. But who was he? Mr Laurence was a wartime evacuee who joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the age of 17. Mind the gap: TFL bosses are looking to reinstate Mr Laurence's voice after axing it from the Tube last year . The dashing young actor went on to secure a string of roles in films that included Three Men In A Boat, a 1956 comedy starring Laurence Harvey, Jimmy Edwards, and a young Kenneth Williams playing a bit-part; The Dirty Dozen; and TV episodes of The Saint, starring Roger Moore. Ironically his voice reached a far wider audience than any of those films. It also helped to win him a wife. Dr McCollum, who spent 39 years in the health service, regularly commuted by Tube from her north London home, as did her future husband. They did not meet until 1992 when she was flying out of Heathrow on a guided tour holiday – with Mr Laurence as tour guide. She heard 'the most gorgeous voice' behind her and the pair were instantly attracted. They later became partners and married in 2003 after more than 11 years together. She kept her maiden and professional name but 'adored' being Mrs Laurence. Mr Laurence lost his battle against long-term cardio-vascular problems nearly six years ago when he was in his 70s. 'Knowing he was going to die gave a kind of intensity to our last years together,' she said. 'But I always knew that even when he was gone, I could go and listen to him whenever I wanted.' Yesterday staff at the station said there had been technical difficulties broadcasting Mr Laurence's recording over a new PA system, which was why commuters heard the old and the new intermittently. But TFL said it was hoping to let him take centre stage soon.","The recording of Oswald Laurence first aired on the Tube in the late 1950s .

Iran has threatened to block the 34-mile wide strait, pictured, in retaliation for a planned EU trade embargo on Iranian oil . Tension in the oil shipping lanes of the Gulf looks set to increase amid signs that Iran, Israel and the US will hold military exercises designed to test weaponry and tactics. And the US and European Union are still planning to press ahead with oil sanctions on Iran. On Friday, Tehran’s defence minister announced that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will hold large-scale exercises in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf in February. Called 'the Great Prophet', the exercises are expected to be more extensive than Iranian naval manoeuvres in the Sea of Oman that ended this week. IRAN-USA/SHIELD - Factbox and illustrations of Iran's ballistic missiles with map illustrating potential range. RNGS. (SIN02) The Iranian announcement came as it . emerged that the US and Israel are gearing up for a major missile . defence exercise in the next few weeks. The drills, called Austere Challenge 12, are designed to improve defence systems and co-operation between the forces and would be the largest ever held by the two countries. Israel has deployed the Arrow system, jointly developed and funded with the U.S., which is designed to intercept Iranian missiles in the stratosphere, far from the country. A statement from the Israeli military said: ‘U.S. European Command routinely works with partner nations to ensure their capacity to provide for their own security and, in the case of Israel, their qualitative military edge.’ This week Philip Hammond, the UK's Defence Secretary, warned the regime in Tehran that Britain will not tolerate the ‘very significant consequences’ if it fulfils a threat to block the Strait of Hormuz. Speech: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has warned the regime that any attempt to block the Strait of Hormuz would be 'illegal and unsuccessful' and would be countered militarily if necessary . He signalled that such action would be blocked by force of arms. Mr Hammond used a speech in Washington to warn Iran that any move to close the key Gulf trade route would be opposed by the Royal Navy. ‘Any attempt by Iran to do this would be illegal and unsuccessful,’ he said in a speech at the Atlantic Council. Then in a television interview, Mr Hammond said he wanted to send a ‘very clear message to Iran’ that the UK would not allow the Strait of Hormuz to be closed. The Royal Navy operates mine clearance vessels in the Gulf as part of a joint taskforce based in Bahrain. He said: ‘We are an integrated part of the naval taskforce in the Gulf and one of the missions of that taskforce is to ensure that those shipping lanes remain open. 'Any attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz would be illegal and we need to send a very clear message to Iran that we are determined that the Strait should remain open.’ More than 15million barrels of oil pass through the narrow stretch of water between Iran and the United Arab Emirates every day. Iran has threatened to block the 34-mile wide strait in retaliation for a planned EU trade embargo on Iranian oil. The planned embargo is an attempt to persuade Iran to abandon plans to develop a nuclear weapon.","MoD confirm the Type 45 destroyer will join British presence in the region .

Balotelli, 22, is well known for his love of karting but is forbidden by his contract with AC Milan to drive mini karts in case he gets an injury. But he satisfied his need for speed after convincing bosses at a track to let him take the gleaming Ferrari 450 out for a few high speed circuits. Mario Balotelli took his new £200,000 Ferrari for a spin on an indoor go-kart track . The AC Milan striker loves karting but is forbidden in his contract from driving karts in case of injury . The footballer is a regular at the Pala K go-karting track outside Milan . The former Manchester City star turned up at the Pala K karting complex on the outskirts of Milan with a group of pals. There was no sign of his former girlfriend Fanny Neguesha, who he split with last week despite claiming she 'was the one'. He bought the top-of-the-range sports car to console himself after the break up. The striker spent almost an hour at the club speeding through the curves and chicanes of the 600 metre track in his Ferrari as his pals cheered him on from the stands. The group then left for a bite to eat. Balotelli, who had a go kart track built in the garden of his Cheshire home when he was at Manchester City, is a regular at the Pala K centre and often visited even when he lived in England. Balotelli recently split from girlfriend Fanny Neguesha who he said was 'the one' Pala K owner Joe Ghiringhelli said: 'Mario loves coming here but he's not allowed to race the karts because of his AC Milan contract - they are worried he may injure himself. 'I must say though that we have never had any accidents here so I'm going to write to AC Milan and tell them they have no need to worry about the players using the karts. 'Mario is a regular visitor here and would come over even when he was playing in England - he loves the karts and driving although he said he could never get used to driving in England because over there they drive on the other side of the road. 'We let him take his new Ferrari out on the track and he was roaring around laughing and having fun.'

When the USS Williamsburg was commandeered by Harry Truman to be the President's personal yacht, she became one of the world's most famous ships. Dignitaries such as Winston Churchill were invited to conferences on board, while the vessel sailed around the world taking Truman on a series of exotic vacations. But now the celebrated boat is rusting away in an Italian shipyard - and could be scrapped within a few years if a last-minute attempt to save her fails. Scroll down for video . Wreck: USS Williamsburg, once the U.S. President's official ship, is now rusting away in an Italian shipyard . Demise: The famous ship is neglected and unused in La Spezia, and is likely to sink within a few years if it is no rescued . Scheme: A campaigner has launched a new plan to save the ship and return her to the U.S., but it may be almost too late . The story of the Williamsburg began in 1930, when she was built as a private vessel in Bath, Maine and named 'Aras'. In 1941, she was bought by the U.S. Navy and given the name that would make her famous - just in time to take part in the Second World War. Williamsburg spent much of the war in Iceland, helping safeguard the delivery of supplies from the U.S. to Europe, and also underwent patrols of the North American coast. Soon after the end of the war, she took over from Potomac as the President's official yacht - much to the delight of Harry Truman, who became President following the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. Heyday: The Williamsburg pictured in the 1940s, when she was used by President Harry Truman for vacations and state occasions . Meeting: Winston Churchill, second left, signs a photograph of the Potsdam Conference as Anthony Eden, Dean Acheson and Truman look on . Exercise: The fitness fanatic President keeps in shape on board by leading a group of guests in calisthenic exercises . Meeting: Truman and Churchill on board Williamsburg during one of their frequent conferences on the presidential yacht . The ship quickly gained a reputation as the 'seagoing White House', an iconic symbol of American strength and optimism as the U.S. took the lead in rebuilding the shattered West. Truman used Williamsburg to entertain a string of dignitaries - both American officials such as Secretary of State George Marshall, and visiting foreign leaders. Winston Churchill was a guest on the yacht, as was Clement Attlee, his successor as Britain's Prime Minister. The President and Churchill would enjoy long nights of drinking and gambling, in which they would discuss such seminal issues at the Marshall Plan, Nato and the creation of the state of Israel. Relaxing: Williamsburg docked in Key West, Florida in 1951 for Truman's vacation; he loved using the yacht to cruise around the Americas . Luxury: The President's private lounge on board the ship, which was decommissioned in 1953 by Dwight Eisenhower . Historic: Williamsburg was one of the world's most famous ships during the 1940s and became an icon of American strength . Truman also took his vacations on board Williamsburg, cruising around the U.S. coast and travelling out to distant destinations such as Cuba and Bermuda. When Dwight Eisenhower became President in 1953, he was less enamoured of the ship, and ordered her to be decommissioned after just one voyage. In 1962, the yacht was given to the National Science Foundation to be used for oceanographic research, and renamed Anton Bruun after an eminent biologist. Six years later, the famous ship was damaged when she was attached to a floating drydock which suddenly sank. Many grand plans were suggested for the former Williamsburg, including converting her into a cruise ship, but none of them ever came to fruition. Happy: A smiling President Truman strolls the decks of the yacht where he loved spending time . High-powered: Eden, Acheson, Truman and Churchill discussed affairs of state over long nights of drinking and gambling . Origins: The Williamsburg in 1946, soon after it stopped being a patrol boat and was handed over the White House . For 20 years, Truman's beloved yacht has been in Italy, slowly degrading and barely able to float. The Williamsburg is currently moored at La Spezia, where her owners say she is likely to sink in the next few years and will then be cut up for scrap. However, a retired seaman named Gianfranco Oddone is now campaigning to rescue the ship from her fate, and is seeking a buyer to restore the Williamsburg to its former glory. Having once been an exchange student in Truman's home town of Lamar, Missouri, he is passionate about returning the presidential yacht to the U.S. Watch video here .

A top City banker sacked from her new job after bosses found out she was suing her old firm for sex discrimination has won her employment tribunal claim. Latifa Bouabdillah resigned as vice president and director of financial giant Deutsche Bank and launched a bid to sue the bank for £1million over claims men were promoted ahead of her and received bigger bonuses. She then moved to rival banking giant Commerzbank AG but was sacked when her new bosses found out about her claim against Deutsche Bank, just a month after she took up her new post. She then took that firm to an employment tribunal - claiming victimisation and sex discrimination . Now she is in line for a major pay-out after the Central London tribunal ruled that she was victimised at Commerzbank and criticised the firm’s 'extreme reaction'. However, her claim for sex discrimination against Commerzbank was dismissed. The tribunal ruled: 'We find that the respondent victimised the claimant for having brought sex discrimination proceedings against her former employer and subjected her to the detriment of dismissal.' Miss Bouabdillah had told the tribunal that she initially kept her original claim secret from her new employers because she feared they wouldn’t offer her the £150,000 a year post as head of product engineering. However, just two weeks after taking up her new job at Commerzbank a press report about her employment tribunal claim against Deutsche Bank was seen by her new bosses. She was sacked for a ‘breakdown of trust’ just five days after the article was published. Ms Bouabdillah was escorted to her desk to collect her bag and then to reception to hand in her security passes before being escorted off the premises. She received a letter a few days later stating that she had been sacked because she had 'withheld information material to the Bank.' Commerzbank strongly refuted her claims, and said that when interviewed for the job she said that she left Deutsche Bank because 'there was a lot of competition for positions' and she 'wanted a career break'. However, the tribunal concluded: 'We find that the reason for the respondent’s decision to dismiss the claimant was that she had brought tribunal proceedings. 'The respondent denies this and says that it was her failure to disclose the proceedings rather than the fact she had taken them which was the reason. We reject this. 'We do not accept that she misled the respondents at any stage. When asked direct questions she gave direct answers. They may not have been entirely full answers but that is not a matter of misleading or being dishonest. 'Had the respondent probed deeper, the claimant would have then had to decide whether to answer the more detailed questions or not, but failure to answer questions that were not asked does not in our view amount to a lack of honesty or trust.' Taking action: Ms Bouabdillah launched a bid to sue Deutsche Bank for sexual discrimination over claims men received bonuses three times larger than hers . Case: Ms Bouabdillah was then sacked by her new employer Commerzbank AG when they found out about the case. She then accused them of unfair dismissal, and won today . The tribunal added: 'There is no evidence that the claimant at any stage neglected her duties to the Bank and there is no suggestion that she acted unprofessionally in any of her dealings albeit she had not been a the Bank very long. 'In conclusion we find that the respondent had an immediate and emotional response to the claimant’s disclosure that she had brought discrimination proceedings against her former employer. 'We find that they were uncomfortable with this and decided not to continue with the relationship because this was not the sort of person they wanted to employ.” Miss Bouabdillah had told the tribunal she was likened to a common criminal by Commerzbank’s senior HR partner Nigel Marsden and was left feeling “distressed, demeaned and humiliated” by her new bosses. She said: 'Towards the end of the conversation Nigel compared me to someone who had been shoplifting and said that should be disclosed. 'I was shocked and said how could he compare me to a shoplifter, and said there was no similarity between my case and shoplifting. 'I said that I was the victim in my claims. It seemed to me that they were just looking for an excuse to dismiss me. 'I felt rejected. The meeting upset me a lot. I had been compared to a criminal. I felt that for him I was guilty until proven innocent. I left the meeting feeling terrible, humiliated and very worried about my future.' Miss Bouabdillah was dismissed from her job at Commerzbank on June 11 last year - less than a month after she was appointed to the post. A Commerzbank spokesman said: 'Commerzbank welcomes the tribunal’s decision to dismiss the sexual discrimination claim against the Bank and is considering its legal options with regards to the other part of the claim. 'The Claimant was dismissed for a breach of trust and confidence after having failed adequately to disclose the true reasons for leaving her former employer. She, like many employees of Commerzbank was in a role of significant trust and responsibility. Honesty and trustworthiness are paramount to the Bank and its customers. 'We are committed to ensuring a positive, motivating and rewarding working environment that enables staff to reach their full potential with systems of training and support and, unusually for businesses of its kind, a policy of balancing individual needs with those of the bank.' A remedy hearing is due to take place in September.","Latifa Bouabdillah resigned as vice president of the Deutsche Bank in 2011 .

One of the Philippines' most active volcanoes rumbled to life yesterday which killed five and injured many others who had to be saved by helicopters and mountain rescue. The climbers and their Filipino guides had spent the night camping in two groups before setting out at daybreak for the crater of Mayon volcano when the sudden explosion of rocks, ash and plumes of smoke rocked the picturesque mountain, guide Kenneth Jesalva told ABS-CBN TV network by cellphone. He said rocks 'as big as a living room' came raining down, killing and injuring members of his group, some of whom are in a critical condition. Nature's fury: Nicanor Mabao Jr, one of the Filipino tour guides who survived after Mayon Volcano spewed a giant ash cloud and a hail of rocks, killing five and injuring eight more . Mayon rumbled to life yesterday, spewing room-sized rocks toward nearly 30 climbers . Jesalva said he rushed back to the base camp at 914 meters (3,000 feet) to call for help. Among the dead were three Germans and their Filipino guide, said Albay provincial governer Joey Salceda. Another foreigner was presumed dead, but Salceda said everyone else on the mountain was accounted for by noon. Eight people were injured and Salceda said the others were being brought down the mountain. Speaking from Legazpi, the provincial capital at the foothill of the mountain, he said: 'The injured are all foreigners ... they cannot walk. If you can imagine, the boulders there are as big as cars. 'Some of them slid and rolled down. We will rappel the rescue team, and we will rappel them up again.'

An Austrian mountaineer and two Spaniards were rescued with small bruises, he added. Tuesday's eruption was normal for the restive Mayon, said Renato Solidum, the head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. The 2,460-meter (8,070-foot) mountain about 340 kilometers (212 miles) southeast of Manila has erupted about 40 times during the last 400 years. In 2010, thousands of residents moved to temporary shelters when the volcano ejected ash up to five miles from the crater. Rescuers assist the tour guide after the eruption. The volcano is one of the nation's most active . Survivor: Mountaineer Bon Deblois arrives at camp as rain hammers down in the aftermath of the blast . Solidum said no alert was raised after the latest eruption and no evacuation was being planned. Climbers are not allowed when an alert is up, and the recent calm may have encouraged this week's trek. However, Solidum said that even with no alert raised, the immediate zone around the volcano is supposed to be a no-go area because of the risk of a sudden eruption. Salceda said he would enforce a ban on climbers. Despite the risks, Mayon and its near-perfect cone is a favorite spot for volcano watchers. Most enjoy the occasional nighttime spectacle of the rim lit by flowing lava, viewing from the safety of hotels in Legazpi.

Political junkies are chomping at the bit for the latest insights into Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick, and there was a glimmer of hope Tuesday morning when it was suggested that the public could turn to Wikipedia for answers. A site called Tech President made a compelling case by arguing that interested parties could look at the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees and use the volume of those edits as a gauge for how likely it is that said candidate will be Romney's choice. The article examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential election: shortly before Sarah Palin and Joe Biden were revealed as their respective parties' vice presidential nominees, there was a major spike in the edits to their pages. Frontrunner: Seen here with Mitt Romney today, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (right) had the most edits on her Wikipedia page out of all of the potential VP candidates . The jump in that traffic presumably came from members of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by Americans hoping to learn more about the candidates. For instance, Sarah Palin's page had 68 edits the day before her nomination was announced, while other prospects- which, at the time, included Romney himself- had far fewer changes on that fateful day. The activity increase was first noticed immediately after the Palin nomination, but today's article appears to be the first time that such analysis was applied to this year's crop of candidates. Using the same barometer, a number of political bloggers looked to see if that same detail-specific timeline could give some insights into the upcoming Republican nominee selection process. Trailing behind: Marco Rubio had 100 edits on Tuesday (left), Rob Portman had 81 (center) and Paul Ryan had 57 (right) putting them all behind Ayotte but the system of analysis is also flawed . While Senators Rob Portman and Marco Rubio have often been discussed as the frontrunners in the secretive race, they were outpaced- at least on Wikipedia- by Senator Kelly Ayotte on Tuesday. The New Hampshire Senator, who has campaigned frequently with Romney in recent months, had a total of 153 edits made to her page by Tuesday evening, while Rubio followed with 100 and Portman with 81. Paul Ryan finished out the list with 57 edits. Politico blogger Dylan Byers said that while he initially endorsed the validity of the veritable 'tea leaves' of Wikipedia edits, further inspection proved that a number of the edits were done by the same sources, not all of which were substantive. Additionally, there is the ever-important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation. When Palin was added to the ticket, she was essentially unknown to all Americans outside of Alaska where she was part-way through her first term. As a result, it comes as no surprise that John McCain's campaign staff wanted to add a significant amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of the electorate. Trendsetters: The system of looking through Wikipedia edits for clues came with Sarah Palin's selection in 2008 (above) but she also was less well-known than all of Romney's current candidates . The same cannot be said for Rubio, Portman or Ayotte, all of whom have been under the political microscope for the past few months in wake of their connections to Romney. While the edit tally may not prove to be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot, the Romney campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which will deliver the news first once it breaks. Another tried-and-tested method would be to follow the money. Politico reported Tuesday that Portman is expected to rake in over $500,000 for the Romney ticket from two Ohio fundraisers this week, which would be a positive argument in favor of his candidacy. At the same time, Florida-based Republican Hispanic coordinator Ana Navarro Tweeted an anonymous tip that the Romney’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential partner will be in St. Petersburg, foreshadowing that the candidate is likely from the Sunshine State, (meaning Rubio). It is likely that such rumor-mongering will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal announcement won’t come until after the Olympics finish in order to make the best use of the inevitable media attention.","In the days leading up to public announcements, vice presidential candidate's Wikipedia pages are frequently updated by campaign staffers .

A Nato airstrike hit two houses, killing 10 Afghan civilians and four insurgents near the Pakistani border, officials said today. President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, the latest in a series of civilian casualty reports that have raised tensions between the Afghans and the U.S.-led foreign forces. The attack occurred about 10 p.m. Tuesday during a joint NATO-Afghan operation in the Shigal district of Kunar province, a lawmaker from the area said. The U.S.-led military alliance in Kabul said only that it was looking into the reports. The airstrike occurred at 10 p.m last night during a joint NATO-Afghan operation in the Shigal district of Kunar province. Pictured is an explosion following airstrikes by NATO-led forces during fighting . between Afghan and foreign troops and Taliban insurgents in . Nanagarhar province last year . Wagma Sapay, a member of parliament from Kunar, said the civilians killed were in one house while four senior Taliban leaders were slain as they were gathering next door in the Chawkam area. Karzai's office said 10 civilians, including women and children were killed, and four were wounded. It said a delegation was sent to the site to investigate. The statement said Karzai 'strongly condemns' the airstrike and 'emphasizes that the fight against terrorism is not in the house and villages of Afghan people."" Provincial police chief Ewaz Mohammad Naziri said those killed included five boys, four women and one man. Fazalullah Waheedi governor of Kunar said local government had not been informed about plans for the strike . The governor of Kunar, Sayed Fazelullah Wahidi, said the local government had not been informed about plans for the strike. 'This operation was by coalition and Afghan forces,"" he said. 'We were not aware of it."" The killing of civilians at the hands of U.S. and other foreign forces has been one of the most contentious issues in the 11-year war. Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force, said the alliance was aware of the allegations of civilian casualties in Kunar but could not confirm any details. 'We take these allegations very seriously and we are in the process of determining the circumstances surrounding this incident,' he said. The reported attack came as President Barack Obama announced in his State of the Union speech that he will bring home within a year about half of the 66,000 U.S. troops now in Afghanistan in a step toward withdrawing all foreign combat forces by the end of 2014. The U.N. body monitoring the rights of children said last week that attacks by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan, including airstrikes, have reportedly killed hundreds of children over the last four years.

A policeman who lost his leg in a motorbike crash while on duty is to take part in a charity bike ride after being fitted with a new prosthetic knee joint. Malcolm Hingle's bespoke joint will allow him to ride a bike like an able-bodied person and to make the 375 mile journey without discomfort. The device is made from flexible carbon fibre and has been specially cut to fit a prosthetic knee that enables Mr Hingle to peddle normally. Malcolm Hingle, 52, had to have his left leg amputated following a motorbike crash . The £5,000 socket has been designed so that it will not rub against his stump and cause blisters, meaning the 52-year-old can ride for long periods. The former detective constable will use the socket and prosthetic knee while taking part in a Paris to London bike ride to raise money for the charity Help for Heroes. Mr Hingle, from Chingford, northeast London, lost his left leg above the knee after a motorbike crash in 2006. He was riding a police bike while following drug dealer when a car pulled out in front of him causing him to crash. He underwent 56 operations, but his leg was amputated in July 2011 following an irrecoverable infection. Now experts at the private clinic, Dorset Orthopaedic in Ringwood, Hampshire, have made him the new joint free of charge. He had 56 operations but his knee became infected so doctors has no choice but to remove the leg above the knee . He has now been fitted with a new prosthetic knee joint to allow him to ride a bicycle . Mr Hingle said: ‘I was a Met police detective on surveillance duty following a major criminal in London. ‘A car did a right turn and we collided, I was thrown to the floor and dislocated my left knee and had a compartmental fracture in my right forearm. ‘I had 56 operations, about six of those were on my arm, but in 2011 the knee became infected which resulted in the left leg being amputated. ‘I have got a pneumatic knee joint through the NHS but when I heard about the Help for Heroes bike ride I knew I'd need a different socket. Next month he will take part in a charity bike ride from Paris to London to raise money for Help for Heroes . ‘As the journey is so long a normal socket would leave me with huge sores if I were to use it every day for that type of activity. ‘Dorset Orthopaedic offered to make me a socket to my measurements, which is perfect for the bike ride as I'll be cycling around 80 miles a day. ‘It fits with the pneumatic knee joint which is also perfect for the bike ride as it's pumping up and down and is made for that kind of movement.’ David Hills, clinical director at Dorset Orthopaedic said: ‘This is a specially designed socket using Comfort Fit technology. Mr Hingle is hoping to raise £5,000 for the charity by taking part in the bike ride . ‘This involves using very flexible materials that make cycling easier, combined with extremely lightweight materials such as carbon fibre. ‘I designed this socket around the shape of Malcolm's saddle on his bike so that it is comfortable enough for him to cycle over very long distances. ‘Malcolm is an above the knee amputee so having a very comfortable and flexible socket that doesn't rub or come into contact with the saddle is extremely important. ‘In addition to this, the prosthesis is fitted with a lightweight hydraulic knee that allows an easier pedal action. ‘We created a cast by hand for the test sockets and Malcolm undertook a 54 mile cycle while trialling his prosthesis at home before taking final delivery.’ Mr Hingle, who lives with wife Shirley, hopes to raise £5,000 by taking part in the bike ride next month.

Police have arrested Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf at his home where he had holed up following a dramatic escape from court to avoid detention, it emerged today. Musharraf fled Islamabad High Court in a speeding vehicle yesterday after a judge rejected his bail and ordered his arrest in connection with a case involving his decision to fire senior judges while in power. It was a new low in Musharraf's troubled return from self-imposed exile last month to make a political comeback in the upcoming parliamentary election. Police say they arrested Musharraf overnight and presented him before a judge at Islamabad District Court this morning. Scroll down for video . Drama: Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf fled an Islamabad courthouse yesterday to avoid arrest, but has now been held by police at his home . The former President fled at such a speed yesterday, one of his security detail was left clinging to the outside off the car as it sped off . Local TV footage showed Musharraf entering district court in Islamabad amid a heavy security detachment of police and paramilitary soldiers. The district court judge instructed police to keep Musharraf in their custody for two days and then present him before an anti-terrorism court, said one of his lawyers, Malik Qamar Afzal. Officials have declared Musharraf's home on the outskirts of Islamabad a jail, which is allowed under the country's law, and he will be held there under house arrest. Musharraf's legal team has said they will challenge the arrest order in the Supreme Court later. After Musharraf got away, Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were seen leaving the Islamabad High Court today . Yesterday Musharraf was on the run after fleeing a court in the country's capital to avoid arrest after his bail was revoked, police said. Officers were deployed at the court building in Islamabad but Musharraf's security team rushed him out and put him in a black pick-up truck before they could detain him. The court rejected his bail in a case related to his decision to suspend the constitution and declare a state of emergency in 2007, police spokesman Ali Asghar said. A spokeswoman for Musharraf, Saima Ali Dada, said his legal team is trying to decide the next move. Formerly one of Pakistan's most powerful politicians after seizing power in a 1999 coup, Pervez Musharraf went from Pakistan President to self-imposed exile. During his tenure in charge of the country, which ended in 2008, he survived numerous attempts on his life. The turning point of his time in charge came after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001. He supported America's 'War on Terror', which proved hugely unpopular in Pakistan. In a bid to crush militants who supported Al Qaeda, he ordered his security forces to lay siege to the Red Mosque and its Islamic school in Islamabad, which was said to be campaigning to enforce Sharia law. More than 100 people were killed. In the aftermath, Islamist militants began a campaign of suicide bombings and Musharraf fled the country in 2008, returning last month to participate in elections. His time in power was also marked by . struggles with the judiciary, including an attempt to remove the chief . justice in 2007 - for which he faces treason charges - and clashes over his bid to remain . head of the army while still president. He attempted to appease the West by aiding the 'War on Terror' but managed to further anger militants within Pakistan... while the West criticised his dedication to fighting Al Qaeda. Musharraf was also accused of not doing enough to protect . former PM Benazir Bhutto from being assassinated in 2007, despite . allegedly being aware of Taliban plans to kill her. It followed accusations that he was indirectly responsible for the death of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, a Baloch nationalist leader killed in an army operation the year before. Local television broadcast footage of Musharraf jumping into a black SUV and escaping as a member of his security team clung to the outside of the vehicle.  Meanwhile lawyers shouted 'Look who is running, Musharraf is running!' He sped away to his large compound on the outskirts of Islamabad that is protected by high walls, razor wire and guard towers. This week has gone from bad to worse for Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and spent nearly a decade in power before being forced to step down in 2008. He returned last month after four years in self-imposed exile in Britain to make a political comeback despite legal challenges and Taliban death threats, but has since faced paltry public support. A court in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Tuesday disqualified Musharraf from running in the parliamentary election scheduled for May 11, likely squashing his hopes for political comeback. The case before the Islamabad High . Court  today involved Musharraf's decision in 2007 to detain senior . judges, including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, when he . declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution. The . decision outraged many Pakistanis, and further fueled a nationwide . protest movement by lawyers that eventually resulted in Musharraf . stepping down under the threat of impeachment. Before he returned to the country, . Musharraf obtained pre-arrest bail for the judges' case and two others, . meaning he could not be arrested when he landed - a feature of . Pakistan's legal system. The Islamabad High Court refused to extend that bail today and ordered his arrest, said police officer Ali Asghar. The court previously agreed to extend . his bail in the case for six days on April 12. It's unclear why they . chose to reject it this time. Despite crowds of people, including police officers with the power to arrest him, Musharraf managed to escape to his compound . Musharraf's lawyer, Ahmad Raza Kasuri, . complained that the court didn't listen to their arguments, saying: 'It . is a one-sided decision' that he would challenge. - Ali Dayan Hasan, Human Rights Watch Pakistan . Musharraf's decision to flee the court could put the Pakistani army in an awkward situation. The former general is protected by paramilitary soldiers who officially report to the Interior Ministry, but are headed by senior army officers. Ali Dayan Hasan, the director of Human Rights Watch in Pakistan, called on the military authorities protecting Musharraf to comply with the court's order and ensure that he presents himself for arrest. 'General Musharraf's act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses,' said Hasan in a statement sent to reporters. Musharraf fled to his heavily-guarded compound on the edge of the city after evading arrest today . 'Continued military protection for General Musharraf will make a mockery of claims that Pakistan's armed forces support the rule of law and bring the military further disrepute that it can ill afford,' Hasan said. Pakistan has a long history of the army seizing power in military coups, and the service is considered the most powerful institution in the country. If convicted of treason, Musharraf could face the death penalty or life in prison. But the federal government would have to file charges against the former military ruler, which it has not yet done. The petitions in Islamabad High Court accusing Musharraf of treason were all filed by individuals. Musharraf faces similar accusations from petitions filed before the Supreme Court. He also faces legal charges in two other cases.","Pervez Musharraf, 69, fled court in Islamabad yesterday after Treason case .

'I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,' Kevin Curtis said at a press conference today, describing the moment he was questioned by federal authorities.

Emotional: Curtis said at the news conference: 'I'd never heard of ricin. I thought they said rice' McCoy suggested in court on Monday that . federal authorities should instead investigate J. Everett Dutschke, an . accused child molester who unsuccessfully ran for a Mississippi state . House seat against the son of one of the ricin targets. McCoy said Dutschke recently had a . falling out with Curtis after an argument over email. Dutschke and . Curtis' brother are former business partners. On Tuesday local police and federal . agents searched Dutschke home and asked him to take a lie detector test. Dutschke has denied any involvement in the threats and has not been . accused of wrongdoing by authorities. McCoy told CNN this afternoon that federal agents have not recovered any physical evidence tying Curtis to the poisoned letters. 'Kevin Curtis is absolutely 100 per cent innocent,' McCoy told CNN today. She added: 'He's been through sheer hell.' On Tuesday afternoon, six days after Curtis was arrested, the U.S. Attorney dropped terrorism charges against him. He had been accused of sending letters laces with the deadly poison ricin to the offices of Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. 'I respect President Obama. I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to him or any other U.S. official,' Curtis said Tuesday. McCoy suggested in federal court on Monday that Dutschke is one of the men who the FBI should investigate in the ricin case. 'Framed': Kevin Curtis, who works as an Elvis impersonator, may have been set up by a man who was once his brother's business partner, his lawyer says . Accused: J Everett Dutschke, right, had his home raided by federal agents on Tuesday after Curtis lawyer alleged he might be behind the ricin attack. He is seen here with Senator Roger Wicker . Denial: Dutschke has said he had nothing to do with the ricin attacks and is a 'patriotic American' Dutschke, she said, is a former friend . of Curtis and that the two had a falling out over a book Curtis wrote . called 'Missing Pieces.' On . Friday afternoon ten local officers and federal agents raided Dutschke's house in Tupelo . and searched it. Dutschke denied any involvement in the ricin case on . Tuesday. 'I'm a patriotic American. I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letters,' Dutschke said. He said he was asked to take a lie detector and that police had previously questioned him as well. Dutschke and Curtis are both musicians, are both politically active and are both heavily interested in martial arts. Dutske was arrested early this year and charged with molesting three girls - including a teenager he 'touched' between 2007 and 2011, an eight-year-old girl and a seven-year-old girl. He has not yet stood trial for the charges and is free after posting $25,000 bail. Musician: Kevin Curtis works as an Elvis impersonator and performs music for a living. He once performed for Senator Roger Wicker, one of the politicians who received ricin in the mail . Found nothing: Curtis' lawyer said that despite extensive searches of his home, federal agents did not recover any physical evidence linking Curtis to the ricin letters . McCoy said that whoever framed her client dropped obvious clues that led federal investigators to arrest Curtis. Curtis made several posts on Facebook about the 'organ donation industry.' He signed each of his posts with the phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message.' He also authored a book on organ donation called 'Missing Pieces.' The poison-laced notes included a reference to the book, as well. A day earlier, FBI Agent Brandon Grant . testified searches on Friday of Curtis' vehicle and house in Corinth, . Mississippi, found no ricin, ingredients for the poison, or devices used . to make it. A search of Curtis' computers found no evidence he . researched making ricin. 'There . was no apparent ricin, castor beans or any material there that could be . used for the manufacturing, like a blender or something,' Grant . testified. He speculated that Curtis could have thrown away the . processor. McCoy believes the only explanation is that somebody else set her client up. 'It's horrific that somebody would do this, but yes, I believe that's what happened,' McCoy said. Still, Grant testified that authorities believed they have the right suspect. 'Given the right mindset and the Internet and the acquisition of material, other people could be involved. However, given information right now, we believe we have the right individual,' he said. Suspect: The FBI has arrested a suspect accused of sending letters laced with ricin to President Obama, pictured on Wednesday, and a Mississippi senator . Hound dog: Curtis posted hordes of pictures on his Myspace page showing him from the 1980s and 90s . Grant said lab analysis shows the poison in the letters was in a crude form that could have been created by grinding castor beans in a food processor or coffee grinder. Grant testified Friday that authorities tried to track down the sender of the letters by using a list of Wicker's constituents with the initials KC, the same initials in the letters. Grant said the list was whittled from thousands to about 100 when investigators isolated the ones who lived in an area that would have a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark, which includes many places in north Mississippi. He said Wicker's staff recognized Curtis as someone who had written the senator before. All the envelopes and stamps were self-adhesive, Grant said Monday, meaning they won't yield DNA evidence. He said thus far the envelopes and letters haven't yielded any fingerprints.","Kevin Curtis was set free on Tuesday after the FBI arrested him last week based on clues included in the poison letters sent to three politicians .

He's back: BBC series Bergerac, starring John Nettles could be brought back, but Mr Nettles is very unlikely to return . The BBC could remake classic Jersey-based crime drama Bergerac, but its original star John Nettles is unlikely to be playing the role that made him so famous, it emerged today. It is more than 20 years since the original ratings hit was axed but the Corporation says a new version is in development, but with a younger Jim Bergerac. BBC bosses are eager to copy the success of ITV's Endeavour, which follows the career of the young Inspector Morse. A spokesman told MailOnline the new show is in development, but has not yet been commissioned. Insiders say it wants to make the drama more appealing to a younger audience rather than the more middle-aged market who watched it decades ago . The original Bergerac starred John Nettles as the title character, a casually dressed detective with a vintage sports car solving crimes against the sunny backdrop of the Channel Islands. It ran for a decade on the BBC from 1981 to 1991. After it ended, Nettles went on to star in the highly successful Midsomer Murder series on ITV. It is developing what the makers call a 'reboot' of Bergerac with BBC's in house drama team and with the blessing of the original series creator Robert Banks Stewart. He told industry journal Broadcast: 'The team involved has full artistic freedom to recreate Bergerac the way they see it in the 21st century. 'Obviously the unique atmosphere of Jersey and the island's involvement will count for a lot.' Iconic: John Nettles in the 1949 Triumph Roadster that became so famous in the TV show based on Jersey . After losing out to ITV successes like Downton Abbey and Mr Selfridge in recent drama ratings battles, the show could help revive the BBC's fortunes. And it may also restore some of Jersey's reputation beyond that of a tax-dodging haven for celebrities like Jimmy Carr who had a reported £3.3 million stashed in an account there.","Midsomer Murders star Mr Nettles would be replaced with younger actor .

The security firm G4S was reportedly paid a staggering £284million to provide up to 17,500 personnel for the 2012 Games. But yesterday, in a major humiliation for company bosses and Olympic organisers, it admitted it would fall well short of the target, forcing ministers to pull in thousands of military personnel. The company was contracted to provide a minimum of 15,400 security staff, with a target of 17,500. A soldier on duty at the Olympic park in Stratford on Thursday. He'll soon be joined by 3,500 other troops . Yesterday, as the Government confirmed the call-up of 3,500 extra troops, G4S claimed it would be able to bring in 13,800. However, . with 14 days to go to the Games, question marks remained whether it . would meet even that target, as just a small fraction of that total is . available for deployment. Only 4,000 are ‘boots on the ground’, working . as ticket checkers and bag searchers at the Olympic Park in Stratford, . east London. Another 9,000 . are still in the training and vetting process – raising fears even the . more reduced target might not be achievable. The Armed Forces now make up the overwhelming majority of the security staff likely to be deployed during the Games. The . original plan for 7,500 military is bolstered by a special contingent . of 5,000, plus the 3,500 announced on Tuesday, making a total of 16,000. In addition, there will be 3,000 unpaid volunteers. The . number of staff needed to guard the Olympic venues more than doubled . last December after the organising committee Locog wildly underestimated . the total required. Originally Locog contracted G4S to provide 2,000 . security guards, but in December the firm agreed to increase that number . massively. Falling short: The Armed Forces are to provide up to 3,500 extra troops for security duty at the Games after private security firm G4S admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver . Yesterday Downing Street insisted there would be financial penalties for the firm for failing to meet the contract. But Locog refused to comment on the nature of any fines, claiming it would breach commercial confidentiality. That is despite taxpayers coughing up at least £9billion for the cost of the Games. Insiders said the company had repeatedly claimed until last week that it would meet its obligations. A Whitehall source accused the firm of ‘abysmal’ failure and said it had delayed completing training and vetting processes to save money by not having too many staff on the books before the start of the Games. The source said: ‘Until yesterday officials from G4S were turning up and assuring us that the figures were getting better and going to be OK. ‘Then we learn there’s not as many as we need. They didn’t want to be throwing money at the problem six months ago because their staff would be sitting around doing nothing.’ Home Secretary Theresa May was hauled to the House of Commons to try to explain the shortfall. She insisted: ‘There is no question of Olympic security being compromised.’ But Labour MP Keith Vaz, who called for the emergency statement, said: ‘G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops.’ But Labour MP Keith Vaz, said: ¿G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops.¿ . Mr Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, has written to Nick Buckles, chief executive of G4S, demanding he give evidence before MPs next week. The debacle is the latest blow to the reputation of G4S which, while relatively unknown to the public, is one of the world’s biggest security companies. In recent years its tentacles have extended into swathes of British life which used to be the preserve of the public sector, including running prisons and police custody suites. From headquarters in Crawley, Sussex, company bosses run a sprawling multinational company with interests in more than 125 countries. They provide security at Heathrow and other major airports, and for vans transporting cash on behalf of banks and other financial institutions. Under its previous name Group4Security it had a contract for transporting prisoners, but in 2004 the company ‘lost’ two prisoners, sparking a major investigation. It runs six jails in the UK including Birmingham, where an inspection report in October 2011 said drugs were regularly being thrown over the prison walls. Three G4S guards are on police bail over the death in October 2010 of Angolan national Jimmy Mubenga, who was restrained while being deported from the country. In November last year, company bosses pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion-pound takeover of ISS, a Swedish catering and cleaning firm, after a shareholder revolt. Only yesterday, the company’s failure over the Olympics was cited as Surrey police pulled out of a huge privatisation deal for which G4S was in the running. A spokesman for G4S said: ‘This is an unprecedented and very complex security recruitment and deployment exercise which is being carried out to a very tight schedule. ‘We have encountered some delays in progressing applicants through the final stages but we are working extremely hard to process these as swiftly as possible.’","Army called upon to fill Games security shortfall .

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn made a £950,000 pay-off to the New York hotel cleaner who accused him of trying to rape her. The disgraced economist, 64, and chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo reached the deal to end all legal action for sexual assault against him in the US. The six-figure sum is considerably less than the £3.5 million Strauss-Kahn was reported to have paid Ms Diallo in December, France's Journal de Dimanche newspaper said. Former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn was ordered to pay £950,000 in a civil action brought against him by Nafissatou Diallo after her accusations of rape were dropped . The 30-year-old chambermaid then paid £320,000 in legal fees, leaving her a settlement of £630,000 , the Sunday paper reported. Strauus-Kahn - once tipped as a future president of France - was arrested in May 2011 for trying to rape Guinea immigrant Miss Diallo when she came to clean his suite in New York's Sofitel hotel. He was charged with attempted rape, sexual abuse, a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching and held at the city's notorious Ryker's Island prison. Nafissatou Diallo, 30, took out a civil case against Strauss-Kahn who she said subjected her to a 'violent and sadistic attack' He claimed Ms Diallo had consented to sex but later described the encounter as 'a moral failure' that he would regret his whole life. All charges were then dropped a month later over concerns about the housekeeper's credibility. She went on to file a civil case against him for what she called a 'violent and sadistic attack' that humiliated and degraded her, and 'robbed her of her dignity as a woman'. Strauss-Kahn also faces legal woes in . France, where he returned after criminal charges were dropped, only to . face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. When . those allegations were also abandoned, he was then confronted with more . claims he used hookers supplied by a vice network in Lille, northern . France. He now stands . accused of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around . the world, and of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to . the prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn . confessed to attending many group sex sessions but insisted he did not . know the young women were hookers and that he often had sex with . 'willing girls' in their 20s. He is now under 'judicial control' on 385,000 bail until judges rule later this year on whether he should stand trial over the accusations. The hugely experienced economist has meanwhile made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.","Former IMF chief reached deal to end all US legal action for sexual assault .

Oprah Winfrey may be one of the richest Americans, but after a string of recent real estate investment losses she might consider keeping her billions in the media business. The lady billionaire’s most recent hit came as her company sold retail space that once contained her Oprah Store at a loss of more than $1 million. The sale comes after the company’s closing of the store itself, which was shuttered just after Oprah signed off the daytime airwaves for good in 2011. Fizzle: Oprah Winfrey knows how to make money in media, but the billionaire has taken more than one fat loss in the real estate game . The space, which sat just across from the talk queen’s Harpo Studios in Chicago, cost the company $1.98 million, but it ultimately sold for only $875,000, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Oprah Store sold Oprah logo-emblazoned designer wear from ‘Oprah’s Closet’ and gave proceeds to charity. The law firm that orchestrated the sale said the space is set to become a meditation center. This is not the first time an Oprah-backed real estate investment brought a big loss. Last summer, Ms. Winfrey sold an eight-bedroom co-op unit in Chicago’s Streeterville neighbourhood for $2.75 million, a unit for which she paid a whopping $5.6 million in 2006. Loss: around $3 million. Ouch: The Oprah Store in Chicago closed after Winfrey's talk show ended in 2011. The space was recently sold at a $1 million loss to her company . Ooohm: The store sat just across from Oprah's Harpo Studios in Chicago. It will now become a meditation center . Oprah, by the way, never even moved into the place. These are two sharp blows to the media savvy businesswoman, ones that followed the mightiest of blows: when her much anticipated OWN Network hit airwaves to disappointing numbers. But since the network’s dark first days, things have begun to look up and Oprah may yet redeem her juggernaut status among TV types. Repeat: The Oprah Store, pictured, was just one of her real estate flops. She sold a Chicago condo in July at a $3 million loss . The Oprah Winfrey Network—its full name—has been gaining steam since landing an exclusive first interview with shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong. And Forbes reports that Discovery Channel, which partnered with Oprah on the OWN venture, has confidently reported that the cable network could be in the black by the end of 2013. Oprah is currently the only African American billionaire, with a reported worth of $2.8 billion. Hope: Things may be on the up for Winfrey, though. The OWN network, which tanked initially, is showing marked improvement and her partners at Discovery Channel say it could be in the black by the end of 2013 .","The Queen of Daytime took an even bigger loss last summer when she sold a Chicago co-op she never even moved into for $3M less than she paid in 2006 .

Rows over bedroom tidiness, answering back and dating boys were among the most common causes of arguments between mum and daughter. And it is only when a woman reaches the age of 23 that she finally starts to appreciate everything their mother did for her.

X Factor finalist Rylan Clark has spoken out about his mother’s 30-year battle with crippling Crohn’s disease. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the Celebrity Big Brother 2013 winner said that his mother’s illness had not only affected her but himself too, admitting that it impacted on his childhood and that he continues to worry about the state of her health today. Rylan said that unlike other mothers, Linda Clark, 60, was unable to go on school trips with him. He added that she was sometimes so embarrassed about the symptoms of her disease that he was not allowed to invite friends to stay at his home for sleepovers. Rylan's mother, Linda Clark, 60 (left), was diagnosed with severe Crohn's disease when she was in her 30s . He said: ‘My mum lost her job because of the disease – it totally dictates her life. ‘When she was diagnosed it really hit her hard because it wasn’t picked up early enough. The earlier you pick it up the easier it is to control. ‘I grew up with the disease as well because she was ill – it is life-threatening. It’s scary.’ 'It could be difficult when I was young because sometimes she couldn’t come on school trips and other times she was so embarrassed about her symptoms that I couldn't have my mates to stay over. The single mother, from Essex, was diagnosed with severe Crohn’s Disease when she was in her early thirties. She has had to undergo multiple operations to remove damaged parts of her bowel and she takes numerous medicines every day. Rylan, 24, said: ‘She tries to keep on top of it and to follow a strict diet but it is always hard to know what foods will cause a flare up.’ Rylan, who won Celebrity Big Brother 2013, says that when he was a child his mother was not able to go on school trips with him . He added: ‘I have always been aware of my mum’s illness but it was when I came into my teens that I realised how serious it was.’ Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition, which affects about one in 1,200 people in the UK, causing inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, although it is most commons in the intestines . It causes symptoms including diarrhoea, intense abdominal pain, weight loss and fatigue. The X Factor finalist says that his mother's life is dictated by the disease and that she has had to undergo multiple bowel operations to relieve the symptoms . The exact cause is not known but it is thought to be genetic and connected to the immune system. It is also known to be exacerbated by smoking. There is currently no cure so medications have to be taken to reduce the symptoms and up to 70 per cent of patients require surgery to repair damaged parts of their digestive system. Some even have to move onto a liquid-only diet if their symptoms are particularly severe. Complications, such as a life-threatening bowel obstruction, can occur. He is helping Crohn's and Colitis UK to raise awareness of the chronic condition - their campaign aims to educate every child and teacher in UK schools about the disease in an attempt to prevent embarrassment . Rylan is aware of the genetic element to Crohn’s disease. He said: ‘I have been tested for it and it is a slight worry but it is my mum that I worry about. ‘I hope that if I get it I will be able to manage it well. I know a lot about it but for now I am happy and healthy.’ Crohn's affects one in every 1,200 people in the UK . The former model is now taking part in an awareness campaign organised by the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK. He said: ‘When I was growing up I thought my mum was the only person with Crohn’s. ‘This campaign is about raising awareness and we are trying to encourage every school in the country to educate the children and teachers about it – children with the condition shouldn’t have to be embarrassed and they shouldn’t have to explain in front of their class why they have to go to the toilet.’ He added: ‘I will do anything I can to help raise awareness. In the public eye it is not a glamorous disease but we want as many people as possible to know about it. ‘We want people not to be embarrassed, it is not a death sentence and it can be managed.’ For more information visit www.meandibd.org .

Tory MP Stewart Jackson claims he is being 'bullied' by the expenses watchdog . A Tory MP is being sued by the expenses watchdog after refusing to hand over the capital gain on his taxpayer-funded second home. Stewart Jackson vowed he will not pay £54,000 – the amount the watchdog said represents his constituency home’s increase in value while he was claiming mortgage interest on his expenses. The news comes after it emerged that MPs have jointly made more than £1 million by selling their second homes. The revelation prompted accusations that MPs were making a profit using taxpayers' money. Mr Jackson, the MP for Peterborough, is the only one of 29 MPs to have refused the demand by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to pay up. The other MPs, including four Cabinet ministers, have agreed to repay a total of £484,828. The money is to cover a proportion of the increased value of their second homes funded by the taxpayer through a mortgage interest subsidy. Welsh Secretary David Jones was forced to repay the most – £81,446 – for a home in London. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond handed over £34,884. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson paid £7,755 and Kenneth Clarke, a minister without portfolio, paid £737. Treasury minister David Gauke repaid £26,762.76, universities minister David Willetts £7,730.74, and former farming minister Sir Jim Paice £9,177.12. During the expenses scandal, a string of MPs were accused of making big financial gains on their second homes. There was public fury over the practice of ‘flipping’ the designation of second homes to claim more taxpayers’ cash and over other abuses. The expenses watchdog Ipsa has reached deals with 70 MPs to repay some of the profit from homes bought with taxpayers' money . IPSA said yesterday that it had launched legal action at the High Court to recover the cash from Mr Jackson. But the MP said he would not pay up . and claimed that his constituency home had fallen in value since he . bought it for £470,000 at the end of 2005. Lorely Burt, Liberal Democrat - £180,000 . Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat - £110,000 . Angela Smith, Labour - £170,000 . Nigel Dodds, Democratic Unionist - £152, 823 . Hazel Blears, Labour - £120,000 . David Gauke, Tory Exchequer Secretary - £67,000 . He accused IPSA of rushing . into ‘heavy-handed and disproportionate’ litigation which was ‘clearly . intended to bully me into submission’. IPSA . banned the use of Commons expenses to pay mortgage interest in May . 2010. But transitional arrangements allowed MPs elected before 2010 to . keep claiming the money up to last August – as long as they agreed to . return any potential capital gain. Martin Bell, the former MP who has campaigned for greater transparency, said that MPs should repay any profit. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It's an open and shut case, of course they should pay it back. 'There is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? In this case they very clearly are.' Mr Jackson said: 'All British citizens are entitled . to seek legal adjudication if the State’s actions are unfair or possibly . illegal and so I will be forcefully resisting their precipitous . litigation.' Martin Bell, a former MP, said MPs should repay any profit they made on their properties . He disputes Ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent. 'At . my own expense, I have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and . I have made a reasonable offer to IPSA to settle the matter and reduce . the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer. 'My . valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the . taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and . 2012, in order to fulfill my duties as both a London based legislator . and a constituency MP. 'IPSA . have negotiated with 70 other MPs in a secretive and arbitrary manner . but in respect of my case, regrettably, they have refused to negotiate. 'I am merely seeking fair play and consistency and will pursue legal action to receive it.' Payback: Treasury minister David Gauke and former farming Sir Jim Paice have returned thousands of pounds . An Ipsa spokesman said: 'One of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where MPs . got taxpayer support to own a second home. That is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so. 'The . final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short . transition period for MPs who were already committed to second . mortgages. 'But in doing . this we set the condition that the taxpayer would want its share of any . increase in the value of the property. Today we are publishing that . these capital gains are worth almost £500,000 to the taxpayer. 'One of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where MPs . got taxpayer support to own a second home. That is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so' - IPSA spokesman . 'MPs . knew this was the deal and agreed to the conditions at the start. In . valuing the property, it was important that we didn't rely on amateur . valuations or guesses from the web. 'Instead, . we demanded formal valuations at the start and end, from the Royal . Institute of Chartered Surveyors - the most authoritative voice in this . field. 'We would only accept valuations from RICS members or fellows - providing proper assurance on the value of the properties. 'We . required all MPs to provide these independent valuations at the start . and end of the claim period. And we published the way in which the . capital gain would be calculated. The same method of calculation has . been applied to all 71 cases. 'Stewart . Jackson provided us with two RICS valuations. As he has been unwilling . to pay the £54,000 due we have issued proceedings to recover the sum . through the High Court.'

It may be impossible to buy an aristocratic pedigree, but you can certainly purchase a home that's fit for a Lord or Lady - as long as you have £15million to spare. Fawsley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Northamptonshire which has housed grandees since Tudor times and once played host to Elizabeth I, has just gone on the market. The luxury Grade I-listed home, which is set in 2,000 acres of grounds partly designed by Capability Brown, is currently used as a hotel and spa which specialises in weddings and fine dining. Grand: Fawsley Hall in Northamptonshire offers the aristocratic lifestyle at a £15million asking price . Antique: The building dates back to the Tudor period and once hosted Elizabeth I . Spectacular: Fawsley is now used as a luxury hotel and wedding venue and is looking for a new owner . Visitors are attracted by the building's extraordinary grandeur - and the chance to sleep in a bed once used by the Tudor queen, for £495 a night. The hotel, which is near Grand Prix venue Silverstone, also boasts modern amenities such as a spa, private cinema and conference centre. The manor at Fawsley dates back as far as the 7th century, when it served as the headquarters for the surrounding area. The estate was mentioned in Domesday Book after the Norman Conquest, but the area received a blow in the 1340s when it was afflicted with the Black Death. Venerable: The history of the home dates back to the 7th century and it is mentioned in Domesday Book . Cosy: The property is now kitted out with modern amenities such as a private cinema and spa . Aristocratic: But the family that owned Fawsley fell on hard times and had to sell off the house . In the 15th century, a member of the Knightly family built the first structure to stand on the footprint of the current Fawsley Hall. Sir Edmund Knightly entertained Elizabeth I at the home after helping her father Henry VIII with the dissolution of the monasteries. However, the family's fortune collapsed in the early 20th century, leading to the contents of the house being auctioned off as distant relatives sold the property to be turned into a hotel. The property is currently owned by entrepreneur Simon Lowe and Indian conglomerate the Poonawalla Group, which also owns Grayshott Hall in Surrey. Suite: The rooms in the current hotel are available to guests for up to £500 a night . Estate: The grounds, partly designed by Capability Brown, extend over 2,000 acres of countryside . It was put on the market yesterday by Christie + Co, which expects it to sell for more £15million. Jeremy Jones, director of corporate hotels, said: 'Sitting just north of the Cotswolds, the sheer quality and luxury of Fawsley Hall's facilities and surroundings, combined with its ease of access to and from London, Oxfordshire and the Cotswolds, means that the hotel has strong year-round corporate, wedding and leisure trade. 'And with its mix of unique historical features with stylish and contemporary facilities, it fully merits its reputation as one of the finest country house hotels in the UK.'","Fawsley Hall in Northamptonshire was once home to Knightly family .

Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm . A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal. Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go. The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000. Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’ The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home. He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29. Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years. The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property. Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him. He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him. ‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again. ‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’ Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse where both burglaries took place, was checking his outbuildings when he came across the intruder. He claimed the man, in his 20s, had a £90 tractor battery and a new sink unit in his arms. Incident: This is farmer Tony Martin's property, who has again been targeted by burglars again. These out buildings were allegedly where the thief was seen . Attempt: The thief allegedly tried to steal a tractor battery before being chased away by Mr Martin . As the burglar fled – dropping the stolen items – Mr Martin said he shouted: ‘Come back again and I’ll sort you my way.’ Yesterday he vowed not to let the burglar get away for a second time. He said: ‘He ran away but I’m convinced he’ll be back in my barn and then he’ll wish he wasn’t.’ He said little had changed to protect homeowners since his imprisonment, saying: ‘I don’t think we’re any safer than we were then. ‘I still feel vulnerable and am unable to properly protect myself.’ Scene: The garden and overgrown Bleak House, where Tony Martin shot three times at two burglars and killed one in 1999 . In October last year, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said householders who react with ‘proportionate’ force when confronted by burglars would receive more legal protection. Last month, a law finally came into force to give householders the right to ‘bash a burglar’, but with a string of exemptions attached. For example, people will not be protected if they chase the burglar outside – and any fight must take place indoors. Yesterday, Mr Martin was said to be so ‘distressed’ by the attempted theft that he sought hospital treatment. He asked officers at Wisbech Police . Station, in Cambridgeshire, to ‘detain’ him for his own protection, . claiming he was suffering from ‘delayed shock’. Mr Martin, who has suffered from . depression in recent years, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in . King’s Lynn, Norfolk, where he was assessed by doctors. Intruders: 16 year old Fred Barras was shot dead by Mr Martin while Brendan Fearon escaped . Later he said: ‘I am here for my own sanity and the safety of burglars. I can’t stand burglars. I think they are a filthy lot.’ Mr Martin said he had suffered similar health issues in May 1999, when he had reported a string of burglaries on his farm. He said police suggested at the time . that the break-ins, which took place two months before he shot Barras, . might be a ‘figment of his imagination’. A spokesman for Norfolk Police said: ‘Inquiries are on-going.’","Claims he chased thief yelling: 'Come back again and I'll sort you my way'

Small catch: But any buyer would not own the surrounding graveyard which would remain open to mourners and have burials for people who have reserved plots .

Unusual: The property boasts traditional iron gates, stained glass windows, a nave and vestry, and is listed as being of Special Architectural and Historic Interest . On the market: The church could be transformed into the ideal home but buyers have been slow in coming forward .

'The sale would not come with the church yard, but they would get a 1.5 metre strip around the building. 'I think it would make a good community use for the village, but also it would make an ideal house, but a sensitive house which would not involve too much alteration to the interior. 'The new owners will have to abide by the covenants - just generally promising to maintain the building and keeping it in good repair.' However, potential buyers have been slow in coming forward because of the unusual nature of the building. Future funerals: The graveyard is near capacity but there are still a few empty plots that have been reserved . Development: The buyer of St Paul's Church would get a 1.5 metre strip of land around the building but the headstones will remain where they are . 'We have had interest, a little bit, but unfortunately so far people haven’t been able to follow it through,' said Mr Williams. 'It is quite a big challenge. It’s quite a long process buying it, and it is quite difficult to find the right buyer who has the patience.' Rev Stephen Ball, the priest in charge of the church, said: 'Until we get all the proposals in we won’t have any idea of its use. 'All I want to see is the people who care about the church be happy about what happens next, and a use for it that will conserve the building and recognise it has been a special place for a lot of people.'

A mother-of-four who found it impossible to lose all her baby weight through healthy diet and exercise alone has launched a line of heat-emitting 'slimwear', her own invention, and one which helped her drop three dress sizes. Farnaz Khan, 33, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, shrunk from a size 14 to an eight after she found a link between weight-loss and heat and began experimenting with enormous underpants and.... clingfilm. She said: 'As you can imagine it wasn't very practical. There were strange noises coming from . around me - yes, it was the clingfilm - so I started looking at the . idea of applying heat into a pair of pants.' Before and after: Farnaz pictured before losing the weight, left, and after, right, when she'd experimented with heat-emitting underwear using big pants and clingfilm . Hot pants: The heat-emitting underwear is today's answer to wrapping yourself in clingfilm, but is much more practical, and wearers are likely to shift up to three dress sizes . Despite having no background in technology, Farnaz continued with her research and came up with Fit Britches, a range of clothing and underwear designed to help slimmers lose inches, reduce signs of cellulite and aid skin elasticity. Including a £34.99 pair of Skinny Knickers. She said: 'When you think about it, exercising is all about heating your core body temperature which, in layman's terms, increases micro-circulation and metabolism that leads to weight loss. 'Fit Britches work through using an innovative fibre and knitting. The special yarn is the key ingredient. 'It emits heat when it comes into contact with the skin - but not enough to be noticed by the wearer - and improves metabolism, blood flow and leads to stimulation of the body's lymphatic draining system to melt away toxins and fat.' Entrepreneur: Farnaz Khan with the weight-loss underpants, part of her Fit Britches range of clothing . Farnaz explained that she originally created the product for herself, but . when people commented on her weight-loss she found she had accidentally . creating a demand for it. Average loss after 60 days: . 'I kept getting approached by family and . friends wanting to know what my slimming secret was,' she said.

The product was tested on 50 women, . aged 20 to 60, all overweight and with sedentary lifestyles, who wore . the pants for eight hours a day over 60 days, without a change in diet . or lifestyle. According to the study, the results . after 60 days, on an average loss basis, were 5in from the waist, 3in . from the hips, 3in from the bottom and 4in from the thighs. The results also show a 92 per cent higher . skin-blood microcirculation, eight per cent more skin elasticity, 11 per . cent improved cellulite signs, nine per cent more collagen synthesis, . 51 per cent better thermoregulation and 33 per cent lower lactate . accumulation. Farnaz - who recommends wearing Fit Britches as part of a healthy regime, incorporating diet and exercise - said: 'I used to hate having my picture . taken,' she said.

Sirens blazing, traffic officer Mark James was in hot pursuit of a speeding driver doing 52mph in a 35mph zone. But Officer James had to abandon the high speed chase - to save a mother and her two ducklings from the road. Footage from the patrol car's dash cam has been posted to YouTube by Portland Police, who may also be hoping that someone will identify the speeding car. Scroll down for video . The chase began when a black car doing 52mph in a 35mph zone sped past Officer Mark James . Officer James put his siren on and gave chase, but quickly had to give up when he spotted the ducks . The mother and her two ducklings waddled in front of the car, unaware that they had just helped an offender . The officer is seen slowing down on NW Bridge Avenue to avoid hitting the family, who waddle around the road blissfully unaware that they have just given avian aid to the offender, who was long gone by the time the chase resumed. Officer James is shown walking towards . the family, and a caption on the video reassured viewers that: 'the duck . family was safely escorted to water in a ditch and swam away'. It added: 'The traffic violator swam away too.' The video ends with a shot of the force's badge and a motto: 'Friends of waterfowl since 1871'. Officer James blocked traffic and got out of the car to usher the ducks to safety . With the ducks swimming away from danger, Officer James headed back to the car, but it was too late to catch the speeding driver . The officer's good deed was largely applauded by the force's Facebook fans when it was posted it to its page. But one Facebook user commented: 'Really? He let a speeder going 17mph OVER the speed limit get away for a duck? Hopefully the speeder didn't cause any accidents and next time he will get a ticket!'

"By . Sandra Howard . PUBLISHED: . 19:30 EST, 14 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:30 EST, 14 May 2013 . As my grandson raced up the drive towards us and hurled himself into Michael’s waiting arms, I looked at my husband’s face and had to catch my breath. As he threw Jasper into the air, the look of utter love and adoration was magical. Why? Well, my husband is notoriously formidable and high-achieving. Michael is a former leader of the Conservative Party — and is remembered for his uncompromising stance on crime and prison reform. Yet these days, he receives the most profound joy from the simple pleasure of lifting a squealing three-year-old into the air (complete with jet engine noises). Devotion: Sandra Howard with her husband Michael and their three-year-old grandson Jasper . Michael has locked horns with the BBC’s chief rottweiler Jeremy Paxman and earned the respect of Margaret Thatcher — no mean feat. But today, give him a jigsaw, a stretch of lawn and a football, or a great cupboard for a game of hide-and-seek, and he shines with a brilliance quite removed from anything seen in his professional life. Little children bring great men down to size. But they also bring out the softest, gentlest — dare I say, the best — side in even the most powerful, formidable males. That’s why, when I saw the photos of Sir Alex Ferguson surrounded by his brood of grandchildren, on the week he announced his retirement from Manchester United, I had to smile. There is something completely entrancing about seeing a powerful man — an Alpha Male, if you will — transformed into a cuddly grandad. But a life as a cuddly grandad is what Michael — and Sir Alex — have worked their whole lives for. This is the down-time they deserve. The football plaudits, the political accolades, the entry in Who’s Who — none of them compare with the satisfaction of being surrounded by people who love you simply for being ‘grandpa’. We have four grandchildren — two from my son (Michael’s stepson) Sholto: Louis, 14, and Tallula, 12, and two from our daughter Larissa: Jasper, three, and Theo, five months. He’s been a terrific grandpa to them all. And — while I adore them all to bits — when it comes to being a doting and devoted  grandparent, my husband has me beaten hands down. Try as I might, I’m far too impatient to get involved in all the games they want to play or answer the endless stream of questions that come from nowhere and go round in circles. Maybe Michael’s better prepared than me: he did study Law at Cambridge, after all, and has sat through endless rounds of debate in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Who would have thought they would provide such good training for grandparenting? Another well-known grandad: Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates with his grandchildren after the club sealed victory in the Barclays Premier League in a match against Swansea last week . As anyone who knows him well will tell you, Michael is one of the most impatient men on Earth. If there’s a book he wants to read, he can’t wait to get his hands on it straight away, often before he’s even sat down. And if he has an appointment to get to, there’s no way he will be late. It’s the one characteristic he deplores in me — I’m the worst timekeeper in the world. But when it comes to his grandchildren, his patience is infinite. While I itch for a distraction, Michael will sit on the floor and fit the same piece of jigsaw into the puzzle over and over again. He has spent endless hours patiently teaching Jasper to throw and catch a ball. When we’re out for a pizza and Jasper’s getting fractious, he knows exactly how to distract him — with a game of pyramids where he’ll put one hand on top of Jasper’s and so on, seeing who can pull their hand out first. If only Jeremy Paxman had been so easy to deal with. We get the most bemused looks from other diners — fascinated that this man they recognise from weighty debates on Newsnight should be such an old softie. Being a grandpa brings out the little boy that lurks in most men. Take the first time Jasper came for a sleepover at our house. He was just two and was beside himself with excitement when Michael promised him a trip on the little steam train that chugs through the Romney Marshes near our home. He was so excited the waiting was torture — for me at least. ‘When are we going on the train?’ Jasper asked at five-minute intervals. ‘Soon,’ I replied with increasing levels of frustration. Michael, however, didn’t turn a hair and cheerfully fielded the same question over and over again. A politician is used to such relentless grilling. I don’t know which of them was more excited as the train finally set off. ‘All aboard,’ Jasper yelled. It took me a few seconds to work out where Jasper had picked up that particular phrase. Then the penny dropped. He’d heard it in the Thomas The Tank Engine stories, which Michael loves to read to him. Another grandfatherly job he fulfils with great aplomb — down to doing all the voices. When Jasper wasn’t yelling ‘all aboard’, he was excitedly pointing out all the sheep in the fields. And, believe me, there were hundreds. ‘Sheep. Sheep,’ he squealed. I was exhausted just listening to it all. But not Michael. Michael revels in being teased. Like most grandparents we have made a habit of telling Jasper that he is a good boy. ‘Very good Jasper,’ we’ll tell him when a job has been well done. Now he loves turning the tables. ‘Very good, Grandpa,’ he will announce when he manages to beat Michael at football. And, yes, my highly competitive husband does allow his three-year-old grandson to beat him sometimes. But that doesn’t mean he’s a total pushover. Jasper adores playing hide-and-seek. Sadly, he’s yet to grasp the concept of hiding. When he stands in the middle of our garden, ‘hiding’ in full view, Michael explains, patiently: ‘No Jasper, that really isn’t hiding you know.’ As a former barrister, even his worst enemy couldn’t accuse Michael of being an intellectual slouch. Yet, despite his powerful intellect, he finds it very easy to get into the mindset of a very small child. When Jasper’s baby brother Theo was born at Christmas, Michael was acutely aware that Jasper might feel jealous. His solution? To give Jasper an extra-special role as a big brother. One of the loveliest things is watching the pair of them plotting how they are going to get the baby up to scratch. A few evenings ago I caught them deep in conversation. ‘Do you think you’ll be able to help me to teach Theo how to throw a ball?’ Michael was asking solemnly. Nodding his head, Jasper looked so proud. But the truth is that Michael has always been a family man. It’s one of the things I love most about him. He took his share of nappy-changing when our two children were babies and I have an image of him winding them over his shoulder while reading government papers, before going off to Parliament with baby sick on the shoulder of his suit. Bruiser: Mr Howard speaks to the House of Commons as leader of the Opposition during PMQs in July 2004 . But now he’s semi-retired, like Sir Alex Ferguson, he at last has time to devote to his family. I know his unbounded adoration of his grandchildren causes some raised eyebrows. For example, as a member of the House of Lords, he was offered two tickets to watch the flotilla for the Queen’s Jubilee last summer: one for a guest, one for a child under five. He was desperate to bring Jasper and was frustrated on being told that, as his grandchild rather than his child, Jasper couldn’t attend. ‘But surely the invitation should apply to grandchildren,’ he argued. ‘After all, how many members of the House of Lords have children under five?’ He won his point and both Larissa and Jasper accompanied him. Jasper spent the entire time on Michael’s shoulders yelling: ‘Come on boats.’ If Michael was proud to be part of the procession that wet and so very British day, he was even prouder to share it with his grandson. I’ve no doubt Lady Ferguson will have plenty of plans for Sir Alex on his retirement. And, as they will discover, the joys of retirement are many. Their hours will be theirs again, and theirs to enjoy, as grandparents. I can’t think of a nicer way to reward a job well done.",Michael Howard's wife Sandra tells how her husband reads Thomas The Tank Engine with aplomb .

The past 75 years has seen it all: man walking on the moon, the first female Prime Minister, hemlines rising and falling, recessions, more recessions and plenty of Royal celebrations. But according to nostalgic Brits, nothing can trump the music, fashion and sporting successes of the Sixties as they vote it the best of all the past eight decades. Three quarters of those polled cited the music scene as the reason they would love to have lived in - or are glad they experienced - the Swinging Sixties, while the next biggest group named culture, fashion and sporting events as the reason they rate the Sixties. The Sixties music scene, led by Liverpudlian band The beatles, is the reason why 84% of people voted for the 60¿s as the best decade to live in . The study, which asked Brits to recall their fondest iconic moments and memories from the past eight decades, found that with 40 per cent of the votes, Sixties legends The Beatles are unrivalled when it comes to best British band. Queen and The Rolling Stones are next in line. Even the younger generations quizzed are fans of Sixties music too, with over a quarter of 18-24-year-olds voting for The Beatles over new bands. Top look: The miniskirt, as made famous by Twiggy and Mary Quant was named as one of the  nation's fashion favourites of the past 75 years . When it comes to sporting victories, even after a spectacular summer of sport in 2012, almost a third of the nation still hold onto the 1966 Football World Cup win as the greatest sporting moment of the past 75 years. Would you rather be living in the Sixties than today? 1984 Winter Olympic winners Torvill & Dean, perhaps surprisingly, skated into second position, eclipsing other Olympic legends such as Sir Steve Redgrave and our 2012 hero, Bradley Wiggins. And as for fashion favourites, the miniskirt, ‘Little Black Dress’ and bikini are the nation’s highest rated looks of the past 75 years - although men were six times more likely to vote for the bikini, and twice as likely to vote for the miniskirt than women. The survey, conducted by Nescafé Original to celebrate its 75th anniversary, also found that the Little Black Dress, elevated to iconic status by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany’s, is the undisputed fashion favourite of women, suggesting a true classic will stand the test of time and remain iconic for generations to come.

As far as the men of RAF 617 squadron were aware, the piece of paper pinned to the noticeboard in May 1943 was simply a list of those required for a night training run. But the 133 names on 'Night Flying Programme. 16.5.43.' were destined to play a crucial role in the war, as they had actually been assigned to fly in the Dambusters raid. The battle order document - which lists the names of all the crew in 19 Lancaster bombers who were to take part in the pivotal operation to flood the industrial heartland of Germany - is one of only two known to exist, and is set for auction tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the legendary attack. It belonged to Air Commodore John Whitworth who, after the successful mission, put a poignant pencilled line through eight of the bombers that were lost. Although they would not know until the last minute, the 133 names of RAF crewmen on 'Night Flying Programme. 16.5.43.' had been assigned to fly in the Dambusters raid. Of the 19 bombers, eight were downed, indicated by a pencil line just through the captain's name, as was common practice. The three waves of attack were marked as Red I, Grey II and White III. The numbers to the right of each row show the time the planes returned to base . A group picture of the Dambusters squadron. It was only four hours before the 19 planes took off for Germany's Ruhr valley that the crews were informed of their mission, codenamed Operation Chastise . It was common practice to only pencil out the name of the captain to signify a downed bomber - each containing a crew of seven. For security reasons, only a handful of senior officers knew the details and objective of the mission until the last moment. So secret were the plans that the battle order pinned up on the RAF noticeboard that day was entitled 'Night Flying Programme' to make it appear to the men it was a normal training run. It was only four hours before the 19 planes took off for Germany's Ruhr valley that the crews were informed of their mission, codenamed Operation Chastise. The first name on the sheet of paper was legendary Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who led the squadron and was told about the raid three days before. Using the bouncing bomb invented by engineer Dr Barnes Wallis, seven Lancasters struck the Mohne and Eder dams, causing catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories. On his copy of the flying programme, Air Cdre Whitworth noted the times eight of the 11 bombers returned to RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with Gibson's plane being the penultimate one at 4.15am. The first name on the sheet of paper was legendary Wing Commander Guy Gibson (left), who led the squadron and was told about the raid three days before. Right, an aerial reconnaissance photo taken on May 17, 1943 showing the breach in the Mohne Dam in the Ruhr valley caused by 617 Squadron's raid during the previous night . Only one other copy of the battle order document is known to exist today and that is held at the RAF museum in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and does not include any personal annotations on it. Although the mission was hailed a success, 53 crew members were lost and three were taken prisoner of war. The document is being sold tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the Dambusters' raid after being put up for auction by the son of a late RAF flyer. Wing Commander John Bell, 90, flew with 617 Squadron after Operation Chastise. He said: 'There weren't many copies of these night flying programmes printed. 'One would have been on the officers' ops board and another on the NCOs' board. 'The . men had been practising low-level night flying for several weeks before . the dams raid but had no idea what or when the mission was. 'The programme document would have been pinned up during the day but Bomber Command only gave the clearance for Operation Chastise at 4.45pm. 'The first Lancaster took off at 9.30pm. In between the two times, the men would have had briefings. The routes were already planned and the navigators had to plot them on their maps. 'Guy Gibson led the way. He bombed the Mohne dam first and then directed other aircraft circling to go in and drop their bombs. He then ordered the aircraft to go to the Eder dam and attack that. 'The times back and the losses would have been officially recorded but clearly this was Whitworth's own personal record.' The 13in by 8in sheet of paper was later mounted in the the frame. At some point, it was donated to a museum, possible at RAF Marham, Cambridgeshire, as wording on the frame states the item had been kindly loaned by the executors of the late Air Cdre Whitworth. Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter auctioneers of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, said: 'It is being sold by the son whose father served in the RAF. Sadly, he doesn't know where or how his father acquired it. 'There is one copy of this document at the Grantham museum and this one was clearly made at the same time as it is in the same print and had identical folds, which would suggest the two documents were folded together.' The document has a pre-sale estimate of £1,500. The Daily Mail's front page from May 19 1943, which carried reports of the Dambusters raid under the headline: 'Heart of Ruhr Flooded' The RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, a Lancaster bomber, will perform a fly-past of a Derbyshire reservoir at around 12.50pm on Thursday. The plane, Britain's last operational Lancaster, will be joined by two Spitfires and two . Tornados from today’s 617 Squadron for three spectacular runs down the Derwent Valley and strafe the . Derwent Dam - just as Gibson and his men did so many times in those . ‘bloody dangerous’ training runs. Earlier on, the devoted locals who run the little dam . museum will also be holding their annual memorial service. More than 400 veterans are also expected to gather at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, where the Dambusters squadron was based. Among them will be members of Gibson’s family along with two veterans of the raid, and the daughter of bouncing bomb inventor Barnes Wallis. On Friday, there will be an international service at Lincoln Cathedral. But thanks to the health-and-safety brigade, few members of the public will be able to be there, too. Severn Trent Water, which owns the dam, and other public sector ‘stakeholders’ have decreed heavy traffic on country lanes would pose an unacceptable threat to the emergency services.

A teenager in California who only knew the first name of a girl who posted suicidal thoughts online has saved her life after calling police and sparking an against-the-clock search. Jackie Rosas, from Cathedral City, California, alerted her local authorities at 5pm on May 6 after she saw the girl write on Tumblr, a social networking site, that she was going to kill herself. Armed with just the girl's first name, local police and school staff carried out tireless web sleuthing to uncover the identity of the girl - who was found in Union Township, New Jersey eight hours later. The 16-year-old girl, who has not been named, was found unconscious after consuming a large quantity of pills, taken to a medical facility and put on a psychiatric hold, according to police reports. Haunting message: Jackie Rosas, 18, saw a message on Tumblr from a 16-year-old girl saying she was going to kill herself and contacted police. After eight hours, they found the girl in New Jersey . 'I kind of cried,' Rosas said. 'I was . happy to know that I saved someone's life. It happened at random and . it's an amazing feeling knowing you are able to help someone from . thousands of miles away.' Rosas knew the claims were serious; she had been following the stranger's Tumblr posts for about a year and had witnessed her receiving bullying messages from other users. 'She blogged, saying she was going to . end her life,' Rosas told USA Today. 'She had . been fighting this depression, and when she posted that, my instinct . was that she was serious. 'She wrote something like: ""I'm going to kill . myself. There is no other option"".' Rosas immediately contacted a suicide hotline, but they told her to contact police, where she spoke with patrol Officer Kelly Nava, a 14-year veteran of the department. Sleuth: A high school officer Heather Olsen used social media to help track down the girl 2,000 miles away . All Rosas could so was give the girl's first name and a link to her blog. The only lead it gave to the girl's identity was that she was a color guard at her school. 'It was really nothing to start with,' Nava said. 'My first thought was to run [the girl's] age and name . through our local system... and it came back with so many matches.' She contacted Officer . Heather Olsen, a school resource officer from Cathedral City High . School, in case the girl attended the school - but the officer did not . recognize her. To be certain, Olsen then sent the details to Cathedral City High Assistant Principal Karen Dimick, who also didn’t recognize the girl - but who began her own web sleuthing. Making the call: She contacted Cathedral City police department, pictured, who began internet sleuthing along with local teachers - before they tracked down the girl's last name . 'We were kind of at a dead end,' Olsen said - until the assistant principal messaged her back to say she . had found a Twitter account matching the girl's picture and that she had . found her last name. 'She sent me the link and I just went to town,' Olsen said. Olsen trawled through Twitter posts, YouTube videos and online articles. She eventually came across a newspaper article mentioning a marching band that the girl had written about in one of her tweets. It said the band was in Union Township, New Jersey - finally giving authorities a name and location. Olsen called Nava, from the Cathedral .

She had taken enough pills for authorities to put her on a psychiatric hold, Cathedral City Police records noted. The women in California - Nava, Olsen, Dimick and Rosas - said they were left speechless by the news. When Nava learned of the recovery, she got 'the chills', she said. 'Life is so precious,' Olsen added. 'It is worth every effort to save.'","Jackie Rosas, 18, read the girl's suicidal message on her Tumblr blog .

There is a blog dedicated to her immaculate style and a Twitter account keeping you informed of her sartorial selections. But if that's still not enough information about Michelle Obama's clothes and you want even more immediate access to her wardrobe, you'll thrill at the arrival of a new smartphone fashion app. Following in the wake of her successful Duchess of Cambridge app Kate's Style List, Birmingham-based developer and clothes-lover Helen Barclay has created Michelle's Stye List, a 69p (99 cents) programme enabling you to emulate the dress sense of America's First Lady of Fashion. If you love the style of Michelle Obama, left, you'd be wise to download Michelle's Style List, created by Helen Barclay, right . President Obama's wife recently topped the first Sunday Times Best Dressed list, and she is universally regarded as one of the most elegant women in the world. Some of the mother-of-two's favourite designers and brands include Jason Woo, Isabel Toledo, Roksanda Ilincic, Michael Kors, Narciso and J-Crew. And now you can be the first to know which she has chosen to step out in whenever she leaves the White House. Helen, a former actress, said: 'Michelle Obama has a huge following in the US. She sells out clothes in the same way Kate Middleton does, and like the Duchess of Cambridge she recycles lots of her clothes. 'It is mainly aimed at the American market but I hope it will work here too.' The app was launched last week and features spring, summer, autumn and winter collections of all of the First Lady's outfits. Helen Barclay's app can be downloaded on iPad or iPhone and provides you with instant information about the sartorial style of First Lady Michelle Obama . The app describes what she is wearing, and each item is hyper-linked to take you directly to a page where you can buy or learn where to buy it. Helen, 28, said: 'She is a role model in America - the whole family is. They are massive. They are the most important and powerful family in the world. She does lots of good things for people. 'Michelle dresses very appropriately, in that her outfit always reflects the occasion. She was seen recently at a sports day at a school wearing a track suit. Equally, at an event over Easter she was dressed in a very elegant dress. 'Whenever she appears at various events the app will tell you exactly what clothes she is wearing.' Michelle Obama recently topped the Sunday Times best dressed list, and now Helen Barclay's app will teach you how to get her immaculate look . Helen has given up her career on the dramatic stage to concentrate on digital apps following the success of the first app, which helps savvy shoppers create the Kate look. She is hoping Michelle's Style List will be equally popular. 'It's only been a week but so far it's been going really well,' she added. Just like the Kate app, Helen developed her own programme to track and locate Michelle's fashion finds, and she keeps her users updated 24 hours a day. Users can browse Michelle's favourite designers, compile lists of their favourite outfits, search by accessories and then find out where to purchase her most popular high street items. Helen graduated from Hull University with a degree in theatre studies in 2005, and began acting in both TV commercials and on the stage.

Paedophile: David Cameron, who had sex with two young girls after giving them drink and drugs, has been jailed for ten years . A predatory paedophile who had sex with two young girls after giving them drink and drugs has been jailed for ten years. David Cameron, 48, was said to have put candles and rose petals in his bathroom in an attempt to seduce one of the girls. He was convicted by a jury of sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl when she was drunk and he had given her drugs. He also had sex with her in the grounds of a school late at night in the summer of 2009. Cameron, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, threatened the 13-year-old that her family would come to harm if she told anyone what he had done. He also abused a 15-year-old girl after he gave her neat vodka one night in October 2012. He followed her upstairs and had sex with her as she lay on a bed. Both girls had to give evidence at his trial after he denied any wrongdoing. He was found guilty of five charges of sexual activity with a child - one offence against the 13-year-old girl and the rest involving his 15-year-old victim. At Bradford Crown Court yesterday, Judge Robert Bartfield said Cameron 'wormed his way into their confidence' and that both girls were vulnerable and had troubled backgrounds. 'She [the 13-year-old] was virtually incapable of resistance and this came as near to rape as can possibly be imagined,' Judge Bartfield said. 'They have been significantly traumatised by these events.' After the case, PC Andy Teale, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'Cameron attempted to gain the trust of his victims through association. 'He took advantage of their vulnerability, supplying them with both alcohol and drugs. 'These two young victims are now left to battle with the consequences of Cameron's depraved actions. Scene: Cameron was said to have put candles and rose petals in the bathroom at his home (pictured), in Keighley, in an attempt to seduce one of the girls . 'The sentence really reflects the seriousness of this man's behaviour and the threat that he posed to those around him. 'I sincerely hope that the outcome will now provide an opportunity for the victims to find some closure.' Cameron must sign the sex offenders' register for life and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order protects his victims and other young girls from him in the future.","Paedophile David Cameron jailed after having sex with two young girls .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 16 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 16 May 2013 . The mother of a two-year-old girl, who was still in the womb when her policeman father died on a drunken night out, has started a legal battle on their daughter's behalf to claim child maintenance from the Metropolitan Police. Lawyers for toddler Tabitha Oxer-Patey say Scotland Yard's decision not to grant her a share of Richard Oxer's pension violates her human rights and discriminates against her as a child of unmarried parents. An inquest into the death of PC Oxer, 31, heard he had drunk at least seven pints of lager with a 'half cut' group, including fellow officers, in June 2010, when he died after falling down a flight of stairs in a central London pub. Tragedy: Richard Oxer (right) died in 2010 while partner Theresa Patey (left) was pregnant with their daughter Tabitha, now two . His partner Theresa Patey of Ashford, Middlesex, was four and a half months pregnant at the time. Mr Oxer had been a police officer for six years and was stationed with the Met's territorial support group. Claim: Some of football mad Richard Oxer's police pension should go towards supporting his child, his partner has claimed . The couple's then unborn daughter, Tabitha - who was delivered on November 10, 2011 - made a claim to the Met through her mother last year for entitlement to an allowance from her father's pension. Any 'natural child' of a serving police officer is usually automatically entitled to support from his pension fund following his death, so long as he is still with the force when he dies. However the company that handles pension pay-outs for the Met rejected Tabitha's claim last year, citing the highly unusual combination of her having not yet been born when her father died, as well as the fact that her parents were not married or in a civil partnership. Through her mother, Tabitha has now launched a landmark legal battle to claim her 'inheritance'. Her lawyers' claim that the decision was unlawful raises important questions about the rights of unborn children and unmarried couples. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe, who recorded a verdict of accidental death in September 2010, said of the accident at O'Neills, in Wardour Street: 'Mr Oxer went out with friends and tragically fell. He suffered a significant injury on both sides of his brain.' The coroner heard that Mr Oxer had visited several bars on June 21 with friends and had drunk at least seven pints of lager before taking a taxi to central London. Having ordered another round of drinks, the group, who were described a 'half-cut', went up to the roof terrace where they could smoke. It was on the way back downstairs that Mr Oxer fell and hit his head 'extremely hard', according to witnesses. Ben Cooper, Tabitha's barrister, argues in a writ issued against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner at London's High Court that the refusal of support from her father's pension is discriminatory and breaches her right to respect for family life. He argues that those parts of the Police Pension Fund Regulations which are said to exclude Tabitha from financial support - because she was born out of wedlock after her father's death - are 'incompatable' with the European Convention on Human Rights. High Court: The legal battle is a key test case, as it could allow others to claim financial support for children not born until after their parent had died . Seeking a court declaration that Tabitha is entitled to a 'child survivors pension', the barrister states: 'Such a pension is analogous to a right of inheritance.' He adds: 'The basis for such a refusal was an assertion (that), for child allowance to be payable, the child must have been born before the police officer ceased serving as an officer or passed away'. Mr Cooper says that, under the regulations, a surviving natural child of a police officer, born before his death, is entitled to financial support, but that 'a child born after he dies is excluded from such an entitlement unless the officer was married to or in a civil partnership with the child's mother. 'The effect of (the regulations) is to discriminate against an illegitmate child born after the death of a serving police officer, compared with a legitimate child born in the same circumstances. There is no rational or legitimate justification for such discrimination,' he claims. 'Discrimination on grounds of birth, including illegitimacy, in relation to any convention right is prohibited by article 14 of the convention,' the barrister states. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the claims in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. However Mr Cooper says that the case is 'unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact'. Mr Oxer was a Tottenham Hotspur fan who played for two football teams, AFC Old Bank and Kingston Police FC. He was also a dog-lover and had three lurchers.","Tabitha Oxer-Patey was in her mother's womb when PC Richard Oxer died .

Four hackers who believed they were 'latter day pirates' caused tens of millions of pounds worth of damage in cyber attacks on the CIA, the Pentagon, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and even the NHS. The members of notorious hacker group Lulzsec hijacked computers to attack major businesses including Sony, the Pentagon and newspaper publisher News International in an attack in February 2011. The attacks led to sensitive personal information being leaked online, leaving victims open to fraud. They even attacked the US X Factor contestant data base. Lulzsec members: Ryan Cleary, 21, left (file photo), and A-level student Mustafa Al-Bassam who have admitted their role in bringing down websites which caused tens of millions of pounds worth of damage . The group who caused IT chaos at huge organisations include an A-level student in Peckham, south London, and a 20-year old working from his bedroom in the remote Shetland Islands. The gang wreaked havoc by using 'zombie' computers known as a 'botnet' to launch 'distributed denial of service' attacks. They work by overwhelming servers with useless data and flooding computers with traffic so they crash. The court was told this 'is the internet version of causing a traffic jam' and is used to disable websites. Other high-profile victims who have fallen prey to the shady online outfit included film studios 20th Century Fox, the Arizona State Police and the NHS. Once inside the sites they made unauthorised modifications, including adjustments to security settings, control of access to and distribution of confidential data, and re-directing visitors to websites hosted by hackers. Ryan Cleary, 21, Jake Davis, 20, Ryan Ackroyd, 26, Mustafa Al-Bassam, 18, all appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today having earlier pleaded guilty to various hacking offences. Hacking: Jake Davis, 20, from the Shetland Isles, left, and Ryan Ackroyd, right, arrive at the court today . The court heard how Davis, Ackroyd and Al-Bassam were 'core members' of the international hacking group along with a fourth man known as 'Sabu' convicted in America. They cost companies and state agencies tens of millions of pounds by attacking their websites. Sandip Patel, prosecuting, said: 'The defendants are colloquially known as cyber attackers based in the UK and elsewhere and they waged what was an undoubtedly sophisticated and orchestrated campaign between February and September 2011. 'They achieved extensive national and international notoriety and publicity. They caused unprecedented harm to their victims. 'They saw themselves as latterday pirates. They identified vulnerable computer systems, when they found them they would break into them and pillage them. 'Whatever their motivation, their criminal actions were premeditated, deliberate and extensive. They are at the cutting edge of the contemporary species of international criminal offending referred to as cyber crime.' The name Lulzsec is a combination of . 'lulz' or 'lols', meaning 'laugh out loud' and security, and was a . direct descent of notorious hacking group Anonymous. Police probe: The detached home in Wickford, Essex, where Ryan Cleary was arrested by police in 2011 as officers launched an investigation into Lulzsec hacking . The group researched and targeted vulnerable websites and Cleary provided a sophisticated botnet server which was able to power their denial of service attacks. Jake Davis, nicknamed 'Topiary', was the brains behind the group's communications strategy which he ran from his bedroom in the Shetlands. He ran their website, LulzSec Security, and Twitter feed where he boasted about the attacks the gang had waged and said 'we are Gods now'. The court heard how Cleary, nicknamed 'Viral' was not a core member of Lulzsec but pined to be accepted by the group. He let them use his botnet - a 'web robot' that he had spent six years building and which powered the denial of service attacks. Mother's anguish: Cleary's mother Rita leaves court following an earlier hearing . Mr Patel said: 'At any one time he had up to 100,000 computers directly and actively under his control.' Cleary, from Wickford, Essex, was 'trigger happy' and pocketed up to £3,000 a month by letting other people use his botnet, the court heard. Among its victims was the US Pentagon which had to fork out $120,000 to repair its computer system. Ryan Ackroyd, 26, from Doncaster, masqueraded online as a 16-year-old girl called Kayla and was 'probably the most sophisticated known conspirator', the court heard. He was responsible for researching sites to target and was known as a 'highly sophisticated rooter'. A-level student Al Bassam, of Peckham, southeast London, known as 'T-flow' was a technical mastermind who sought out vulnerable wesbites the gang could target. In one attack he published data from Sony which cost the company an estimated $20m. While in another attack in May 2011 the gang hacked US network Fox and uploaded the personal details of 74,000 people who had registered to appear on X-Factor. Al Bassam previously admitted two counts of conspiring to do an unauthorised act with intent, or reckless as to, impairing the operation of computer. He also pleaded guilty to a longer-running hacking campaign that saw data stolen from the systems of organisations including 20th Century Fox, Nintendo, the NHS, and the Arizona State Police. Fellow conspirators Ryan Ackroyd, 26, from Doncaster, and Jake Davis, 20, and Ryan Cleary, 21 have pleaded guilty to taking part in cyber attacks. Davis and Cleary had both earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to do an unauthorised act or acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing, the operation of a computer or computers. Ackroyd admitted hacking into a series of organisations' computer systems between February 1, 2011, and September 2 the same year. In a separate case, Cleary had earlier pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children and possessing indecent images of children. The sentencing continues.","Group included an A-level student and a 20-year-old working in his bedroom .

Scores of abandoned gas masks covering a shop floor, rusted carriages of a motionless big wheel, neglected wallpaper falling off the wall of an empty family home... These haunting images offer a rare glimpse into the life that stopped still in Chernobyl and neighbouring city Pripyat 27 years ago, when a test at a nuclear power reactor went wrong. It was the worst nuclear disaster in history, and so dangerous was the fallout that the Ukrainian government evacuated 350,000 residents, creating an Exclusion Zone where time has stood still ever since. Scores of abandoned gas masks cover the floor of what may have been a shop in Pripyat, a once-thriving town of 50,000 people near the Ukrainian border with Belarus . Time has stood still at this fairground ride that once echoed to children's laughter: Now rusted and blackened, it serves as a bleak memorial to long-gone families . Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from the exclusion zone, leaving behind homes into which they had invested time, money and love . Most people are barred from living in the zone, named the Alienation Zone, which covers an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant, to protect them from the effects of any lingering radiation.  A few residents refused to leave, and a handful of older residents have moved back to be close to family graves, but the area is mostly uninhabited and has now reverted to forests. Tourists may obtain day passes, and workers who are rebuilding the damaged sarcophagus are allowed in for limited hours only each month.  Scientists the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years. Earlier this month, photographer Hélène Veilleux was allowed in, and spent four days photographing the irradiated ruins of the towns where hundreds of thousands of families once lived, worked and died. These astonishing photographs document what she saw on her journey from Chernobyl to Pripyat. The public swimming baths would once have resonated to shrieks from excited children - the now-drained pool has not been swum in for decades . The Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986, was the worst nuclear accident in history, killing 64 and leaving many thousands more with long-term effects including cancer and deformities . Brightly painted tanks, their guns crossed, stand unused in the Chernobyl Zone of Alienation, 27 years after a test at the nuclear reactor went so disastrously wrong . Large public buildings are now simply falling apart: ceiling tiles have dropped off and smashed, wall claddings have slid down . The schoolchildren who were evacuated in the aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor are now adults . This photograph shows how vast strip lights dangle precariously, still attached by wires to the ceilings they were nailed to more than quarter of a century ago . While people have been forced out of the exclusion zone, nature - including deer - has regained control, with much of it reverting to forest . What looks like a school common room or hospital waiting room is a shell of its former self- chairs still in rows are covered with dust and fallen plasterwork . The fabric of both public and private buildings is slowly rotting as the vast, 1000sq mile zone of alienation is gradually reclaimed by nature . Trees sprout between paving slabs as nature gradually regains the upper hand over the exclusion zone - experts estimate it will not be habitable for another 20,000 years . The explosion and subsequent fire at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere . The disaster began at Chernobyl reactor number four, when a power surge occurred during a systems test, causing a series of steam explosions and a fire which sent a plume of radioactive material into the air . A gas mask would have provided little protection to the people of Chernobyl and Pripyat, many of whom suffered cancers and deformities as a result of the radiation released in the accident . Very few people enter the Chernobyl exclusion zone - a handful of people refused to leave, and some elderly people moved back to be near graves, but the zone is largely desolate .","Photographer Hélène Veilleux was allowed into the Zone Of Alienation surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear plant .

A schoolboy killed himself after listening to death metal on his iPod, an inquest has heard. Truman Edley, who was just 15 at the time of his death, hanged himself in the hallway of the family home in Rotherham after he had been listening to the violent music. A coroner refused to name the band he was listening to or publish the extreme lyrics which formed part of the evidence at the inquest in Rotherham. The official also noted that Truman had been suffering from a number of problems, and his mother said that he had 'self-esteem' issues. The teenager, who was named after American indie band Trumans Waters, frequently listened to death metal through headphones. His mother Nicola discovered his body at their home in November 2011, two months after she had found him sobbing in his bedroom wardrobe. On another occasion, she found scratches on his arm - he said that he had done it while messing around in the woods, but two friends asked him to visit a youth support service, fearing he had been self-harming. Mrs Edley described her son as 'loving' and said he was fiercely protective of his loved ones. 'He was one of the most kind, loving and caring people,' she said. 'We told each other that we loved each other every day. 'He became a stereotypical teenager, like the Harry Enfield character Kevin. He was more interested in spending time with friends and took increasing pride in his appearance.' But she added: 'His self-esteem was low. He didn't like himself or they way he looked very much. On the outside he showed a lot of confidence, but on the inside he was a lot more sensitive.' Violent: The coroner at the hearing in a Rotherham court, pictured, refused to read out the death metal lyrics . Coroner Fred Curtis, who recorded a verdict of suicide at the inquest in Rotherham, commented on Truman's musical tastes saying: 'I'm not going to read the lyrics out, all I will say about them is they are extremely dark in content. 'They certainly deal with dark matters and, in some respects, seem to glorify death to some degree. 'It's also the view of the police officers in this case and Truman's mother who, not surprisingly was unaware of the content until after his death. 'Whatever the influences, I think it right that one can say there was no appreciation by anyone of the extent of his troubles and problems. 'There may be other factors behind these problems but I think the only person who can answer for those is Truman himself.' PC Glyn Farrell, who attended the scene of the death, said he was a fan of death metal but admitted it could be depressive. 'I do listen to that sort of music myself, which has a lot of screaming with heavy guitar sounds,' he told the hearing. 'It can have an effect on people.' Det Sgt Peter Hogson told the coroner: 'There seemed to be two Trumans. The outgoing one was a happy, bubbly joker who would make people laugh, was very well-liked and had a wide group of good friends. 'But then there seemed to be another, more fragile and sensitive individual who kept things from his family and bottled them up.' Toxicology tests came back negative, and although a scribbled note was found at the scene it was unclear when it had been written.","Truman Edley, 15, found hanged in hallway of family home by mother .

A mother accused of murdering five people by setting fire to a pushchair outside their front door said that the person who started the blaze was ‘beyond evil’. Melanie Smith, pictured for the first time arriving at court yesterday, denied killing the three children and two adults because she was fed up with the buggy being left outside her own front door, adding that she was ‘not that kind of person’. Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her son Charlie, aged 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, died in the fire at the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, north Wales. Miss Shiers’s partner, Liam Timbrell, 23, died in hospital a fortnight later. 'I'm not that kind of person': Melanie Smith arrives at Mold Crown Court today before taking the stand to deny starting a house fire which killed five members of the same family . Mold Crown Court has heard that Smith – a heavy drinking, jobless mother of five who lived in the flat below – started the fire after a row with Miss Shiers over the pushchair. Smith, who lived in the flat below the victims in Maes y Groes, Prestatyn, denies five counts of murder at Mold Crown Court. Under cross examination from Ian Murphy QC, for the prosecution, Smith denied that she was a murderer. Mr Murphy said Smith, an alcoholic, had been 'drunk and angry' at Ms Shiers and had told numerous friends that she intended to burn her house down with children in it. Mr Murphy said: 'I suggest to you that it was very easy for you to carry out this terrible, wicked deed of setting fire to the pushchair with a lighter.' Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth. All three of them died in the fire . Skye Allen, aged two years, and Bailey . Allen, four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in . Prestatyn, North Wales . Fire deaths: Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze . Smith replied: 'That is crazy. You are twisting things.' Mr Murphy accused Smith of using her boyfriend Steven Clarkson to establish a false alibi. He said Smith got into bed with Clarkson after setting fire to the pram so she could then pretend to be a victim. 'Once you started that fire, you then started your great big lie, by suggesting you are an innocent victim,' Mr Murphy said. Smith said: 'That's wrong.' Mr Murphy said: 'It was started deliberately by you and you in effect stage managed your exit from the property.' 'No chance,' Smith replied. Mr Murphy added: 'After six weeks or . more of threats to torch or burn their property with children inside, . that's exactly what you did.' Smith denied this, leading Mr Murphy to add: 'And you did so with deadly intent and to deadly effect.' Smith said: 'No, that's not true. I'm not that kind of person.' Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year . During her trial, which started on April 10, the court was played a harrowing 999 call in which Mr Timbrell shouted: 'Oh my god, oh my god, we're going to die.' The jury was also told that Mr Timbrell later told rescuing paramedics that 'it was arson' and 'it was Mel' and that he had heard Smith shouting threats about burning the house down that night. Mr Murphy said Mr Timbrell had heard Smith's 'easily recognisable voice'. 'He heard what he was later to tell other people. He heard from you your deadly threat. I am going to set fire to the house,' Mr Murphy said. Smith, wearing glasses and with blonde hair tied back, responded: 'I didn't say anything like that. Someone has taken them all away and I am getting the blame for it.' 'He said, 'it was Mel', because he heard you,' Mr Murphy said. Smith replied: 'No.' Mr Murphy said Smith was 'drunk and angry' on the night in question. In the dock: Smith is flanked by two security officers earlier in the hearing . Angry about her relationship with Mr Clarkson, whom she had accused of cheating on her, and angry at Ms Shiers for leaving the pushchair in the hallway, being noisy and being 'a scruffy dirty bitch', the court heard. He said Smith set the fire 'in a rage' after hearing Ms Shiers and Mr Timbrell having sex upstairs. Mr Murphy said: 'You told the jury that you heard Lee-Anna making love upstairs. Is that what prompted you to go and set this fire?' Smith said: 'No it was not.' The court has heard from a number of witnesses who claim to have heard Smith making drunken threats to burn peoples' houses down 'with their children inside' and Mr Murphy said the defendant had a 'tendency' to do this when she was drunk. Smith denied ever setting any fire or making threats and added: 'I would never burn anyone. You have got to be pretty sick and crazy and beyond evil to do something like this.' Mr Murphy then asked her if she thought all the witnesses in the case were lying and she responded: 'Yeah they are. Everybody wants justice and they are all looking at me and I am innocent. I have done nothing.' Mr Murphy said it was Smith's intention to 'kill everybody in the upstairs flat' and said Smith knew Ms Shiers regularly had more than one child staying over. Smith replied: 'I don't think so. I would never ever harm anyone in that way. What I have heard in court, I am distraught myself. God knows what the family is going through.' The trial continues.

As generations of parents will gladly testify, bath time often turns into a battleground when toddlers are involved. And as these adorable pictures show, it’s not just human babies who get all steamed up when it’s time to take a dip. Two-year-old Mr Bernie — one of 330 orphaned apes at the Orangutan Care Centre and Quarantine in Borneo — will do just about anything to avoid taking a plunge. With four strong hands able to firmly grasp the sides of the bath, getting him into the warm, soapy water can be a soggy struggle.

In the wild, orangutans usually shy away from water, preferring to keep themselves and their babies clean through picking out bugs and dirt with their long fingers. But at the orphanage there are no ape mums to help out. Some toddler apes — such as Charlie, pictured here in a green towel — are fans. Mister Bernie, however, is not. He was brought to the orphanage in July 2010. A spokesman from the centre said: ‘He was a scrawny, scared little thing with hair matted from sticky sap. After a long bath, some motherly attention, and countless bananas, Mr Bernie started thriving  in his new home. He is now strong, healthy and handsome.’ The centre was set up in 1998 to help orphaned and rescued orangutans learn the skills they need to live independently in the wild. Located in the village of Pasir Panjang near Tanjung Puting National Park, a team of surrogate human mums live with the youngsters day and night. Each day, the orphans are taken into the . 200 acre forest surrounding the centre where they forage, play and hunt, . carefully watched by their carers.

She was rescued from a worker at a palm oil plantation who was keeping her as a pet. When she arrived at the centre a year ago, aged 12 months, she was half the size of a healthy orangutan of her age. Mr Bernie has altogether more confidence.

The new lawyer for the widow of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect insists that she will co-operate with the investigation into the terrorist atrocity. Joshua Dratel, who has represented several terrorism suspects, joined the legal team of Katherine Russell, who was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, last week. She has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but the FBI are currently interrogating her to find out if she had any clue as to her husband's plans. Co-operating: Katherine Russell, the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is talking to police . The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, are believed to have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs. Mr Dratel, from New York, today said that he joined Russell's legal team to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating. 'I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.' Interrogation: Russell, pictured last month, has been talking to FBI officials investigating the attack . Dzhokhar, 19, is in a prison hospital facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan, 26, died on April 19 after a shootout with police. Russell, 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed. She has reverted to using her maiden name, switching from her married name of Tsarnaeva. Atrocity: The bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last month killed three people and injured 260 . Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it. Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.","Katherine Russell's new lawyer Joshua Dratel speaks about case .

"By . David Martosko and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:30 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:54 EST, 4 May 2013 . The once-secret identities of the three Benghazi 'whistle-blowers' have been revealed just days before they were set to testify at a congressional hearing about the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Libya. On Wednesday, the three State Department officials will appear on Capitol Hill before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to talk about the September 11, 2012, assault on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Fox News revealed Saturday that the key witnesses are: Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya. Scroll down for video . First hearing: Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, testifies on Capitol Hill on October 10 . Wintess: Gregory N. Hicks, a veteran officer of the Foreign Service - was in Tripoli on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens . For Nordstrom, the upcoming hearing would not be the first time that he was called to testify on the events of last September. 'For . me the Taliban is on the inside of the [State Department] building,' the former mission deputy chief angrily said while speaking at a hearing . chaired by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa in October 2012. During . his testimony at the time, Nordstrom detailed for lawmakers how he and . the late ambassador had repeatedly asked to increase security at the . embassy in the months leading up to the attack, but said that their . pleas fell on deaf ears as the situation in the country continued . deteriorating. Witness accounts: The three career diplomats who were in Libya during the 2012 attacks will appear before a congressional hearing to testify about the deadly events of last September . The two other State Department officials have never publicly spoken about the attacks. At the time of the deadly attacks, Hicks was the highest-ranking American diplomat serving in Libya. Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican and members of the House committee, said that Hicks - a veteran officer of the Foreign Service - was in Tripoli on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from Ambassador Stevens. 'We're under attacks! We're under attacks' Stevens reportedly yelled into his cell phone. According . to the Utah congressman, Hicks reacted to the news by calling . Washington to alert officials and set off an 'inter-agency response.' What remains: As the investigation into the attack continues, the consulate remains damaged . According to the State Department website, Thompson 'advises senior leadership on operational counterterrorism matters, and ensures that the United States can rapidly respond to global terrorism crises.' Victim: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed during the attack . Hicks and Thompson are believed to be represented pro bono by Joe diGenova, a former US attorney, and his wife, Victoria Toensing, a former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Of the three men, Nordstrom is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle-blower. According to diGenova and Toensing, their clients' accounts of the attacks in Benghazi were dismissed by then-Secretary Hillary Clinton's Accountability Review Board, and the two civil servants have been subjected to an intimidation campaign by their superiors meant to stop them from telling the truth about the tragic events in Libya. The revelation of the witnesses' identities comes just days after the Obama administration denied that it was prohibiting any U.S. personnel who survived last year's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya from testifying before Congress about what they experienced. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced on Wednesday that it will convene a hearing on May 8 aimed at 'exposing failure' in the Obama administration to respond to security threats to that diplomatic mission, and to present to the public and to Congress an accurate version of the attack that left Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans dead. 'This Administration has offered the American people only a carefully selected and sanitized version of events from before, during, and after the Benghazi terrorist attacks, committee Chairman Issa, a Republican congressman from California, said in a statement. 'Not surprisingly, this version of events casts senior officials in the most favorable light possible.' Jay Carney insisted in a press briefing that no administration employees had sought security clearances so they could testify about he Benghazi raid, even after the House Oversight Committee asked for those very clearances . Issa's committee has already shed public light on the U.S. State Department's denials of requests for more robust security at the consulate in Benghazi. And in an October 2012 hearing, it produced evidence contradicting the administration's initial claim that the the Sept. 11, 2012 military-style assault on the diplomatic compound began as a 'protest' sparked by a low-budget YouTube video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad. 'Next week’s hearing will expose new facts and details that the Obama Administration has tried to suppress,' Issa said. At least four surviving witnesses to the Benghazi attack have retained attorneys to help them navigate the process of testifying before Congress about what they saw. They are all employees of the CIA and the State Department, according to a Fox News report. The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya was attacked and burned on Sept. 11, 2012 in a military-style attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans . California Republican Rep> Darrell Issa (L) has announced a hearing in which the House Oversight committee, which he chairs, will hear testimony from survivors who say they have been blocked from telling Congress what they know. South Caroline Rep. Trey Gowdy (R) has promised that the Benghazi attack is 'not going away despite the efforts of this [Obama] administration' President Obama denied on Tuesday that he was aware of any U.S. personnel who were being prevented from sharing their observations with congressional investigators. 'I'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying,” the president said in response to a reporter's question, 'so what I’ll do is I will find out what exactly you’re referring to.' Both the CIA and the State Department have told Congress that no employees have requested the security clearances that their lawyers would need before talking to Congress. And on Wednesday, Obama's chief spokesman Jay Carney insisted during a White House press briefing that 'Benghazi happened a long time ago,' and that 'we are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress to provide information related to Benghazi.' Attorney Victoria Toensing represents a survivor of the Benghazi attack whom she says the Obama administration has blocked from testifying by refusing to give her the necessary security clearance to learn what her own client knows . But Toensing, who represents two of the witnesses, told Fox News that administration officials are issuing 'some very despicable threats to people ... They're taking career people and making them well aware . that their careers will be over' if they testify. The State Department, she said during a separate Fox News interview, has 'had two letters from Chairman Issa, one on April 16, the other one April 26, that specifically say, ""We want you to provide a process for clearing a lawyer to receive classified information.""' 'How can they possibly get up there and just lie to the press corps?' she asked, referring to the . president and his spokespersons. Toensing, according to her her husband and partner, who was interviewed Wednesday on ABC radio affiliate WMAL in Washington, already possesses a Top Secret clearance, and would only need a letter from an administration attorney in order to learn what her client already knows. DiGenova explained on Monday that 'the Department of State is refusing to grant clearances to Victoria and other people who want to represent the whistle-blowers, in an attempt to prevent the testimony.' The FBI released these photos on Wednesday of individuals who sere seen near the Benghazi consulate on the day Libyan terrorists attack it, killing four Americans including the U.S. ambassador. The raid on that diplomatic outpost happened eight months ago . House Republicans issued a scathing report on April 23 criticizing the Obama administration for a series of intelligence failures and an attempted cover-up after the Benghazi raid. When then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before Congress, she disputed that it was important to determine whether the raid was carried out by terrorist militants or by an angry group of protesters, as the administration first claimed . 'On April 26, Congressman Issa sent a letter to the new Sec of State, John Kerry, demanding that the lawyers who are going to represent the whistle-blowers be cleared - be given clearances - so they can talk to their clients and the committee about classified information,' DiGenova said. 'She got a new Top Secret security clearance within the last year. And now they will not clear her or any of the other lawyers to represent the Department of State people. This is so outrageous.' 'There is going to be a Constitutional showdown here,' he predicted,' and 'Congress is going to win. The administration's effort to cover up whatever happened in Benghazi is going to fail.' 'The whistle-blowers are out there,' diGenova insisted. 'These are great Americans. These are heroes. They were on the ground in Benghazi. They want to tell their story and the administration is going to do everything it can to stop them from testifying under oath in public. And they want to protect Hillary [Clinton] and the president. That's what this is all about.' South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, said Wednesday that he was 'not at liberty to disclose the identity of the witnesses' who will appear at next week's hearing. 'Benghazi is warming up,' Gowdy promised during a televised interview. 'It is not going away despite the efforts of this administration.' Joe DiGenova, shown here in a file photo, said Benghazi survivors 'want to tell their story and the [Obama] administration is going to do everything it can to stop them.'","Gregory N.

Clemente admitted to Letterman that his first reaction after the swearing incident was to crawl into bed and call his parents . ‘I went home, crawled in bed and . called my parents,’ Clemente admitted. ‘But the next day, you gotta pick . yourself up, you gotta laugh at yourself and keep going.’ Clemente proved a figure of fun for Letterman and he had even devoted his Top 10 list to the sacked anchor's plight. Several more gags were made at Clemente’s expense on the show, but Letterman also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him 'he would be just fine.' But when a cocky-sounding Clemente made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from ESPN, Letterman told him to forget it. ‘Look, I'm trying to get you the job back in Bismarck, forget about ESPN,’ said Letterman. ‘That ain't gonna happen. You're going back to Bismarck.’ Second chance: A.J. Clemente, from Bismarck, North Dakota, also appeared on the Today Show .

It was a busy couple of days for . Clemente following his blunder as he made appearances on both Live With Kelly and Michael and the Today show. On Live With Kelly and Michael, the show's control room bleeped Clemente even when he didn’t swear as a joke. Kelly Ripa explained it was a ‘precautionary bleep.’ Still Clemente had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night. Cohost Michael Strahan told Clemente, ‘One thing about New Yorkers, we believe in giving second chances, man. Yesterday, we called for you. You came here today. (Applause) So, we have a challenge for you if you're willing to accept it.

Are you up for it? What do you think?’ Spotlight: AJ Clemente also appeared on LIVE with Kelly and Michael . Clemente agreed. ‘Yeah,’ he said, adding, ‘yeah, definitely.’ Earlier on the Today show he had revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last Sunday. 'When . I first saw the clip, it was gut-wrenching,' Clemente told the Today show of those two words that first introduced him to Bismarck's evening . news audience, as well as the rest of America. 'F****** S***,' Clemente is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk. 'I didn't even know I said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break,' he said. His co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard. Off guard: Clemente told the Today show that he didn't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected . He says he hadn't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car. 'I was looking down, I was going over my script, Van my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on, we actually came on 30 seconds early,' he says. Then when he saw several names he couldn't pronounce related to the London Marathon winners in his upcoming script, 'fireball shot came right out of my mouth,' he explained. 'I fully expected that they would fire me' he said while calling those two words 'inexcusable.' 'Rookie mistake. I’m a free agent. Can’t . help but laugh at myself and stay positive,' Clemente later wrote on . Twitter after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a . 'tough day.' Opportunity: Helping him out the anchors allowed Clemente to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel . ‘I want to apologize for an incident . that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening, when one of our . employees used profanity on the air,’ Monica Hannan, KFYR-TV wrote in an apology on the station's Facebook page on Sunday. ‘He . did not realize his microphone was on, but still, that's no excuse.

A number of innocent bystanders were injured when the romantic rivalry between rappers Chris Brown and Drake turned violent at a Manhattan club early Thursday morning. The second female victim, who was hit in the face and hand with a broken bottle, has stepped forward and shown her injuries in the wake of the ongoing drama. A 21-year-old woman named Veronica spoke to TMZ and showed how she sustained a bruise on her forehead and cuts on her right hand that needed to be treated with stitches. Victim: 21-year-old Veronica, pictured, was hit with a bottle on her right hand and trampled on her head . Treating the wound: She received stitches on her hand as a result of the injury from the nightclub brawl . Aftermath: The woman, whose injuries are shown above, now says she plans on suing the club, and isn't ruling out suing the rappers at the heart of the fight as well . Veronica, who was at SoHo nightclub W.i.P. at a table in between both Brown and Drake, said that at first she had no idea what was going on when the fight broke out around 4am on Thursday. 'I heard people screaming ... so I tried to get away from the action and hid behind a couch,' she told the site. The move only worked to some extent, as she was hit in the hand with a broken bottle. In addition to being in the way of the flying fluids, she also got trampled by another clubgoer who stepped on her head. 'I plan on suing the club over the incident,' she told TMZ, and is not ruling out a suit against the millionaire rappers at the heart of the incident. 'I'm trying to see my best legal options,' she said. The aftermath: Broken glass can be seen strewn across the bar following the Chris and Drake fight . Veronica is not the only one taking her claims to court, as another one of the five victims has lawyered up. Ingrid Gutierrez, a 21-year-old model who was at the club with Brown and his entourage, has spoken to several media outlets in keeping with the advice of her attorney. 'I was on the couch, covering my face, because I'd been hit on the head by a bottle and my head was bleeding. I thought I was going to die,' she told News Core. Unsurprisingly considering she is a friend of the controversial Brown, notorious for his felony assault on former girlfriend Rihanna, Ms Gutierrez says that Drake was the one who turned the bickering into a violent showdown. Best of enemies: Drake, left, and Chris Brown, . right, seen partying on opposite sides of club WiP before the night . ended in bottle throwing with Chris sustaining a cut to the chin . The situation started when Brown sent a . bottle of expensive champagne over to Drake's table, allegedly as an . alcoholic peace offering to the rapper who has also been romantically . linked to Rihianna. Object of their affection: Rihanna, seen here on Friday in New York, was not at the club at the time of the fight but was clearly on their minds . Ms Gutierrez says that 'I then saw a . waitress come back with a piece of paper and gave it to Chris,' which . was supposedly a note that read 'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal . with it'. '(Brown) looked upset and just threw it on the floor,' she said. '(Drake and his entourage) were giving him the middle finger. They got into each other's faces and were shouting at each other. 'Chris told Drake to f*** off, and the next thing I could hear is the sound of smashed glass and mayhem started.' The police investigation into the incident is ongoing, and as a result there are reports that there will be added security at Drake's Jones Beach concert tonight. The New York Post reported this . morning that police may arrest the rapper for reckless endangerment at . the concert, but police sources tell MailOnline that those reports have . neither been confirmed nor denied. The likelihood of an arrest seems . very slim at this time. Veronica is the second unconnected bystander to release photos of her injuries, as the first was arguably the most serious.

Paintings said to be by gangster Reggie Kray that were set to go under the hammer have been withdrawn from auction after they were found to be fakes. The three paintings, one entitled 'Girl Bathing' and two called 'Tree Studies', were thought to have been created by the notorious gangland boss in 1986 while he served a life sentence at Wayland Prison in Norwich and Parkhurst Jail on the Isle of Wight. But Cambridge auctioneers Cheffins have removed the works from sale after experts deemed them too good to have been painted Kray. Fake: Three paintings thought to have been by gangster Reggie Kray, including this one called 'Bathing Girl' have been revealed as forgeries . Notorious: Gangster Reggie Kray was thought to have created the paintings in 1986 while serving life in prison . The watercolours, complete with Kray's prison number and signature, had been tipped to sell for at least £500 each. Experts believed that 'Girl Bathing' was inspired by Edgar Degas's 'The Tub' which killer Kray is said to have become obsessed with during his incarceration. But fellow inmate Peter Gillett told the Daily Mirror that Kray was too lazy to paint much. The 54-year-old said: 'He was an egomaniac. If he had been that good he would have let everybody know.' The paintings, which were due to be auctioned on May 2, had been described by Cheffins auctioneers as 'very different' and 'quite unusual'. Not for sale: One of the other paintings by Kray, called 'Tree Studies', that should have gone under the hammer earlier this month . Sarah Flynn said that his works were 'not bad at all'. But the auction house confirmed that the paintings were removed from sale after they were found to be forgeries. Reggie Kray took up art after he was jailed for the murder of Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in 1969. Both he and his brother Ronnie became keen artists while they were in jail, usually copying classic images by famous artists. They were said to have produced scores of pictures in a variety of mediums including watercolour, chalk, charcoal, pastel, pencil, and on canvas - and cover a wide range of topics, including nudes, still life, and landscapes. Twins: Reggie, left, and Ronnie Kray, right, are both said to have become keen painters while in prison . A series of artworks sold for more than £12,000 in 2009 and a 40-strong collection sold for more than £17,000 last summer. Kray and his twin brother Ronnie became kingpins of organised crime in London during the 1950s and 1960s with their mob called 'The Firm'. They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets and the murders of McVitie and George Cornell and both jailed for life in 1969. Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2000 and died eight weeks later from cancer aged 66. His brother died five years earlier age 61.

The head teacher of a rival school allegedly injected the yoghurt with rat poison and left it on the road to the girls' school . Two schoolgirls have died in China after eating yoghurt poisoned by the head of a rival kindergarten, according to state media reports. The Xinhua News Agency said the girls' grandmother found the yoghurt, which was left in a bag with a pile of notebooks, on the road near their school in Pingshan county. She took the books and yoghurt back home and let the girls, aged five and six, have it when they came back from school. But as they played outside after drinking it they suddenly started foaming at the mouth and collapsed to the ground. The children were rushed to the local hospital where they began fitting, but they later died. It is believed the girls were sisters named Lu and Flowers. Chinese media reported six-year-old Lu died on the way to hospital, while her younger sister Flowers died a week later. Hebei Youth Daily said their grandmother, who it named as Renshu Ting, also tasted some of the yoghurt and spent a few days in hospital. Police said the yoghurt was poisoned with tetramine - a rat posion. Officers believe poisoning was motivated by competition for students between the schools, media reports said. Reports claimed the woman headteacher confessed to injecting rat poison into the yoghurt and asking a man to place it with notebooks on the road to the rival kindergarten, which is in Hebei province. She and the man who allegedly helped her put the yoghurt on the road were arrested after the incident on April 24. There was no response from police or Pingshan county's information office last night. Five years ago, thousands of Chinese children were poisoned when the industrial chemical melamine was added to baby milk powder to make it appear to contain more protein. Six children died and tens of thousands were made ill by the incident. Death sentences were handed down to people found responsible for adding the melamine to the milk.

Its people have just been hit with a stark austerity budget that proposes £4.5billion spending cuts. But Israel's prime minister doesn't seem to have heard the news as he's doubled his expenses, spending £975,000 on luxuries such as hairdressers and shoes. Benjamin Netanyahu's household expenses were revealed after the Movement for Freedom of Information demanded his office release the details of his costs. His taxpayer-funded spending on food and hospitality went from £39,000 in 2009 to £88,000 in 2012. An increase that will no doubt enrage Israeli citizens was under 'representation expenses' – which included £11,700 being spent on his wardrobe, shoes, make-up and hair treatment, The Daily Telegraph reported. Another 318,000 shekels - or £57,287 - were spent on the prime minister's family's private villa in the exclusive Caesarea, a coastal resort, The Independent reported. Details of his lavish spending came after his government approved an unpopular austerity budget which will raise taxes and cut public spending in order to tackle 7bn deficit in 2012. Demonstrations across Israeli cities were held at the weekend to oppose the tough measures, the Guardian reported. The prime minister's office issued a statement about the figures, saying they included 'the expenses for official events held in [Mr Netanyahu's] home and working expenses for the many meetings held there.' Details of his lavish spending came after his government approved an unpopular austerity budget . It is likely to mortify the prime minister, who has already been widely criticised for he and his family's spending. Earlier this year he was forced to cancel a state contract when it was revealed that he was spending £1,700 a year of taxpayer money for his favorite ice cream. It follows an embarrassing incident where the prime minister spent £83,000 having a double bed to be installed on a plane that carried him and his wife, Sara, to Baroness Thatcher's funeral in London in April, to make the journey more comfortable. He will now make alternative travel arrangements after his 'rest chamber' was slammed for being extravagant, the BBC reported. The revelations come Israel celebrated its Independence Day - Yom Ha'Atzmaut - and this year marked the 65th anniversary of the nation's independence on April 15 and 16.","Benjamin Netanyahu's taxpayer-funded spending on food and hospitality went from £39,000 in 2009 to £88,000 in 2012 .

"UPDATED: . 13:42 EST, 5 December 2011 . The International Space Station might have cost billions, but one facility has been lacking up till now - any kind of laundry. Brave - and strong-stomached - astronauts usually wear underwear for three or four days  before putting them in a capsule that is ejected and burns up in the atmosphere. Other clothes are worn 'for months'. NASA has asked Oregon-based UMPQUA to build a low-power, low-water washer-dryer that can make life 250 miles up a bit more pleasant. Previously, the inhabitants of the International Space Station had to wear underwear for three to four days at once - and other clothes 'for months' NASA astronaut Greg Chamitoff: Previously, dirty clothes were simply ejected from the International Space Station in a capsule which burns up in the atmosphere . It would initially be deployed on the International Space Station, but also serve as a template for future missions such as to The Moon and Mars. NASA commissioned the research because of the high cost of sending anything into space, which works out as between £3,100 and £6,200 per 500g. This has meant that astronauts were only allowed a limited number of underpants per trip to keep costs down. Preliminary designs by UMPQUA suggest that it plans to use air, jets of water vapour and microwave rays to clean the clothes. The Advanced Microgravity Compatible, Integrated Laundry (AMCIL) would also use a vacuum for drying the clothes off. Preliminary designs by UMPQUA suggest that it plans to use air, jets of water vapour and microwave rays to clean the clothes. The Advanced Microgravity Compatible, Integrated Laundry (AMCIL) would also use a vacuum for drying the clothes off. The proposal for the device - which states it has already been successfully tested in zero gravity environment - claims that it would achieve ‘greatly enhanced softness’ over previous such machines. The proposal adds: ‘Tumbling was achieved by an array of three air jets, two to generate a cyclonic effect and a third to induce tumbling by blowing perpendicular to the plane of rotation.’ NASA said it wanted to develop a machine that would work for ‘long duration human missions beyond low Earth orbit’. It said: ‘The system is suitable for use in any long term space mission where resupply logistics preclude routine delivery of fresh crew clothing and removal of disposable clothing articles. Box of Bold Washing Powder: Nasa's solution is rather more hi-tech, and involves bombarding clothes with microwaves . ‘While the proposed laundry system is microgravity compatible, the system will be completely functional in reduced gravity environments.’ UMPQUA has also submitted a second proposal to NASA - a human waste incinerator. It describes its design as ‘light, compact, simple, energy efficient, contains few moving parts, is virtually maintenance free - and requires little astronaut time.’","Astronauts previously wore underwear for three days .

The convicted fraudster has taken a job looking after telephones and computers in the North Carolina prison where he is serving a 150-year sentence. Madoff works for only 'a few hours' a day, which leaves him plenty of time to ponder his undoing. The man who ran his own finance firm is now identified as inmate 61727-054 at Butner Federal . Correctional Complex. In 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to siphoning $17.5 billion from thousands of investors in a long-running, pyramid-style con. Remorse: Jailed financier Bernie Madoff says he is racked with guilt over the death of his son . The 75-year-old told CNN Money his deception began . after the Black Monday crash of 1987. He said that was when he turned his . investors into victims, but insists he never intended his crime to go on for so long. 'It . was certainly never my intention for this to happen, he said. 'I . thought I could work myself out of a temporary situation but it kept . getting worse and worse and I didn't have the courage to admit what I . had done.' The medium-security prison Madoff now calls home are a far cry from his former life of luxury. Tragic: Bernie Madoff's eldest son Mark with his wife Stephanie. Mark hanged himself after Madoff was jailed . When his Ponzi scheme was revealed Madoff had to give up his $7 million . Manhattan penthouse, a beach house in Montauk, New York, his homes in . Florida and France, and a yacht named The Bull. Madoff and his wife Ruth also had to auction furniture, jewellery and clothing in November 2010 to compensate his victims. Among the lots at the Sheraton Hotel auction in New York were the disgraced financier's suits, a pair of velveteen monogrammed slippers and a Steinway piano. Madoff, who was married for 50 years, had tried to hide his family from the fraud. In 2010, on the second anniversary of his arrest, his eldest son Mark hanged himself. Assets: After his downfall Madoff had to sell several homes, including his Manhattan penthouse . For sale: The convicted fraudster had to give up his beach house in Montauk, Long Island . 'I . was responsible for my son Mark's death and that's very, very . difficult,' he said. 'I live with that. I live with the remorse, the . pain I caused everybody, certainly my family, and the victims.' Mark's widow Stephanie, who is the mother of his two children, previously lashed out at Madoff for reveling in his celebrity status in prison. She claims he wrote her a letter from prison saying: 'As you can imagine, I am quite the celebrity, and am treated like a Mafia don. They call me either Uncle Bernie or Mr. Madoff.' During his Manhattan court case in 2009, . Madoff told the court: 'I am actually grateful for this opportunity to . publicly comment about my crimes, for which I am deeply sorry and . ashamed.' His remorse and lengthy jail term is not enough for some of the victims affected by his fraudulent scheme.

A man who had access to an emergency beacon set it off after the body of the 41-year-old woman washed up onto the beach at around 4pm (WST). But there was no sign of her 48-year-old partner, who remains missing. Neither the man nor the woman has been named. The search for the man will resume at first light in Australia.

Ed Miliband today finally admitted Labour would borrow billions more to fund its policies, less than 24 hours after dodging the question 10 times. The Labour leader was forced to concede his radio pitch for votes in this week's local elections had gone 'not so well' yesterday after repeatedly trying to avoid saying his tax and spending plans would add to the nation's debts. Confronted today by claims his economic policies had descended into a 'Milishambles', he caved in and said: 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.' See video below . Labour leader Ed Miliband told ITV's Daybreak that his spending plans would mean an increase in borrowing, less than 24 hours after dodging the question in a radio interview . Mr Miliband pitched Labour into disarray . on the economy and welfare yesterday when he was unable to answer basic . questions about his party’s policies. He appeared to lose his temper with Martha Kearney, presenter of BBC Radio 4's World at One, telling her ‘You don’t understand’ when she . pressed him on Labour’s position on the economy. The Labour leader refused on ten occasions to . admit that his party would increase government borrowing, despite . outlining plans that would require more than £28billion of borrowing. Mr Miliband was challenged repeatedly on how his promises to spend billions more on tax cuts and job creation schemes. But . during tetchy exchanges on BBC Radio 4 he refused to admit he would . have to borrow more money to fill the budget black hole in his plans, . including a £28billion bill for his Alternative Queen's Speech. Today he was confronted on ITV's Daybreak by the headline in the Daily Mail which branded the interview a 'Milishambles'. 'That happens, you do interviews - some interviews well, some interviews not so well,' Mr Miliband said. Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly brandished the Daily Mail headline which branded his radio interview yesterday a 'Milishambles' Mr Miliband admitted his Radio 4 interview yesterday had gone 'not so well' He quickly ditched yesterday's reluctance to come clean about the £13billion cost of his plan to cut VAT. He said: 'I was asked a question about VAT and Labour's plans to cut VAT. 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.' And he went on to repeat his claim that more borrowing would lead to less borrowing. '""The point I was making yesterday was that if you can get growth going . by  cutting VAT, then over time you will see actually borrowing fall - . that was the point I was making yesterday.' Borrowing has remained stubbornly high . for Chancellor George Osborne. It fell only slightly last year to . £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12. Any attempt to add to borrowing would spook the markets, the Tories have warned. Sajid Javid, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Less than 24 hours after refusing ten times to admit the truth, a weak Ed Miliband has finally been forced to come clean that he plans to increase borrowing. 'More spending, more borrowing and more debt is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place. It's the same old Labour.' In another difficult interview, Mr Miliband was also pressed about why he is less popular with voters than Tony Blair or David Cameron when they were on the verge of taking power, repeatedly refused to predict how many seats he would win in Thursday's local elections and insisted standing on a wooden pallet in high streets was proof he was 'doing politics in a different way'. Mr Miliband, pictured campaigning in Worcester, says that using a wooden pallet as a soapbox proves he is doing politics 'in a different way' Labour is under pressure to make gains of at least 350 in the county and unitary council elections on Thursday, to prove Mr Miliband's One Nation slogan is resonating in all parts of the country. 'What I am going to do is go out there and make my case to people . I am trying to do politics in a different way. I have gone from Maidstone to Newcastle-under-Lyme, going around and doing old fashioned politics if you like. 'Going out into a market square, standing on a soapbox, saying how I want to change the country and taking questions from all-comers. 'Sometimes hostile questions but actually I find that if you engage with people, people do respect you for saying I will take your question whoever you are, whether you are a supporter or not.' Asked about his approval ratings two years before a General Election in comparison to those enjoyed by Mr Cameron and Mr Blair, Mr Miliband said: 'I am not going to get into these comparisons. I am going to go out and do it my own way. We are coming off the back of a difficult General Election defeat in 2010. 'What have I done? I have talked about the things Labour got wrong - I have been open and honest about that. I have set out a vision for our country, what I call One Nation - use the talents of every person in the country and then we are setting out specific policies that can make a difference.' Mr Miliband has used his pallet to address crowds in South Shields (left) and Chorley . The interview came after questions were raised about Labour’s alternative Queen’s . Speech, which repeated the party’s pledge to bring in a temporary VAT . cut to 17.5 per cent, which would cost £13 billion. It also outlined . pledges to reintroduce the 10p tax rate, which could cost £7.3billion if restored to the previous level before Gordon Brown abolished it. Labour says it would base the level on how much a mansion tax would raise, which could be only £2billion. The Tories claim . there is a £28billion black hole in the plans. Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has previously admitted that Labour would . have to raise borrowing in an attempt to foster economic growth, in the . hope that means borrowing can be cut later. But Mr Miliband flatly . refused to admit that borrowing would increase, angrily dodging ten . different questions on the subject. Asked yesterday whether he thinks the Government needs to borrow more now, Mr . Miliband told Radio 4 ‘No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get . borrowing down.’ Pressed again, he added: ‘I don’t accept that borrowing . would be higher under a Labour government because borrowing would be . lower over the medium term.’ Asked to agree with Mr Balls that borrowing would rise in the short-term he refused. Tory MP Brooks Newmark branded Mr Miliband’s performance ‘a . Milishambles’, while the Liberal Democrat press office tweeted that it . was ‘a car crash’. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to admit . what his Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, has already said: that Labour’s . plans mean more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly how . Labour got us into this mess in the first place.’ The grilling of Ed Miliband by Radio 4’s World at One presenter Martha Kearney was described as a ‘car crash’ interview. Here is an edited transcript:MK: Would it be fair to say, looking at your plans overall, that you think that the Government needs to borrow more now and that’s in order to boost growth in the economy.EM: No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get borrowing down.MK: In order to produce more growth, if you were PM at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more wouldn’t you?

Williams, of Middleton, Wisconsin, won $500 several years ago and now wants to score a little higher. He'll have his chance on Wednesday with the latest drawing for the Powerball jackpot. It's ballooned to an estimated $360 million, with a cash value of $229.2 million, making it the third largest Powerball jackpot and the seventh largest jackpot ever. Lucky ticket: A Powerball ticket is seen in Tampa, Florida, while on Wednesday similar ticket holders will face the chance of winning an estimated $360 million jackpot . Williams doesn't necessarily spend more when the prize is high. But his $4 investment in the quick-pick option means he does spend. 'I know rationally it makes no sense,' he said. 'But at the same time, without a ticket, I have zero chance.' Ervin Torok, a truck driver from Sioux Falls, S.D., also is looking for his second chance. He won a $500 prize a few years back. 'You never know,' Torok, 52, said while checking some lottery tickets from a gas station. 'Maybe one day you'll get lucky and win.' Thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012, players don't necessarily have to strike big to get lucky. A $1 increase and new $1 million and $2 million prizes means the odds of winning something have increased. Just last Saturday, there was no Powerball jackpot winner, but more than a dozen tickets won $1 million prizes in 10 states. Last big win: Pedro Quezada, the winner of a $338 million Powerball jackpot in March, holds up a promotional check in New Jersey following his big win . The 'cross-selling' of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets in January 2010 began the jump to bigger jackpots because more people had access to tickets, said Mary Neubauer, spokeswoman for the Iowa Lottery. Iowa is one of the founding Powerball states. Neubauer called large jackpots 'the new normal' and said she expects them to keep surpassing all-time jackpot records set years ago. In fact, more than half of the all-time jackpot records have been reached in the last three years. The top two all-time jackpots - $656 million from a Mega Millions jackpot and $587.5 million from a Powerball jackpot - were achieved in 2012. 'It usually took a handful of months, if not several months, for a jackpot to reach this large amount,' Neubauer said. 'Now it's achieving that within a handful of weeks. I think the redesign is achieving exactly what we had wanted it to achieve, which is the bigger, faster-growing jackpot.' The last major jackpot win came when a New Jersey man won a $338.3 million jackpot on March 23. It is now considered the fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history. Tom Powers, 52, a janitor from Omaha, Neb., bought several tickets Tuesday from a convenience store. He said he would definitely walk away from work if he won the jackpot, but he's not sure how he would spend all the winnings. 'It's really unfathomable the amount of money this is putting out,' Powers said. The next drawing is scheduled for Wednesday night.","Wednesday's drawing faces ticket holds with third largest Powerball jackpot and the seventh largest jackpot ever .

Muhammed Khalil, 38, then asked his mistress to lie for him to police saying that he was actually the victim of abuse. However, he was jailed yesterday for 15 months for the brutal assault that left Biklis Parveen, 33, with a serious head injury. Muhammed Khalil (right) attacked his wife Bilkis Parveen (left), slapping her and ramming her head into a cabinet . Birmingham Crown Court heard that the former probation officer flew into a rage and attacked his wife when she refused to let him take their two children away from the family home in October. He slapped her across the face then rammed her head into the furniture. Khalil then fled their home in Hall Green, Birmingham, before starting to weave his web of lies. His new lover, Anarkali Habib, 34, told police she saw him being attacked by his wife when she was driving past their house. She claimed she was driving past their house when she saw Mrs Parveen attacking Khalil and handed him her mobile phone to call police. However, a jury found Khalil guilty of assault after hearing the pair had been having an affair. Khalil was jailed for 15 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday after also pleading guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice. Passing sentence, Judge Simon Drew said only the fact that Habib 'cracked under pressure' stopped Mrs Parveen being wrongly arrested. He told Khalil: 'You did not cause your former wife to be arrested and prosecuted. Muhammed Khalil (left) has been jailed for 15 months after he battered his wife Bilkis Parveen (right) 'That was because the witness you had set up cracked under the pressure rather than anything you did yourself.' The judge added that Khalil's crimes went to the 'heart of the judicial system'. During his trial prosecutor Graeme Simpson told the court Khalil flew into a rage when he tried to take his two children, two and four, away from his wife. Mr Simpson said: 'He swore at her and slapped her across the face three or four times before pushing her against furniture in the hallway, where she received a nasty cut above her eye. 'In interview Mr Khalil initially told police that he did not know the woman (Habib) and had never met her. 'When officers told him later that they had been provided with the same mobile telephone number by his wife who had been told about a witness from York, he admitted concocting the cock and bull story.' Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard that Habib had had an affair and was attempting to take the children from his wife . Habib, from York, had previously admitted one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice with their web of lies. She was handed a three-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, in December last year. Mrs Parveen told the court she had found out her husband had been cheating on her after she discovered Habib's number on his mobile phone. She told the court: 'I had found out that he had been having an affair and had forgiven him. 'He came back for four days and then left again. 'He turned up again and said he wanted to take the kids.' Mohammed Rashid, defending Khalil, said he lost his temper as he tried to sort out arrangements regarding his children with his wife. Mr Rashid said: 'It is quite clear he panicked when he phoned up his friend.'","Muhammed Khalil, 38, attacked his wife Bilikis Parveen, 33 last year .

A councillor has claimed more than £10,000 in allowances while living with his new wife in the Philippines. Colin Payne, 58, has spent much of the past two years in Manila with Jackie, the Filipino bride he met on holiday. In that time he has attended only seven of a possible 24 meetings of his council in Devon, blaming tropical storms for his failure to show up. He has still pocketed £9,140 in allowances and a £1,806 special responsibility payment for sitting on North Devon District Council’s executive committee. Yesterday the Liberal Democrat was facing a motion of no-confidence from members of his own party. They say he has spent just five months in the UK over the past two years. In a statement they said: ‘His constituents have been unable to contact him and he has been unable to carry out his councillor duties.’ Des Brailey, who leads the Conservative group on the council, said: ‘He has been absent from a lot of meetings and if he’s not here then he can’t properly represent his residents. ‘If it was one of my councillors I’d be having a stern word with them.’ Mr Payne, who has three children from his first marriage, said he had spent so much time 7,000 miles away because his 48-year-old wife had been denied a UK visa.

A two-month summer trip to be with her had to be extended, he said, because typhoons had grounded international flights. He added: ‘Nine tenths of councillors’ work these days is via email. I haven’t stopped doing that. ‘Most meetings are lip service, rubber stamping. I was conscious I couldn’t get to any meetings and so I took the decision to step down from the executive committee. ‘I was taking money for nothing and couldn’t do that job properly. ‘I’ve been a councillor for 30 years and until this year I could count the number of meetings I’ve missed on one hand.’ Mr Payne met his wife four years ago in Singapore while he was travelling home from watching cricket in Australia.

I’m honest and open about it,’ he added. ‘For the first time in 30 years I’ve had a personal problem.’ Mr Payne said his previous marriage broke down ten years ago in part because of his workload as a councillor and as owner of a fire safety business in Barnstaple. He added: ‘For 29 years my attendance record was exemplary but four years ago I was fortunate enough to meet a beautiful, amazing woman. Jackie and I became friends, we spent some holidays together, she then got a visa as a visitor, and gradually we grew closer which culminated in our marriage in December 2011.’ His wife, a mother of two, works as an English translator in the Philippines.

An ice cream parlour in Rome which charged British tourists £54 for four cones has taken out a newspaper advert justifying its high prices. The Antica Roma gelataria charged brothers Roger and Stephen Bannister and their wives the sum when they stopped at the outlet near the city's famous Spanish Steps. When the unlucky tourists complained, . they were told the cost would have been double if they had eaten their . gelatos at a table instead of standing up. One Rome councillor called . the prices ‘a scandal’. Anger: Roger Bannister (left), his brother Steven and their wives Wendy and Joyce with the £54 receipt for the ice cream they bought in Rome. The ice cream parlour has taken out an advert justifying its high prices . They had ordered three scoops of ice . cream each to take away from the Antica Roma cafe near the Spanish . Steps, and were charged €64 (£54) for their snacks. The family complained about the cost to a national newspaper - reigniting a debate over high prices faced by tourists in parts of Italy. But the firm has responded by taking out a full page advert titled 'the price is right,' in which it justifies the cost of its products. Managers at the company said the outlet offers cones for about £2, but that the British tourists, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, had chosen ice creams with 'a big wafer and special ingredients,' the Telegraph reports. Ice cream is big business in Italy. There are 37,000 independent ice cream makers in the country and the industry employs 150,000 people. 360,000 tonnes of ice cream are consumed in Italy each year and the market is worth £3.2 billion annually. High cost: The family were horrified by the high price after buying ice creams at the Antica Roma bar (left of picture) in Rome . It is one of the few products that has not been hit by recession — with sales up by more than five per cent in the past year. The most expensive ice creams in Italy used to be those served at the Gran Caffe Lavena in Venice where two scoops cost nearly £12, according to Italian chef Antonio Carluccio. Expense: The cost of the ice creams has reignited debate over the high prices faced by tourists in Italy . But this now appears to have been overtaken by the £13.50 ice creams on sale at the Antica Roma ice cream parlour. The . firm claims the high quality of its ice cream has helped it survive the . country's economic crisis and that its business has continued to grow. The Bannisters were offered a free trip back to Rome by the city's mayor Gianni Alemanno after their story made headlines across the world. Roger Bannister earlier described how the group had been on a six-day trip to Rome, adding: 'Up until . then we'd had a brilliant time, but that left a bad taste in the mouth – . quite literally. 'To be honest the ice cream wasn't that nice either. We'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday. 'I felt I had been ripped off but what could I do?' Matteo Costantini, a local councillor, . said of the tourists' ordeal: 'They were justifiably outraged at what . they had been asked to pay, and it should not be allowed.

Britain could take back powers from the European Union covering immigration, tourism, benefits and trade, it emerged today. Ministers revealed the latest shopping list of policy areas which could be returned from Brussels as part of David Cameron’s plan to negotiate a new EU deal before holding an in-out vote. It includes suggesting that tighter immigration controls are need to maintain public confidence in the welfare state and questioning whether EU trade policy deters investment in the UK. David Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain in the EU, but only if his review and renegotiation secures a better deal with Brussels . The Prime Minister set up the Balance of Competences Review to examine which EU rules Britain should consider withdrawing from. After taking evidence from a wide range of pro- and anti-European bodies and experts, the government hopes to use it as proof that many edicts from Brussels are not working. However has been largely dismissed by other EU countries, raising doubts about what concessions – if any – Mr Cameron will be able to secure. Mr Cameron wants the review to ‘give everyone the opportunity to make their points about which areas of European endeavour are in our interest and which are not’. The latest stage plank of his Europe strategy comes after a tumultuous week for the Prime Minister, who last night saw 114 Tory MPs condemn him for not including an EU referendum in the Queen's Speech. Today Tory MP James Wharton won the backbench draw to take legislation through Parliament, and vowed to try to enshrine an in-out vote into law. It came as the Home Office, HM Treasury, Ministry of Justice, Department for Business and Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued a call for evidence on areas of policy and its impact on the UK. They cover the free movement of goods and people, asylum and immigration, family law. One of the most contentious areas has been access to benefits for newcomers to Britain. A raft of EU rules are to be reviewed by the UK government to see if they benefit Britain or hold back growth . The Home Office review published today states that access to social security benefits for people from outside the UK is ‘inevitably a controversial matter’. The government used the Queen’s Speech to promise tougher curbs on access to housing, out-of-work benefits and healthcare, but ministers admit they are hamstrung by some EU rules. The Home Office highlights in its review fears that allowing people to move around the EU could be having a ‘disproportionate impact on the social security systems of some member states’. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The result of the reports will be a comprehensive, thorough and detailed analysis of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK on the issues of asylum and immigration, and free movement of persons. ‘It will aid our understanding of the nature of our EU membership and it will provide a constructive and serious contribution to the wider European debate about modernising, reforming and improving the EU.’ Immigration minister Mark Harper said the review would pinpoint ways to 'modernise and improve' the EU  French President Francois Hollande has ruled out allowing Britain to renegotiate its membership . The review of family law includes the powers to resolve disputes where a parent takes a child to another part of the EU without the other parent’s consent. It also covers claiming maintenance payments from estranged fathers who move to a different member state. The culture review questions the effectiveness of heritage programmes masterminded by Brussels and whether the involvement of the EU in tourism policy makes it harder for countries to compete for visitors. Trade experts are asked by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about the benefits of EU’s trade policy benefits and whether Britain  succeeds in curbing the protectionist instincts of other member states. However French President Francois Hollande has made clear he will not allow Britain to renegotiate new membership terms. ‘To repatriate [powers]? Usually when a country commits, it is for life,’ he said last year. ‘I believe that treaties are meant to be complied with. This discussion could take place, but Europe is not a Europe in which you can take back competences. It is not Europe à la carte.’","Prime Minister ordered review of European Union's power over Britain .

Mr Wharton was among 114 Tory MPs who . voted in favour of an amendment to the Queen’s Speech on Wednesday, . regretting that the Government had failed to include legislation on an . EU referendum in its legislative agenda for the coming year because of . the opposition of Lib Dems in the Coalition. Mr Cameron, who has already pledged . to hold a referendum if he is Prime Minister after the next election, . has agreed instead to throw his support behind a private member’s Bill. George Osborne, second left, hailed the EU referendum bill as he joined India's Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, right on a tour of the Pudding Mill Lane Crossrail construction site, in east London . Mr Osborne said the Tories would appeal to Eurosceptics in other parties to back the in-out vote . In a highly unusual move for such . legislation, a three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – . will be imposed on Tory MPs in a vote on Mr Wharton’s Bill, meaning any . members of the . The Prime Minister is preparing to appoint a new chief whip amid warnings that discipline on the Conservative benches is close to collapse. Former defence secretary Liam Fox is tipped as the leading candidate to replace the veteran Cabinet minister Sir George Young. David Cameron could make the change as early as July. ‘It is clear David needs a bruiser,’ said a source, adding: ‘Liam Fox holds great sway on the Right, elements of which look increasingly out of control.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and former chief whip Andrew Mitchell are also being considered for the role. Government who might vote against it will have to resign. Mr Wharton warned Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg to ‘think long and hard’ before ordering his MPs to . vote against the Bill, pointing out that the Lib Dems had promised an . in/out referendum before the 2010 election. The row over an EU referendum has pitched the Coalition parties into their most fractious arguments to date. But sources said claims that some senior Tories had begun to plan for an early break-up of the Government were ‘nonsense’. Labour leader Ed Miliband also faces a . dilemma. Tory sources said that if Labour tried to block the draft . Bill, it would show ‘contempt’ for voters who want the first say on . Britain’s place in Europe since 1975. George . Osborne revealed an operation would be launched to persuade Labour and . Lib Dem Eurosceptics to also vote to support a referendum. The Chancellor said Mr Wharton is 'going to have . the full support of the Conservative party; David Cameron, myself, we’re . going to make sure Conservative MPs get behind it, we’re going to try . and persuade rebel MPs from other parties to back us'. Speaking during a visit  the Pudding . Mill Lane Crossrail construction site, in east London, Mr Osborne told . BBC News: 'When the dust settles people can see that the Conservative . party wants to give people a choice, an In/Out choice, on Britain’s . membership of Europe. David Cameron published the draft bill this week in an attempt to show his commitment to a referendum . 'We’ve got a chance to legislate for . it in Parliament and it’s now up to the other parties what they’re going . to do. It’s pretty clear they’re actually against giving people a . choice and that is going to be put to the test.' Nearly half of British people would vote to leave the European Union, according to a poll asking the official referendum question. The YouGov poll for The Sun found 43 per cent of people believed the UK should not remain in the EU, while 37 per cent said it should. People were asked: 'Do you think the UK should remain a member of the EU?' Some 16 per cent said they didn't know, while three per cent would not vote.","James Wharton tops list of backbenchers to introduce their own legislation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:15 EST, 16 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:19 EST, 16 May 2013 . A Chinese high-altitude rocket launch this week was the first test of an interceptor that could destroy orbiting satellites, claims a U.S defense official. The launch, said by the Chinese to be a science mission, reached 6,250 miles (10,000km) above the Earth - the highest suborbital launch since 1976. No objects were placed into orbit, the Pentagon said yesterday. The rocket re-entered Earth's atmosphere above the Indian Ocean. China launched the rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, seen at a previous lunar launch in 2010 . 'We tracked several objects during the flight but did not observe the insertion of any objects into orbit and no objects associated with this launch remain in space,' said Lieutenant Colonel Monica Matoush, a Pentagon spokeswoman. China said the rocket, launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in western China, carried a science payload to study the earth's magnetosphere. 'I want to emphasize that China has consistently advocated for the peaceful use of outer space and opposes the weaponization of outer space as well as an arms race in outer space,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing. 'The experiment was designed to investigate energetic particles and magnetic fields in the ionized stratum and near-Earth space,' reported the state-run Xinhua news agency. 'According to a preliminary analysis by the NSSC [National Space Science Center], the experiment has reached expected objectives by allowing scientists to obtain first-hand data regarding the space environment at different altitudes.' However, a U.S. defense official said intelligence showed that the rocket could be used in the future to carry an anti-satellite payload on a similar trajectory. 'It was a ground-based missile that we believe would be their first test of an interceptor that would be designed to go after a satellite that's actually on orbit,' said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, declined to comment specifically on the rocket launch, but said China was clearly taking a more aggressive posture in space. 'Any time you have a nation-state looking to have a more aggressive posture in space, it's very concerning,' Rogers said at a Reuters Cybersecurity Summit. The United States remains concerned about China's development of anti-satellite capabilities after Beijing shot a missile at one of its own defunct satellites in orbit in 2007, creating an enormous amount of debris in space. Monday's rocket launch was similar to launches using the Blue Scout Junior rocket that were conducted by the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s for research on Earth's magnetosphere, Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said. The Pentagon said no objects had been left in orbit following the Chinese rocket's return to the atmosphere (file photo) He said all the previous suborbital launches above 10,000km had been conducted by the United States. All China's previous missile tests reached less than 2,000km, although Beijing had launched orbital vehicles higher, including to the moon, he said. Most scientific suborbital launches are at most 1,500km or so, McDowell added. The 1976 launch was Gravity Probe A, when NASA and McDowell's institute worked together to launch an atomic clock to 10,280km. Monday's launch came less than a week after U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter unveiled what he called a 'long overdue' effort to safeguard U.S. national security satellites and develop ways to counter the space capabilities of potential adversaries. U.S. military space officials are taking steps to improve the resilience of national security satellites in orbit, the defense official said. These include using new wave forms to make it more difficult for adversaries to jam signals from space, putting U.S. sensors on commercial satellites and using terrestrial high-frequency communications. Last week, the Pentagon released an 83-page report on Chinese military developments that highlighted China's increasing space capabilities and said Beijing was pursuing a variety of activities aimed at preventing its adversaries from using space-based assets during a crisis.","China launched what it said was a science mission on Monday night .

A mother claimed today her daughter was pushed to suicide after police refused to reopen an investigation into sexual abuse she suffered as a child. Oxford graduate Dr Suzanne Dow, 33, took an overdose of prescription medication in October 2011, at her home in Nottingham. An inquest later found her 'neighbours from hell' and a failed love affair had only partially contributed to the gifted academic's despair and a narrative verdict was recorded. Narrative verdict: Suzanne Dow who took an overdose of prescription medication in October 2011 . But her mother, Maureen Dow, 65, claimed her daughter killed herself because the man who abused her, aged ten, had gone unpunished. Dr Dow's abuser admitted what he had done to Suffolk Police in 1991 but because she was so young her mother decided she didn't want her to give evidence in court. That meant that the matter could only be dealt with by way of a caution and Dr Dow had spent the rest of her life haunted by the knowledge her attacker was still free. But when the bright young doctor finally plucked up the courage to pursue her abuser she was told by police that the case was closed. And Suffolk Police said there was no way to reopen the matter because all the original paperwork had been destroyed - as was force policy at the time. Six months later Dr Dow committed suicide, leaving her heartbroken mother to dwell on the prospect that her abuser may never be brought to justice. Suzanne Dow's former house in Nottingham, which was next door to a drugs den . Mrs Dow today said she had chosen to break her silence after learning Suffolk Police revealed had handed out 87 cautions in five years for serious sex attacks. The grieving mother, from Colchester, Essex, has demanded no other victims should endure the heartache she and her daughter had been left to suffer. She said: 'I think children should be protected. People need to be protected and they need to be aware. 'The damage this causes to children lasts a lifetime. If he was given a caution what would have stopped him abusing other children? 'It was never publicly acknowledged he was a danger. As the press have said now, it is only when you make these things public that more victims come forwards.' An inquest in Nottingham held earlier this year concluded Dr Dow had in part been driven to her suicide by troublesome neighbours, as part of a narrative verdict. 'I just want people to understand what she went through and how the abuse affected her life.' Suzanne's mother . The inquests heard that she lived in fear, was unable to sleep, witnessed drug deals on her doorstep and found hypodermic needles by her home. But despite her daughter's torment Mrs Dow revealed it was the torment of her sexual abuse, which had been the underlying problem. She added: 'It always came back to the abuse. We as a family, believed it was the sexual abuse that caused Suzie's death. It affected her life. 'Her fragility was based on the sex abuse. It just never went away fro Suzanne. She was just a totally innocent child and it ruined her childhood. 'I just want people to understand what she went through and how the abuse affected her life. I cry every day for Suzie. She's my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night.' Suffolk Police had got rid of archived material and taped recordings of the police interview because it was not their policy to keep it on file once they had issued a caution. A force spokesman said: 'We can confirm that in April 2011, Suffolk Police contacted the mother of a victim who had claimed that a man had been arrested and cautioned in connection with a crime alleged to have taken place in the 1980s. 'We can also confirm that this approach to the mother was prompted by a call from Nottinghamshire Police to Suffolk Police the same month asking Suffolk to investigate. 'Following extensive enquiries, including searching archives and taped interview records held by Suffolk, it was found that the relevant documentation relating to the initial investigation did not exist. 'It appears this would have been destroyed in accordance with policies regarding cautions that were in place at the time of the original inquiry.' He added: 'Suffolk Police takes reports of sexual offences extremely seriously and they are all investigated. 'The sexual offences recording category includes a wide range of offences, ranging from the lower level to the more serious, such as a stranger rape. 'The circumstances in which a caution may be an appropriate outcome may be an inter-familial case, incidents where both the offender and the victim are young children, or consensual sexual activity between those who are underage. 'However, as with any reported crime the concerns of the victim are always at the forefront of our policing and any investigations that are concluded with a caution are only done so after careful consideration and if it is felt appropriate for all parties concerned. 'While policies were previously in place where records in relation to cases concluded with cautions were destroyed after three years, new guidelines mean that information is now retained by police.'","Dr Suzanne Dow, 33, took an overdose of prescription medication .

A bride-to-be born with no arms has learned to scuba dive so she can swim amongst the coral with her husband on honeymoon in the Maldives. Laura Britland, 32, was determined to dive with Jon Furness, who she marries next month, despite her disability. She was warned that you need arms for propulsion and hands to control the tanks, valves and mask underwater - but scuba experts developed a new technique allowing her to overcome this. Determined: Laura Britland, 32, pictured here with her scuba instructors Marcus Bancroft (left) and Dave Lowe - has learned to scuba dive despite having no arms so she can swim underwater on honeymoon . Ms Britland uses her feet to tackle everyday tasks at home - but underwater the diving flippers get in the way. So the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so she can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees. She said: 'I was looking for something to do as a challenge and I was spurred on when somebody said I couldn’t do it. It wasn’t easy at first but like everything else if you are determined you’ll succeed. 'If I felt myself getting knocked back I would think about how much I want to dive in the Maldives on honeymoon with Jon.' Technique: Mr Lowe adjusts her breathing apparatus in the pool. Ms Britland uses a special technique which enables her to propel herself through the water, despite her disabilities . Swim: The scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so Laura can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees . Practice: She goes through her paces in the pool. Ms Britland said the attraction of diving was that it is 'peaceful and calm' Ms Britland learned to swim when she was a little girl but only on her back because you need arms to keep your head out of the water. But she said her greatest fear was making the 'giant stride' - the term divers use to describe the moment they step over the edge of a pool or boat into the water. She said: 'Since I was a child I’ve been taught not to fall, as I’d end up flat on my face because I can’t put out a hand to stop me. So stepping forward into the water felt alien to me, but now I’ve got used to making that giant stride. Future: Ms Britland - pictured here with fiance Jon Furness - has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club . 'The other problem was the diving mask, you need a hand to take it off and clear it from water or misting. I had to concentrate on remaining calm when my mask was full of water instead of panicking, as that made it more difficult to clear.' Ms Britland said she developed a technique of looking up and putting her tongue on the roof of her mouth then breathing through her nose to clear the mask. The charity worker, of Rugby, Warwickshire, has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club. She is now planning her first open water dive at the Stoney Cove National Diving Centre, a former quarry, near Leicester. Ms Britland, and  civil servant Mr Furness, 33, are getting married in Sheffield next month and will honeymoon in the Maldives later this year. She was born without arms due to a genetic condition but said her parents refused to treat her any differently to any other child. She said: 'I was born without arms - there’s never been an explanation why, but it seems to be genetic. I’ve never been interested in finding out the reason. 'My parents’ attitude has always been just to get on with it, they never let me say I couldn’t do anything - I couldn’t get out of helping around the house. I use my feet a lot, where other people would use their hands.' She said the attraction of diving for her 'is that it is peaceful and calm, and, when I dive, I feel the same as other people.' Love: The couple are now looking forward to looking at the coral and tropical fish on their honeymoon . Ms Britland is about to take delivery of a custom-made £950 armless dry-suit with buoyancy valves built-in so she can use her chin or knees to adjust them. The zip has also been adapted so she can fasten it herself. Mr Furness, who is also learning to dive, said: 'I’m really proud of her - if you tell Laura she can’t do something she will prove them wrong. I can’t wait to dive together in the Maldives and hopefully have our photograph taken together underwater.' The pair praised diving instructors Marcus Bancroft and Dave Lowe who rigged up the elaborate system that allows Ms Britland to operate her scuba equipment with her knees. Mr Bancroft, 42, said: 'Laura is a brave and inspiring young woman - by the time her honeymoon comes around she will be a competent diver.'","Laura Britland, 32, determined to overcome disability so she could dive .

The flan flinging free-for-all was scheduled to close the first Bakewell Baking Festival, held in the Derbyshire town which is home to the famous cherry-topped cake. But Mayor Paul Morgans has been unable to find an insurer to cover the event because it is 'too dangerous'. In the 1976 film Bugsy Malone, a custard pie fight made everyone realise they could be friends. Insurers told people in Bakewell (famous for its tarts) they are seen as dangerous . He said: 'I have rung round dozens of insurance companies - none of which will cover this event as it is classed as a sport. 'But really - how can a paper plate and some custard foam be more dangerous than horse riding or rugby or even crossing the road? It's a classic case of world gone mad. 'These insurance companies are really damaging our country and taking all the pleasure out of being alive. 'I'm surprised there isn't rioting in the streets. It's ridiculous.' Bakewell, a picturesque town in the Derbyshire Dales, is famous for its confectioneries, including the Bakewell Tart and the Bakewell Pudding - a flan stuffed with egg and almonds.

David Cameron has pledged to support women who stay at home and raise children . David Cameron has pledged to support women who stay at home to raise children, fuelling hopes that he will act on his promise to recognise marriage in the tax system. The Prime Minister has come under fire from stay-at-home mothers after excluding them from new childcare plans. He was also criticised for stopping child benefit for families living off a single salary at a lower income level than those with two wage earners. But he denied ministers were trying to force mothers back to work. Mr Cameron also signalled that he was preparing to dilute controversial plans to increase the number of children a childminder can look after, following opposition from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg. The Prime Minister said he did not agree with Business Secretary Vince Cable that there was ‘prejudice’ against stay-at-home mothers. He added: ‘I support the choices mums make. If they want to work we should support that, and if they want to stay at home we should support that. The idea is not to dictate to people what they should do, but to support the choices they make. ‘There are lots of things we do that help stay-at-home mums. The support we’re giving for nursery education is a good example.’ His words will encourage Tory MPs and ministers who are lobbying him to fulfil his promise to create a marriage tax break. Speculation is mounting that George Osborne may bring in a modest tax break in his autumn statement. But some Tories believe it will come too late to take effect before the next election in 2015. The Prime Minister also suggested he was willing to compromise over the Coalition’s childcare plans after Mr Clegg withdrew his support at the last moment. Ministers were planning to relax the rules on the number of children childminders and nursery staff can care for. But in a late change of heart this month, Mr Clegg said he had serious concerns about the plans, which would allow nursery staff to look after six two-year-olds. Nick Clegg withdrew his support for the Coalition's childcare plans at the last moment following a call in to his LBC Radio by campaigner Laura Perrins . Laura Perrins told Clegg many families felt discriminated against by a £1,200 tax break . This enraged Education Secretary Michael . Gove, who accused Mr Clegg of blocking the plans to bolster his . position as Lib Dem leader. Mr Clegg’s U-turn followed an embarrassing phone-in on his LBC radio show in March, when he was harangued by barrister and mother-of-two Laura Perrins. The 32-year-old, who gave up her legal career to look after her children, told him many traditional families felt discriminated against by the announcement that working parents only would receive a tax break of up to £1,200 per year to cover soaring childcare costs. Mrs Perrins, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’. Yesterday, Mr Cameron said it was pointless getting frustrated with Mr Clegg’s change of tack, adding: ‘Trying to get quality affordable childcare is a priority for the Government. The proposals we put forward had a lot of merit. ‘Clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the Coalition about how best to go forward. ‘There’s no point getting too frustrated. We’ll find a way forward that I hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare.’ From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would also be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. The ratio for three-year-olds would remain unchanged. Tory sources claim this would cut nursery costs by around £1,300 a year without compromising quality. But the plans were criticised by childminders and mothers.","Prime Minister under fire from stay-at-home mothers over childcare plans .

In the running: Anthony Weiner is about to announce his campaign to be Mayor of New York . Anthony Weiner is about to announce that he will run to be Mayor of New York City, it was reported today. The disgraced former congressman has . been flirting with the idea of a political comeback ever since he . re-emerged into the public eye earlier this year. Now he is believed to have appointed a campaign manager, and will officially announce his candidacy within the next few days. Mr Weiner, 48, was forced to resign . as U.S. congressman for a district in Queens in 2011 after it emerged . that he had sent explicit pictures of himself to a 21-year-old woman. Over the past few months the Democrat . has conducted a series of interviews in a bid to rehabilitate his . public image, and has long been suspected of harbouring an ambition to . succeed Michael Bloomberg as Mayor. One poll last month put Mr Weiner at second place among New York voters, behind only the current favourite Christine Quinn. Now sources have confirmed that he . will announce his candidacy before Memorial Day on May 27 in order to . meet the deadlines for filing election papers next month. 'He's definitely running,' a friend told the New York Post today. A major step towards confirming his . candidacy came this month when Mr Weiner hired Danny Kedem as his . campaign manager, according to Politico. Mr Kedem is an experienced Democratic . operative who was involved with a congressional campaign in Staten . Island ahead of last year's elections. The candidate has also hired a press secretary and is moving to appoint staff to other key roles. Couple: Mr Weiner is married Huma Abedin, who is one of the top aides to Hillary Clinton . Mr Weiner suffered a blow this week . when it emerged that he will not attract the support of Bill and Hillary . Clinton, who have distanced themselves from him despite their . friendship with his wife Huma Abedin, one of the top aides to the former . Secretary of State. 'The Clintons wish Weiner would just . disappear. Every time he pops up, it’s a reminder of Bill’s scandal with . Monica Lewinsky, and it isn’t helpful to Hillary’s hopes for 2016,' an . unidentified Democrat told the New York Post's Page Six. The references to Lewinsky will . inevitably be a distraction if Hillary decides . to run as the Democratic nominee for president in the next election, . and since many consider her the party's front runner, it is important . for her to take steps to keep it that way. Close: But Mrs Clinton and her husband are unlikely to support Mr Weiner's mayoral bid this year . Overlapping: Hillary, seen here when she was a Senator for New York, worked with then-congressman Anthony Weiner and knows him socially through her work with Huma . Mr . Weiner has been opening up publicly in the last month through a series . of interviews to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers, and in one of the . profiles Ms Abedin told The New York Times that Mrs Clinton was a major source of support for her when the scandal broke. 'We’ve had a lot of personal . conversations, none of which I feel comfortable talking about. But what I . will say about her, and for that matter her entire family, the . unconditional love and support they have given me has been a real gift,' she told the Times. It . comes as little shock that Ms Abedin finds the former President a . supportive friend as well, since he performed her wedding ceremony in . 2010. The potential . problems with a Weiner campaign are effectively connected to how close . Ms Abedin is with her longtime boss, who is now considered favourite to . be the next Democratic presidential nominee.","Weiner will announce start of campaign within next few days, source says .

Ariel Castro's daughter who is in an Indiana prison for slashing her baby's throat has revealed that she went to school with Amanda Berry - meaning Castro used his daughters to get to know two of the three women he allegedly held captive in his house for ten years. Emily Castro spoke out for the first time in a jailhouse interview with a private investigator on Monday. She is the last of Castro's children to condemn his alleged crimes of kidnapping, raping and beating Amanda, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. Also on Monday, a female officer who first broke down the door of Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland after Amanda broke herself out last week revealed that Michelle clutched onto her and begged her not to let go when she was rescued. Condemned: Emily Castro, 25, said her father was a 'monster' for using his daughters to get to his alleged kidnapping victims . Abused: Amanda Berry, seen with the daughter she bore to Ariel Castro, went to the same elementary school as Emily Castro . Ariel Castro plans to plead not guilty to charges of kidnapping and rape of the three women . Emily Castro, 25, told private investigator Chris Giannini that she knew both Gina and Amanda before they were kidnapped, according to recordings of the interviews broadcast by Fox 8 TV in Cleveland. Concerning her relationship with Amanda, Emily Castro said: 'I went to Wilbur Wright (Elementary School in Cleveland) with her. I seen Gina a couple times. 'It couldn't be coincidence.' Emily Castro's younger sister Arlene says she was best friends with Gina when she was taken off a busy Cleveland street in 2004. Anthony Castro, Ariel's son, told MailOnline last week that he fears his father targeted Gina, then 14, because of her relationship with Arlene. Best of friends: Arlene Castro (right) was the last person to see Gina DeJesus (left) in 2004. Ariel's children fear he target Gina because she was familiar to him, as well . According to reports, Emily Castro was in the car with her father moments before Amanda was abducted in 2003. 'It hurts so bad. I feel so used. I feel like I'm nothing to him. I'm nothing anymore,' she said. She said her father was a master at keeping secrets, even from his own daughter. When she came to visit him after the girls were abducted, he made subtle excuses to keep her away from his captives. 'The upstairs was blocked off with the big bass speaker, so I figured that since he lived there alone so long that he didn't have any need for those four bedrooms upstairs,' she said. When she asked to sleep in her old bedroom, he told her no. He said: 'It's cold up there, it's blocked off, it's dusty,' according to Emily. Emily's Grimilda mother moved her and her three siblings out of the house in 1996 after Grimilda endured years of brutal beatings and savage control of her life. Cleveland police officer Barbara Johnson described the harrowing experience of breaking into Castro's house and finding Michelle Knight . Emily, like her sisters and her brother before her, condemned her father for his actions. 'He's a monster. Seeing the guy that hugged us and misled with us and took us to eat and cared about us supposedly, that he is the guy that is in handcuffs...' she said. Emily Castro is serving 25 years in an Indiana prison for slashing her 11-month-old daughter's throat in 2007. The child survived and Castro told a judge she was mentally ill and did not know what she was doing when she attacked her child. Also on Monday, female Cleveland police officer Barbara Johnson told of how she was one of the first officers to enter the house where the three women were kept in chains for a decade. 'Michelle hugged me first, then clutched me and said, ""Don't let me go,""' she said, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'You can't really describe how I felt...it rips the heart out of my chest.' Another officer said he felt a sense of evil in the house when he entered it.","Emily Castro said she went to elementary school with victim Amanda Berry and knew Gina DeJesus .

Melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century, scientists claim. They claim there is a one in 20 chance that ocean levels around the British coast could be around a metre higher by 2100 as a result of climate change. If such rises were to take place, London’s current sea defences would struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade. How the South East could be hit: Researchers say the areas in red would be completely underwater, and believe the Thames Barrier would struggle to cope, with the capital at risk of flooding once a decade . Using a model of ‘medium’ climate . change, they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm (1.4 in) and . 36.8cm (14in) to average global sea levels by 2100. Warming . temperatures also cause the sea to expand, in effect doubling the . increase from ice melt. Once this is taken into account, alongside storm . surges and weather patterns, the team say the ‘best guess’ for overall . rise in sea levels globally could be from 6cm (2.4in) up to 69cm (27in). The team of scientists from the European Ice2sea programme, including academics from the British Antarctic Survey and University of Bristol, are the first to try and accurately predict how polar ice melt will contribute to rises in future sea levels. The authors say the report is the most detailed yet into the loss of ice from Greenland, Antarctica and glaciers. Using a model of ‘medium’ climate change, they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm (1.4 in) and 36.8cm (14in) to average global sea levels by 2100.

How melting glaciers cause sea rise: Using a model of ?medium? climate change, they expect ice melt will contribute between 3.5cm (1.4 in) and 36.8cm (14in) to average global sea levels by 2100. Warming temperatures also cause the sea to expand, in effect doubling the increase from ice melt. Once this is taken into account, alongside storm surges and weather patterns, the team say the ‘best guess’ for overall rise in sea levels globally could be from 6cm (2.4in) up to 69cm (27in). Rises at the more extreme end of the scale would spell disaster for small Pacific island states like Tuvalu, and other low-lying nations such as the Maldives. Cities inhabited by millions, including London and New York, will also have to have to build up defences. The Thames Barrier would struggle to cope with predicted storm surges, experts say, leaving London at risk of 'great floods' Current defences are only adequate to provide protection to the one-in-one thousand years, shown by the dark black line. This would be substantially reduced with a change in regional sea level to approximately once in 12 years with a metre rise, the researchers say. Professor David Vaughan, of the British Antarctic Survey who is coordinating the programme, said: ‘Today as the glaciers and ice sheets lose their ice, the water that they once held has melted and flowed in to rivers and seas, increasing their volume and raising global sea levels. ‘Current rates of sea level rise are already having impacts on the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems. ‘It is likely some future ice loss and sea level rise is now unavoidable. Ice2sea projections of regional variations in sea-level rise to 2100: The top image shows the 'mid-range' scenario of ice loss, and bottom the 'high-end' scenario. These scenarios were developed from ice2sea projections and take account of uncertainty in emissions, global climate, and glacial . projections. The black lines show the contour of mean global sea-level rise due to continental ice-loss, thermal expansion of the oceans. 'But nevertheless, understanding why changes are occurring today and how they could increase in the future is the first step in maintaining the security of our coastal regions for future generations.’ The researchers said if climate change continued to accelerate, it would lead to bigger sea level rises and more extreme storm surges. And they said rises in sea levels would not stop after 2100, with increases between 2100 and 2200 likely to be much greater than during the 21st century. Capitals around the world would be hit. The team predict the rises could entirely wipe out the Maldives . Floods like brought by Superstorm Sandy could begin to devastate New York City every two years as sea levels rise by five feet by the year 2100, according to the startling new predictions released by climate scientists. The sea level projections mean that much smaller floods will produce more catastrophic effects on the city. New York was proven to be extremely vulnerable by the 11-foot storm surge that battered the city in October. The new data could reignite debate over whether the city should construct a $17billion system of flood barriers and spend another $12billion shoring up outlying areas of the city like the Rockaway Peninsula.","Melting ice from the poles could make sea levels rise by up to three feet by the end of the century, new predictions claim .

Life-saving operation: Toby Dring, from north Yorkshire, had open heart surgery at 22 hours old, with mother Sophie . Parents of children with serious heart conditions were ‘obstructed’  from seeking treatment elsewhere by staff at a scandal-hit heart unit, campaigners have claimed. Heart operations on children at Leeds General Infirmary were suspended on Thursday night following concerns over high death rates and allegedly unsafe practices. A senior heart surgeon at the unit has also been banned from operating on children while ‘aspects of his practice’ are investigated. NHS bosses said they had been forced . to act after finding that death rates were twice the national average – . with ‘clear blue water’ between the number of patients dying at the unit . and mortality rates elsewhere. The . suspension of the unit provoked a huge political row yesterday, with . MPs and some parents claiming the timing – just 24 hours after a High . Court ruling quashed plans to close the centre – was ‘deeply . questionable’. Some experts said the data on death rates was ‘preliminary’ and should not have been used to justify the suspension. But yesterday shocking new claims emerged that families unhappy with the care at the unit had been blocked from going elsewhere. Staff at the unit – which has been operating under threat of closure since last year – were said to have been so desperate for patients not to go to another hospital that they gave ‘wholly inappropriate’ advice to patients. One such family was even reported to social services, it is alleged. The NHS safety watchdog the Care Quality Commission was sent a letter by the patient group HeartLine last month, claiming that: . Heartbreaking: Sophie Dring insisted to be referred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle after doctors at Leeds General Infirmary told her there was no chance Toby would survive . Sophie . Dring claims a cardiologist at Leeds General Infirmary tried to . pressure her into having an abortion when her unborn child was diagnosed . with a serious heart condition. The 26-year-old said her son Toby, . now 18 months, only survived because she researched his condition and . discovered he could have life-saving surgery. Miss Dring was five months pregnant . when she was told her baby had hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which . occurs when the left side of the heart fails to form properly. She claims a consultant cardiologist then told her there was no chance of him surviving and that she should have a termination. However, after finding there was an . operation possible – at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle – she . insisted she be referred there. Toby was induced at 39 weeks on . September 8 2011 and transferred immediately to the Freeman Hospital, . where he underwent major surgery when he was just 22 hours old. Miss Dring, of Whitby, North . Yorkshire, welcomed news of a review into care service at Leeds General . Infirmary. She said: ‘Toby still has a long way to go and will need a . heart transplant in the future but he is doing well. ‘He lives life to the full. It is heartbreaking to look at him and think he wouldn’t be here if Leeds had their way.’ The letter compared the situation to . the Bristol heart scandal in the 1990s, where 35 babies died and dozens . more were left brain-damaged by hospital failures. It . accuses the unit of trying to protect its reputation as a safe surgical . centre by sending complex surgeries to other centres or not risking . operations that may be unsuccessful. The LGI strongly denied ‘any suggestion we would act improperly’. But Anne Keatley Clarke, chief executive of the Children’s Heart Federation, which represents 22 bodies including HeartLine, said she had written to the CQC because she felt ‘morally obliged to flag up safety concerns’. She said: ‘It appears managers and clinicians in Leeds, together with the parent support group, have put their own interests ahead of the well-being of critically ill children.’ Critically ill: Toby Dring is the youngest person in the country to undergo open heart surgery. He had the operation in Newcastle after doctors at Leeds General Infirmary allegedly pressured mother Sophie to have an abortion . She claimed many families had been left too frightened to raise concerns in case it affected the care given to their children. Mrs Keatley Clarke said the ‘chilling’ parents’ cases came after numerous other worries had been raised about LGI, and called for the unit to be permanently closed. Leeds is one of three out of 14 children’s heart units set to close following last year’s Safe and Sustainable NHS Review aimed at providing services in a smaller number of specialised centres. Controversial decision: Sir Bruce Keogh as National Medical Director authorised the suspension of the unit . The unit fought back, with huge public support and a legal campaign against the closure. It won the first round of a court battle on Wednesday after judges found the consultation on closing the unit had been flawed. The move to close the unit over safety concerns just 24 hours later  led campaigners and MPs to question the basis of the court decision. Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said he was ‘stunned and appalled’ by the suspension and called for NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh to resign. He also called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to immediately lift the suspension of the Leeds unit. ‘Sir Bruce Keogh should resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe and Sustainable review,’ he said. The row intensified further when an expert claimed the mortality data on which the decision was based was ‘not fit to be used’. Dr John Gibbs, of the steering committee for the Central Cardiology Audit database, which supplied the data, said the figures were preliminary and had not undergone the ‘usual rigorous checking process’. But Sir Bruce yesterday said it would have been irresponsible to ignore a ‘constellation’ of warnings,  including mortality data. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: ‘I couldn’t sit back just because the timing was inconvenient, awkward or would look suspicious, as it does.’ The suspension was agreed by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, whose chief executive Maggie Boyle apologised to parents and families who will be affected. NHS England said the suspension was for checks to be made to ensure the unit is operating safely.The CQC last night admitted it had received claims that uncertainty over the future of children’s heart surgery at the LGI was harming outcomes. A CQC spokesman said: ‘We are in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements are in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients during the period of the review.’","Children's heart operations suspended at Leeds hospital on Thursday .

And for the wives, mothers and daughters who lose their loved ones to the sea rather than to war the burden is no less to bear. Now, modelling themselves on the success of the Military Wives, a group of women bound together by heartbreaking loss are finding support in each other, and singing. The newly formed Fishwives Choir have recruited almost 40 members from fishing communities all across the UK. Each has lost a relative to the sea and this week, with the help of the man behind the Military Wives, they recorded their first charity single. Scroll down for video . Modelling themselves on the Military Wives Choir, the newly formed Fishwives Choir have recruited almost 40 members from fishing communities all across the UK who have lost a relative at sea . The choir was the brain-child of mum-of-four Jane Dolby, 47, whose trawler-man husband Colin was drowned in a freak storm off the coast of Essex in 2008. As a young widow Mrs Dolby was confronted with the grief of losing her husband but also the struggle of providing for her children as a single mum. She admits she was left ‘penniless’ and without the charity the Fishermen’s Mission providing her with both financial and emotional support, says she ‘wouldn’t have survived.’ Now her idea to bring together women with similar experiences has come to life and their single, a unique arrangement of the Fisherman’s hymn ‘Eternal Father’, is set to be released in July. But Mrs Dolby, who works for a children’s charity in her home town of Southen-on-sea, never intended to launch a choir. She wanted to try and raise some money for the charity, suggesting to a few friends via Facebook that they do a karaoke style song to sell in the local pub. But almost overnight, she says ‘things snowballed’ and she found herself being contacted by women from all over the country asking if they could join in too. The choir was the brain-child of mum-of-four Jane Dolby, 47, whose trawler-man husband Colin was drowned in a freak storm off the coast of Essex in 2008, and now they're releasing their debut charity single . She said: ‘It’s so amazing to have had this little idea over a year ago and see it finally all coming together. ‘Most of us have has never even met each other other face-to-face before this week, let alone sing together but we’re all here for the same reason, to pay tribute to men we loved. ‘Colin made me a better person because he was someone that always did the right thing so I know he would be pleased that now I am doing the right thing for the Fishermen’s Mission. ‘The Mission supported the children and I from the first few hours after Colin went missing, I just can’t say enough good things about them.’ Mrs Dolby has also got huge support from another all female choir and even recruited their music producer Phil Da Costa to help too. She added: ‘The support we have had from the Military Wives has been fantastic - we all of us have the same fear that when our men go to work we don’t know if we’re going to see them again. ‘Living with that uncertainty hanging over you everyday bring us together and we all feel a strong and common bond. ‘Very often Colin went to work and he didn’t earn enough to cover the cost of diesel he put in the boat but it’s not just a job it’s in their blood. Music producer Da Costa, who produced the Military Wives' number one album, has donated his time to help the Fishwives and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success . ‘He had 400 years of fishermen in his family, he used to joke that he had salt water in his veins. ‘We want to use music to remind people yes we should be proud of our military and yes we should also be proud of our fishermen.’ Music producer Da Costa, who produced the Military Wives’ number one album, has donated his time to help the Fishwives and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success. He said: ‘The Military Wives became so successful that we set standard in pop music for choirs with the number one single and album. ‘They captured people’s hearts and I think this can be another one of those true life stories that really strike a chord with people. ‘It’s a very personal project for me, I’ve known Jane for years and I remember receiving the e-mail she sent us all in 2008 saying that her husband had gone out fishing and hadn’t come back. ‘This is a very similar thing to what we did with the Military Wives, a lot of them hadn’t sung together before but it means they’re a completely blank canvas and I find that really exciting.’ Sue Hendriks, 57, was one of the first members of the choir, as soon as she saw the Facebook advert she knew she had to be a part of it. She lost her husband Brian 12 years ago when he disappeared while out fishing on the rocks near their home in, Perranporth, Cornwall. She said: ‘On the day he died it was too rough for them to go out on the boat but he decided to go out angling off the rocks instead. ‘At tea time that day I had a knock on the door from the police saying they had found his fishing gear on the rocks and that he was missing.’ Brian’s body was found nine days later by one of his colleagues. He had a fractured skull leading officials to believe that he slipped on the rocks before being washed out to sea. He was 43. Mrs Hendriks said she joined the Fishwives with her daughter Jennie Ainsell, 29, to pay tribute to Brian. Their single, a unique arrangement of the Fisherman's hymn Eternal Father, is set to be released in July and they starred on The One Show this week . She added: ‘I wanted to do this in memory of Brian, he was a fisherman from the time he left school, the job meant the whole world to him. ‘The Fishermen’s Mission was so good to us, they don’t get as much publicity as some other charities but they offer vital support.’ Morna Young, 29, is one of the youngest members of the choir. She was five when her father Donnie, then 43, was pulled over board with the nets while fishing in the North Sea. As a professional musician Miss Young, from Burghead, Scotland, jumped at the chance to join the Fishwives and volunteered as one of the three solo vocalists. She said: ‘The thing that is special about this choir is that we all share part of a very special identity. ‘Fishing is always told from a male point of view but that is why this choir is so amazing, it tells the stories of the communities through women’s eyes. Peter Shaw from the Fishermen's Mission said it was 'incredibly rewarding' to watch the choir rehearse and called them 'an inspiration' ‘Most of us have really only just met but we feel like we know each other already, fishing is something that is in your blood, I can’t describe it.’ Peter Shaw from the Fishermen’s Mission said it was ‘incredibly rewarding’ to watch the choir rehearse and called them ‘an inspiration.’ He said: ‘We are a charity and we have people doing all kinds of things to raise money for us but this is really tremendous. ‘A whole group of fishwives coming together to sing for us is such an inspiration. ‘It helps raise our profile and raise our funds but it also gives us a feeling that we made a difference in supporting these families when they needed it, it makes it all incredibly rewarding. ‘It’s a beautiful way of saying thank you.’","Fishwives Choir recruited members from fishing communities .

At barely a couple of metres wide, this ramshackle home looks like a contender for the title of narrowest house in Britain. It sprung up in between two more solidly constructed houses in Leyton, east London, a month ago, leaving locals wondering who was behind it. Now Waltham Forest Council is investigating the house, which is believed not to have planning permission, and is expected to order it to be torn down imminently. The makeshift house has sprung up in Manor Road, Leyton, in the past month, leaving neighbours puzzled . The wooden house began to be built a month ago, apparently without planning permission . The wooden house, covered in plywood and lacking any obvious roof, fills a gap that used to house a dilapidated shed in the residential street. The plywood construction hides what used to be a dilapidated shed . Neighbours in Manor Road, who said there was a garage there before the shed, say they have not noticed anyone living at the newly-sprung up house while construction work goes on.

'They seem to have put this bizarre front on it, but what was there before was really, really horrible. I don’t have anything against it.' But one woman in her 70s who lives next door said: 'You’re going to have to be quite thin to live in there.' Waltham Forest council said: 'We are investigating and will take appropriate action.'

Images from the archive of a tiny Cambridge computer lab show the incredible technological revolution that has taken place over a single generation. From the world's first programmable computer, created in 1949, to the chunky first calculator with huge buttons and a chip that led to the iPad - the Cambridge lab has pioneered it all. And as the lab this year celebrates its 75th anniversary, this collection shows the effect a two man team, set up in 1938 has had on millions worldwide. Even before it revolutionised the world with the first programmable computer, the lab was the first to use London firm Modivo's electric calculating machine, shown in a picture from the lab's archive below. Scroll down for video . The lab was initially home to some very basic machines such as this early electric calculating machine, which was built by London firm Moldivo, but used at the Lab. With over 100 buttons, it was capable of Multiplication, Automatic Division, Addition and Subtraction. At the time the lab was created, computing was done by people, often mathematically gifted young women who carried out tedious numerical calculations by hand . Founded in the 1938 as the University of Cambridge’s Mathematical Laboratory with just two men based in an old Anatomy School, the lab was today hailed by Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt of Google as instrumental in the technological revolution. It was one of the first customers of electric calculator, but staff soon invented EDSAC, the first programmable computer ever brought into general service. Users prepared programmes by punching them on to paper, and the room sized machine measured 5m by 2m - a far cry from today's handheld gadgets. EDSAC was the first of many technological breakthroughs at the lab, including the computer password, the webcam (developed so engineers could get fresh coffee), the BBC Micro and the ARM chip that powers dozens of smartphones and tablets, including Apple's iPad.

Andy Hopper, professor of computer technology and current head of the lab, said: 'I believe that we are completely unique and that there is no other department in the world quite like us. 'Cambridge is the place where computers became a tool for general use, and the qualities that made that possible have never left us. 'They made us the biggest wealth conversion engine in the Cambridge cluster and therefore in Europe. 'And they have enabled us to achieve more than any other computer science department in the world.' In contrast with its humble beginnings, the centre is now home to dozens of staff and hundreds of students and is credited with giving rise to almost 200 technology firms.

Over . the decades it has been responsible for developments which contributed . to the rise of early home computers and the low power chips used in . mobile phones and iPads. The . 'Mathematical Laboratory' began life as a two-man team, confined to the . Anatomy School’s North Wing, and was charged with providing a resource . for solving complex problems by 'numerical methods'. When . John Lennard-Jones, a Theoretical Chemist who was to become its first . Director, submitted proposals for a computing facility in 1936, the idea . was described as 'extraordinary'. At . the time, a 'computer' was a person, very frequently a mathematically . gifted woman, employed to carry out tedious numerical calculations by . hand. Lennard-Jones’ visionary proposal was for a facility that would carry out complicated . calculations in support of wider University research, with the human . computers using 'recent developments in mechanical and electrical aids . to computation'. The . Lab’s early hardware consisted of these machines, and two analog . computers which were designed to solve linear differential equations. The Titan computer under construction at the lab. Titan was the prototype of the Atlas 2 computer, and was designed starting in 1963, and in operation from 1964 to 1973. One of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse Fourier Transforms of data from the One-Mile Radio Telescope. The first passwords: The CAP computer was the first successful experimental computer that demonstrated the use of security capabilities, both in hardware and software. It first became operational in 1976, using tokens or keys to allow users to access files and other information on the system. It greatly improved the security of computing at the lab. The team then went on to address the problem of security, inventing what was in effect the first computer password system.

The Trojan Room coffee pot was located in the corridor just outside the so-called Trojan Room within the old Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. However, engineers became bored of pointless trips to the coffee room - and decided a technological solution was the answer. They utilised a spare computer to create, on the user's desktop computer, a live 128×128 grayscale picture of the state of the coffee pot. They later created a version in a browser window, becoming the world’s first web cam. The invention was eventually used by others, and paved the way for the explosion in webcams and even videconferencing systems.

Ministers are considering allowing heterosexual couples to enter civil partnerships . Ministers are considering allowing heterosexual couples to enter civil partnerships as part of a desperate attempt to avoid defeat on their gay marriage Bill. In yet another U-turn to placate restive Tory backbenchers, the Government has promised a review into the future of civil partnerships five years after same-sex marriage becomes law. It will look at whether the partnerships should be scrapped – or whether they should also be offered to a man and woman as an alternative to marriage. The government has previously refused to . countenance such a move, saying it would undermine the ‘gold standard’ status of marriage. But Tory rebels – estimated at up to 150 – said the change did not go far enough. They said they would still vote on Monday for the immediate extension of civil partnerships to heterosexual couples – which they said was vital if marriage was to be extended to same-sex couples. Rebel leader Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, said he was confident of victory. ‘This amendment will not wash,’ he said. ‘If this Bill passes through Parliament as it stands, both marriage and civil partnerships will be available to same-sex couples, but opposite-sex couples would only have access to marriage. ‘This cannot be fair to the many couples in loving, stable relationships who for whatever reasons do not wish to go down the traditional marriage route, but who do want a public recognition of their commitment and protections under the law that civil partnerships rightly brought to gay couples.’ The new government amendment promising the review was tabled yesterday. Culture minister Maria Miller, who is in charge of equalities issues, said: ‘The Equal Marriage Bill is about extending marriage to same-sex couples. Questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. ‘There are strong views on both sides of . this debate, and we have listened to those views. We are therefore . offering the House the opportunity to have a review of this area, rather . than legislating now without the required evidence.’ Government previously refused such a move, saying it would undermine ¿gold standard¿ status of marriage . Rebel leader Tim Loughton said he was confident of victory . Only three days ago, Mrs Miller ruled out extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples completely, saying it was neither a ‘necessity or a requirement’. She told the parliamentary joint committee on human rights: ‘We don’t feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships to heterosexual couples because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way. 'It is already there for heterosexual couples. It’s called marriage.’ Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has campaigned for civil partnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples, said he was disappointed the move will not be implemented immediately and will only be considered as part of a review. ‘While the government’s promise of a review of civil partnership law is welcome, it is unnecessary,’ he said. ‘A majority of the public support the retention of civil partnerships and want to make them available to heterosexual couples, according to the government’s own public consultation last year. ‘David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making excuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to equality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. They’re not being consistent.’ A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘Civil partnerships were created for a very specific reason - to give same-sex couples access to legal rights at a time when society was not ready to give them access to marriage. ‘Now that the time is right to extend marriage to same sex couples, it is also right that we should consider the future of civil partnerships. ‘There are strong views on both sides of this debate, and we have listened to those views. A proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered and thorough way, giving full consideration to the implications of any changes.’","Government promised a review into the future of civil partnership .

She wrote: 'David...I understand how it's difficult to you to realise that I cannot be your girlfriend. 'Please understand this. I am so sorry.. I try to offer all that I can - my friendship..I cannot give you more..Sorry.' Following dozens more messages, Sartin hatched a plan to pay gangsters to kidnap Miss Barykina and have her shipped as a 'package' in a 'crate' to his home .

David Price, the leader of a gang of travellers who ripped off victims across the country, claimed he had spent some of the £1.3m gained on Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style presents . The leader of a gang of rogue traders which made more than £1.3 million by conning elderly people tried to get out of repaying the cash by claiming he had spent some of it on Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style presents. David Price led a gang of travellers who ripped off victims across the country by massively overcharging for unnecessary and shoddy home maintenance or gardening jobs, carefully picking the most vulnerable householders. He and members of his family from Brigg, Humberside, were jailed at Teesside Crown Court in 2011 for fraud and money laundering. A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing was held this week. Price, 44, who is currently serving more than seven-and-a-half years, told the hearing he spent thousands on weddings for others in his community, jewellery and furs from Bond Street, his horses and vans, as well as gambling and cigarettes. He told the court the show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings showed how travellers often clubbed together to pay for lavish ceremonies and splashed out on generous presents. But Judge Howard Crowson, sitting yesterday at Teesside Crown Court, said: 'In Mr Price's evidence there was an attempt to persuade me that it is part of his culture to provide lavish gifts at weddings and a reference to popular television in support. 'If I regarded popular television as a guide to behaviour in the general population I would do a disservice to the general population. 'Mr Price produced no evidence of any such purchase and mentioned not a single person to whom he had made such a gift.' The gang was found to have benefited from their crimes by a total of £1,338,047.40 and must repay £413,948.35 of that - but should their assets increase in future, they could be forced to pay back the full amount. Price now faces a longer jail term if he does not repay £368,350.77 of the £455,629 he was found to have benefited from through crime. His wife Angelina Price, also known as Nicholson, must pay back £22,149.60 of the £509,384.56 she benefited from. Judge Crowson said of David Price yesterday: 'My overall view was of a man who, whilst seeking to appear fair-minded, merely pretended to be making concessions as to expenditure when he was, at all times, seeking to mislead me so as to reduce his potential liability.' Angelina Price (left) must pay back £22,149.60 of the £509,384.56 she benefited from. Members of the Price family, from Brigg, Humberside (right) were jailed at Teesside Crown Court in 2011 for fraud and money laundering . A judge sitting at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) yesterday said Price 'produced no evidence' of buying lavish gifts for weddings . North Yorkshire Trading Standards officers began an 18-month investigation into the Prices after the gang moved to an illegal site off the A1 at Dishforth while on their way to Appleby Horse Fair and there were complaints about elderly people being conned by doorstep traders offering to carry out gardening work. Investigations revealed the lengths to which the gang would go to press their victims - some in their 90s and extremely frail, many suffering from dementia - to pay for work which was rarely ever done. One 85-year-old was pressured to part with £52,000; another victim, over 80 and the sole carer of a husband with dementia, was defrauded of more than £23,000 for gardening work. 'If I regarded popular television as a . guide to behaviour in the general population I would do a disservice to . the general population' - Judge Howard Crowson . As the investigation developed, hundreds of payments into multiple bank accounts held by the gang and their associates were found. Victims were found throughout Yorkshire and the Humber region and across other counties including Essex, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire. The Prices pretended to be genuine tree surgeons despite having no qualifications. The operation involved flyers, magnetic signs for their vans and staff in branded T-shirts, running seven or eight differently-named firms. When their caravan site was raided, officers found £25,000 in cash in a kettle. After the hearing, David Bowe, North Yorkshire County Council's director of business and environmental services, said: 'We are absolutely determined to use every tool available to us to protect vulnerable residents in this county from doorstep crime and to achieve justice for them, including compensation payments, when they have been defrauded by such appalling offenders as these. 'The Proceeds of Crime Act is an extremely valuable tool which is available to us and the courts to ensure that crime does not pay and that victims in cases such as this get their hard-earned savings back.' Trading Standards traced at least 81 victims, and they or their estates will be a priority to be repaid from the Prices' cash, a spokeswoman said.","David Price led gang of travellers who ripped off victims across country .

'I know that in Israel’s vibrant . democracy, every word, every gesture is carefully scrutinized,' Obama . said. 'But I want to clear something up just so you know: Any drama . between me and my friend, Bibi, over the years was just a plot to create . material for Eretz Nehederet.' 'That’s the only thing that was going . on,' he said, as the crowd applauded and laughed. 'We just wanted to . make sure the writers had good material.'

His . visit to Herzl's grave, together with yesterday's visit to see the Dead . Sea Scrolls, the ancient Hebrew texts, were symbolic stops for Obama.

'Here on . your ancient land, let it be said for all the world to hear,' Obama said . today. 'The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, . but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a . holocaust will never happen again.'

Before . leaving for Jordan, Obama was to have lunch with Netanyahu and then . tour the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Obama and his hosts arrived at the . somber Herzl grave site under cloudless skies. Obama approached Herzl's . resting place alone and bowed his head in silence. He turned briefly to . ask Netanyahu where to place a small stone in the Jewish custom, then . laid the stone atop the grave. 'It is humbling and inspiring to . visit and remember the visionary who began the remarkable establishment . of the State of Israel,' Obama wrote in the Mt. Herzl guestbook. 'May . our two countries possess the same vision and will to secure peace and . prosperity for future generations.' At Rabin's grave a short walk away, . Obama was greeted by members of Rabin's family. He initially placed a . stone on Rabin's wife's side of the grave, then returned to place one . atop Rabin's side.

Forging ties: President Obama shares a toasts with Israel's President Shimon Peres during his historic visit . Exchange: President Obama presented the Israeli leader with this framed wooden piece of Touro Synagogue -the oldest synagogue in the United States . 'It can only be read under a microscope,' said Yvette Gershon a reprsentative from the Technion-Israeli Institute of Technology. Making . Obama's gift involved a marriage of ancient history and complex modern . technology: 'The etching was done by accelerating charged atoms, called . ions, and bombarding them at various points on the surface of the chip,' said Ms Gershon added. 'When an ion beam hits the chip it creates a tiny recess, in this case 20 nanometers deep,' she explained. President Obama famously gave former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown a DVD boxset when he visited Washington in 2009. But . it seems this time he has learned his lesson and brought Netanyahu a . framed wooden piece of the Touro Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in the . U.S. and a national historic site.

Taxpayers are forking out more than £25,000 so that two dangerous inmates can have sex swap operations. The criminals, who are at high-security Full Sutton Prison, told officials they wanted to become women courtesy of free treatment on the NHS. Under Labour’s Gender Recognition Act, the Ministry of Justice had no option but to agree.’ Controversial: The two men are in Full Sutton Prison, which has admitted staff are being given extra training to 'support' them through the sex change process . The inmates – whose identities are being kept secret – have now begun a treatment programme. Once complete, they will be switched to a women’s jail to reflect their change of gender. Staff have been trained to support the convicts as they go through the process, which costs £13,500 each. Last night, Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, expressed shock that the surgery was going ahead at a time of budget cuts. He said: ‘Expensive treatment on the . NHS must be based on medical need, especially with the increasing care . demands placed on the Health Service. Part of prison involves removal of . a criminal’s liberty. ‘Many people will find it surprising . that these changes have been given the go-ahead given the huge, and . expensive, complications it will create.’ Details of the operations emerged in . the 2012 report by the Independent Monitoring Board for the 600-inmate . Category A and B prison – which holds terrorists and killers. It said the pair had ‘exercised their legal right of choice and requested the right to start on the path of changing gender’. Inmate: Serial killer Dennis Nilsen, who murdered 15, is currently at Full Sutton . The report adds: ‘Staff have received training and necessary arrangements have been put in place to support the prisoners.’ It comes at a time when the governor . at the jail has to find £1.1million in savings between 2013 and 2014. Inmates at Full Sutton, in East Yorkshire, include Dennis Nilson, who . murdered 15 men before dissecting their bodies, and Jeremy Bamber, who . killed his father, mother, sister and her six-year-old twins. This is not the first case of . dangerous prisoners being granted sex change procedures on the taxpayer. In 2011 it emerged that killer Robert Page was being called Emma, had . developed breasts after £200-a-month hormone treatment, wore a blonde . wig and was allowed to dress in skirts and blouses in the male Category A . jail HMP Wakefield. He is serving a life sentence for . killing Clive White, 56, during a bungled burglary and will be . transferred to nearby female prison HMP Newhall when the gender . reassignment surgery is complete. There has also been controversy over . the rights of prisoners to obtain other expensive treatments courtesy of . the taxpayer – including IVF to father children from behind bars. The . European Court of Human Rights has ruled blocking prisoners’ access to . IVF treatment may breach their right to a ‘private and family life’. Since a 2007 case involving a British . killer, 13 inmates have demanded the right to father children, citing . the decision. In 2011, one application was approved by then prisons . minister Crispin Blunt. But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last month . vowed to review the policy with a view to a ban – putting him on a . collision course with Europe.

And now pairs of tiny baby booties made from donated breast milk have been created by British designers. Simple kitchen equipment was used by Nick Gant and Tanya Dean, both lecturers at the University of Brighton in East Sussex, to transform proteins in the milk into a hard plastic-type material which was then moulded into the booties. They cannot be worn, but they have been created using milk donated by a mother to promote World Breast Milk Donation Day this Sunday. The tiny, one-inch booties were created using donated breast milk, from which proteins were extracted and then used to create a hard plastic-type material . The inch-long booties are not the first type of sustainable footwear to have been created by the innovative designers. The pair have made other sorts of shoe from . unusual waste materials. They . have created children's slippers from dog hair, flip flops from beach . waste collected by volunteers, recycled wine corks into men's brogues , Cinderella glass slippers . and they have 3D-printed a shoe from recycled office paper. Designer Tanya Dean shows the one-inch-long baby booties she has co-created with Nick Gant, using donated breast milk at the University of Brighton in East Sussex, to promote World Breast Milk Donation Day . The pair - described as 'masters of material manipulation' - have worked with brands including Absolut Vodka and Vivienne Westwood, and are currently working on producing a trainer using chip fat. Of their breast milk project, Mr Gant said: 'The aim is to highlight the importance of breast milk donation, and more broadly to challenge people's perceptions about so-called waste products. 'We want to show that they can be used to raise awareness and communicate issues about material culture, ethics and sustainability. 'Turning waste material like breast milk which couldn't otherwise be used, but which is embedded with meaning and personal history, into something new, gives the products created greater meaning and value.' Tanya Dean and Nick Gant have created other upcycled footwear, including children's slippers made from dog hair and flip flops made from plastic found on the beach . The process to create the booties was relatively simple. It involved gently heating some breast milk, then adding some vinegar to help form a congealed curd cluster, similar to mozzarella. It was then pressed into silicon moulds and dried over the course of four days. Also in their repertoire are men's brogues made from cork . There are plans for five more pairs of booties to be made. The first pair will be presented to a donor to mark World Breast Milk Donation Day. Mr Gant and Ms Dean worked with Gillian Weaver, manager of the milk bank at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in London, and chairwoman of the UK Association for Milk Banking's national forum. The milk bank, run by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, provides specially heat-treated breast milk collected from volunteer donor mothers for use in feeding sick and premature babies. Ms Weaver said: 'Seeing these tiny booties made from breast milk is a unique reminder of the valuable role that breast milk plays in helping premature babies to survive and grow.' Along with breast milk booties, left, Nick Gant and Tanya Dean have made slippers from dog hair, right . The pair have also created sustainable flip flops from plastic found on the beach and in the ocean which they turned into thread . Jewellery made from breast milk proved an unlikely hit among new mothers in April. Mommy Milk Creations is just one of several stores on craft site Etsy.com to plasticize breast milk samples so that it can be transformed into wearable keepsakes such as pendants and bracelets. Allicia . Mogavero from Southern Rhode Island in America, who runs the online store, . instructs buyers to send two tablespoons of their milk in a zip-lock . bag, so that she can preserve it in resin. Parenting trend: Mommy Milk Creations is just one of several stores on Etsy, which uses breast milk to create wearable keepsakes such as pendants, lucky charms and bracelets . The mother-of-three told MailOnline that she can 'barely keep up' with orders and the response has been 'overwhelming'. Customers tell her that the . jewelry 'is a gorgeous reminder of such a special time' and a great way . of commemorating 'the bonding experience you had with your child.' On receiving a breast milk sample, Ms Mogavero 'plasticizes' it, then molds it into miniature shapes such as hearts, moons, stars or tiny feet and hands. The 'milk bead' is then set in . clear resin and silver hooks and chains are added. The child's name . or a special message can also be included. Personalization: Mothers can choose to have their child's name added alongside the 'bead' of breast milk . Ms Mogavero warns that the color of the . finished piece will vary depending on the sample of milk and no two . pieces are ever the same. 'Some milk is more yellow than others, . other milk is very thin and will create a less bright bead, if you . will,' she writes on her website. 'There may be some areas in your breast milk bead that appear . slightly darker or whiter than the rest of the bead. This is because milk has fatty and non-fatty parts. 'For the most part your bead will look . like a uniform color but under very close inspection you may see the . slight color variations or speckles.' A restaurant in London sold breast milk ice cream to customers in a cocktail glass in 2011. Icecreamists, based in Covent Garden, named the £14 dish Baby Gaga... until Lady Gaga launched a lawsuit against them. Victoria Hiley, 35, from Leeds provided the first 30 fluid ounces of milk which was enough to make the first 50 servings. The recipe blended breast milk with Madagascan vanilla pods and lemon zest.

A father has been accused of shooting his orthodontist wife dead at their plush country club house while their two-year-old daughter was inside the home - before he eluded authorities for 12 hours. A manhunt was launched for Randolph Maidens, 42, after police responded to a welfare check at his Brentwood, Tennessee home at 5.49pm Sunday and found the body of his wife Rachael, 34. Authorities said it was not clear who called 911 to ask police to check on the family. When they arrived at the home in the Governors Club golf community, Maidens was nowhere to be seen. Officers found the couple's two-year-old daughter, Natalie, who was unharmed. Murdered: Randolph Maidens allegedly killed his wife Rachael Maidens in their gated community home . Brentwood police, helped by a SWAT . Team, a K-9 unit and . helicopters, launched an overnight manhunt for Maidens and put the gated community on lockdown as they searched the area. Maidens eventually walked out of the woods behind the back of his house and was taken into custody without incident at 6 am on Monday, ABC News reported. Brentwood police officials would not . comment on a possible motive for the crime, simply stating it was an . 'ongoing investigation'. But one neighbor described how she witnessed Maidens acting bizarrely three weeks ago. 'I saw him running through the woods behind our house, and he a had on a black ski . mask and a backpack that looked like a quiver,' the neighbor told WKRN-TV. Arrest: Maidens fled the home after allegedly killing his wife and leaving their daughter, 2, with her body .

County magistrate judge on Tuesday and was charged with homicide in the . death of his wife, the Williamson County Sheriff's Department told ABC . News. He is being held in  Williamson County Jail on a $2.5 million bond and will appear in court on May 2.

'I think to say just how sorry I am and I'm going to miss coming to the office and seeing her,' former patient Cindy Bayer told News Channel 5. 'She always had a smile and was always friendly.

As American Idol gears up for its 12th season, a new anonymous tell-all book about the inner workings of the hit reality singing competition is set to be released. Elimination Night, a thinly-veiled account of the talent show's tenth season, is touted as a work of fiction; however the book describes itself as 'so searingly accurate... that it had to be written anonymously.' Though names have been changed (even the show is renamed Project Icon), with a disclaimer that any similarities to the . real show are 'coincidental', the book's characters bear an overtly suspicious resemblance to judges Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler, Randy Jackson and host Ryan Seacrest. Elimination Night: A disclaimer says that any similarities to the real show are 'coincidental', but the book's characters bear an overtly suspicious resemblance to judges Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson . Season ten was the first year without Simon Cowell on the panel of judges, with two new stars taking the reigns: Mr Tyler and Ms Lopez. Written by an unidentified author with 'firsthand knowledge of the inner workings of a top TV talent show,' Elimination Night follows Sasha, a lowly production assistant responsible for the show's new aging rock star judge Joey Lovecraft and . Queens-born diva, Bibi Vasquez. Like American idol, the book’s 'Project Icon' sees itself struggling to win over viewers after the famed tough producer and judge, Mr Horrible, leaves to start a rival show called Talent Machine on the same network. In real life, the co-founder and judge everyone loved to hate, Mr Cowell, left the show to start X Factor. Tell-all: Elimination Night is touted as a work of fiction, however the book describes itself as 'so searingly accurate... that it had to be written anonymously' After Mr Horrible's departure, the show needs a new big name, so executives approach Bibi Vasquez, a singer whose song 'Bibi from the Hood' became an international success. She is known for . her outrageous outfits, and in the book is starring with her . then-fiance in a universally panned movie, titled Jinky. For anyone familiar with J. Lo's own . career, they will know her hit song Jenny from the Block catapulted her . into the subconscious of teens everywhere, and her film Gigli, which she starred in with her ex-finance Ben Affleck, was a flop. Bibi . agrees to appear on the show, but executive must adhere to a 78-page . contract, the last 20 of which are devoted entirely to her backstage . 'dressing' compound. The contract stipulates: 'Artist to be paid $60million per year. 'Artist's body to be insured with $1billion dollar policy in case of injury. (Breasts, buttocks to be valued . at $100 million each.) 'Crew to be forbidden to make eye contact with Artist at all times. 'Artist to be provided with . chauffeur-driven limo... a Rolls-Royce Phantom, white. Artist to select driver (male, under 25) from head/torso shots.' Meanwhile, Joey Lovecraft is . portrayed as a 62-year-old rock star that has just had a falling-out . with his band, Honeyload. He meets the Project icon producers on the . heels of a . rehab stint. Less than a year prior to making his . debut as an American Idol judge, it was announced that Steven Tyler had . quit Aerosmith to pursue a solo career, and Rolling Stone subsequently . reported that he had checked into rehab for pain management. Elimination Night is a thinly-veiled 'fictional tell-all' of American Idol during its tenth season. It is touted as a work of fiction; however the book's characters bear an overtly . suspicious resemblance to judges Jennifer Lopez, Steve Tyler, Randy . Jackson and Simon Cowell. In the book: JD Coolz is an overweight . session player and long-standing judge on Project Icon, who repeats the . phrase 'booya-ka-ka!' In real life: Randy Jackson, a former . session player and the last original host left on American Idol, used . the catchphrase 'In it to win it' in each episode. In the book: Bibi Vasquez, a new Project Icon judge, is a singer and actress who grew up in Queens and is known for her insurable derriere and hit song, Bibi from the Hood. In real life: Jennifer Lopez, a singer and actress who famously grew up in the Bronx, debuted as an American Idol judge in season ten and her song Jenny from the Block was an international success. In the book: New judge Joey Lovecraft was the lead singer of rock band Honeyload. He joins Project Icon after a falling-out with his band on the heels of a . rehab stint. In real life: Steve Tyler, who joined Ms Lopez as a new judge in season ten of American Idol, purportedly quit his position as lead singer of Aerosmith to pursue a solo career before checking into rehab . for pain management. In the book: Project Icon sees its the famed tough producer and judge, Nigel Crowther, nicknamed Mr Horrible, . leave to start a rival show called Talent Machine on the same network. In real life: The American Idol co-founder and judge that everyone loved to hate, Simon Cowell, nicknamed Mr Nasty, left the show to start X Factor which also airs on Fox. Despite their on-air affability, . the book describes the two debut judges as egomaniacs who, when backstage, . fight over the sizes of their dressing rooms and who gets announced on . air first. Only two contestants are picked on in the tell-all book, one of which bears a striking resemblance to real-life season ten winner. Jimmy Nugget, an 18-year-old country singer seems to mirror American Idol winner Scotty McCreery, a 17-year-old country boy from North Carolina. Since Mr McCreery won the competition, his sexuality has been widely speculated by bloggers. In the book, Mr Nugget openly sleeps with men. Some of the biggest bombshells, however, aren't directly related to the show's biggest stars. The most interesting revelations come from character Sasha's bottom of the food chain, first-hand insiders view. Elimination Night depicts the show's producers using a secret rating system to audit prospective contestants before they even make it to the judge’s table during auditions. Then, as the season progresses, producers manipulate and even sabotage the singers they want to see on or off the show. The book illustrates how a group of 20 production assistants pick the first pool of talent in unrecorded auditions. Sasha, the book's narrator, describes the experience as unpleasant: 'You’re spat at, punched, kissed, bribed, threatened, flashed.' At this point, each contestant is given a ticket with a purposefully inverted code so that the producers can track the talent, and manipulate their on-camera reactions. 'N' on a ticket means an absolute  'yes, they’ll go onto Hollywood'; 'X' is a maybe; and a Y' is definite no but 'the kid looks like a crier or a psycho, so roll the cameras.' The book continues: 'If someone has a good gimmick - y’know, dying kid, mom in prison, amusing facial tic - put a star in the top-right corner.' A star in the right-hand corner equals more air time, because, the book says, tear-jerking stories are valued higher than talent. To increase on-screen drama, and to make it look as natural as possible, producers manipulate contestants before they perform with the strategy: 'Tell the singer the very opposite of the truth.' If the contestant is a wonderful singer, the producers tell them to prepare for the fact they probably will not move on to the next round. But if a singer is terrible, producers puff up their confidence. The book says this screening process makes the final outcome, and the contestants fate, all the more cinematic. Meanwhile the star judges are taught to give the most talented contestants plenty of negative signals, such as shaking their heads during the audition process, to add to the tension.

Shrouded in secrecy: Translators working on Dan Brown's new novel Inferno were banned from discussing the plot and made to work in an underground bunker to keep the text a mystery . It is a scene that could have come out of one of Dan Brown's own novels - 11 people confined inside an underground bunker keeping a closely-guarded secret from the rest of the world. However, instead of a mystery to be solved by Brown's hero Robert Langdon, this was the reality for translators toiling over the Da Vinci Code author's latest tome. Such was the publisher's desire to release Brown's new novel Inferno in several languages on the same day, the translators are said to have found themselves cooped up in a high-security basement working seven days a week until at least 8pm. The English translation of Inferno is 'hell', and it would be hard to imagine a more devilish existence then that of the linguists, who were tasked with reading the new novel day and night. The chosen 11 were banned from taking mobile phones into the windowless bunker at the Milan headquarters of Italian publishing house, Mondadori. Their laptops were nailed down to their workstations and the translators, from France, Spain, Germany, Brazil and Italy, were only permitted to access the internet via a solitary supervised shared computer, according to newspaper The Independent on Sunday. Security surrounding the project was so tight that although the translators were allowed to eat their meals at the Mondadori staff canteen, each was given a cover story to conceal what they were really up to between February and April 2012. When not in use the prized manuscripts were stored in safes, guarded as tightly as the valuable artworks depicted in Brown's popular mystery thrillers. The plot of Inferno has been shrouded in secrecy, but is believed to make repeated references to Dante's Inferno, the first part of epic poem The Divine Comedy, which depicts the narrator's journey through hell. Publishers were so scared that the . translators might pirate the text before the publication date each of . the 11 was banned from discussing the plot, forced to sign in and out . each time they entered the bunker and to keep a record of all their . activities, including cigarette and meal breaks. Going globall: The new novel by Dan Brown, above, being released on May 14 in English, French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Italian and Portuguese versions . Italian translator Annamaria Raffo told magazine TV Sorrisi e Canzoni, which is also published by Berlusconi family-owned Mondadori, that there was initially 'distrust' among the group, although by the end of the ordeal the bunker had a 'playground atmosphere'. A French translator, Carole Delporte added that the experience had enabled the linguists to immerse themselves completely in the text. Foreign versions of English language books have usually been published after the originals, causing publishers to lose money. The blog, Love German Books, has . stated that Brown's last novel, The Lost Symbol, had already climbed to . number two on the country's bestseller list by the time the German . version was released - one month after the English edition hit the . shelves. Inferno will . instead be published on May 14, and released in English, French, German, . Spanish, Catalan, Italian and Portuguese versions on the same day. Big screen hero: Tom Hanks, right, has played Brown's hero Robert Langdon, in the film version of novels The Da Vinci Code, which also starred Audrey Tautou, left . It is the fourth of Brown's books to feature symbology expert Robert Langdon, who was portrayed by actor Tom Hanks in the film versions of previous novels, The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. According to the description of the novel on Amazon,Inferno is 'set in the heart of Europe, where Langdon is drawn into a harrowing world centred around one of history's most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces.' He has said of the new book: 'Although I studied Dante's Inferno as a student, it wasn't until recently, while researching in Florence, that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante's work on the modern world. 'With this new novel, I am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm, a landscape of codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways.' The 48-year-old's books have previously been translated into 52 languages and as of last year had sold more than 200 million copies combined, while the Tom hanks films have taken around £800 million. Inspiration: Brown's new novel is thought to reference Dante's Inferno, which depicts the narrator's journey through hell.

During a live segment on Piers Morgan’s show Monday night, the anchor spoke with the network’s meteorologist who based the sensational claim solely on a comment left in a chat room. ‘You have an update on the stock exchange situation. Do we still think that three feet of water got into the exchange? There seem to be conflicting reports now,’ Morgan asked meteorologist Chad Myers. ‘Oh, is that right? You know, I got that from the National Weather Service chat bulletin board. It was right on there; it said three feet of water on the floor. I don’t know if there’s conflicting reports or not,’ Myers said. The claim instantly went viral, spreading quickly on social networks and circulating as fact. An NYSE official quickly tried to thwart the rumor, saying that the infrastructure of the landmark Wall Street building was ‘fine’. A spokesman for the network issued a vague apology, purposefully avoiding the point of the fact that their sources were as murky as the alleged sea water that covered much of lower Manhattan. ‘Chad referenced a National Weather Service report that turned out to be incorrect.

Nasdaq officials began employing . their contingency plans as soon as they came to the decision to close on . Sunday around 10.30pm. Traders were able to continue to . complete a drastically-reduced level of orders electronically, as many . banks have remote systems set up so that employees can work from home in . crisis situations. The New York Stock Exchange, which is . a privately-held company in itself, keeps a secondary location up and . running in case of emergency where all data is stored.

According to Wall Street and Tech, . the centre boasts a supply of 28 megawatts of power, which equates to . the amount used to power 4,500 residential homes. Additionally NYSE spokesman Robert . Rendine told The New York Times that they have a number of generators . and sufficient fuel to power the site for at least one week if . electricity does not return. 'I'm a little surprised that the . exchanges couldn't secure the technology needed to keep the market . operating,' said Dominic Salvino, a trader from the Chicago Board .

Sparkling slabs of the 'white gold' at the heart of Ethiopia's ancient salt trade form patterns in a vast desert basin in this incredible image. For centuries Ethiopians have made the long trek to the Danakil Depression - one of the hottest and harshest environments in the world - to collect salt from the sun-blasted earth before transporting the slabs back by camel. But a tradition that has continued for hundreds of years could be set to change beyond recognition, with the construction of a paved road cutting through the Danakil Depression. Scroll down for video . Unforgiving environment: A man walks along sulphur and mineral salt formations near Dallol in the Danakil Depression, northern Ethiopia, where merchants have been travelling for centuries to collect salt from the vast desert basin . Other-worldly: Swirling sulphur and mineral salt formations can be seen in the Danakil Depression, one of the hottest and harshest environments on earth . Although the road being cut through the Danakil Depression is making it easier to transport the salt, the region's fiercely independent local salt miners and traders are wary of the access it might give to industrial mining companies with mechanised extraction techniques that require far less labour. xxxxx . 'Most of the people who live here are dependent on the salt caravans, so we are not happy with prospective salt companies that try to set up base here,' said Abdullah Ali Noor, a chief and clan leader's son in Hamad-Ile, on the salt desert's edge. 'Everything has to be initiated from the community. We prefer to stick with the old ways,' he added. Changing times: Camel caravans have been making the journey to the Danakil Depression for hundreds of years, but construction is now underway on a tarmac road through the desert basin . Danakil Depression: Once the merchants find a suitable place to mine, they extract, shape and pack as many salt slabs as possible before embarking on the two-day journey back to the town of Berahile . Lonely landscape: A camel caravan loaded with slabs of salt can be seen making its way back to civilisation from the Danakil Depression in the north of the African country . Arduous trek: Camel caravans and journeyed to and from the remote Ethiopian salt desert in this way for hundreds of years . Solitary trek: An armed Afar man steps on rocks as he crosses a river close to the Danakil Depression in Ethiopia . The tarmac road will link the highland city of Mekele with the village of Dallol in the Danakil Depression, a harsh but hauntingly beautiful geographical wonder of salt flats and volcanoes once described as 'a land of death' by the famous British desert explorer Wilfred Thesiger. The road has cut from five hours to three the drive from Mekele to Berahile, a town two days' trek by camel from the Afar salt deposits that are one of Ethiopia's main sources of the crystalline food product. New roads like these are gradually helping to transform this landlocked Horn of Africa state, which has a unique culture and history but has been racked by coups, famines and droughts, into one of the fastest-growing economies on the continent. As Africa's biggest coffee producer, Ethiopia's economy remains based on agriculture, which accounts for 46 percent of gross domestic product and 85 percent of employment. But its nearly 94 million population - the second biggest in Africa - is attracting the attention of foreign investors hungry for new markets.

Feeding time: Miners who have relied on camels to make the long journey to the salt desert for centuries fear a planned road making the region more accessible could threaten their ancient trade . Arid: A man extracts salt from the desert in the Danakil Depression, where rain never falls and average annual temperatures creep towards 100F . African tradition: A camel herder and salt merchant clutches rope in the Danakil Depression, the unforgiving region at the heart of Ethiopia's ancient salt trade . Further south in the Danakil Depression, at the salt reserve of Lake Afdera, industrial salt production is already under way. A company named Berhane and Zewdu PLC came to the desert plains near Hamad-Ile in 2011 aiming to produce salt there, according to Noor.Clan leaders saw the threat to their ancient trade and lined up to oppose the project. Fearing sabotage of its equipment, the company left the following year, local people said. But Noor still welcomed the new road. 'The new highway will give easy access to the market, which will bring benefits and development to this region,' Noor said. Years of journeys: Adbu Ibrahim Mohammed, a retired salt merchant, was 15 years old when he first began trekking with caravans of camels to the desert basin in northern Ethiopia . The development he talks of is visible in Berahile, where caravans from the salt pans come to drop off their cargo so it can be transported to the rest of the country. Most residents are involved directly or indirectly in the salt business. Telephone and electricity networks have been extended to the town over the past four years, a new Berahile Salt Association was established in 2010 to facilitate trade and a recently built salt store is now the biggest construction in town. Toiling in the heat: Miners extract salt before shaping and packing the slabs, loading up their camels and preparing for the long, slow trek across the vast desert basin back to the nearest town . Long journey: A worker loads a camel with slabs of salt in the Danakil Depression in northern Ethiopia, before making the long journey back across the desert basin . Dry heat: Scores of camels form a caravan to trek across the barren landscape in the African desert . Pack animals: Camels walk in single file behind a salt merchant through the vast, barren landscape . 'Thousands of people benefit from this work as the salt here is exported throughout the country,' said the head of the association, Derassa Shifa. For now, tradition and modernity co-exist - the organisation buys salt from the caravans that make the four-day trek to the salt flats and back, then sells it to merchants who carry it away by truck. The salt blocks, which were once used as a unit of money, are sold across Ethiopia, many of them to farmers to provide their animals with essential minerals. Ethiopia has the largest livestock population on the African continent. Life is harsh for the thousands of camel herders and salt extractors who use traditional hoes and axes to carve the 'white gold' out of the ground in the Danakil Depression. Many of the salt diggers live in Hamad-Ile and hire out their services to different caravans. The work, however exhausting, still draws thousands onto the baking salt flats. 'You forget about the sun and the heat,' said Kidane Berhe, 45, a camel herder and salt merchant. 'I lost a friend once on the salt desert because he was working too much with no protection from the sun. Eventually he just collapsed.' Water source: Young residents of Hamad-Ile pump water from a well in the Danakil Depression . Rest stop: Salt merchants are seen posing for a photograph after they stop to rest for the night in a canyon on their way back to town from the remote salt desert .

Former First Daughter Caroline Kennedy is to sit on a Manhattan jury that will help decide the fate of a cocaine dealer . The only surviving child of President John F. Kennedy and the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will serve on the Supreme Court panel hearing the case of Nelson Chatman. When asked during jury selection if she or any member of her family had ever been a victim of a crime, Caroline Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg decided to skip and not answer. I do solemnly swear: Caroline Kennedy will be sitting on a jury in Manhattan this week in the trial of a coke dealer . She would of course had to mention that her father, former President John F Kennedy and her uncle, former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, were both victims of assassinations. 'I have not been convicted of a crime,' Kennedy said during jury selection at the Centre St. courthouse. She also didn't mention the stalking episodes her family had to endure a couple of years ago. The next question on the survey asked whether any member of her family had been involved with law enforcement. Kennedy curse: Caroline Kennedy mentioned that her brother John Junior was a former district attorney but did not mention his tragic death in a place crash off the Massachusetts coast in 1999 . 'My brother, years ago, worked as an assistant district attorney,' she said. Ms. Kennedy did not mention that her late brother, John F Kennedy Jr was killed in a private plane crash off Martha's Vineyard. She was also uneasy when a defense lawyer asked her if she knew anyone with a drug problem. 'I know a few people,' she muttered. A number of Kennedy's have admitted their problems with drugs in the past including cousins Robert F. Junior and David who used heroin and Patrick J who took cocaine. It's not clear whether Kennedy gave a fuller account of her law enforcement ties behind closed doors about her family history of drug use or connection to two of the biggest political crimes in the twentieth century. Other jurors who were in the gallery to be chosen for jury service listened intently as the mother of three began to speak. Daddy's little girl: President Kennedy, and Caroline seated in car in 1963. She did not mention her father's assassination during jury selection at Manhattan Supreme Court . Family history: President Kennedy, little John Jr. and Caroline in August 1963.

I’ve lived at my present address for 25 years. I live with my husband and two grown children. I have a law degree and I’m an author,' Kennedy said. She will sit on the trial of Nelson Chatman, 31, who is contesting charges of selling cocaine. He was caught in December selling drugs on a street corner in Harlem to an undercover police officer. Kennedy has written at least seven books including 'The Right to Privacy' and her latest 'Poems to Learn By Heart' came out this spring. She said her writing career would not influence her ability to make a decision in the case. Chatman’s trial starts today and will last for about a week.","Kennedy did not mention her family's tragic history involving the assassinations of her father and uncle .

Seventy-years-ago yesterday, the squadron, made up of the RAF's finest, took to the skies on their top-secret mission. Their aim was to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley which were a vital source of industrial power for Nazi Germany.

A scale model of the Mohne Dam built in Watford was key to getting the Dambusters raid off the ground. As anniversary events take place throughout the country to mark to 1943 raid, these replica models are tributes to the planning and strategy behind the daring Raid. The model was built in 1941, two years before the raid, across a brook to simulate real conditions. Idyllic: Tucked away in the Watford countryside the humble replica dam is a piece of history . Higher cause: the small-scale recreation was built in the same way as the target Mohne and Eder dams, using the same masonry techniques . Tourist attraction: Secret meetings to plan the raids were held on the site in Watford . Part of History: Barnes Wallis Jr visits the 50th scale model dam in 1997. His father masterminded the raid and the bouncing bomb . It was tested in the run up to the . attack when decisions were still to be made about how heavy the bombs . should be and where they would be dropped. It . took seven weeks to build and was made out of a scaled-down form of . masonry, composed of mortar blocks, identical to the intended target. Explosive tests were then carried out on the replica. Three trusted employees of the Building Research Establishment in Watford, worked on the covert model. Bursting through: The replica dam was tested in the research phase of Operation Chastise . Small scale: the replica was tested at different points, so the strategists could plan where to bomb . Work in progress: Theses images show the replica dam as it was constructed. It was built over a brook so that it was an accurate representation of the real thing . Trial and error: The replica dam was designed to prepare an effective strategy for future air raids on German dams . Then and Now: The model dam was built over seven weeks. The team of three engineers worked tirelessly to recreate the shape of the target. Today, visitors can see the model dam where it was built in Watford . Meetings between Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the Bouncing Bomb and Dr Norman Davey, Head of Engineering at BRE, took place at the site near Watford. Wallis' plans to attack the Mohne and . Eder dams were outlined and the the model dam was used for testing his strategies. The model dam's discovery was published . as the final shots for the film The Dambusters were being recorded. The very first tests at BRE were not included in the film. The raid was carried out by 133 airmen in 19 Lancaster bombers from the specifically formed 617 squadron.

These rare photographs taken more than 150 years ago are thought to be among the first ever pictures taken of China. Showing Beijing in the days before sky-scrapers when it was still known as Peking, the photographs were taken by Anglo-Italian photographer Felice Beato and include the first ever panorama of the city. The collection also includes the only known photograph of the old Imperial Summer Palace before it was destroyed by fire by British troops in 1860. This is the left half of the panoramic image, thought to be the first ever such shot taken of Peking, as Beijing was then called, by Anglo-Irish photographer Felice Beato . This is the right half of the panoramic image, taken in 1860 when the gleaming skyscrapers the inhabitants of today's Beijing were still more than a century away . This panorama, seen in its entirety, is 5ft 5in wide and 8in tall and was taken from Peking's South Gate looking towards the Forbidden City . The set of 18 original albumen photographs were taken by Mr Beato, regarded as one of the first ever photojournalists, while he was embedded with the British Army in 1860. Mr Beato had joined up with the army in India in 1857 to photograph the uprising in the country at the time before travelling on to China.  He captured daily life with the troops, as well as landscapes and historical buildings around the country. Thought to be the first ever photographer to visit Beijing, Mr Beato took a series of six shots from the South Gate looking towards the Forbidden City which became the first ever panorama of the city. The resulting photograph, printed on fine photographic paper, is 5ft 5ins wide and 8ins tall. Mr Beato also photographed the old Imperial Summer Palace, part of a private estate owned by the Emperor of China, just days before it was torched by the British and French armies. Other photos in the collection feature Pehtang, North Taku Fort, tombs near Peking and the Imperial Winter Palace.  Mr Beato's images of the historical buildings and landmarks are among the only ones in existence. The collection includes a picture of the old Imperial Summer Palace taken just before it was burnt down, left, and one of the gateway to the Great Llama Temple, right . On the left is a tomb of an Empress of China in Peking, while the picture on the right shows the left bastion of the captured South Taku Fort in Peh-Tang . He sold them to an army lieutenant while in China before returning to Britain where he sold 400 pictures to a commercial photographer who reprinted them. The collection is tipped to fetch £200,000 when it is auctioned by Sotheby's on behalf of a private collector in London on May 14. Richard Fattorini, director of books and manuscripts at the auction house, said: 'These photographs are of huge historical significance - they are among the first photos ever taken of Beijing and include the first ever panorama taken of the city. 'These photographs provide a fascinating insight into a lost time before the forests of skyscrapers that dominate China's landscape today. 'Beato had very cleverly got himself entrenched with the British Army and had joined them in India in the mid-1850s.  He then travelled to China with the Army and documented day-to-day life, almost like a newspaper photographer would have done.  He was probably the first photographer ever to visit Beijing. 'He was a specialist in taking panoramic . photographs, and one day he got up onto a wall overlooking Beijing . towards the Forbidden City and took an incredible panorama made up of . six separate shots. This image shows the captured Taku Fort at the mouth of the Pei-ho river, taken by Felice Beato in China during the summer of 1860 . 'At the time it would have been incredibly difficult to do, with each shot lined up perfectly. It was the first ever panorama taken of the city. 'The collection also includes the only photograph in existence of the Imperial Summer Palace just days before it was torched by British troops.' While still in China, Beato sold his photos on to Lieutenant Edward Courtney who marked each one with a caption.  The original images were passed down through Courtney's family before ending up in a private collection. On his return to Britain, Beato also sold 400 images to Henry Hering, a commercial photographer from London, who reprinted them and sold them at £20 for 69 photos. Mr Fattorini added: 'The photographs are in remarkable condition given they are 150 years old. 'In the last year or so, early photos of China have become extremely valuable as collectors recognise their significance, and these are among the finest examples.'","These images, taken by photographer Felice Beato in 1860, are thought to be among the first-ever photos of China .

It happened during an argument while they were clearing out the garage at their £250,000 detached, four-bedroom home. Sportswoman Julia Wilkerson, 40, lashed out after caring for her 71-year-old mother . The blow left Clover Wilkerson . bleeding and led to her daughter, a former team captain of the Norfolk .

The pair’s ‘loving relationship’ broke . down as Wilkerson, 40, struggled to cope under the immense strain of . being a carer, King’s Lynn magistrates’ court was told. She had fallen into a ‘cycle of . resentment and guilt’ and feared her life was no longer her own. Yvonne . Neil, prosecuting, said Wilkerson’s mother admitted slapping her . daughter on the back first during the argument in the garage. That led to Wilkerson hitting her mother with the broom, which was an ‘entirely disproportionate’ reaction, the lawyer added. Ian Graham, defending, said it was an ‘unfortunate case of two people who clearly love each other’. Wilkerson, a former team captain of Norfolk Ladies County Golf Association and five-time winner of Norfolk county championships, found herself hauled into court . ‘The relationship has got into . difficulty,’ he said. ‘Julia has siblings but she was the person who . decided to take on the very serious responsibility of becoming her . carer. It appears to have got too much for her.’ Mr Graham said Wilkerson was someone . with previous good  character who had got into a  ‘difficult situation’ with her mother but it was hoped the two would now be able to reconcile . their differences. Wilkerson, of King’s Lynn,  Norfolk, . was given a 12-month  conditional discharge after magistrates were given . character references showing her to be a ‘very caring person’. Presiding magistrate Jill Skinner said: ‘Both you and your mother are probably very upset by the whole thing.’ Wilkerson, who had denied a charge of . assault by beating at a previous hearing, was also ordered to pay £100 . costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Police yesterday confirmed that . Wilkerson’s mother complained about her daughter on the day of the . attack, October 5 last year, which led to her arrest. Wilkerson was living with her mother at the time. Speaking at the house yesterday, her . mother said: ‘My daughter does not live here any more and it was part of . her bail conditions. ‘She works at a health centre but I . don’t want to make any further comment.’ Mrs Wilkerson lives a mile away . from her former husband Albert, who is remarried, and son Paul, 35. Neither was available to comment yesterday. Barbara Williams, director of research . and support charity  Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘Parkinson’s is an incurable . condition that progresses over time, and caring for someone with . Parkinson’s can have a profound effect on mental and physical wellbeing. ‘It’s very common for carers to feel . stressed, fatigued and have difficulty sleeping but very often they . don’t prioritise their own care, missing doctor’s appointments and . putting off getting help. ‘Nonetheless they have the  courage to keep going, and the  support carers contribute is invaluable.’ She urged carers in need of support . themselves to contact the charity’s support workers and groups to ‘help . take the pressure out of the pressure cooker’.","Julia Wilkerson, 40, lashed out after caring for her 71-year-old mother .

Investigation: Forensic research on the window of Mark Bridger's Land Rover Discovery, in Mold, north Wales . Earlier . this week the jury heard from a forensic scientist who said he could . find no evidence of a collision either on the Land Rover or on the . child’s bike. April’s body was never found despite the biggest search operation in British policing history. The court also heard that Bridger used . to work for Randall Parker Foods in Llanidloes, which is about 17 miles . from Machynlleth, between October 2009 and January 2010. A . statement read from his former colleague Gage Talbot said: ‘Mark . Bridger’s employment in the abattoir would have allowed him access to an . array of knives and he was skilled at boning and skinning knives.’ The . court also heard that Bridger started working as a firefighter for the . London Fire Brigade in May 1984 but resigned in November the same year. He was living in south Croydon, Surrey, at the time. Trial: Mark Bridger (left), 47, told police he drank 15 pints and a half a bottle of vodka every day - and claims he was drunk at the wheel of his Land Rover when he ran over April Jones (right) while she played on her bike . A . statement was also read from Staff Sgt Luke Jones who had checked armed . forces records for any evidence that Bridger had served, as he claimed . to have done in his police interviews. Nobody going by the name Mark Leonard Bridger has ever served in the UK regular or reserve forces, the court heard. The jury was shown footage of the moment Bridger was booked in at Aberystwyth police station. The film shows him being searched and having his shoes and jacket removed.

The arresting officer tells him he has been arrested on suspicion of abduction. Paul Hobson, for the prosecution, read out Bridger’s first interviews with the police. In a statement, Pc Jules Evans said she asked the defendant if he had served in the armed forces. He told the officer that he had ‘worked as a mercenary in Angola and he had been to Belize’. He said he had been ‘trained by an SAS unit in Burma’. He said he had been ‘seconded’ to the British Army but that he was not registered to it and that he had been doing this for the past nine years. The jury heard previously that April and her best friend had been cycling near their homes on Machynlleth’s Bryn-Y-Gog estate when she disappeared. The pair had swapped bikes and April had been riding her friend’s bicycle shortly before she was last seen. Mr Hobson then read the interviews with Det Con Louise Thomas who read her part of the first ‘urgent interview’ which was carried out shortly after his arrest while Mr Hobson read Bridger’s replies to the court. House: Floral tributes and a single candle burns outside the former home of Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales, who is on trial for the abduction and murder of April Jones . During the interview, which took place at 6:18pm on October 2, Bridger said: ‘I don’t know where she is.’ He said he had split up with his girlfriend and then been to his daughter’s parents’ evening at Machynlleth Junior School when he began drinking. He said: ‘I am a registered alcoholic. I drink 15 to 20 pints a day and a bottle of vodka a day and through the night.’ During a long statement Bridger went on to say how he drove over April, put her in his car, tried to giver her mouth to mouth, and then panicked and starting driving around getting increasingly drunk. He told the officer: ‘I had obviously crushed her little body.’ 'I am a registered alcoholic. I drink 15 to 20 pints a day and a bottle of vodka a day and through the night' Mark Bridger . During the statement Bridger, wearing a short-sleeved light blue shirt and tie, broke down and wept in the dock. He told Det Con Thomas that ‘adrenaline was pumping and the alcohol inside me was pumping’. He said at some point he stopped the car and that ‘he knew there was no life in her’. Bridger said that he ‘slapped her’ and did ‘all the things that go through your head.’ ‘All this time I am thinking, ‘what have I done’’ and then took some more mouthfuls of vodka’. He then described being back at his home and not knowing how he had got there. Bridger then told the officer he began frantically searching his property for the child. Mother and father: Coral and Paul Jones, parents of April Jones, arrive at Mold Crown Court earlier this week . He said: ‘I would not have dumped her. I just don’t know where I have put her. I am sorry, I don’t know.’ Later he told the officer: ‘Due to this incident I have difficulty looking female police officers in the eye. A dad is a dad but a mother gives birth. I am surprised you spoke to me so politely.’ In his second interview on the morning of October 3, Bridger told police that he had spent the previous night in custody without sleep because he was ‘going over events in his head to jog a memory’. But he said he still had no recollection of where he put April’s body. 'I would not have buried her, but obviously it was raining and I would have covered her out of respect' Mark Bridger . He added: ‘I don’t believe in myself that I would have dumped her. I would have put her where she would be found. ‘I would not have buried her, but obviously it was raining and I would have covered her out of respect.’ He said he remembered driving around Machynlleth with April’s body and seeing men in fluorescent jackets who he believed to be railway workers. ‘I knew the seriousness of things, but I hadn’t realised people had been called out for a missing girl,’ he added. As the evidence was read out to the jury, Bridger, wearing a blue short sleeved shirt and blue tie, used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes. Asked why he went to the Bryn-y-Gog estate that night, he said he wanted to see his ex-partner who lived there. He said he was ‘reminiscing about the relationship’ and added: ‘I just wanted to see my ex and I sat there and drank an amount of cider. I was quite emotional.’ The trial continues.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:13 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:33 EST, 12 May 2013 . Can we agree on this? Americans still think alike much of the time even if our politicians don't. To get heads nodding, just say something worrisome about the economy or dismissive of Washington. Almost all Americans consider themselves very patriotic, believe in God, value higher education and admire those who get rich through hard work. Not much argument there. But here's the oft-overlooked truth: Even some issues that are highly contentious in the partisan capital have solid public support across the country. United We Stand: Despite political differences at the ballot box, the American Dream is still alive. Most Americans still share similar values for life, liberty and the American way . National polls show that 7 of 10 people want to raise the minimum wage. Similar numbers want term limits for Congress, support building the Keystone XL pipeline to bring oil from Canada and back using government money to make preschool available to every child. There are toeholds of agreement on big, divisive issues such as immigration, abortion and guns. If those slivers of consensus were the starting point in debates, political compromise might just be possible. Instead, drama and conflict are what feed this country's party-driven politics, the news media, the bloggers and tweeters, even the pollsters who measure opinion. The 24-hour, left vs. right cacophony coming out of Washington tends to drown out any notes of national harmony. Maybe the great division in politics these days lies between Washington and the rest of the nation. Bonny Paulson thinks so. A retired flight attendant in Huntly, Va., she rents a Shenandoah Valley log cabin to travelers. Paulson gets an earful of people grumbling about politicians, but she doesn't hear much disagreement about the issues. Values: Americans still think a lot alike and share core values: Nine out of 10 call themselves very patriotic, believe in God, value higher education, and admire those who get rich through hard work . 'Washington is more polarized than the rest of the nation,' she says. Judy Hokse, visiting Washington with a group of volunteers serving meals to the homeless, says ordinary people are more entrenched in their political views than they were when she was a teenager in the 1970s. But the political standoff in Washington, she said, 'is just way out there. 'In our neck of the woods there are different opinions,' says Hokse, of Saugatuck, Michigan., 'but we can talk about them.' The notion of a divided country even divides the academics. Some political scientists bemoan a disappearing ideological center, reflected in the polarization consuming politics. Others dismiss the idea of a balkanized nation of Republican- or Democratic-leaning states. They see instead a laid-back land of mostly moderate, pragmatic voters remote from their highly partisan leaders. Certainly there's plenty for people to argue about. Last year's presidential race fanned long-standing debates over the size of government, the social safety net and taxes. Some states have begun recognizing gay marriage; many have imposed constitutional bans. Some are tightening gun laws, while others are looking to loosen them. Shared beliefs: Seven out of 10 Americans want to raise the minimum wage . Democrat Barack Obama is on track to become the most polarizing president in nearly seven decades of Gallup records. His predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, held the distinction previously, signaling a trend. Gallup says that 7 out of 10 people say Americans are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values. Yet with a few exceptions such as issues of race and gender and views of government, opinions haven't changed much in a quarter-century of Pew polls tracking political values. 'That's a really critical point that often gets overlooked,' said Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. 'It's easy to assume when we see more partisan polarization that somehow American values are shifting. In most dimensions the way Americans overall look at things is very consistent over time.' While U.S. opinion overall stuck to the middle of the road, the politically engaged became better at sorting themselves into like-minded camps. Voters changed views or changed parties, and increasing numbers left the parties to become independents. Rockefeller Republicans and Reagan Democrats disappeared. The remaining party faithful are more ideologically distilled. Common ground: 7 out of 10 Americans say the poor have become too dependent on government assistance; even more want government action to make health care affordable and accessible . Two decades ago, Republican support for stricter environmental rules was at 86 percent, almost as high as for Democrats. Last year only 47 percent of Republicans wanted tougher environmental rules, Pew found. Democratic support remained high. On family values, it was Democrats who changed. Over 25 years, the numbers of Democrats saying they had ""old-fashioned values"" about family and marriage declined from 86 percent to 60 percent, while Republicans held steady. Despite the party shifts, stricter environmental rules and old-fashioned values are still endorsed by 7 out of 10 people. Likewise, the abortion debate divides the political parties and fervent activists. Yet most people stand somewhere in the middle. They overwhelmingly say abortion should be legal under some circumstances, especially in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life. At the same time, large majorities support some restrictions, such as a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent for minors. Gun control and illegal immigration? U.S. opinion is torn, with angry voices on all sides. Yet some ideas are getting support from 4 out of 5 people polled: extending federal background checks to all gun buyers, tightening security at the nation's borders, and providing a path to citizenship for some workers who are in the country illegally, if they meet requirements such as paying back taxes. So there's common ground. But even where people agree on big ideas, some of those ideas may conflict with each other. Republicans aren't the only ones who say business is the nation's backbone. Nearly three-fourths of Americans agree. But just as many worry that there's too much power in the hands of a few big companies — a Democratic-sounding sentiment. Seven in 10 say the poor have become too dependent on government assistance, but even more want government action to make health care affordable and accessible. Details matter. A resounding majority believes that in the United States 'the rich just get richer while the poor get poorer."" But there's no consensus on what, if anything, to do about that. The nation is enduringly optimistic about Americans' ability to solve problems, but it's pessimistic about the people who make the rules in government and politics. Majorities believe elected officials are out of touch and harming the nation, and most say they prefer leaders who are willing to compromise, a rarity in Washington now. There's bipartisan disdain for lawmakers. The divided Congress gets 15 percent approval from Republicans and 13 percent among Democrats, according to Gallup. 'If you listen to the people here in town they're all fed up,' said Debbie Grauel, owner of an independent office supply store in Deale, Md. ""Everybody's for term limits for everybody.' What else can bring a sprawling, diverse, free-spirited nation of 316 million close to agreement? It's hard to say. Polls rarely measure the mom-and-apple-pie stuff. 'If there's something that's really a consensus, you are not going to find surveys asking about it,"" said Tom Smith, director of the giant General Social Survey since 1980. Pollsters tend to drop those questions for something new. Of course, consensus of opinion doesn't guarantee action. Nine out of 10 people tell Pew it's their duty to always vote, but fewer than 6 in 10 of those who were eligible voted in the 2012 presidential election. Nor does harmony equal tranquility. Times of crisis create a rallying effect, epitomized by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Bush's presidential approval rating jumped to 90 percent, the highest in Gallup's history. Approval of Congress reached 84 percent. In ordinary times, unity of opinion might be the wrong goal. 'If everybody agreed, there would be no debate,' said Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport. 'There's an argument to be made that from debate and disagreement come truth.'","Polls in the U.S. suggest Americans still think a lot alike .

The BBC was forced to broadcast another grovelling apology for Newsnight yesterday after a flawed report on Help for Heroes. The programme, which accused the military charity of misspending its cash, was made by the same journalist and group of researchers responsible for Newsnight’s disastrous ‘investigation’ three months later which falsely accused Lord McAlpine of being a paedophile. That slur cost the BBC £185,000 in damages to the peer and almost brought down the corporation’s flagship TV news programme. The BBC has been forced to apologise for the Newsnight programme, presented by Eddie Mair (pictured) The BBC's editorial complaints unit said the report, by Angus Stickler (pictured), was 'misleading' and 'unfair' Last night Help for Heroes accused . the reporter responsible for the Newsnight attack on the charity, Angus .

Mr Stickler resigned as chief . reporter of the now-discredited BIJ after the McAlpine scandal last . November implicating the former Tory Party treasurer in child abuse . claims. The BBC has now admitted that Mr . Stickler and the BIJ’s programme about Help for Heroes was ‘misleading’ and ‘unfair’ to the charity and the programme misrepresented the views . of Diane Dernie, the mother of badly wounded soldier Ben Parkinson. The Newsnight report screened last . August accused the charity – which was founded in 2007 and has raised . more than £150million – of being ‘too cosy’ with the Ministry of Defence . and subsidising Government rehabilitation buildings rather than . spending on everyday care for veterans.

He also raised fears that Newsnight . may have ‘seriously prejudiced’ the charity’s efforts to raise another . £63million for the recovery centres vital to helping wounded service . personnel. The charity’s co-founder and chief . executive, Bryn Parry, formally complained to the BBC, which insisted . days after the broadcast: ‘We stand by the programme and the high . quality of our journalism.’ Help for Heroes reluctantly decided . to take no further action at the time because it felt such a move would . distract from its principal task of helping wounded servicemen. Help for Heroes was accused of misspending funds in the Newsnight report .

The corporation said yesterday: . ‘Following an investigation by its Editorial Complaints Unit, the BBC . now accepts that its coverage was misleading and unfair to Help for . Heroes. ‘The BBC gave the impression that . Help for Heroes was responsible for shortcomings in the provision of . support to wounded veterans. 'The Editorial Complaints Unit found no . evidence to support this suggestion. ‘Although it was legitimate to report . the concerns of veterans, the BBC portrayed criticisms about overall . support by a number of agencies as specific criticisms of Help for .

'This unfair impression was reinforced by our coverage of the . story in other outlets. ‘In addition, the Newsnight report . contained interviews with two contributors which were edited in a way . which misrepresented their views.’ Mr Parry said: ‘My issue has not been . with the BBC, my issue has been with Angus Stickler and the Bureau of .

A flock of wartime homing pigeons that were fitted with mini parachutes and air-dropped into France were awarded bravery medals after bringing vital intelligence back across the English channel. The set of five valuable honours awarded to the birds will be shown on the Antiques Roadshow this Sunday and shed new light on the methods the Allies devised to spy on the enemy. The birds were strapped into mini-parachutes and placed in small crates that were dropped behind enemy lines to be used by the French Resistance. War hero: Carrier pigeon 'MPS42' is pictured with his . Dickin Medal after returning three times from occupied Europe. The bird's medal has will now feature on the Antique's Roadshow . Pigeon carrier: Every RAF aircraft carried at least one pigeon on each flight . A corkscrew fan on the wooden crate unwound in the wind leading to the door to open automatically in mid-air, allowing the pigeon to drop to the ground. The French attached coded messages about German military movements to the birds which flew across the English Channel with the precious intelligence. But one chilling note that has emerged after 70 years was written in German and informed the British the French recipient had been shot for spying having been found with a pigeon. A bird can be seen peeping out of a crate as it is carried by a member of an RAF bomber crew setting off on a mission over France .

Training: Aircrews being trained by a SPS operative in the correct deployment of the birds . A Special Pigeon Service operative loads a pigeon into a parachute cannister to be dropped over occupied Europe . Some 32 racing pigeons were awarded the prestigious Dickin Medal - the animal version of the Victoria Cross - for their acts of heroism in World War Two. The Royal Pigeon Racing Association owns five of them. Its general manager, Stewart Wardrope, took them along to the BBC's Antiques Roadshow to show them off. He also revealed the stories behind their award as well some of the other madcap inventions made by British boffins and used to gather intelligence using the birds. These included a clockwork camera strapped to the belly of a pigeon that automatically took reconnaissance snaps of Nazi-occupied Europe before returning home. Of the five medals due to be featured on this Sunday's Antiques Roadshow, two were awarded to pigeons that delivered important intelligence from Europe six times between them. A plucky pigeon being released from in mid air above occupied France . Posters were put up across Britain warning the hungry populace not to shoot down the precious birds and (right) a Dicken medal for gallantry awarded to the birds . Another, named 'Beachcomber', brought back the first news of the disastrous landings at Dieppe in September 1942. Most RAF planes took with them at least one carrier pigeon in the event of crashing behind enemy lines with no radio communication. A bird named, 'Dutch Coast', saved the crew of one downed plane by flying 288 miles in seven hours with an SOS that led to the men being rescued. Mr Wardrope said: 'Thousands of racing pigeons were used by the Allies in the war and they saved lives and brought very important intelligence back from the French about the Germans. 'The British dreamed up all sorts of ways of getting them to the French Resistance. 'They strapped them in little parachutes so that they couldn't fly off and dropped them out of the planes over a pre-arranged position. Long haul hero: Dickin medal winner 'Mercury' made an epic 480 mile trip from occupied Denmark in July 1942 . Intel: A piece of vital wartime intelligence that was brought back to Britain by one of the Pigeons . 'Then there were problems with pigeons flying into the tail planes of faster aircraft so the British put the pigeons inside little boxes with a cork screw fan and the friction of the wind wound the fan which opened the box allowing the pigeon to drop out. 'Anybody caught with a racing pigeon in France were considered to be spies and were court martialled and possibly executed. 'The Germans had special teams called Hawk units based along the coast which were snipers and their job was to try and shot England-bound pigeons out of the sky. 'All the pigeons were interested in was getting home but they regularly had to fly through shot and fire to do that. Some of the pigeons were even fitted with small cameras to bring back aerial photographs . A British paratrooper equipped with pigeon in cannister prepares to jump into enemy territory . 'They returned to their owners who then made contact with the military and passed on the coded messages.' The National Pigeon Service was set up in the war and involved over 200,000 birds being given to the armed services. Those that flew over Nazi-occupied Europe were part of the Special Pigeon Service. In 1943 Maria Dickin, founder of the People's Dispensary of Sick Animals (PDSA) set up the Dickin Medal to honour the bravery of animals in the war. The exact valuation of the five medals given on the Antiques Roadshow cannot be revealed until Sunday but as a collection they are worth thousands and thousands of pounds .","Valuable 'Dickin' medals given to hero birds set to feature on Antiques Roadshow .

The Food and Drug Administration has approved changes to the . label of popular sleep drug zolpidem that, in some cases, even include a . warning not to drive a car the entire day after taking the drug. On Tuesday, the regulator approved the changes for two . brand-name producers of the drug: Sanofi, which makes Ambien and Ambien CR and . Meda AB, which produces Edluar.

Lights out: The FDA has OK'd changes made to labels of brands of the sleep drug zolpidem at its own behest . The regulator said that women were more susceptible to the . risk because they eliminate the drug from the blood more slowly than men. Approved changes also include a lowered dose recommendation. The agency said that research had shown that the drugs . remain in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with morning . driving, which increases the risk of car accidents. The FDA in January asked zolpidem manufacturers to reduce . recommended dosages on the drugs’ labels. They also said doctors should aim to . prescribe the lowest dose possible that will successfully treat insomnia.

Today, the changes implemented by those manufacturers were . approved. The FDA recommended doses of 5 mg for women and either 5 mg . or 10 mg for men for immediate-release zolpidem products such as Sanofi's . Ambien. The initial dose of extended-release products is 6.25 mg for . women and either 6.25 or 12.5 mg for men, according to the FDA. The popularity of zolpidem has led to some highly visible . incidents caused by its use on recent years.

The U.S. Postal Service named the city the worst in America for dog attacks on letter carriers last year while urging pet owners to help reduce the attacks on an estimated 4.5 million Americans annually. The agency on Wednesday released its city rankings ahead of National Dog Bite Prevention Week, which starts Monday, May 19. The Postal Service said that overall 5,879 postal workers were attacked last year, an increase of 274 dog bite incidents compared to 2011. Top 15: Mail carriers in Los Angeles reported 69 dog bites with the second runner-up of San Antonio, Texas having seen 42 . Watch out! Los Angeles was the worst city in America for dog attacks on letter carriers last year according to the United States Postal Service . Los Angeles was the worst with 69 . attacks, followed by San Antonio with 42 and Chicago with 41. The city . with the least attacks was Wichita, Kan., with 20. According to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation, nearly 1 out of every five people bitten will require medical attention, accounting for more than 800,000 Americans - half of which are children. 'Several of our letter carriers know first-hand about both the prevention and the pain of animal attacks, and we want to do whatever we can to help educate the community — especially parents and pet owners,' the USPS said in a release. If letter carriers feel threatened by a dog, they can skip delivery to the house and ask the customer to retrieve any mail at the post office instead. Claims: A similar ranking of dog bites and their claims by State Farm insurance shows the state of California having had the most bites and paid claims, nearly double of Illinois' which came in second place . Similar to the USPS' report, California on a whole had the most dog bites and related paid claims according to those filed with State Farm insurance in 2012. In contrast, dog bite claims nationally dropped with the company. In 2012 the insurance company reported 3,670 dog bite claims, a slight decrease from the 3,750 seen in 2011. Nationally the insurance company made more than $108 million from dog bites with California's $17.1 million nearly doubling those seen in  runner-up Illinois.

A 12-year-old Russian boy was stabbed nearly two dozen times while on holiday on the island of Crete, allegedly by a Dutchman working as an entertainer at the child's hotel, Greek authorities said. Nikita Onishchenko, who was on holiday with his family, was airlifted to Athens by military plane after being stabbed 20 times on the chest, back and other parts of the body. He was left in a 'comatose state' in a 'serious' condition and is now expected to undergo urgent surgery. His distraught mother Ekaterina was at his bedside, having flown with him from Crete to a children's hospital in Athens. Knife attack: The 12-year-old Russian victim, who was stabbed at least 20 times, is moved from an ambulance at Herakleion airport in Crete to be flown to hospital in Athens .

A preliminary investigation indicated the boy later tracked down the man, finding him near the hotel with the stolen items. Police said the man then led the boy into the parking lot, stabbed him and abandoned him. Authorities later found the knife believed to have been used in the attack, and recovered the laptop and mobile phone. Police  claimed to have found the attack weapon which had been washed and hidden in a fire hose. 'He is still in critical condition,' said  Panos Ephstathiou, head of the medical centre, where the child was initially treated. 'The patient can later face serious problems with the lower limbs. Unfortunately, in such cases, the injuries often lead to paralysis of the legs.' Russian reports of the case suggested a possible sexual motive in the attack, but there was no confirmation of this by the Greek authorities. Greece last night acted to play down fears over its safety as a tourist destination. 'I am sincerely sorry for what happened. Greece is a safe country,' said Health Minister Andreas Lykourentzos. 'Greece is a hospitable country and the National Health System is in a position to meet anychallenge, whether it concerns a Greek citizen or a tourist.'","Russian boy discovered wounded on the edge of a field .

Changes: More children now read more ebooks on iPads or Kindles than they do traditional books, which is damaging literacy standards (file picture) Children who read on an iPad or Kindle are falling behind in the classroom as figures showed for the first time the majority of youngsters now prefer ebooks to printed versions. The advance of technology means that young people who read on a screen have weaker literacy skills and fewer children now enjoy reading, experts have said. A survey, conducted by The National Literacy Trust, found that 52 per cent of children preferred to read on an electronic device - including e-readers, computers and smartphones - while only 32 per cent said they would rather read a physical book. Worryingly, only 12 per cent of those who read using new technology said they really . enjoyed reading, compared with 51 per cent of those who favoured books. Pupils who get free school meals, generally a sign they are from poorer . backgrounds, are the least likely group to pick up a traditional book, the research found. The poll of 34,910 young people aged between eight and 16 . across the UK found that those who read printed texts were almost twice . as likely to have above-average reading skills as those who read on . screens every day. The study also found that children were more likely to have their own computer than their own desk. Jonathan Douglas, the director of the National Literacy Trust, said: . 'While we welcome the positive impact which technology has on bringing . further reading opportunities to young people, it's crucial that reading . in print is not cast aside. 'We are concerned by our finding that children who only read . on-screen are significantly less likely to enjoy reading and less likely . to be strong readers. 'Good reading skills and reading for pleasure are closely linked to . children's success at school and beyond. We need to encourage children . to become avid readers, whatever format they choose.' Damaging: Reading electronically appears to be causing the number of children who enjoy reading to plummet as well as hinder academic performance, experts say . Award winning author Joan Brady is one of several literary stars to say the rise of the ebook is a 'problem' for Britain's children. Boys in particular would prefer to read on a computer screen and the change in trend has encouraged many publishers to cash in by offering electronic versions of comics and books. The number of children and young people reading newspapers has fallen from 46.8 per cent in 2005 to 31.2 per cent in 2012.","Survey of 35,000 pupils finds majority of youngsters now read on screen .

The boxer is projected to make $90million in 2013, according to Sports Illustrated's annual list released on Wednesday. Miami Heat star LeBron James is a distant second at $56.5million.

Golden: Kobe Bryant, right, is projected to collect just under $47million, including endorsement deals . New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees vaults into the rankings at No. 3 at $47.8million, thanks to a new contract he signed before last season. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is fourth at just under $47million. Tiger Woods is fifth with $40.8million, his lowest spot since SI started the list in 2004. He was No. 1 through 2011. Woods, who is coming off a big win at the Player's Championship this weekend, is beginning to find his stride after battling injury and very public battle with a cheating scandal. But his overall value continues to decline, most likely due to the loss of several endorsement deals following the appearance of numerous mistresses across the country. Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year.

Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco, who signed a $120.6million mega-deal in March, does not appear on the list despite being the highest paid athlete in the NFL - because . But Sports Illustrated left out players who signed big contracts after their respective seasons had ended. The top 50 include 25 baseball players, 13 basketball players and eight football players, with no female athletes for the fifth consecutive year.

As most parents know only too well, having children in the house can be something of a passion-killer. But as a former rock-and-roll lothario, Rod Stewart is determined not to let family life get in the way of romance. The 68-year-old has revealed he sleeps with wife Penny Lancaster ‘three quality times’ a week and regularly whisks her away on holiday so they can spend more time alone. He said he hires a nanny to take care of  the children and takes lingerie model Miss Lancaster, 42, to their £3million beach house in Florida where he seduces her with ‘champagne and candlelight’. ‘You’ve got to understand when you’ve got two small kids and you’re both in bed and your son comes home through the door and says mum! dad! – We’ve got to fit it in between the children,’ he said. ‘Four of them live with me and although it’s a massive house it’s very noisy. We go to Florida three or four times a year and that’s probably when I get my leg over the most.’ Stewart, who has two children with third wife Miss Lancaster and a further six  with former partners, also revealed that domestic life at the couple’s Beverly Hills home involves chores, cleaning and the school run – albeit with a bit more glamour than  most of us can muster. He admitted his children were too embarrassed to be driven to school in his Ferrari, so he now drops them off in a Rolls Royce. In a remarkably frank interview with American radio personality Howard Stern, Stewart said: ‘I’m up at 7.30 every  morning, I drive the kids to school in the Rolls. I love my Rolls Royce. 'I used to take Sean in my Ferrari and he hated it. He’d say “please don’t stop right outside the school” but I would. ‘I went to a parent-teacher meeting . last week and I read for [son] Alastair’s class too. I don’t do any . house cleaning though, that’s one thing I don’t do. ‘It’s . funny if the dog does a deposit somewhere and I go and pick it up I’m . always thinking I bet Elton John doesn’t have to do this. ‘No, I do chip in and do my bit of  house cleaning.’ Red light: Stewart's children find his Ferrari embarrassing on the school run . Levels of stardom: Rod Stewart said he did not believe Elton John, right, picked up the dog's mess around the house . But . Stewart admitted struggling to navigate the ‘fine line’ between . ‘spoiling and depriving’ children Sarah, 50, Kimberly, 33, Sean, 32, . Ruby, 25, Renee, 20, Liam, 18, Alastair, seven, and Aiden, three. He . said: ‘I like to give them a little  help investing [in] their careers. But give them piles of cash? No. Because then they just get lazy.’ Miss Lancaster and Stewart married in 2007 and have been together for more than 13 years. He was previously married to Alana Hamilton, now 67, and model Rachel Hunter, 43. But Stewart, who once admitted he slept with so many groupies in his 20s that he lost count, said: ‘I am a different man now. I was a rock star, that’s what you do. But I never really got into orgies. I tried it with a couple of Japanese girls a long time ago and I found it all a bit disappointing and distracting.’ He described himself as a romantic, enjoying ‘candlelight and glass of champagne’ and said: ‘I think I’ve grown up a lot in the past ten years.’ He added: ‘I’ve had my failures, but if I may say, I’m always very kind and I treat women with a great deal of respect when we get intimate like that.’","Secrets to a happy marriage - by former lothario Rod Stewart .

A 13-year-old boy was forced to watch his mother's body wash ashore and his father apparently drown in a tragic snorkelling accent off the coast of Australia. The family was on a 'dream holiday' which they were planning to turn into a book, it emerged today as the search for the missing father continues around the idyllic Coral Bay in Western Australia. The victims were 41-year-old Kathreen Ricketson and her husband Rob Shugg, 48, who were travelling around the country with their son and 10-year-old daughter. Police said today they held grave fears for Mr Shugg, who has not been found despite an intense day-long search off Elle's Beach, south of the bay and the nearby Ningaloo Reef. Couple: Kathreen Ricketson, left, and Rob Shugg, right, apparently drowned off the coast of Western Australia . Inspector Dominic Wood said the couple's son, who had been left on the beach with his sister, raised the alarm after he realised his parents were in trouble when he went into the water to swim with them and saw them face down. It has not been revealed whether they were still wearing snorkelling apparatus. As Ms Ricketson's body washed ashore, another family who had been travelling with them activated an emergency beacon which resulted in police racing to the area. But nothing could be done to help Ms Ricketson. 'It must have been horrific,' said Inspector Wood. 'It must be any child's worst nightmare.' Horror: The tragic accident occurred near to the idyllic resort of Coral Bay in Western Australia, pictured . Just what happened out on the reef to result in a woman dying and her partner going missing was being investigated by police today. But Mr Wood said there were no evident injuries on the woman's body, apparently ruling out a shark attack. Ms Ricketson, from Canberra, wrote on a website as the family set out for their travels around the country that they had a publishing deal for a book called Family Road Trip. 'The book is not just any old travel book,' she wrote. 'It will be part on-the-road memoir, part family camping adventure how-to, but mostly it will be a whole bunch of fun projects that can be done in a day or a weekend by those who want to get away from it all and reconnect with their families.' She continued: 'Our trip will take us, with our camping trailer, around Australia for a year. 'The kids will be home-schooled and Rob and I will be working on the road. We have power, internet and our laptops and so theoretically we will be able to work from almost anywhere.' On a later blog she described the trip to the Ningaloo Reef as 'a dream come true.' Her latest note stated that she and the family were bush camping at a cattle station near the coast and the reef. Trip of a lifetime: The couple were on a family holiday all around Australia in order to write a book . Inspector Wood said the couple entered the water at about 2.45pm on Wednesday and the woman's body washed ashore some 45 minutes later. A search of the reef and inlets near Coral Bay by expert police divers from Perth has failed to find Mr Shugg and Barney Hutchison, from West Australia Water Police, said hopes were dimming as time passed. 'The missing man has been in the water a long time and hopes of finding him fade with each passing hour,' he told ABC radio. Police said that even though the 13-year-old boy described seeing both parents face down in the water, Mr Shugg had since disappeared. Mr Wood said that people on the beach thought the pair was snorkelling when they saw them face down in the water. But when they did not respond to calls from the children, Ms Ricketson was pulled ashore and campers tried desperately to save her life. 'While they were trying to save the life of the mother, they noticed the father was also not moving in the water,' he said. 'As they tried to get him out he disappeared under the water. 'The kids were obviously there and it would have been an absolutely devastating situation for them.' Police said they were regarding the incident as a 'tragic accident'. The couple's children were flown to Perth today where they were met by family members who had flown in from Tasmania.","Kathreen Ricketson and Rob Shugg on 'dream holiday' around Australia .

Mystery: Earlene Johnson (left) from Kansas City, Missouri, is desperately trying to find out why her 11-year-old daughter Falica has ballooned to 400lbs - so far doctors have been unable to come up with a diagnosis . 'We exercise everyday. We’ve been in nutrition classes every since 2007,' she explained. In . September 2012, Falica’s primary care doctor apparently referred her to a children's hospital in Missouri in an attempt to get a diagnosis. However, Ms Johnson claims that instead of getting help she encountered prejudice. 'They . would not do any blood work, they wouldn’t do any X-rays, they wouldn’t . do any testing on my daughter,' the frustrated mom said. Hunting for an answer: Ms Johnson insists that blood tests show good glucose and cholesterol levels, indicating her daughter has a healthy diet . 'They were saying that they believe that . she overeats and that I can stop it. Basically they were telling me that it was my fault. 'Everyone should have proper medical care regardless if you’re white, black, purple, pink, red or whatever.' Ms Johnson . said that she was instructed to follow up with the nutrition clinic. But after making . an appointment she received a surprise visit from Child Services. 'The . next day, when I got home, the State of Missouri and Child Services was . at my house,' she recalled. Fitness regime: The mother and daughter visit their local park everyday for a gentle workout . No action was taken and Ms  Johnson and her daughter are still looking for what’s causing the dangerous weight gain. Ms Johnson says that she takes Falica to the local park everyday for stretching sessions. At the adventure playground they use the slide steps to do gentle step-ups and take long walks. Falica is now attending a program at the Healthy Hawks program at the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Pediatrics, which helps children and their families. To date, she has already lost ten pounds.","Earlene Johnson says blood tests show good glucose and cholesterol levels, indicating a .

A 75-year-old man accused of running a prostitution ring and promoting crack cocaine use within a New Jersey senior housing complex has pleaded not guilty to his charges. James Parham was among three arrested amid allegations of on-going prostitution and drug use at the Vincente Tibbs Senior Citizen Building in Englewood. Standing before a judge on Wednesday Parham declined a public defender to fight the charges, saying 'God is my attorney,' NJ.com reports. Plea: James Parham, 75, accused of possessing a glass pipe used for smoking crack cocaine and maintaining a nuisance in which people gathered for unlawful purposes pleaded not guilty on Wednesday . 'I'm broke right now,' Parham argued his case outside the courtroom. 'If I was promoting prostitution, I'd have money.' In late April police arrested Parham and his 66-year-old neighbor Cheryl Chaney who faces an additional charge of possessing crack cocaine. Police also charged 54-year-old Selma McDuffie, a school crossing guard who has now been suspended and banned from visiting the complex, with having a crack pipe. Chaney and McDuffie, who has since been suspended from her job, are expected in court on June 6. The arrests came after many elderly . residents at the home complained about drunks and addicts invading the . 152-unit building. Many were fearful to leave their rooms, police said. Scene: Residents of the Vincente K. Tibbs Senior Citizen Building in Englewood, New Jersey have been arrested for allegedly setting up a prostitution ring and possessing crack cocaine . 'Essentially, they were prisoners in . their own building,' Chief Arthur O’Keefe of the Englewood police, told the New Jersey Record. 'I wasn’t going to allow that to continue.' The Englewood Housing Authority, . which manages the property serving disabled and low-income residents . over 62, said they carried out checks on the two residents before they . moved in. They met the income guidelines and passed a criminal background check, an official told The Record. But the residents' concerns sparked an undercover investigation and officials checked surveillance footage to track down the perpetrators. The federally-funded housing agency . cannot afford private security guards for the home, officials said, and instead, residents must contact police if they have any issues. But in light of the findings - where people were afraid to leave their rooms after coming face-to-face with addicts and strangers in the hallways - police patrol the building around the clock. O’Keefe said the police department is . understaffed following injuries to several officers in recent . weeks but that he has no plans to end the patrols at the Tibbs complex. 'I'm not going to allow the seniors to fall victim again,' he said. Parham moved to the home in January 2012 while Chaney has lived there since September 2010.","James Parham, 75, 'provided prostitutes to his younger neighbors'

Rapper Drake performed in New York last night - and, contrary to rumours beforehand, he was not arrested over his role in a vicious nightclub brawl with Chris Brown. However, the notorious fight did make an impact on Drake's Long Island show on Saturday, as he appeared to refer to his troubles twice during his set. The concert came as it emerged that the nightclub where Drake and Brown fought over R&B star Rihanna, sending several injured people to hospital, has been closed 'indefinitely'. Scroll down to see the video of Drake and Brown . Performance: Drake managed to get through his New York concert without being apprehended by police . Drake performed at the Jones Beach Theater in the town of Wantagh, and opened his set by saying: 'When I woke up this morning, I had to think about a lot of things.' But he continued: 'But the only thing I gave a f*** about was that I was in New York City tonight,' according to the Daily News. Later in the set, he seemed to make another reference to Wednesday night's scuffle, when he said: 'It's last call and you're really too drunk to give a f***. 'A n***** in the corner is standing there looking at you funny. You bump elbows with him on the way to the bathroom, but really there's only one n***** that you got to think about.' NYPD sources had suggested that the star could be arrested at the concert if he did not turn himself in, but by the time the evening came around there was no sign that he would be taken into custody. Meanwhile it was reported by TMZ that W.i.P., the nightclub in New York's SoHo district, has been shut down indefinitely over a number of violations apparently unrelated to the A-list brawl. Earlier a second bystander released photos of her injuries that were a result of the flying bottles during the fight. No love lost: Chris Brown seen in New York earlier this week, and Drake, . right, seen in London in March. The pair clashed at a nightspot in NYC in the early hours of Thursday . The aftermath: Broken glass can be seen strewn across the bar following the Chris and Drake fight . A woman named Veronica told TMZ that she was sitting at a table near the two rappers when she saw the beginning of the brawl. Veronica had to get stitches on her right hand and has a bruise in the middle of her forehead. 'I heard people screaming ... so I tried to get away from the action and hid behind a couch,' she told the site. What she didn't know at the time was . that the fight, which left the club looking like a war zone with broken . bottles everywhere, was supposedly caused by notorious rapper Chris . Brown sending Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, a bottle of . champagne. While the gesture may seem nice, the . closest connection that the two men have is that they have both been . romantically linked to Rihannna.

Horrific: Hollie C, a 24-year-old Australian tourist, received 16 stitches to close a head wound she received when she was hit with a flying bottle during the fight .

Police seem to agree, as the New York . Post reported that while they are considering Brown a 'witness and . victim', they are now on the hunt for Drake. 'I believe the police are building a case against Drake and his thugs,' Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos told the paper. Said 'thugs' included fellow rapper Meek Mill and a bevy of security handlers. Another serious question comes for . Brown, however, as some of his own posse may have been known gang . members, which would be a violation of his probation agreement for his . previous assault charge. An unidentified source told The Post . that a number of members of the notorious Crips gang might have been . with the 23-year-old rapper when the fight happened around 4am Thursday . morning.

One of the disgraced badminton players disqualified from the Olympic Games for deliberately throwing a match has revealed she is quitting the sport. Chinese player Yu Yang was top seed in the women's doubles with her partner Wang Xiaoli. Today it was reported she announced her retirement on her micro-blog, bidding 'farewell' to the sport. Chinese officials had told their Olympic badminton team leader and shamed players to make a public apology following the scandal, and chief coach Li Yongbo has since taken responsibility for China's part in the scandal. Scroll down to hear the apology . Farce: China's Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang play against South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na . Victors: Kim Ha-na (left) and Jung Kyung-eun (right) eventually won, despite their best efforts . Quiet word: Tournament referee Torsten Berg was forced to intervene after all four players began missing routine shots . The other women's doubles players . implicated were South Korean pairs Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na, and Ha . Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung, plus Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari of . Indonesia. 'The delegation has already severely . criticised and educated the responsible badminton leaders, team and . relevant players and demanded they profoundly recognise the seriousness . and the harmfulness of this matter, reflect deeply on it, publicly . apologise and resolutely prevent such incidents from happening again,' the Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying. World doubles champions Yu Yang (front) and Wang Xiaoli, of China, watch as the shuttlecock yet again lands int he net . Li, chief coach of the Chinese . badminton team, said the poor behaviour of his players reflected the . shortcomings of new rules in the sport. 'I feel that no matter whether it is . the rules or something else, that's no excuse,' said Li. 'The key point . is we did not behave professionally as athletes and did not treat each . match seriously. 'We didn't strive with all our might . in the Olympic way. From that point of view we really didn't grasp this . point thoroughly ... as chief coach I really feel I must say sorry to . fans and viewers nationwide,' Li told Xinhua. The eight players were thrown out of . the Games for throwing matches in a bid to secure more favourable draws . later in the tournament. The players had all qualified for the . quarter-finals of the women’s doubles and were accused of trying to . manipulate the draw by losing so they would be matched with easier . opposition in the next round or avoid playing their teammates. Amid shameful and embarrassing scenes, . players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the . shuttlecock over the court’s lines. The longest rally in one set lasted . just four shots. As a furious backlash grew, Lord Coe, head of London 2012, described the players’ actions as ‘depressing' and 'unacceptable’. The spotlight will be on the Chinese, who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before. Petya Nedelcheva, a Bulgarian player . who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match, said . Chinese players routinely tried to avoid playing each other. Controversy: Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari of Indonesia and Jung Eun Ha and Min Jung Kim of Korea are threatened with a 'black card' Heated: A coach for Indonesia argues with the tournament referee . For the last time? Yu said she would not play Badminton again on Chinese social media site Weibo . I quit: Yu Yung (left) said goodbye to the world of badminton after being disqualified for deliberately trying to lose a gaem . She said: ‘China control everything. I . don’t know who controlled the match to lose but if it is China again, . they did it so many times last year – they didn’t play against each . other in 20 matches. They do what they want.’ The Wembley fiasco began when Chinese . top seeds Wang and Yu started to show little interest in . beating Koreans Jung and Kim to finish top of Group A. Coming second would have meant avoiding compatriots and second seeds Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei until the final. The Koreans responded to China’s antics by copying them. Referee Torsten Berg warned all the . players and produced a black card, meaning they would be disqualified. After protests, this was rescinded. The match restarted and the Koreans went on to win 21-14, 21-11. The matter did not end there as a . second Korean pair, third seeds Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung, attempted . to engineer defeat in their match against Indonesia’s Meiliana Jauhari . and Greysia Polii. Their motive was apparent retaliation . to avoid Xiaoli and Yang in the quarter-finals, an outcome they failed . to achieve as they won 18-21, 21-14, 21-12. The Indonesians were not bystanders in the affair as they responded to the Koreans by trying to lose themselves. Yu reportedly made an announcement via a verified account on Chinese social media site Weibo. The coach of the Japanese women's football team has been told he won't be disciplined - even though he admitted ordering his players not to win a match at the Olympics. Norio Sasaki told his team not to push for a winning goal during their 0-0 draw with South Africa because he knew a victory would force them to play a quarter-final in Glasgow - 350 miles from their Cardiff base. At a press conference after Tuesday's match, Sasaki said the draw had been an ideal result.Japan would have topped their group with a win, but the draw meant they finished second. Consequently, their quarter-final against Brazil on Friday will be played in Cardiff. 'It was a different way of playing compared to the usual game, but the players were on the same page as me,' Sasaki said through a translator. 'I feel sorry we couldn't show a respectable game, but it's my responsibility, not the players, why the game was like that.'It was important for us not to move to Glasgow.' Football's governing body, FIFA, said its disciplinary committee had studied Sasaki’s comments and 'there are no sufficient elements to start disciplinary proceedings' for corruption or 'unlawfully influencing match results'. 'This is my last game. Farewell Badminton World Federation. Farewell my dear badminton,"" she posted. Meanwhile Chinese head coach Li has . taken responsibility for the farce, telling Chinese news agency Xinhua: . 'As head coach, I owe the supporters of Chinese badminton and the . Chinese TV audiences an apology. 'Chinese players failed to demonstrate the fine tradition and fighting spirit of the national team. 'It's me to blame.' Gail Emms, the former British . badminton star and Olympic silver medallist, said: ‘You cannot do this . in an Olympic Games, this is something that is not acceptable . . . it . was just disgraceful.’ Miss Emms said the potential for . match-fixing was raised in a managers’ meeting on Monday but the referee . had dismissed concerns. She added: ‘All the managers got . together with the referee and said, “look, this has happened; in Group D . you will find some very dodgy matches going on in the evening because . of it” and the referee laughed and said “don’t be silly”. ‘The managers said “we know the game, we know the players and we know the teams and we know this is going to happen”.’ Korea’s coach Sung Han-kook laid the . blame squarely at the feet of China. He said: ‘The Chinese started this. They did it first. They didn’t want to meet each other in the . semi-final.’ After the players' disqualification, their places will be taken by the . teams who finished third and fourth in their qualifying groups concerned . – Canada, Australia, Russia and South Africa. Locog said fans would not be given any . refunds, even though some paid up to £80 to see the world’s best . players. Chief executive Paul Deighton said: ‘You get in to all sorts of . strange precedents if people aren’t satisfied with what they see – it . is very grey and dangerous territory.’ BWF . secretary-general Thomas Lund said: 'The regulations clearly state you . have to win every match and you cannot throw some matches to win other . matches. 'There's no two ways about that and that is what the disciplinary committee found in the principles of the Olympic spirit.

"By . Oliver Tree . UPDATED: . 04:52 EST, 4 July 2011 . Capture: Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter, Topsannah (Prairie Flower), in 1861 pictured after she was 'rescued' by government troops . Cynthia Ann Parker, aged just nine, was abducted as her family were brutally slaughtered around her. After her isolated Texan outpost was attacked by Comanche Indians, she was stripped from her mother and spirited away on horseback - brought up to live as one of the tribe. For 24 years the blue-eyed captive remained with her abductors, marrying and bearing children - even forgetting her native English tongue. But in an incredible quirk of fate, one of her sons - Quanah Parker - rose to become one the most feared Native American generals of the 1800s and the last of Comanche leaders to finally surrender the tribe to a life on the reservations under U.S. authorities. The brutal tale of abduction, bloodshed and surrender - a story that was echoed in the John Wayne classic film The Searchers - is the subject of a new book, Empire Of The Summer Moon. Author S.C. Gwynne takes up the tale . of Cynthia Parker - Nautdah to her adopted Comanche family - weaving her . unlikely narrative into the violent sweep of scalpings, raiding parties . and bloody revenge that punctuated frontier life in the mid 1800s. Cynthia's grandfather was scalped and had his genitals removed as his wife was made to watch, while in an attack on another settlement Gwynne tells of a pregnant woman was gang raped before being shot with arrows. She was then scalped alive. Gwynne begins the story of the horrors that befell the Parker family on . May 19 1836. A Comanche raiding party surrounded their ranch in . frontier Texas stormed the lightly manned station - demanding a cow to sacrifice and directions to the . nearest watering hole. Suspecting a trap, the women and children fled out the back door, into cornfields, a dried river bed or open country. As the men walked towards the saddled Comanche, unarmed and offering food, they were brutally attacked, and dismembered before their shocked family members. Fleeing with her mother Lucy and four siblings, Cynthia was run down by the pursuing Comanche, surrounded and torn away from her mother. Gwynne writes: 'The Indians caught them... forced Lucy to surrender two of her children, then  dragged her, the two remaining children and one of the men back to the fort.' Ledaer: Quanah Parker, Cynthia's son, who became a feared Comanche tribal leader . Meanwhile, those who remained inside to face the marauding Comanche suffered the same fate as many other frontier settlers of the time - an agonising death. Tale: S.C. Gwynne has written a bloody and detailed narrative of the Wild West . 'The logic of Comanche raids was . straightforward: All the men were killed, and any men who were captured . alive were tortured; the captive women were gang raped. Some were . killed, some were tortured,' he wrote. 'Babies were invariably killed.' The Parkers were no different - four male family members were pinned to the ground with spears and forcibly scalped. Others who tried to run were . savagely attacked: 'Elder John Parker, his wife Sallie and her daughter . Elizabeth Kellog ...were surrounded and stripped of all their clothing. 'The Indians went to work on them, attacking the old man with tomahawks...forcing Granny Parker to watch what they did to him. 'They scalped him, cut off his genitals and killed him.' The violence was typical of that experienced in Wild West America. In an unrelated episode, Gwynne describes a similar attack on another settler family. After seizing a nine-month pregnant woman, the Comanche: 'Dragged her back to a point about two hundred yards from the cabin. 'There she was gang raped. When they were finished , they shot several arrows into her. 'They . scalped her alive by making deep cuts below her ears and, in effect, . peeling the top of her head entirely off. She lived for four days' Hunters and hunted: Texas Rangers were at the forefront of the battle for the untamed West. Pictured is Frontier Battalion 'B' around 1880 . Mounted: A Native American chief on horseback . But despite her violent introduction to the tribe, Cynthia - now known as Nautdah or 'found one' - eventually married a Comanche leader Peta Nocona. Over the next 24 years she became a fully integrated member of the tribe giving birth to three children including the infamous Quanah. 'The captive women were gang raped. Some were . killed, some were tortured. Babies were invariably killed' As the skirmishes between Texas Rangers and native Americans became more brutal, Washington took a firmer line on the raiding tribes, sending troops in ever greater numbers to hunt down the elusive master horsemen of the plains. It was in one of these raids in 1860 that Cynthia,- barely recognisable as a white woman except for her blue eyes - was 're-captured'. In fact, so integrated was Cynthia, that the only English words she could speak were: 'Me Cincee Ann'. Despite her 'rescue', Cynthia did not feel at home with her American relatives and tried to escape several times. By 1836 the Comanche empire numbered some 30-40,000 people. A vast military machine, they had crushed around 20 other tribes in their relentless expansion with one American commander labelling their soldiers 'the finest light cavalry in the world'. Highly skilled horsemen, individual soldiers could fire 20 arrows in the time it took one American soldier to load and fire a single shot. This once great military power eventually succumbed to the ravages of disease, relentless settler expansion and more frequent attacks by government troops. Heartbroken at never again seeing her two sons - who escaped in the 1860 raid - she grew more introvert and ill. When her young daughter died at the age of five her health rapidly declined, and she died lonely and alone in 1870 aged 43. Her son Quanah, however, went on to lead a Comanche tribe before he was even 20. Unusually tall and athletic for the usually diminutive Comanche, Quanah sealed his reputation in a number of daring raids . His . greatest victory came in 1871 when he outwitted a government force of . 600 soldiers, successfully attacking their camp at night while leading . an entire village to safety. But . by the mid-1870s life was becoming impossible for the nomadic Comanche, . and on June 2, 1875 Quanah led his village into captivity, the last . Comanche commander to do so. In . his remaining years Quanah enjoyed a certain celebrity and became a . successful cattle rancher as the remains of the once proud Comanche . empire collapsed around him.

Shocking figures about cheddar's high-salt content surfaced in November, when the Mail reported that the cheese can . contain as much salt as junk food products, and a single portion has a greater . amount of salt than a bag of crisps. And it seems supermarkets are responding to the news accordingly as the first ever reduced-salt mild cheddar cheese launches in the UK today. The ground-breaking cheese, which will go on sale exclusively at more than 600 Tesco stores, will offer health-conscious British shoppers a cheddar with a 30 per cent reduction of salt. Cheese, especially cheddar, is one of the most popular foods in Britain but also one of the biggest contributors of salt to the UK diet . Cheese, and especially cheddar, is . one of the most popular foods in Britain, but it is one of the biggest . contributors of salt to the UK diet, along with bacon and bread. Alarming levels of salt in cheese contribute to high blood pressure, which is responsible for . strokes, heart attacks and thousands of early deaths a year, reported Consensus . Action on Salt and Health (CASH). With more people than ever watching their salt intake Tesco believes this new cheese will fill an . important gap in the market. Tesco cheese category buying manager . David Chamberlain said: 'Cheddar is the most consumed cheese in Britain . with plenty of different varieties to suit a wide range of tastes - from . mild to extra strong and even those that can reduce your cholesterol. 'There are also several different fat-reduced cheddars available, but now shoppers across the UK will have easy . access to a reduced-salt variety for the first time. 'This cheese has been developed over several years by one of the UK's top dairy producers and we believe it stands up well against regular mild cheddars. We also think it will inspire other cheese makers to follow suit. 100g of cheese can contain 1.5g to 3.5g of salt. 50g/2oz cheddar - a piece the size of a small matchbox or the amount you'd get in a cheese sandwich - contains 0.8g salt. You could try replacing high-salt cheddar and feta with mozzarella and cream cheeses, which are relatively low in salt. The cheese has been made for Tesco by . award-winning dairy producers Joseph Heler, who have become well known . for their ground-breaking work within the reduced fat cheese market. Small amounts of salt are essential for health, but Tesco and Heler were conscious that there are a number of people within the UK who are watching their salt intake yet still want to continue to enjoy every day foods. Tesco nutritionist Karen Tonks added: 'Reducing salt consumption is an important factor in helping to reduce early deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. 'Cheese is a popular product both as a snack and as an ingredient and is a good source of calcium and protein but its salt content means that you have to keep an eye on the portion size. 'Now with a reduced salt cheese in the range it means it is easier to balance salt intakes - especially when combining with other foods that also contain salt - and with a great flavour the family won't notice the difference.'

A woman who described herself as a ‘real life Princess Fiona’ has lost six stone in weight after an embarrassing incident that left her stuck in her cinema seat. Victoria Lambley, 36, from Nottingham, had spent the evening watching Shrek in her local cinema.  but when the lights went up at the end of the film she tried to stand up - only to find she was stuck in her chair. Mother of three, who at 5ft 2in weighed 16st, struggled to lift herself out but remained firmly wedged. Eventually managing to free herself, a mortified Victoria vowed to lose weight. Now, four years on, she weighs just 10st and wears a size 10 dress. A slimline Victoria pictured at a cinema with her old jeans (left) and right, at her largest, before losing weight . 'When I realised I was trapped in the seat I wanted the ground to swallow me up - it was humiliating,' she said. 'I was out with my kids and struggled to get out before the lights came on and people saw. I had to push my chunky thighs out from under the arm rests. It really shocked me. I could no longer deny how big I'd become. 'Since I've lost the weight I feel so much better, but I still keep my old jeans to remind me never to go back.' Victoria had always been big, never having been below a size 16, but gained more weight as she got older and had children. At her biggest she was wearing a size 20, and claims even that was a squeeze. Victoria pictured at the Dodgems around the time of the humiliating cinema incident . She said: 'Everything was a challenge when I was overweight - I couldn't walk anywhere or do stuff with my kids. 'I'd diet for a week, but then reward myself with a takeaway if I lost half a pound. 'Getting stuck in the cinema made me realise how bad I was - I was the real life Princess Fiona. 'I panicked - it's the same feeling as when you get a ring stuck on your finger, but much more embarrassing.' Since the incident at the Savoy Cinema in 2009, Nottingham, Victoria has joined Weight Watchers and lost six stone. She has now been at her target weight for over a year but admits that chocolate is her weakness. 'I would eat a few bars every day, especially Time Outs. And I'd go through family bags of crisps. My car was stuffed with emergency chocolate snacks,' she said. Mother of three Victoria pictured before the weight loss (left) and right, four years later (and six stone lighter) Since the incident at the Savoy Cinema in 2009, Victoria has joined WeightWatchers and lost six stone . 'I thought the weight loss classes would be like Little Britain and I'd be weighed in front of everyone, but nothing else had worked for me and I had to try it. 'My friend dragged me along and now I never miss a class. It's not at all like I expected, we're like a family.' For Victoria the class really was family, as her brother Matthew, 33, joined and lost eight and a half stone himself. Victoria said: 'I got him into it, but he carried on and did the hard work himself. He's been really supportive and I couldn't have done it without him.' Since losing the weight Victoria's confidence has rocketed and she's even found love. She said: 'I've known Christian since we were kids, but I never thought a nice guy like him would be interested in me. But thanks to my new confidence we got together and now we're engaged. 'We're in no rush to get married but I can't wait to fit into a size ten wedding dress.'

From the hockey sticks gathering dust in the attic to the gym kit lying forlornly at the back of your wardrobe, most of us have splashed out on at least one sporty item that hasn't made the grade. But rather than let her old yoga mat go to waste, one unimpressed gym-dodger decided to give her cast-off a new lease of life. Anjelika Paranjpe, creative director of innovative craft website Brit + Co, came up with not one but 20 different ways to make it happen. Not using your yoga mat? Why not convert it into a useful case for your iPad or laptop . Anjelika Paranjpe, creative director of . innovative craft website Brit + Co, came up with not one but 20 . different ways to turn an unwanted yoga mat into useful bits and pieces . 'After years of downward dogs and sun salutations, it's time to retire your very first yoga mat,' she explains via the website. 'As it turns out, yoga mats are . ridiculously versatile for repurposing, from flip flops to laptop covers . to keychains to koozies!' Along . with koozies (America's version of for beer holders and coffee mug warmers), Paranjpe also managed to whip . up everything from mouse mats and hair ties to clutch bags and bottle 'corks' using just her old yoga . mat and some scissors, string and superglue. Not that you need them for everything. Paranjpe's simplest idea was to reuse the whole mat by turning it into a lining for a drawer. Making a coaster is also an easy option . according to Paranjpe, who says they are 'perfect for absorbing . the perspiration of an ice-cold glass of water - cut to a size that works . for your glasses and you're done'. Paranjpe's electric blue mousemat and slippers are both made from a discarded yoga mat, and her online tutorial is just one of many on innovative craft website Brit + Co . Even more helpfully, your brand new . coaster will also double as a jar opener - something that Paranjpe . discovered when faced with a recalcitrant jar of of Smucker's Caramel . Topping. Anjelika Paranjpe, creative director of Brit + Co . 'This was made out . of pure necessity here at Brit HQ,' she explains. 'We couldn't get the . darned Smucker's Caramel Topping open and grabbed the closest thing . around, which happened to be a yoga mat. Those grips are still good for . something!' Much more . impressive was the surprisingly stylish chair cover, which despite . looking like something Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen spent hours on, is . actually relatively easy to make. 'We recommend using paper bags to create a templates,' she advises. 'Trace onto the yoga mat using a coloured pencil, and cut! 'If you want to attach, punch a hole on each side and use string, shoelaces, or ribbon.' Other . ideas included place mats, a laptop case, a bottle stopper and knee . pads. Any thin shreds left over can be turned into hair ties. Waste not, . want not! Other home-furnishing ideas include creating a seat cover or protecting floors with yoga mat scratch pads . Paranjpe's online tutorial is one of many on Brit + Co, an innovative website teaching people how to get creative at home, be it with a pair of scissors, a bottle of nail polish or a frying pan.

All you need are superglue, scissors and a packet of popper fastenings, which can be picked up in most haberdashery stores, including John Lewis. Paranjpe explains: 'You already knew that yoga was fashionable, but who knew you could accessorise with a yoga mat? 'Cut a large rectangle with a rounded top. Fold into a style you like, and measure where you want your snap buttons [popper fastenings] to be. 'Attach the snap buttons using super glue.

Guests joined in with the fun of the theme dressing in suitably ghoulish attire and applying theatrical 'undead' make-up - even 'zombifying' a small child.

Jennifer Jones (left) and Rob Blackmore (right) dressed as the undead for their big day . 'When technology grew and computer games came out, the first zombie game I played was Resident Evil. From there it just escalated and I became a huge fan. I've never played a zombie game I haven't liked.' Jennifer, 27, said: 'My mum wasn't even surprised. Everyday is like Halloween for me. She loved the idea.' Asked whether she had ever dreamed of a white wedding, Jennifer replied: 'It was never going to be like that. We wanted to get married on Halloween anyway so it was always going to be a spooky, creepy, weird wedding.' The couple, from Stockbridge, Liverpool, were able to have the wedding they'd always wanted after winning a competition. Organisers gave an open invitation to footballer Luis Suarez to attend the ceremony after he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic during a Premier League match on Sunday. Guests joined in with the fun of the theme by dressing up as flesheating beasts . But Jennifer said she would have 'tackled him and bit him first' had the Liverpool striker turned up for her big day. More than 250 people gathered for the unorthodox ceremony at One Mayfair in central London. The couple had entered a Facebook competition to win a zombie wedding organised by the makers of new video game Dead Island Riptide. They beat dozens of applicants by impressing the judges with their enthusiasm for the game series. The ceremony was decorated as a hellish Caribbean paradise - a theme that runs through the Dead Island series of games.

A mother-of-three who lost a staggering 18 stone in 15 months is celebrating her weight loss with her new toyboy. Nicole Miller, 36, went from 27 stone to nine stone in just over a year, determined to turn her life around after ending an abusive relationship. And now the ex-chip shop owner from Wallsend, North Tyneside, has found love, with Lee Richardson, 27, with whom she plans to set up a weight loss business. Glamorous Nicole is now a svelte size 8 and even shares clothes with her 11-year-old  daughter. She has her sights set on becoming a bodybuilder after a tummy tuck operation to remove excess skin in the summer. Nicole, who suffered from depression, weighed 27 stone size for 11 years due to her constant comfort eating. On an average day, Nicole would consume in excess of 5,000 calories binging on junk food and waking in the night with food cravings . Nicole's diet consisted of takeaways, multiple packets of crisps, biscuits, stacks of bacon sandwiches and microwave curries. 'I wouldn't really have breakfast,' said Nicole. 'I would start eating at about 1 o'clock in the afternoon. 'I would have four bacon sandwiches and then just eat continuously as the day went on. 'I would eat anything and everything. 'I would even get up in the night at two or three in the morning and eat. 'I would make sandwiches, microwave curries - anything - and I must have eaten half of the profits out of my chip-shop. 'Then when I was full I would go back to bed. It was out of depression. I wasn't being greedy - I was comforting myself.' It was a trip to her GP 15 months ago that set Nicole into action, when the doctor told her that her weight was slowly killing her. But despite being offered gastric band surgery, Nicole wanted to lose the  weight herself, and embarked on a strict regime of exercise and healthy eating. The next day, Nicole started at the gym. 'It took me 20 minutes to walk in,' she said. Nicole, pictured before her weight loss, went from 27 stone to nine bagging her a toyboy in the process . The ex-chip shop owner has found love with Lee Richardson with whom she plans to set up a business . 'I was so embarrassed. I thought everyone would be looking at me and laughing but it wasn't like that at all. At first I could barely walk on the treadmill for two minutes but now I can run for an hour solid.' It wasn't an easy journey for Nicole, who still exercises four times a week, but every day without fail she would turn up at the gym for another gruelling session. The hard work soon started to pay off, and in the first week Nicole lost 11lb, and has carried on shrinking ever since. Nicole met her new boyfriend Lee a year ago, after the pair started talking about their bull mastif dogs outside of Nicole's chip shop in Whitley bay, North Tyneside. 'I didn't want a relationship when I was big because I didn't like myself,' said Nicole. 'I wasn't looking for a relationship when I met Lee but we just clicked.' Lee, a website designer, said: 'She didn't want me, she just wanted the dog. Nicole pictured with her partner Lee . 'When I see pictures of her at her . biggest I can't believe she's the same person as she'd already started . to lose weight when I met her.' Nicole now wants to use her experiences to help other women who are struggling with their weight, and with the support of Lee, is starting up a weight loss and fitness business called Butterfly Diet. 'I've called it the Butterfly Diet because at 36 I have eventually become the butterfly I always wanted to be. 'During my marriage I was very unhappy. 'I was always made to feel like I wasn't important. 'I wasn't doing normal woman stuff like doing my hair and make-up because I wasn't allowed to do that. 'But now I've come out of my cocoon so to speak. 'I want to use my experiences to help other women.' Nicole plans to show off all of her hard work by taking to the stage as a bodybuilder. With competitions set firmly in her sights, Nicole intends to work on her muscle definition and compete as early as next year. And Nicole's children, Harrison, 18, Abriz, 11 and Amir 8, couldn't be prouder of their mum - although the weight loss has led to a spate of wardrobe-raiding between mother and daughter. 'My 11-year old daughter has taken to stealing my clothes,' said Nicole. 'I even caught her wearing my bra the other day. But I must admit, I did have her trousers on yesterday. 'At least I can chase them around the house now if they're naughty - they used to be able to get away!' Consumed 5,000 calories a day eating junk food and waking in the night with food cravings .
