"A front in the Yukon has caused mountain ash berries to ferment, and as an unfortunate result the birds that feed on them are nearly drinking themselves to death. The berry is a particular favorite of the Bohemian waxwing. The alcoholic berries leave them so intoxicated they may even have difficulties flying and avoiding obstacles. 'There are many, many records of waxwings drinking themselves almost to death,' Derek Matthews, chair of the Vancouver Avian Research Center,said, according to AOL. Still others have been killed or injured by flying drunk into windows and walls. To help deal with the tipsy birds, the animal health unit of Environment Yukon is putting together an avian drunk tank to help sober them up. Birds who might be intoxicated are put into a hamster cage to sleep it off. For those with an advanced berry binge problem, there's even a 'rehab' program at the Yukon Wildlife Preserve. According to a 2012 study, the birds have an abnormally large liver and therefor a higher tolerance. The binges are a seasonal Yukon occurrence in November and December as the berries ferment.","A front in the Yukon has caused mountain ash berries to ferment .

"BBC host Nick Robinson has apologised after posing for a photograph with a candidate standing for a far right party. The Corporation's political editor was criticised online after smiling in the picture with Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First – a spin off from the British National Party. He admitted he made a 'mistake' while covering the Rochester and Strood by-election overnight. Scroll down for video . Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First, posted this photo with Nick Robinson on the party's Facebook page . Mr Robinson later apologised on Twitter, saying he made a mistake by not checking who she was . Journalists descended on the Kent town to cover the by-election triggered by the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless to Ukip. Mr Reckless won the seat by 2,920 votes, in a major blow for David Cameron Conservatives. Ms Fransen was among 13 candidates standing in the seat. While votes were being counted, she asked Mr Robinson to pose for the photograph. The image was then posted on Britain First's Facebook page. Critics on Twitter said the picture was 'shameful' and suggested Mr Robinson should resign. Writing on the social media site, Mr Robinson said: ‘Lesson of the day. Never agree to have selfie taken without first checking who's asking. Shame but my mistake.’ Ms Fransen secured just 56 votes in the by-election, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. Mr Reckless beat Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst, with Labour pushed into third. He follows Douglas Carswell into the Commons, after he became Ukip's first elected MP after defecting in August. The Liberal Democrats continued a humiliating string of by-election performances, finishing fifth behind the Greens with just 349 votes and losing another deposit. Turnout was 50.67 per cent. The picture was taken at the count at Medway Park in Gillingham where the result of the Rochester and Strood by-election was announced . A jubilant Nigel Farage celebrates the victory of Tory defector Mark Reckless who became Ukip's second elected MP in a devastating blow to the Conservatives . Mr Reckless was later sworn in as Britain's second Ukip MP in the Commons. He declared that Ukip will 'give you back your country' after winning his seat by 2,920 votes, erasing the Tory majority of almost 10,000 that he secured in 2010. In his acceptance speech, Mr Reckless said: 'If we can win here, we can win across the country. If you vote Ukip, you get Ukip.' Jubilant Nigel Farage punched the air and declared that the 'massive, massive' win in what he called a 'David v Goliath battle' meant 'all bets are off' for the general election in 2015. The result is embarrassing for David Cameron who just six weeks ago tore into Mr Reckless and vowed to kick his 'fat a***' out of the Commons. Today the Prime Minister insisted he is 'absolutely determined' to win the seat back at the general election.","Nick Robinson pictured smiling in photo with Britain First's deputy leader .

"A man from upstate New York decided to turn his snow day into a video project on Wednesday and sent his drone out into the snow to see what splendor it could capture. James Grimaldi of West Seneca New York sent his drone flying over the snow-covered houses and frosted trees. What the drone filmed was a series of romantic winter images from a perspective that resembles gazing into a holiday snow globe. Covered: There isn't an inch of road in sight in the heavily snowed on Upstate New York area . AccuWeather.com reports that West Seneca got 65.1 inches of snow late Tuesday night through Friday but wasn't the most snowed on area. 'The areas that got hit the hardest were farther away from the lake than West Seneca and had lower temperatures,' AccuWeather.com Expert Meteorologist Brett Anderson said. 'In West Seneca, the air was warmer and the snow was heavier and wetter, so it compacted more than fluffy snow would have,' he added. In Lancaster New York over 74 inches fell and plows couldn't even keep up with the demand.

"Beer drinkers who have a sweet tooth can now get their fix in a bottle. Hogs Back Brewery in Tongham, Surrey, and Montezuma's Chocolate in West Sussex have combined their expertise to create the unique 4.5 per cent Chocolate Lager. It took six months and 'a happy accident' to create the final product and it means chocoholic beer lovers can now get both of their fixes at once. Hogs Brewery has teamed up with Montezuma Chocolate to create the UK's first chocolate lager . 1. Sapporo Space Barley (5.5% ABV)  features barley that was on the International Space Station. The 2009 limited edition beer was released in 250 six packs that sold for around $100 each. 2. Mamma Mia Pizza Beer (4.7% ABV) was developed in 2006 by Tom and Athena Seefurth in Illinois, America. The brew is made with tomatoes, onions and garlic. 3. Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana Ale (5.3% AVB) is an artisan ale which contains essence of chocolate, banana and peanut butter. 4. Coconut Curry Hefeweizen (8% ABV) is a cloudy yellow beer with bold coconut and curry tones. The beer is brewed with  cinnamon, coriander, fenugreek, ginger, kaffir lime, and cayenne pepper and carries a bit of heat. 5. Oyster Stout (4.6% ABV) is a Porterhouse Brew and is said to be a balanced and smooth stout with a hint of sweetness derived from the fresh oysters which are shucked into the conditioning tank of the beer. Rupert Thompson, the owner of Hog's Back Brewery, said: 'We are the only people producing chocolate lager in the UK. 'We were originally intending to do an ale - we thought something dark would go best with chocolate. 'But when we tried it with a light lager it blew us away. 'The main challenge was to add the chocolate without its fat, as fat cannot be added to beer because it ruins the head.' In the past, a dark roasted malt has been used to create a chocolate brew. Montezuma's chocolate lager does things differently, using chocolate essence extracted from Montezuma's dark Lordy Lord bar. This results in a very strong chocolate aroma. Beer reviewers at ratebeer.com have mixed feelings about the lager. A Surrey reviewer Theydon_Bois describes the lager as having  'sweet milk chocolate' nose with a 'honey, Coco Pops and chocolate malt' taste. He wrote it was 'pleasant enough' but he 'wouldn’t be rushing back for it.' Polarising: According to brewer owner Rupert Thompson, drinkers will either love or hate the beer . Mr Thompson describes the beer as having 'a bit of a Marmite effect' with people either loving it or hating it. He said: 'Some people just don't like the concept of chocolate in beer, even if they do like the taste.' Simon Pattinson, founder of Montezuma's, said: 'As projects go, beer and chocolate is probably about as good as it gets. 'I personally like it with savoury food, like you'd have a normal beer.' Montezuma's chocolate lager has already won a gold award at the International Beer Challenge 2014. The beer could accompany desserts in the place of wine, or stand alone. Mr Thompson continued: 'Chocolate puddings are notoriously difficult to complement with wines but it could work very well if this lager were added to dessert menus.' The £2 bottle of lager is available to buy on Montezuma’s website.","Hogs Brewery in Surrey teamed up with West Sussex confectioners .

"Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King is recovering well from proton therapy treatment in Prague, his parents have revealed. Resting at the family's home in Spain, the child is now doing 'so much better' and is able to walk and talk after being confined to a hospital bed for months. He was released from the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech Republic last month after undergoing a pioneering procedure to fight a tumour in his brain. Ashya King is recovering well from proton therapy treatment he received in Prague, his parents said. The five-year-old was released from the Proton Therapy Centre at the end of October (pictured) after undergoing 30 rounds of treatment . Today his father, Brett King said: 'He’s communicating with us, because he can hear us and he can see us. 'He’s so much, so much better now and we’re really happy with him, the fact that he’s saying a few words as well,” Mrs King told ITV. 'He’s just improving each day.' Ashya's case made headlines across the world when his parents sparked an international manhunt after removing him from a Southampton hospital without doctors' consent on August 28. Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly five-year-old in their care. After being traced to Malaga, Mr and Mrs King were arrested and put in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities. Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days. The five-year-old is recovering at his family's home in Spain with parents Brett and Naghmeh (pictured). The couple sparked an international manhunt in August after removing the child from Southampton General Hospital without doctors' permission . Ashya was taken to Prague from Spain where his parents fled with him in August after becoming unsatisfied with the care he was receiving in the UK . The child arrived in Prague with his parents in September after they were dramatically released from jail . In a dramatic turn of events his parents were released without charge and able to travel to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre. NHS England reversed its position and agreed to pay for the treatment. Ashya was released at the end of October after undergoing 30 rounds of therapy. Despite his promising recovery, Mr King said today he would not return to the UK with Ashya until he was assured nothing could be done to separate the family again. 'If they ever try to take Ashya away that would kill us. 'Until things are established with what’s going to happen with Ashya, we feel too scared to return with Ashya,' the 51-year-old said. 'There's a real fear that we have, not regarding us being arrested again but regarding Ashya. Ashya has undergone dozens of rounds of treatment at the centre in Prague (treatment room pictured) British police sparked an international manhunt after the child went missing with his parents on August 28. Pictured, a Hampshire Police press conference on the morning Ashya was taken from hospital . 'We don't really know what social services and the NHS have in store for us. They've never come forward and said ""it's been a mistake, we'll never do it again. 'We've heard many stories when families go back, they think it’s safe to go back, the social services get involved. 'They take the child away. And then they give a gagging order for the parents so they can never explain their story to anyone.'","Ashya King is recovering well from proton therapy treatment, say parents .

"An adorable video showing ducklings and their families being rescued from a range of precarious situations including manholes and busy roads has gone viral and been viewed more than 65 million times. The cute clip called People Being Awesome which lasts three minutes was put up by Animals Australia and is part of a campaign calling for duck shooting to be banned in Victoria in the lead up to the election on November 29. It has been viewed nearly 65 million times and been shared an amazing 1.4 million times by people that have loved the video. Scroll down for video . Team effort: The cute video has gone viral and been shared more than 1.4 million times . This willing volunteer is helped by two friends down a manhole to try and rescue a duckling . It takes four people in all to get to one little distressed duckling which had been trapped down the hole . Lyn White, Campaign Director for Animals Australia, told news.com.au that the response to the video has been 'overwhelming'. She added: 'The response to this small video has been extraordinary and reinforces that overwhelmingly people want our native waterbirds to be protected, not shot out of the sky in the name of 'sport',' she said. 'It provides such a powerful indication of what people are seeking and responding to when it comes to human behaviour — people are responding to empathy not apathy — and whichever political party finally recognises this will reap the rewards.' The first clip in the video shows a man dangling down a manhole as his two friends hold onto his legs and after a few moments they start to pull him up and it shows him retreieving an adorable duckling which scuttles off. Animal rights group Animals Australia shows a heart wrenching picture of a duck injured as a result of shooting as part of their campaign and explains that the duck shooting is already banned in Western Australia, NSW and Queensland. They say that the Victorian government still 'support the recreational slaughter of native water birds'. It says: 'With the state election coming up on November 29, the Victorian Labor Party wants every vote they can get. So and make our wetlands safe for everyone to enjoy. 'With fewer than 0.4% of Victorians actively involved in shooting and more than 75% of Victorians supporting a ban on duck shooting, we've teamed up with RSPCA Victoria and over 50 other groups to send a clear message to Labor on behalf of Victorians: 'Our waterbirds should be safe, not shot.' Will you join us?' Animals Australia have compiled a joint letter with RSPCA which has been signed by more than 50 other comservation and welfare groups. It calls of all Victorian Labour MPs to ban the shooting of native Australian ducks. Worth the effort: The volunteer looks proud as punch when he finally got to the duckling . The letter states: 'Many ducks aren't killed instantly. Instead they suffer fractured legs, shattered bills, splintered wings, pellets through their eyes and gunshot lodged in vital organs. These wounded birds often face a slow, painful death.' So it's no wonder the three minute video, People Being Awesome, posted and compiled by Animals Australia has gone viral with more than 1,410, 000 shares, and 64,186,372 views. The video, which features a range of people rescuing ducks and opens on a man being held down a manhole to save a duckling, forms part of a new campaign by the animal rights group urging Victorian Labor to change their policy on duck shooting. Animals Australia said other states including Western Australia, Queensland and NSW have already banned it so it was time Victoria did the same. Simply beautiful: This is one of the fluffy little ducklings which was rescued on the video which has gone viral . Animals Australia have sent a joint letter with the RSPCA, and it has been signed by more than 50 other animal welfare and conservation groups, calling on all Victorian Labor MPs and candidates to ban the 'cruel sport'. 'Duck-shooting is a practice that causes unnecessary suffering to native wildlife and is also opposed by the vast majority of Victorians,' the letter reads. 'The ALP taking a decision that reflects the wishes of most Victorians, rather than a small and declining number of shooters, is not only appropriate but would elicit an overwhelmingly positive response from the Victorian community.'","The cute video has gone viral and been shared more than 1.4 million times .

"New statistics reveal that an astonishing number of individuals in the United States are infected with sexually transmitted diseases. According to the Center for Disease Control, there are a total of 110 million STDs among the men and women of America, with 20 million new cases being reported every year. The direct medical cost of these infections is said to be $16 billion. Scroll down for video . Scary stats: 110 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases have been reported in the United States, with chlamydia, as seen in the chart above, being one of the most common . Growing numbers: Each year, 20 million news cases of STDs, including syphilis (above), are reported . Perhaps most frightening however is the fact that 50% of new infections occur in individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. This all comes at a time when many in the country are terrified of the threat of Ebola, an infectious disease that has so far been found in just one individual currently in the United States. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common, accounting for almost 80 million existing infections and just over 14 million new ones each year. The four other most common existing infections are, in order, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, chlamydia and HIV according to numbers being reported on Live Science. Chlamydia is the second highest in terms of new infections ever year, and also one of the hardest to measure as many who are infected are unaware as they don't show any symptoms. HIV meanwhile seems to be slowly decreasing when compared to other STDs, with only 40,000 new cases being reported every year. About 50.5 million current infections are in men while 59.5 million are in women.","There are 110 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States alone, with HPV being the most common .

"President Barack Obama knew he'd be upsetting Republicans in Congress when he announced on Tuesday his intentions to press ahead with unilateral action on immigration. GOP leaders had been telling him for months that any attempt to circumvent the legislative process would be met with fierce opposition. But a handful of Senate Democrats came out against executive action, as well, this week, saying they'd rather Congress make fixes to the immigration system than the president. 'I'm disappointed the president decided to use executive action at this time on this issue, as it could poison any hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the new Senate before it has even started,' North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp told Politico on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Signed, sealed, delivered: President Barack Obama signs two presidential memoranda associated with his actions on immigration in his office on Air Force One as he arrives at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, this afternoon . Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia told Reuters, 'I wish he wouldn't do it.' Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill was also hesitant to fully get behind the president. 'I have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable, I think it probably makes most Missourians uncomfortable,' she told Reuters. Several of the Democratic lawmakers acknowledged that like Obama, their first preference would have been for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Their failure to do so doesn't give him license to issue his own rules, though, they said. 'I am as frustrated as anyone that Congress is not doing its job, but the president shouldn't make such significant policy changes on his own,' Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly said in a press release on Thursday. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said this week that he thought Obama should have waited until after newly elected members had the chance to weigh in on the issue before taking matters into his own hands. 'If I were the president, what I'd say to the Congress — House, Senate, Democrat or Republican — I'm going to give you a little bit of time and in the new Congress expect you to do something,' Carper told reporters. As a result of midterm election victories, Republicans will hold at least eight additional seats in the Senate, if not nine, depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 runoff in Louisiana. Republicans also picked up at least a dozen seats in the House of Representatives, and potentially several more that have yet to be decided. President Obama blew off this week suggestions from both Republicans and his fellow Democrats that he give the GOP one more shot to make changes to the immigration system before going it alone, however, arguing at a press conference last Sunday that he'd been given the opposition party plenty of opportunities to act and he was done waiting. Across the street from the White House, Leaders of Casa de Maryland and SEIU 36BJ led the celebration today of President Obama's temporary measures to delay the deportation of nearly five million immigrants. Supporters of immigration reform pose for a photo while holding a banner thanking Obama for his speech last night . 'On immigration reform it continues to be my great preference to see Congress pass comprehensive legislation, because that is not reversed by a future President, it would have to be reversed by a future Congress,' Obama said in response to a reporter's question about the possibility of a future president rescinding his executive order. 'That’s part of the reason why I’ve argued consistently that we’re better off if we can get a comprehensive deal through Congress.That’s why I showed extraordinary patience with Congress in trying to work a bipartisan deal,' Obama stated. 'That’s why I was so encouraged when the Senate produced a bipartisan immigration deal and why I waited for over a year for Speaker Boehner to call that bipartisan bill in the House.' But, the president said, 'I can’t wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that, at least for the next two years, can improve the system, can allow us to shift more resources to the border rather than separating families' and 'improve the legal immigration system. 'I would be derelict in my duties if I did not try to improve the system that everybody acknowledges is broken,' he argued. In an address to the nation on Thursday night officially announcing the contents of his forthcoming executive order, Obama again proclaimed that he'd been backed into a corner by Congress and was taking the lead on the issue only because lawmakers on Capitol Hill refused to bring his preferred reforms up for debate. 'Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote,' he said. 'Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President – the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me – that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.'

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A young mother was tossed screaming on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive after being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery. Kepari Leniata, 20, 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with white-hot iron rods. She was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres. As the mother-of-two screamed in agony, more petrol-soaked tyres were thrown on top of her. Brutal: In February, a young woman was burnt alive on a pile of tyres (pictured) for allegedly killing a boy . The horrendous scene took place in in the village of . Paiala, in the highlands of Papua New Guinea where many believe that witchcraft exists and sorcery is used to kill enemies. The head bishop of a Lutheran Church located in the district today condemned the killing. ‘Sorcery . and sorcery-related killings are growing and the government needs to . come up with a law to stop such practice,’ David Piso told The National . newspaper. ‘Many innocent and helpless people . have been killed and tortured after being accused of witchcraft, but . taking a life is against the teachings of the Bible and the laws of the . country,’ he said. The tragedy unfolded after Miss Leniata's . young neighbour fell sick on Tuesday morning. He complained of pains in . the stomach and chest and was taken to Mt Hagen hospital where he died a . few hours later. Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands . Scene: The two women had been tied to poles and were about to be burned alive when police arrived in Mount Hagen . Relatives of the boy were suspicious . that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had . gone into hiding in the jungle. After they were tracked down, the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy's death. Miss Leniata, they said, was the person responsible. The boy's family went to her hut at 7am on Wednesday, stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death. Pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online. The . Post Courier newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of . two ‘provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers, including . school children, who crowded around and took photos of the woman being . consumed alive by the fire.’ Police who rushed to the area were . turned back by the angry crowd, but were able to drive away with one of . the other women while the second has fled. Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture) Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages . Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. Papua New Guinean police have launched a murder . investigation and are reportedly preparing charges against those . responsible. A firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd. Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, leaves behind two children, the youngest an eight-month-old girl. The country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has sworn to bring the killers to justice, as he addressed the matter in a statement today. ‘No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said. ‘Barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country. 'It is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with.’ The U.S. embassy on the Papua New Guinea issued a statement condemning the ""’brutal murder’ calling it evidence of ‘pervasive gender-based violence’. ’We add our voice to those of Papua New Guinean religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon Ms Leniata,’ the embassy said. ‘There is no possible justification for this sort of violence. We hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying, prosecuting, and punishing those responsible for Ms Leniata's murder.’","Police turned back by lynch mob in highlands of Papua New Guinea .

"A hateful roadside sign blaming Africa for disease and Barack Obama has sparked outrage in Nebraska.

A hateful roadside sign blaming Africa for disease and Barack Obama was erected by a man near a highway in Minden, Nebraska, and was soon shared across social media . Mayor-elect Ted Griess said he received an email 'to the effect it was creating quite a stir in the community'. He told NBC Nebraska: 'It was being transferred all the way across this nation from one Facebook account to the next.' Mr Griess tracked down the owner of the sign and after reasoning with him it was taken down. The man's name has not been released. The sign thanked Africa for the Ebola crisis which has claimed more than 5,000 lives; health workers in Guinea are pictured preparing to move the body of a victim who died from the virus . Mr Griess said: 'It was so large and it was coming into the community alongside the highway and, as the mayor-to-be, I didn't want that type of image to be portrayed in Minden, Nebraska. We're called the Christmas City.' Current Minden Mayor Roger Jones said he thought the sign was 'stupid' and couldn't 'believe anybody would do that'. The sign also upset local residents. Bruce Lindstrom said he was 'stunned that America has come to this place where hatred and the vitriol is so wide open'.","The sign was erected by a man near a highway in Minden, Nebraska .

"A stroll across the tree tops of Tyrol high in the Austrian alps will finally be possible from Saturday with the opening of the long-awaited 1,329feet-long suspension bridge, Highline179. The bridge connecting the ruins of 700-year-old Castle Ehrenberg with the remains of the 17th-century Roman fortress Claudia in the market town of Reutte welcomes its first visitors from 3pm on November 22. From the lofty height of 376 feet, up to 500 people at any one time can walk along the 4ft-wide bridge between the historic relics, with the stunning mountains and valleys always in sight, for eight euros (£6.30) for adults and five (£3.95) for ages four to 14. The 1,329 feet-long suspension bridge, Highline179, opens on Saturday in the Tyrol region of Austria . The bridge, which is 376 feet high, 1,329 feet long and just 3.93 feet wide, will cost eight euros per adult crossing . Height: 376 feet (114,60m) Length: 1,329 feet (403m) Width: 3.93 feet (1.2m) Supported by: Four supporting cables       (2.6 inches) plus 16 rock anchors . Dead weight: 70 tonnes . Bridge load: Maximum 500 people . Crossing the B179, from which the bridge takes its name, Highline179 took 206 days to construct but in reality has been 16 years in the making. The castle-to-castle bridge was first conceived in 1998 by the architect Armin Walch, whose original vision pales in comparison to the ambitious structure now ready to welcome its first official visitors. 'At that time the suspension bridge was to be a mere 250 metres in length,' says the bridge's official website. 'In 2008 the plans were revised and the length of the bridge was then to span 312 metres and with that, be the “longest suspension bridge in the Alps”.' The design was again expanded to 403m in 2012 before construction began earlier this year. Just four supporting cables, each 60mm wide, support the bridge that has a dead weight of 70 tonnes, while 16 rock anchors at each end provide additional safety. From Sunday the bridge will be open we will be open daily from 8am to 10pm. Highline179 connects 700-year-old Castle Ehrenberg with the 17th century Roman ruin Fort Claudia in the market town of Reutte .

"A mother who gave birth on the side of the road on the way to hospital had the amazing event recorded by her birth photographer who was luckily trailing her car. Corinne Cinatl, 29, from Bendigo in Victoria, welcomed daughter Matilda in the front seat of the family car as her husband and three-year-old son looked on. But she was unaware that her friend and birth photographer Breanna Gravener, 28, had been driving behind the family just in case anything happened on the way to the hospital. Scroll down for video . Corinne Cinatl, 29, from Bendigo in Victoria, welcomed daughter Matilda in the front seat of the family car . Ms Cinatl had the amazing event on May 21 recorded by her birth photographer Breanna Gravener who was luckily trailing her car . On May 21 Ms Cinatl woke up at 2.40am with discomfort in her ribs but did not think anything of it because she'd experienced the same thing every night for the past two weeks. After getting up and stretching six times in three hours she realised she was actually being woken by contractions. Ms Cinatl, who is a HypnoBirthing practitioner, felt her first contraction or 'surge' at 5.50am but she told her husband wasn't sure she was in labour because she hadn't felt any other signs. 'After I got in the shower I said ""I'm having another surge"",' she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Cinatl got out of the shower briefly to tend to her three-year-old son Charlie who had just woken up and had three more surges in her bedroom while he supported her. But as her surges got stronger she wanted to get back into the shower and the comforting hot water. About 20 minutes into the 35 minute drive to the hospital her water broke and she told her husband Mishi (right) they needed to pull over . Ms Cinatl said she wasn't thinking about the fact she was in a car, and the only challenge was labouring in the car sitting upright . 'I just thought I can't get out of the shower it's too comfortable in here,' Ms Cinatl said. Meanwhile her husband Mishi Cinatl, 29, had been timing her surges and noticed they were just four minutes apart. He started packing the car for hospital and had contacted Ms Cinatl's doula and birth photographer to let them know the labour was progressing quickly. 'I thought I had more time,' Ms Cinatl said. 'Our Doula had told my husband to get me out of the shower since I was not wanting to get out of there, she knew I needed to get to the hospital. 'Reluctantly I got out, and things really sped up, I could hardly make it from one room to the next without having to stop for a surge.' The family got in the car to start the 35 minute drive to the hospital, not knowing that photographer Ms Gravener had made it to their house before they left and was following them 'just in case anything happened on the way'. After the birth Ms Cinatl heard a female voice asking her if everything was OK and was shocked to find out it was Ms Gravener, who had captured the entire event . Mr Cinatl was reluctant to stop the car as he thought they could make it to the hospital but Ms Cinatl's water broke and she told him she could feel the baby's head . Ms Cinatl was very uncomfortable sitting upright in the car, and at one point exclaimed: 'I don't want to do this in the car, it's too hard!' About 20 minutes into the drive she knew she needed to pull over. Mr Cinatl was reluctant to stop as he thought they could make it to the hospital but Ms Cinatl's water broke and she told him she could feel the baby's head. 'I reached down and felt a warm little head, I was excited and surprised at the same time,' Ms Cinatl said. 'My husband then pulled over and quickly jumped out of the car, he came to the passenger side and opened my door as I lifted my bottom off the seat and only just had enough time to pull my pants down to my mid-thigh before the baby's head completely emerged with a gush of warm amniotic fluid. Ms Cinatl said Matilda is healthy and 'totally in love' with her brother Charlie, three . Ms Cinatl said the pictures were more perfect than she could have hoped for . 'The next surge and her body came out into her daddy's hands and I immediately reached down to pick her up and bring her to my chest.' Ms Cinatl said she wasn't thinking about the fact she was in a car. 'The only challenge was actually labouring in the car sitting upright, that wasn't my position of choice,' she said. Meanwhile Ms Gravener had also pulled over and grabbed her camera to run around to the passenger door. 'Pretty much the first picture I took was baby coming out so not a second to lose,' Ms Gravener told Daily Mail Australia. 'None of us were stressed at all we were all actually really happy and it was beautiful. After the birth Mr Cinatl called an ambulance and the family was taken to hospital where baby Matilda's umbilical cord was cut . 'We could tell straight away that her baby was fine.' After the birth Ms Cinatl heard a female voice asking her if everything was OK and was shocked to find out it was Mr Gravener, who had captured the entire event. 'I was completely elated that she had captured that wondrous moment, a moment that still sounds fictional every time I say it out loud,' she said. 'It helped me to process the actual event as well. 'It was so surreal that it happened in the car. It wasn't stressful but I actually had to pinch myself afterwards that it happened like that.' Ms Cinatl said the pictures, which have been posted onto Ms Gravener's website thebirthstory.com.au, were more perfect than she could have hoped for. Ms Cinatl pictured on Tuesday with healthy baby Matilda who is now six weeks old . 'I wanted pictures of the baby coming out but I didn't want them to be really graphic,' she said. 'They're so descriptive but really tame.' The two women have known each other for two years, and Ms Gravener has taken Ms Cinatl's Intuitive Birthing classes in the past. After the birth Mr Cinatl called an ambulance and the family was taken to hospital where baby Matilda's umbilical cord was cut. Ms Cinatl and Matilda were healthy so they were discharged six hours later. Ms Cinatl wants other mothers to know that if they find themselves in a similar situation it's not necessarily a cause for concern. 'If a birth is happening that quickly it's very rare that there's a complication,' she said. 'Complicated births are not quick births.'","Corinne Cinatl, 29, welcomed baby Matilda in front seat of the family car .

"A 100-year-old watercolor of Munich's old city hall is expected to fetch at least £40,000 at auction this weekend - not so much for its artistic value as for the signature in the bottom left corner reading A. Hitler. The painting is one of some 2,000 painted by Adolf Hitler and is thought to be from about 1914, when he was struggling to make a living as an artist, almost two decades before rising to power as the Nazi dictator. It has drawn interest from around the world, with most viewing it as a curiosity or as an investment, said Nuremberg's Weidler auction house director Kathrin Weidler. Scroll down for video . The 100-year-old watercolor of Munich's old city hall is expected to fetch at least £40,000 at auction . It is being sold by a pair of elderly sisters, whose grandfather purchased the painting in 1916. Though Hitler's paintings surface fairly regularly, Ms Weidler said this 11x8.5 inch scene, unimaginatively called 'The Old City Hall,' is particularly valuable. It includes the original bill of sale and a signed letter from Hitler's adjutant, Albert Bormann, brother of Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann. From the text of the undated Bormann letter, it appears the Nazi-era owner sent a photo of the painting to Hitler's office asking about its provenance. The starting price for the painting is about £3,600, and the auction house, which has sold several Hitlers over the past decade, expects it will go for £40,000 - but would not be surprised if sold for double that . The watercolour includes the original bill of sale and a signed letter from Hitler's adjutant, Albert Bormann, brother of Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann .

"A man has sued a New Hampshire cemetery after discovering that someone else is buried in his plot. Kenneth Dame bought the plot for himself and his wife at Bayside Cemetery in Laconia in 1987. Due to an administrative error, restaurateur Michael Girardi, who died last year, is buried next to 11 members of the Dame family. Kenneth Dame says the plot he bought at Bayside Cemetery in Laconia, New Hampshire, is now occupied by a total stranger . Now buried in the Dame family plot is Michael Girardi, a restaurateur who died last year and was placed in the lot due to an administrative error . Girardi's family has not given permission to have him reburied at a different plot. 'This is Michael’s home,' said Girardi's long-time girlfriend, Carol Clancy, to WMUR. 'This became Michael’s home, and that’s why he’s buried there.' Clancy said Girardi died unexpectedly of a heart attack in August 2013. 'All of us were grief-stricken,' she told WMUR. 'Nobody in a million years thought that this was another family’s grave site, and even when we found out, we were just horrified. What do we do?' Carol Clancy (left) says there's no easy solution to fix the mistake that landed her long-time boyfriend Michael Girardi (right) in the wrong cemetery plot. So far, Girardi's family has refused every offer from Kenneth Dame . Dame's lawsuit says he was offered another double plot, about 60 feet away. Dame's lawyer said the proposed solution 'is much too far for him to agree to.' Cemetery Trustee Edwin Burliegh declined to comment.

Officers say they are treating Ms Yemm's death as murder, although they have refused to comment on exactly how she died. Detective Superintendent William Davies of Gwent Police told the hearing in Newport that officers found Miss Yemm dead inside the Sirhowy Arms. He explained: 'Upon arrival, officers found the body of a female on the floor of the hotel. An inquest heard today that Miss Yemm, pictured, was found dead by officers with serious neck and facial injuries. Her provisional cause of death has been recorded as sharp force trauma to the face and neck . 'She was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

"Whether its the romance of Rapunzel or the magic of Jack and the Beanstalk, classic children's tales have long held appeal for both parents and their offspring alike. Now publisher Ladybird has now announced plans to make all of its books gender-neutral in a bid to ensure that children aren't swayed by their sex when choosing reading material. Gendered titles include Favourite Fairy Tales for Girls, Sleeping Beauty and Favourite Stories for Boys, which along with Jack, includes classic yarn, Three Little Pigs. Gender-neutral: Publisher Ladybird will no longer include 'girls' or 'boys' branding on its books . The publishing house, which is famous for its much-loved Peter and Jane primary reading books, said the re-brand, which will only affect six titles, came about after a petition was delivered by campaigners. Speaking to activists from Let Books Be Books, a spokesman for the company said: 'At Ladybird, we certainly don’t want to be seen to be limiting children in any way. 'Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have the six [gendered] titles you cite … so we offer a vast range for children and their parents.' Let Books Be Books is an off-shoot of the larger Let Toys Be Toys campaign, which lobbies to have gendered branding removed from playthings. Targets include anything branded with 'boys' or 'girls' such as M&S's 'Little Miss' and 'Boys' Stuff' ranges or Hobbycraft's 'Craft Kit for Girls' offering. Popular: Although Rapunzel, seen here in Disney's Tangled, has long hair, boys enjoy her exploits too . Much loved: Ladybird is famous for its Peter and Jane series of primary reading books . Several publishing houses have already responded to the campaign, among them Ladybird's parent company Penguin Random House which has promised to follow suit. The parent-led group, which grew out of a thread on Mumsnet, has already enjoyed a series of successes, and has persuaded toy retailers M&S, Morrison's and Tesco, among others, to rethink their branding. 'We’re asking children’s publishers to take the ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ labels off books and allow children to choose freely what kinds of stories and activity books interest them,' say campaigners on their website. Change: Ladybird agreed to change its ways following an approach from the Let Books Be Books campaign . 'These books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys. 'Blue covers, with themes of action and adventure, robots, space, trucks and pirates contrast with a riot of pink sparkles, fairies, princesses, flowers and butterflies. 'But real children’s interests are a lot more diverse, and more interesting, than that.'","Ladybird, which publishes Peter and Jane, is to go gender-neutral .

"Crowds will once again flock inside the Colosseum, after the Italian government backed plans to rebuild the ancient amphitheatre's  arena floor. Some 1,500 years after barbarians were devoured by wild beasts for the crowd's enjoyment, Dario Franceschini, the Italian culture minister, said that people should be able to 'enjoy monuments by bringing them to life'. Currently the labyrinthine corridors and cells for wild animals and slaves that were built under the arena lie exposed after excavations in the last couple of centuries. Scroll down for video . The Colosseum in Rome is to be used as an entertainment venue once again after the Italian government backed plans to rebuild the ancient amphitheatre's sandy arena . But 19th century photographs that reveal how the arena floor would have looked intact give visitors much more of a sense of where the fighting and executions took place, archeologists say. Mr Franceschini said the reconstructed arena where 35,000 watched fights, executions and animal hunts could be used for 'classical concerts, theatrical spectacles or productions of ancient plays', although he drew the lines at football matches. He told a press conference in Rome yesterday: 'I am convinced that with an intelligent reconstruction of the arena of the Colosseum, the symbol of this country, it could become much much more attractive.' 'Imagine the beauty of going up in the original lifts that could have carried gladiators up to the arena and seeing the Colosseum from the centre as they would have seen it.' The corridors and cells for wild animals and slaves that were once hidden under the arena floor are currently exposed after years of excavation . Archaeologist Daniele Manacorda, pictured,  said the plan to replace the arena's long-disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the Colosseum to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor . 'We are not talking about Bayern v Roma, but if we choose classical music concerts, ancient plays, spectacles that have an enormous commercial value clearly in terms of the TV rights'. Earlier he tweeted images of plans by archeologist Professor Daniele Manacorda of Roma Tre adding: 'All it will take is a bit of courage.' Archaeologist Daniele Manacorda of Roma Tre university said his suggestion to replace the arena's long-disappeared floor is aimed at restoring the Colosseum to its original state so visitors can better appreciate its ancient splendor — not turning it into a heavily trafficked concert venue. 'It's the most normal idea in the world,' Manacorda said. Critics have feared the Colosseum would be turned into a venue for rock concerts, viewed as both unbefitting of its stature as an ancient wonder and likely to inflict damage to the structure already weakened by earthquakes, notably in 443 and most recently in the 1700s.

Italian Culture minister Dario Franceschini said the reconstructed arena where 35,000 watched fights, executions and animal hunts could be used for 'classical concerts, theatrical spectacles or productions of ancient plays' Visitors entering the Colosseum today can look down into the stadium's labyrinthine belly to the rooms where bears and lions were once caged, and where gladiators prepared for mortal battle. Those utilitarian spaces were covered by the wooden floor of the arena itself during the nearly five centuries that the Colosseum functioned as a center of entertainment, with spectacles including exotic animal hunts and sea-battle re-enactments. Italians are not in principle against using their ancient monuments as backdrops for entertainment. Verona's Arena, a Roman amphitheater, attracts thousands each summer to its opera series, and performances are set regularly among the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. The Colosseum itself has housed occasional performances, and is visited every year by the pope during the Stations of the Cross. The Colosseum, however, enjoys a unique status as the most predominant symbol not only of Rome, but of Italy, making sensitive any discussion about altering the status quo. 'It is so important and bulky in its presence, that to transition it into a venue where you perform opera is beneath its dignity,' said Giorgio Croci, a structural engineer who is one of Italy's leading experts on the Colosseum. 'The image of the Colosseum needs to remain beyond that practical use. It needs to remain an icon, a point of reference with all its history and its past.'

"A young couple from Essex is taking legal action against a UK tour operator over claims that they fell seriously ill at a five-star all-inclusive Turkish hotel. Naomi Harding and boyfriend Kieran Pierce say they were forced to abandon their romantic getaway after they came down with gastric symptoms at the Diamond Hill Resort Hotel in the beach resort of Alanya in June 2013. They claim they flew home early to seek medical treatment in the UK for symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Kieran Pierce and Naomi Harding fell ill while staying at the Diamond Hill Resort in Turkey . Mr Pierce and Ms Harding say they were forced to leave the beach resort in Turkey due to their illness . Naomi, a 21-year-old secretary, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis while 22-year-old Kieran, who has diabetes, claims gastroenteritis triggered ketoacidosis as it made it hard for him to maintain his blood sugar levels, their lawyers said. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition arises when there is a lack of insulin in the body. Kieran and Naomi say they were forced to fly home early to seek medical treatment in the UK . Kieran, a client service adviser from Hockley, alleges he was left feeling extremely weak and lethargic, and he risked slipping into a diabetic coma if his condition worsened. Naomi, from Leigh-on-Sea, was off work for five weeks and she said she is still suffering from symptoms nearly 18 months after their trip. She said: ‘I have been undergoing investigation with my general practitioner over the past year and to this day I am still struggling with stomach issues and ongoing symptoms. ‘Our illnesses ruined the holiday and forced us to leave the resort to return home early. 'As Kieran is diabetic, it was incredibly scary for me to see his condition decline, especially when we were travelling home and were both very unwell. ‘He was so weak that he could not even carry his suitcase and when we got home we both went to our doctors.’ She added: ‘It’s not what you expect when you book to go on holiday. Instead of feeling relaxed and coming back fresh, we’ve come back feeling really ill and we want to know what caused it.’ Naomi and Kieran, who booked with Freedom Travel Group, have hired solicitors from the law firm of Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of their illness. They claim the resort’s food hygiene standards were poor with food being left uncovered and exposed to flies, or served cold or lukewarm when it should have been hot. And they allege fresh food was added on top of old food in the buffet restaurant. Jennifer Downing, an International Personal Injury law expert at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'Aside from making holidays extremely unpleasant, gastroenteritis can have a long-term impact on a sufferer’s health and it can be serious when someone with diabetes suffers from gastric symptoms. The couple claims food hygiene standards were poor at the Diamond Hill Resort Hotel .

"Alex Salmond today conceded there are alternative . ‘options’ to the British pound as the crisis deepened over his plans for an . independent Scotland’s currency. The First Minister denied that he does not have a back-up . plan, signalling that he could go into this year’s referendum with a proposal . for a new Scottish currency. But Mr Salmond is coming under intense pressure to reveal . his chosen ‘plan B’, with the country’s top business leaders demanding answers. Under pressure: Alex Salmond said other options were presented by the Scottish Government's 'fiscal commission working group' ¿ which included a 'new Scottish currency' The row comes after Chancellor George Osborne, Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls and LibDem Treasury chief Danny Alexander this week . comprehensively rejected any deal to share the pound in a ‘currency union’ with . a separate Scotland. The game-changing move has left the Nationalists in . disarray just seven months before Scotland’s future is decided on September 18. Mr Salmond said other options were presented by . the Scottish Government’s ‘fiscal commission working group’ – which included a . ‘new Scottish currency’, either with a fixed exchange rate to the pound or a . ‘floating’ exchange rate. A ‘Scottish pound’ could be pegged on a one-to-one basis . with the British pound, in the way the Irish pound was until 1979. There would . be a Scottish central bank to replace the Bank of England to ensure the . credibility of the currency, and there would need to be large reserve of . sterling. Mr Salmond’s fiscal commission found last year: ‘In the long . run, the creation of a new Scottish currency would represent a significant . increase in economic sovereignty.’ However, it would be a major challenge to decide how . contracts, savings, pensions and salaries would be converted at the start into . values in the new currency. 'Keeping millions of British pounds in reserve would . also limit Scottish ministers’ ability to invest in public services. And if the markets were unsure about a new Scottish . currency, a premium could be added to interest rates – forcing Scots to pay . more for loans and mortgages. Mr Osborne used a speech in Edinburgh to insist the currency was not like a CD collection to be divided up in the event of a 'messy divorce' During an exchange on BBC's Good Morning Scotland, First Minister Alex Salmond was keen to stress there were alternatives to an independent Scotland keeping the pound: . BBC's Jim Naughtie: Does that mean in the event of a yes vote you go into negotiations without another option in your back pocket? Alex Salmond: Well let me say for the third time Jim that the fiscal commission working group set out all of the monetary policy options for an independent Scotland but recommended the best one was a sterling area and that’s the one that we’re going to be articulating and that’s what you’d expect us to do…. Naughtie: OK Alex Salmond says there is no alternative... Salmond: No I didn’t say that Jim, I said... Naughtie: I’m just checking... Salmond: Try again, I said the Fiscal Commission Working Group set out a range of monetary policy options for an independent Scotland. Other currency options include unilaterally choosing to use . the pound with no control over monetary policy – adopting a formula used by . Panama, East Timor and the Federated States of Micronesia. Yesterday, a graphic . appeared on Yes Scotland’s Facebook page which stated: ‘An independent Scotland . would not need Westminster’s permission to continue using the pound.’ Or a separate Scottish Government could try to persuade . European nations to let the country join the Euro – which was once Mr Salmond’s . favoured option. Mr Salmond was interviewed on BBC radio show Good Morning . Scotland, after spending much of Thursday at his Aberdeenshire home . and avoiding the TV cameras as his independence plans crumbled around him. The First Minister was asked by presented Jim Naughtie if he . would go into negotiations following a ‘Yes’ victory ‘without another option in . your back pocket’? ‘The fiscal commission working group set out all of the . monetary policy options for an independent Scotland but recommended the best . one was a sterling area, and that’s the one we’re proposing and that we’re . going to be articulating and that’s what you’d expect us to do,’ Mr Salmond . replied. ‘OK Alex Salmond says there is no alternative,’ Mr Naughie . continued, before the SNP leader interrupted him and said: ‘No I didn’t say . that Jim.’ Mr Naughtie then challenged the First Minister: ‘So there is . an alternative. What is it?’ ‘The fiscal commission working group set out a range of . options,’ Mr Salmond conceded. Asked if the options were ‘off the table’, the First . Minister added: ‘They’re in the fiscal commission working group. They’re there . and have been there for the past year.’ Mr Osborne said it is clear that as Chancellor he could not recommend that the UK could share the pound with an independent Scotland . Conservative Chancellor George Osborne: The . evidence shows it wouldn’t work. It would cost jobs and cost money and . wouldn’t provide economic security for Scotland or for the rest of the . UK. People need to know – that is not going to happen.' Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander: 'This isn't bluff, or bullying, it's a . statement of fact. The SNP's claims that an independent Scotland could . or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction.' Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls: . 'You’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as Scotland is pulling . away from the UK. It won’t happen, I wouldn’t recommend it. Scotland . will not keep the pound if Scotland chooses independence.' Former Chancellor Alistair Darling said: ‘The . penny has dropped for Alex Salmond – he knows he cannot promise the pound. ‘Alex Salmond is offering us one of two options: a rush to . join the euro or a separate unproven currency. 'Both currency options would be . bad for jobs as every time we sold to our biggest customer, England, Scottish . firms would need to pay the costs of changing currency.’ Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ‘The First . Minister has effectively conceded that the sterling currency with the UK will . not happen. ‘He pointed towards the options in his fiscal commission but . he needs to tell us which one he’d choose. 'Would it be the euro or a separate . Scottish currency? The clock is ticking.’ Owen Kelly, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise . – whose members include Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, Aviva and Standard Life – . added: ‘It is as clear as it can be at this stage, that a currency union is not . an option for an independent Scotland. ‘It would now be prudent for businesses to consider the . specific effects adopting remaining options could have on their business.’","First Minister insists he has a back-up plan if voters back independence .

"Advice: M&S style director Belinda Earl says women should dress comfortably for work . Power-dressing is a thing of the past, according to the style director of Marks & Spencer. Belinda Earl said women should embrace comfortable clothes for work, rather than trying to dress to impress or compete with men. Instead of a strict uniform of black dresses and suits, she suggested a host of unconventional alternatives, including trendy culottes – flowing long shorts which fall below the knee. She also advised women to wear cashmere knitwear and leather skirts and jackets. M&S cashmere jumpers cost up to £200, while leather skirts are up to £249, meaning her recommendations might be beyond many budgets. Mrs Earl wore a £55 Autograph animal print bodycon dress and a Per Una leather biker jacket, reduced from £199 to £74, to deliver yesterday’s talk entitled ‘Dress for the job you want’. The former chief executive of Jaeger and Debenhams, told a conference that women were now ‘much more in control in the workplace over our individual style’. She said: ‘Nowadays things have changed – it is no longer about trying to dress like the boys or flirt with the boys. The power-dressing we all remember ... life has really changed over the last 20 to 30 years.’ She singled out several items that women should consider investing in, including stretch animal print pencil skirts and a green faux fur jacket. Scroll down for video . Highlighting three pairs of culottes, which were last popular in the 1990s, she said: ‘Actually it’s very easy to wear, particularly in the spring-summer which is a transitional season.’ She also recommended mini-skirts, pencil skirts and leather skirts, the latter of which she said were particularly popular at the M&S offices. The 52-year-old also recommended investing in a good quality bag for work and a statement jacket. She said: ‘The trophy jacket is really important in terms of putting together a look. You can wear a leather jacket during the day and faux fur in the evening and you are ready to rock. Office attire? Culottes are back in fashion. Left, navy culottes by paperlondon.com and right, by Per Una . Speaking at Management Today’s Inspiring Women conference, she urged the audience to develop their own ‘style handwriting’. ‘It is really important in today’s world, where we are all very judgemental, that we have a wardrobe that can really fit and flatter, that works for you, that actually gives you that inner confidence,’ she said. ‘If you know that you can look and feel your best, it can often help you not only rise to the dizzy heights of the great days but also it can maybe help you through some of the darker days too.’ A recent study found workers in the UK dress up for the office for fear of being judged on their professional performance. Research for the Government’s Business is Great campaign showed 44 per cent of respondents admitted to judging colleagues by their attire.","Power-dressing is a thing of the past, says style director Belinda Earl .

"A window washer fell screaming from a rooftop 11 stories to the street below, only to be saved from a more gruesome fate by a passing car. The incident occurred Friday morning at the Sterling Bank & Trust building in downtown San Francisco, CBS reports. According to Buzzfeed, the worker was wearing a harness as he was setting up for work, when he suddenly fell off the edge of the building. Scroll down for video . Dizzying heights: A window washer fell 11 stories from the roof of the Sterling Bank & Trust building in San Francisco, but his fall was slightly cushioned by a passing Camry . As the man plunged toward the street, a Toyota Camry was driving past, and the man landed on its roof, shattering the back windows. Mashable reports driver Mohammad Alcozai was unharmed even though the fall destroyed the car's windshield and collapsed in the roof. Alcozai told reporters he was praying for the man, The Indiana Gazette reports. 'I'm very happy that I wasn't hurt,' he said. 'Hopefully he can make it. I pray for him that he can make it.' Sam Hartwell says he saw the man fall as he passed through the intersection. 'I was actually looking in the direction of where the fellow fell off the building,' he said. 'I saw something blue out of the corner of my eye falling and then I heard the loud thud and the shattering of the back of the car.' A group of bystanders ran towards the scene, with some helping to direct traffic while others administered aid and called 911. 'Everyone did the right thing, we didn’t disrupt the integrity of the spinal cord,' Hartwell said. 'We covered him with clothing. He was obviously in shock' According to Hartwell, the man was breathing and lucid in one eye, though he was bleeding from the ears.

The team relied solely on their own skill, and a few hidden secrets - with no computers graphics involved in the production of the video. The trio, known as the Ocean Brothers, created the video for underwater photography competition World Shoot Out - where it won the prize for best short film. ‘We didn’t use any special effects, just camera tricks and weights which were hidden inside the wetsuits,’ biologist filmmaker Armiche Ramos said. ‘People who watch it usually don’t know what’s happening, they think that the images are made by computer.’ he said. Despite the amazing footage, no special effects were used to create the award-winning short film . Putting their experience to work: The men utilised their experience free-diving to create the film, reminiscent of a science-fiction film . Shot over three years in El Hierro, the smallest of the Canary Islands, the filming was forced to be postponed for a year due to an active underwater volcano in the region. ‘The location is not always calm and we had to wait for the correct moment for several months at a time,’ Mr Ramos said.","Filmmakers utilise their experience in free diving to trick viewers .

"The family of a popular superhead who was found hanged at his home have criticised his former employers for placing him under months of unbearable stress. Mark Geadah, 43, was found dead in his summer house by his wife, Lesley, on August 24 and an inquest into his death heard he had been receiving treatment for work-related depression. Speaking at a pre-inquest review hearing yesterday the family demanded answers for Mr Geadah's 'neglect' at work and said his lack of support was a 'slap in the face'. Heavy workload: Mark Geadah had been receiving treatment for work-related depression before he was found dead by his wife in August . His father Monir Geadah said: 'He was a victim of his own success. When he took those jobs he was pressurised. He was a perfect, perfect son in every respect before that. 'It is causing a lot of stress on us a family. I had a heart attack two weeks ago though this stress. The longer this drags the more it pressurises our family. The neglect is there.' The 43-year-old had served as head of Allington Primary School, in Kent, for nine years. During that time he oversaw two Ofsted inspections, both of which resulted in an 'outstanding' rating. His success did not go unnoticed and he became executive head at a second school in Kent - Aylesford Primary School - earlier this year, while continuing as head of Allington - both of which are academies. Following the inquest opening Kent County Council, Allington Primary School and the Valley Invicta Academies Trust, which runs Aylesford Primary, released a statement. Earlier this year, Mr Geadah had doubled his workload by taking on the role of executive head at Aylesford Primary School in Kent . It said: 'Mark Geadah was a highly gifted teacher and a national leader of education, the highest of professional accolades and one awarded only to people of the highest calibre. 'He was ably assisted and supported by the senior management team and governing bodies of both schools,' the statement added. 'We are devastated by his death but we will inherit the success he and his teams achieved, build on that and be worthy of his legacy.' But the family yesterday insisted he was not supported by his management in the months leading to his death. They also questioned the treatment he received from medical authorities as a result of his depression. His mother Jill Geadah said: 'They did so little to help Mark. When we found out that members of staff who knew him had been offered support it was a slap in the face. 'They could have done so much more.' But Coroner Patricia Harding said the inquest does not serve to place blame and if the family wish to explore Mr Geadah's treatment by his employers they must do so through other agencies. She said: 'I am aware that the family have a number of concerns. 'There is a concern that the employers of Mr Geadah should be involved in the inquest. 'The coroner's inquiry is to answer four important factual questions: who is the person who had died, how, when and where did that death occur. 'And how means by what means - the sequence of events that led to the death and caused the death. 'The coroners' court is not a court of blame. 'We do not look at issues of medical negligence. 'However we do look at issues of neglect and that is why I will commission an independent expert to look at that. 'I am also not going to include the employers in my inquest because that falls outside of my remit.' An inquest into his death opened and adjourned on September 1 and coroner Patricia Harding said it was unlikely the inquest would resume until next year.

"The Liberal Democrats’ share of the Rochester vote was the lowest ever achieved by any major party in a by-election. Nick Clegg was humiliated as his party came in fifth place – only 300 votes ahead of Charlotte Rose, a former ‘sex worker of the year’ who stood as an independent. The Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby received just 349 votes, with the party losing its deposit for the eighth time since 2010. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby managed to narrowly defeated former 'sex worker of the year' Charlotte Rose . With only 0.9 per cent of the ballots cast in Rochester and Strood, the result raises fears of a Lib Dem meltdown in next year’s election. In 2010, the Liberal Democrats won 7,800 votes in the constituency – 16.3 per cent of the total – to come third after the Conservatives and Labour. On Thursday, the party came behind Ukip, the Tories, Labour and the Greens – although it did manage to beat Hairy Knorm Davidson, of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, and Miss Rose. Dominatrix Miss Rose, a friend of former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men. Miss Rose called for more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry and also defeated the Liberal Democrat candidate Geoff Juby . Miss Rose, a friend of former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men . She received 43 votes for policies including more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry. Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron yesterday said the party had found itself in ‘a really funny electoral situation’. He added: ‘When I went knocking on doors in Rochester I found amongst the people I spoke to plenty of Lib Dems who took the interesting view to tactically vote Conservative to try and beat Ukip. ‘My assumption is more Lib Dem and Labour voters voted Tory than there were Tories voting Tory, as they all seemed to vote Ukip. It’s a peculiar situation that all of us will take some time to take stock of. ‘Next May we won’t see a majority government from any party, in which case we need to think about what kind of government we want – one in hock to extremist nationalists, or including Lib Dems who are moderate, sensible and helped to get the economy back on track.’ Candidates lose their deposit if they score less than 5 per cent of the vote – a major humiliation for a party of government. The previous record for the lowest share for a major party in a by-election was set by the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie vote of 1948, who received 1.2 per cent of the vote. The Lib Dems had traditionally done well in by-elections, but it has a dismal record since going into Coalition – with the exception of the poll in Eastleigh, which they held.","Liberal Democrats only managed 300 more votes than Charlotte Rose .

"Tragic: Anne Jackson, 79, was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck . A renowned poet was allegedly stabbed to death by her stepson at her picturesque country farm in south Wales, an inquest heard today. Writer Anne Jackson, 79, was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck and her stepson Timothy Jackson, 48, has been arrested and charged with her murder. Mrs Jackson, who used the name Anne Cluysenaar to write, also worked as a teacher and university lecturer. She was killed on November 1 - just one day after celebrating her 39th wedding anniversary with her husband Walt. Coroner's officer David Arnold told the inquest: 'On arrival officers located the body of a female in the living room area of the property. 'Life was pronounced extinct at the scene by paramedics. A post mortem examination found the cause of death to be stab wounds to the chest and neck.' Belgium-born Mrs Jackson came to Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two. She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old - and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life. She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen. The poet had moved to a small-holding with her husband Walt and had lived there for more than 25 years. Mr Jackson, who did not live with the couple, appeared in court earlier this month charged with murder. Gwent Coroner David Bowen adjourned the Newport inquest after releasing her body for a funeral to take place. Mrs Jackson had seen much of her work printed in literary journals and magazines and her publisher Cinammon Press said she was a highly committed poet. Dr Jan Fortune, from the firm, told the BBC that Mrs Jackson and her husband Walt had celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary the day before she died. 'Murdered': The renowned poet was allegedly stabbed to death by her stepson at her picturesque country farm in south Wales, an inquest heard today . She said Mrs Jackson was very supportive of other people's work and would always put herself out to help them. She added: 'It is a great loss to poetry and also a great loss in terms of the way the community of poets operate. She was a generous and extraordinarily talented poet.' She added that the company was still committed to publishing Mrs Jackson's most recent work.

"Republican firebrand Sarah Palin is rarely at a loss for words but became unmoored on Saturday in Iowa after her teleprompter froze and left her without portions of her prepared speech. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of one-liners – and some of them made little sense. 'The man can only ride you when your back is bent,' she said, as audience members looked at each other quizzically. 'So strengthen it! Then the man can't ride you, America won't get taken for a ride, because so much is at stake.' Addressing the controversy over the virtues of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and the 'American Sniper' film that tells his life story, she shouted: “Screw the left in Hollywood!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Republican firebrand Sarah Palin is rarely at a loss for words but became unmoored on Saturday in Iowa after her teleprompter froze and left her without portions of her prepared speech . The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of one-liners – and some of them made little sense . 'The man can only ride you when your back is bent,' she said, as audience members looked at each other quizzically . And she carped about Democrats' view of Obamacare. 'What will they do to stop causing our pain, and start feeling it again? Well, in other words, um – Is Hillary a New Democrat or an old one?' 'Now the press asks, the press asks, ""Can anyone stop Hillary?"" Again, this is to forego a conclusion, right? It's to scare us off, to convince us that – a pantsuit can crush patriots?' Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee issued a terse reaction to the Republican's embarrassing 35-minute meltdown: 'Thank you!' Palin's more lucid moments included a hint that she might actually launch a White House campaign. 'If you want something said, you ask a man,' Palin boomed. 'If you want something done, you ask a woman.' BEWILDERED: Palin's audience often seemed unsure what to make of her rambling speech . Then, waving a 'Ready For Hillary' sticker, she mocked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 'Now I'm ready for Hillary,' she told her uneasy audience 'Are you? Are you coming?' Eventually Palin returned to one of her time-worn themes: 'lame-stream media' journalists who have classed her as a low-grade intellect selling weak sauce since Arizona Senator John McCain tapped her as his running mate nearly 8 years ago. And in a fit of pique, she seemed to be blaming her fellow Republicans for letting her get clobbered. The 2016 election, she said, 'is war for the sovereignty of the United States of America. We don’t sit on our thumbs next time when one of our own is being crucified, and falsely accused of whatever the hit accusation of the day happens to be: racism, sexism, whatever.' Her appearance at the gathering of grandees came not long after telling the Washington Post she is 'seriously interested' in a Presidential bid come the 2016 race. In a different interview the previous day she also said she was especially keen on running to make sure a woman is on the slate, saying 'America has had enough of seeing that ... sign on the Oval Office door saying, ""No Girls Allowed"".' But days earlier she told a different interviewer that 'I don't give a flying flip' if a woman is elected president. HATERS GONNA HATE HATE HATE: Palin, speaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines alongside a raft of other Republican big-hitters, entered to the Taylor Swift song 'Shake it Off' and claimed to be 'ready' to take on Hillary Clinton . THANK YOU , AND THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU: Almost sixteen minutes into a 35-minute speech meant to be a 20-minute slot, Palin had thanked half of Iowa for hosting her . Palin spoke at the Iowa event alongside a host of others whose names have been floated as potential GOP candidates, including Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee. Her position near the end of the lineup indicated that the event's hosts, Citizens United and Iowa Congressman Steve King, hoped the Alaskan would be a showstopper. She nearly stopped the entire show as Saturday brought something progressives have waited nearly a decade for: the moment when conservatives stopped laughing with Palin and started laughing at her. When the substance of her speech arrived, she hit Obama over his executive order mainstraiming millions of illegal immigrants, and claimed Democrats have a worse record for waging a 'war on women' than conservatives. Despite frequent references to 'real solutions' she would propose to solve America's problems – which she said include a bloated government and a president who refuses to listen to Congress – Palin did not elaborate on what those fixes might be. But 'we get honest on national security,' she riffed. 'We give hope to the people that we need not – we will not – succumb to evil, and we call it as it is, we address it.' 'That must be, by the way, that 800-pound elephant in the room of the White House that the radical left won't even name.' Palin, however, named it. 'It is any Muslim who would choose evil, whose loyalty to a death-cult perversion is so darkened and has deceived their soul that they actually think they're welcome here to transform here. No!' 'What we do is strengthen our military,' she said. 'We respect our troops and let them – our troops as our gatekeepers – we let them tell jihadists, ""Uh-uh, this is our house! Get the hell out"".'","Former Alaska governor and tea party darling gave confusing address at the Iowa Freedom Summit, rambling after her teleprompter froze .

"Record numbers of patients are being admitted to hospital wards from A&E, in further evidence of an overcrowding crisis. Last week there were 108,301 emergency admissions – mostly elderly – from A&E. This was the most since figures were first collected four years ago. Data also showed 6,587 of them had to wait on trolleys for between four and 12 hours – twice as many as in the same week last year. Yesterday it emerged that hospital managers were planning to take legal action to evict elderly patients who were blocking beds, to free up space on wards. Overcrowding in some A&E departments is now believed to be the worst in living memory . Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Trust in Dorset is giving families seven days to find a place for patients in care homes before they start court proceedings. ‘Bed-blocking’ describes when elderly patients remain in hospital despite being fit for discharge because care at home has not been set up for them, or they do not have a place in a nursing home. The problem has reached record levels across the NHS and is causing A&E units to become overcrowded because patients cannot be moved up to wards. In addition, A&E admissions are rising as patients find it increasingly hard to get an appointment with their GPs. The increase is also being driven by an ageing population. Furthermore, pressure has intensified over the past few weeks with the onset of winter illnesses, and many casualty departments have urged people to stay away unless severely hurt or ill. Figures published yesterday by NHS England, the body that runs the Health Service, revealed that A&E units were struggling to cope with rising demand. A total of 429,200 patients were admitted to emergency departments last week, a rise of more than 5 per cent compared with the same time last year. Some 30,102 patients waited more than the Government’s four-hour limit to be treated – twice as many as this time last year, and the most in 18 months. Families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court. The  policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals. (File image) But officials failed to publish another key set of statistics showing the number of cancelled operations, A&E units closed because they were full, and ambulances diverted to other hospitals. These so-called winter-pressure figures are normally released weekly from mid-November, but NHS England said there would be a ‘temporary’ delay while it reviewed ‘information requirements’. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘It is clear hospitals in all parts of England are struggling to cope. This Tory-led Government pushed elderly care services to the brink, leaving people turning to A&E. Whole hospitals are being overwhelmed by the pressure. They have ignored the problem for far too long and it is threatening to drag down the NHS this winter.’ Over the past fortnight, hospitals in Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, King’s Lynn in Suffolk, Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire, Wigan in Greater Manchester and the Wirral in Cheshire have asked the public to avoid A&E except in genuine emergencies. Last week, a major incident was declared at Colchester hospital in Essex after the NHS watchdog found A&E staff were struggling to cope with unprecedented demand. The pressures are particularly intense in Cambridgeshire, which has a large elderly population. Its three trusts are on ‘black alert’, meaning they are unwilling to accept patients who are not seriously ill. Dr Louise Irvine, a GP in Lewisham, South London, who also represents the National Health Action Party, said: ‘Hospitals and patients are caught up in a desperate situation created by cuts. Hospitals throughout the country are being very tightly squeezed financially, so there is very little slack in the system.’ Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, of NHS England, said: ‘The NHS is pulling out all the stops to meet this rising demand.’ Last week, a major incident was declared at Colchester hospital in Essex (pictured) after the NHS watchdog found A&E staff were struggling to cope with unprecedented demand .","Last week, there more than 100,000 emergency admissions from A&E .

"Earlier this year, a digital guru released a viral video in a bid to sell his worn-out Holden Barina. The blockbuster clip, titled Buy My Barina, amassed over one million views in a week. And with good reason: laden with sleek special effects, the clip cost over five times the value of the car. Now, Sydney based David Johns has now made a sequel video titled Barinageddon, and it takes the blockbuster standards of its forerunner to a whole new level. Sydney based David Johns has released a sequel to his viral video Buy My Barina . Barinageddon it takes the blockbuster standards of its forerunner to a whole new level . It tells the story of how a chance lightening bolt mutates the car into a rampant monster . After Buy My Barina garnered offers from all over the world, Mr Johns finally sold the car to NRMA in August, with all profits donated to Cancer Council Australia. So begins the plot for the follow up video, titled Barinageddon. Things kick off with a well-dressed Mr Johns handing the keys onto a lab coat clad NRMA scientist, who says he has some ‘very special plans for the car.’ An apprehensive Mr Johns asks: ‘She’ll be alright, wont she?’ ‘We’re just going to run a few tests’ the scientist says with an assuring smile. ‘What could possibly go wrong?’ In one scene, the panicking scientist declares: ‘The barina has escaped! No one could have predicted this!’ The slick special effects throughout the clip far transcend those in the original video . Mr Johns told Daily Mail Australia the plot was inspired by factual events. 'When I dropped off the car at the NRMA their Research facility, they had some crazy equipment there. Hailguns, stuff to test the impact of dogs in a cars. That's where we hatched the concept of this clip,' he said. 'Then they offered the use of the facility for filming - how could we turn down an opportunity like that?' During elaborate experiments with the car, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory, shooting electrical volts into the blue Barina. This freak accident mutates the car into something nobody could have predicted: a rampaging monster hell-bent on wiping humanity. ‘The barina has escaped!’ the panicking scientist says. ‘No one could have predicted this!’ A visual of the deadly mutant barina which wreaks havoc on the city . David Johns, who is experienced in digital advertising, is planning to turn the trailer into a feature length film with a Kickstarter campaign . The car is then seen speeding around the city on the nightly news, with a reporter declaring ‘this little car is going to send us back to the stone age.’ The clip climaxes with the statement ‘It's like Armageddon...but with a Barina.’ The project is a collaboration between Mr Johns Chimney Group Asia-Pacific and the NRMA. Mr Johns says he was thrilled with the final result. 'Our 3D team in Poland did an amazing job . Have a great team of visual compositors here too that brought it all together.' Now, he plans to turn the trailer into a feature length with a little help from a Kickstarter campaign. 'I know it's an ""out there"" idea. But madder films have been made. If tornados can be full of sharks and snakes let loose on planes.. then why couldn't a mutated hatchback threaten humankind!'","David Johns released a viral video to sell his 1999 Holden Barina .

"If you happen to live in small-town Williamsfield, Ohio, and have a 44093 zip code, your neighborhood has been ranked America's number one most stressful place to live, based on data from the latest U.S. Census. Real estate blog Movoto crunched the numbers by assessing factors such as average household earnings, hours worked, commute times, access to health care and amount of disposable income. Zip codes in Mississippi, California, Alabama and Tennessee were ranked next most-stressful; with certain inner-city zip codes, in New York and Los Angeles for example, deemed least stressful of all. Coastal cool: Areas in the Midwest tend to have a higher concentration of stressful zip codes, whereas life appears to be more relaxed in the Southeastern states and on the West Coast  (pictured) Taking eight stress-factors into account for every zip code and averaging their scores left the picturesque Williamsfield, Ohio, head-and-shoulders above the rest. With a small population of 984 people - and 'basically no bars, restaurants or parks' as Movoto points out - inhabitants of this zip code struggle with long working hours and very little pay-off. Almost 40per cent of locals don't have health insurance, 40per cent of families are below the poverty line, and rent accounts for an average of 50per cent of people's pay checks, despite 42-hour work-weeks being the norm. The zip code of 38647 in Michigan City, Mississippi came next, again for its long working hours, very low median incomes and average commutes of 45 minutes. 1.   44093, Williamsfield, Ohio . 2.   38647, Michigan City, Mississippi . 3.   93640, Mendota, California . 4.   36776, Sawyerville, Alabama . 5.   38617, Coahoma, Mississippi . 6.   37018, McConnell, Illinois . 7.   39743, Crawford, Mississippi . 8.   77032, Houston, Texas . 9.   85172, Stanfield, Arizona . 10. 29915, Daufuskie Island, Sout Carolina . 1.   90058, Los Angeles, California . 2.   86436, Topock, Arizona . 3.   4663, Shubuta, Mississippi . 4.   11237, Brooklyn, New York . 5.   1134, Bon Wier, Texas . 6.   1599, Parkers Lake, Kentucky . 7.   95328, Keyes, California . 8.   30021, Clarkston, Georgia . 9.   92327, Daggett, California . 10. 90037, Los Angeles, California . Worlds apart: The zip code of 44093 in Williamsfield, Ohio (left) ranked most stressful, with high poverty - and incidentally no bars - and the snazzy 90058 zip code in Los Angeles, California (right) was ranked lowest . 93640 in Mendota, California took the third spot, and has one of the biggest populations in the top ten with 11,600 inhabitants. It had a headache of stress scores across the board, with standouts being an unemployment rate over 25per cent, over 42per cent of families below the poverty line, and an average work-week of over 42 hours. 36776 in Sawyerville, Alabama came in fourth, with almost 40per cent of locals unemployed. For those who are employed, the work-week is over 40 hours, the commute is 34 minutes, and more than half their pay checks - a household average of $27,000 - goes on rent. Inhabitants of the 38617 zip code in Coahoma, the second Mississippi zip code to make the top ten, wrestle with 42-minute commutes - the lowest in this category was a swift four minutes in McConnell, Illinois - as well as long working hours and 25per cent of the population without health care . 37018 in Beechgrove, Tennessee, and 39743 in Crawford, Mississippi come in next as the sixth and seventh most stressful zip codes to live in; again, with hard-working locals pulling in low incomes and many without health insurance. At number eight on the list, Houston, Texas, locals with a 77032 zip code work an average of 39 hours per week, endure a 31-minute commute and make less than $22,500 per year -per household, with a staggeringly high 42per cent of them living below the poverty line. 85172 in Stanfield, Arizona, in at number nine, was an area deemed by Movoto as 'particularly problematic in the wealth department.' Half of people's incomes go on rent and their average 45-hour work-week is especially long. 29915 in Daufuskie Island, South Carolina, takes the number ten spot. Despite it being a pretty and historic resort town, unemployment rates are over 27per cent, and for those who do work, it's for an average of 46 hours a week, with a 47-minute commute twice a day. As for the least stress-inducing zip codes in the U.S., where overall quality of life is highest, 90058 in Los Angeles, California wins; followed by 86436 in Topock, Arizona, and 39360 in Shubuta, Mississippi.","Using data from the latest U.S. Census, the real estate survey took into account average incomes, working hours and commute times .

"If you've ever struggled to make a call where there is no phone signal, one enterprising hacker may have the answer. German inventor Dennis de Bel says his invention could lead to a resurgence in the ancient art. He boasted the technique is NSA-proof, and free to use. Scroll down for video . The new SMS: The German Smoke Messaging Service can send smoke signals from your phone . Before use, the user must place the lamp oil into the vaporiser. This is then heated and vaporized, sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone's camera. Later versions will be able to 'read' the messages using the camera. Users have to work out their own code. Three puffs is 'hello,' 5 puffs is 'hello, I'm coming home later, according to the system's inventor. He revealed the project at a recent Berlin art show. 'S.M.S. or Smoke Messaging Service, takes your device to the next level,' he said . 'Based on millennia of experience this iPhone hardware addon offers you safe, long distance, visual communication for free! 'Smoke is one of the earliest technologies for long distance visual communication - this iPhone addon offers you the advantages of ancient technology TODAY!' At the push of a button, lamp-oil is heated and vaporized, sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone's camera. 'This cloud could potentially be picked up by the camera and translated in real-time,' De Bel told Vice. 'But, that is for later implementation' The system also relies on the two participants knowing the code for signals. 'For example, three puffs is 'hello,' 5 puffs is 'hello, I'm coming home later,' said De Bel. A button on the side of the device is currently used to control the smoke signal - future versions could use an app . Before use, the user must place the lamp oil into the vaporiser. The first known use of smoke signals is in Ancient China, where soldiers stationed along the Great Wall would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower. Greek historian Polybius, came up with a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 BC,converting Greek alphabetic characters into numeric characters so they can be hidden in pairs - an encryption technique known as as the 'Polybius square' which was used by Germans in the later years of the First World War. The North American indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal, with each tribe having its own signaling system and understanding. They are still in use today by the College of Cardinals to reveal  the selection of a new Pope.","Art project called S.M.S. or Smoke Messaging Service .

"It's believed Channel Seven's flagship current affairs show has lost two of its most experienced staff members, with reports on Friday that Sunday Night executive producer Mark Llewellyn has left his senior role after an office bust up. The Daily Telegraph also reported that veteran journalist Ross Coulthart has quit after his office friends were allegedly involved in a physical bust up. The fallout coming after claims Mark Llewellyn had pinned producer Paul Waterhouse against a wall at the network’s offices last month and Coulthart was forced to intervene,The Australian reported. Mark Llewellyn has reportedly left his role as EP of Channel Seven's Sunday Night program over an alleged altercation with a fellow staff member three weeks ago. The network has stated he will return after extended leave to an EP role on 'prime time programming' Channel Seven journalist Ross Coulthart has reportedly quit Sunday Night . The Daily Telegraph also claimed Coulthart walked out on the show last Friday because he was upset about the way the affair has been handled. A source told the paper Llewellyn had been under stress for some time: ‘Ross could see this coming to a head and had been flagging his fears for Mark with others for some time.’ Channel Seven has not responded to questions about the alleged bust-up . Llewellyn had reportedly first been suspended over the incident, which is believed to have happened on October 29, but has subsequently been informed of the network's decision by CEO, Tim Worner, according to the Daily Telegraph. It is understood Waterhouse's conduct is not being investigated. Late on Friday Channel Seven provided the following statement: . 'Sunday Night executive producer Mark Llewellyn is taking an extended period of leave. 'In 2015, Mark will return to the Network in an executive producer role working on prime time programming. 'Mark is the founding executive producer on Sunday Night, which first aired in 2009.' Daily Mail Australia has also placed calls to Mr Llewellyn and Mr Coulthart seeking comment over the reports. Coulthart is not the first veteran reporter thought to have quit Sunday Night this year. In January, 62-year-old Mike Munro left the program to joined Channel 10. On 9 February he began work as the presenter of Ten Eyewitness News Weekend.","Reports that Sunday Night Executive Producer Mark Llewellyn has left the show after altercation .

"A rare burst of Southern California rain led to mudslides early Friday in the foothills near Los Angeles that had long suffered drought. At least one home and a vehicle were damaged as muck flowed through Glendora, an  suburb located just south of the San Gabriel mountains following downpours. Four feet of mud were seen behind one home with some soaking into the interior, Los Angeles County fire officials told KTLA. Sunk: A driveway covered in mud shows the aftermath of the thunderstorm and ensuing mudslide early Friday morning in Glendora . 'It’s against the back wall of the residence and it’s seeping into the house,' fire inspector Rick Flores said. Part of the mud was taken out by crews using shovels and wheelbarrow ahead of heavy equipment being brought in. 'We’re telling residents to do a self assessment of their home before they leave to work or school, make sure it’s safe to get out,' Flores added. The Glendora Fire Department cautioned drivers to be aware of any debris left in the roads by the storm in a press release. Mudslides were expected to come with heavy rain near the burn area of the Colby Fire, a wildfire that lit up the hills north of Glendora earlier this year, burning across nearly 2,000 acres of land. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Colby area early Thursday as the storm dumped hail and heavy rain in some areas. Still there: Thick layers of mud were still in the driveway of at least one home, as seen in this photo tweeted by reporter Qwesi McCray . Working: Crews dug out a mud flow at a home in Glendora, where one house and a vehicle were partially buried after a rare downpour . Around a half an inch of rain fell near Glendora, though rainfall totals in other parts of the area were fairly low. Snow hit Big Bear Lake, a small town up in the San Bernardino Mountains. California's historically harsh drought has brought water levels to dramatic lows.","A wave of mud poured into Glendora, a suburb just south of the San Gabriel mountains .

"You’d think the last thing a fence that for years has had hundreds of bras hanging on it needs is support, but that’s the case for the Cardrona Valley Bra Fence in New Zealand. For the past two years thieves have been stealing the bras off the fence, and in recent months there were regularly none to be seen on it at all. However, those who want to see the local tourist attraction remain are jumping out of their cups with anger. Tired of being taken for boobs, the Cardrona Valley Bra Fence Facebook page has been updating its followers with tip-offs on who the thieves are. No one has been arrested by police yet, but the page is now asking its supporters to return to the fence with their ‘pre-loved’ bras to help recreate the attraction. At one time hundreds of bras floated in the breeze at Cardrona Valley Bra Fence . One of the venture’s most vocal supporters is Kelly Spaans, who owns the Cardrona Horse Trekking & Quad Biking business. The bra fence sits directly opposite her place of work, but she has no problem with it at all. ‘Generally the bras are taken at night, but on Tuesday, during the day, some local people took the 30 or so bras that were put there recently,’ she explained. ‘I saw them and have a good idea who they are. I’m sure these people could be prosecuted by the police for theft, but we don’t want to make too much of a stir out of it. ‘So instead we’re going to put up hundreds all at once so it’ll be very difficult for the thief or thieves to take them all down. It’ll be a beautiful big spectacle. But as time went on thieves have taken more and more of them in recent years . Supporters of the tourist attraction always put more bras up when they got stolen . But today the thieves have had their way and there are no bras to be seen at all . Some locals get caught in the act of stealing bras and the photograph of their raid is posted on Facebook . ‘And that’s why we started this campaign on Facebook for people to send us their ‘pre-loved’ bras so we could get as many of them as possible.’ Ms Spaans also explained that many people hung bras on the fence because it meant something to them. Members of the Facebook page have even offered a reward for anyone who can identify the thieves . ‘Visitors have come here and hung bras on the fence of their loved ones who may have passed away,’ she said. ‘It means these thieves are stealing something that has got a lot of sentimental value for someone. But the thieves don’t care about this at all.' In the good old days you would be able to see bras all the way up the road . The site has been a controversial tourist attraction for years. It all began in 1999 when some passers-by began attaching bras to the fence – to this day no one knows why. But it soon became very popular and over the years the bras hanging on the fence grew to hundreds. People from all over the world visiting New Zealand would go to the Cardrona Valley just to tie their bra to it. People have travelled from all over the world to tie their bras to the fence at Cardrona Valley . However, the busty tourist attraction split locals. Some welcomed it as it brought tourists to the area and put the Cardrona Valley on the map. Others though, felt it was an eyesore and potential hazard to drivers using the road. Many who hung bras on the fence did so because it held some sentimental value to them . It was for this reason that in 2006, after discovering the fence rested on public road reserve, the local Council determined the bra fence was a ‘traffic hazard’ and ordered the bras to be removed from the fence. In 2010 however, a layby was put in so tourists and visitors could safely pull over and take photographs. But in the past two years, the bra snatchers have returned with a vengeance, and Mrs Spaans wants to teach them a lesson. Today there's nothing to be seen, but supporters say that is all going to change soon . ‘They’re basically just spoilsports. I mean it’s pretty childish to resort to doing this. But it’s time we showed them that no matter what they do we won’t just sit back and let them away with it,’ she said.","Since 1999 visitors from all over the world have tied their bras to the quirky tourist attraction .
In the past two years thieves have stolen the bras leaving nothing at all to be seen on the fence .

"Buying a property can be an overwhelming project, as any new-home owner will tell you. The investment will probably be the biggest financial output you will undertake, and will take a lot of hard work and research to ensure you are on the right track. Establishing a strategy and sticking to it is crucial when negotiating the waters of the house market, especially as Australia's record-making house prices are steadily increasing and safe within a property bubble that doesn't look to burst. Daily Mail Australia spoke to the country's leading experts to get the best advice for prospective property buyers, and the ultimate traps to avoid when looking to bid, ahead of a weekend brimming with auctions in the capital cities. Scroll down for video . 21 Hampton Court Sovereign Islands in Queensland is up for auction this weekend by Ray White- Sovereign Islands . This beautiful residence is listed at over $3 million and boasts a intimate spa courtyard with a decked sun bathing area . With five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a large gym, and a home theater, this stunning residence offers waterfront views to be envied . Never buy without doing your research . From checking out the prices of houses in the area, to commissioning inspections of the property, arming yourself with as much information as possible is your best bet to make a sound decision. Brian Haratsis, Executive Director of MicroPlan advises that scoping out sales in the area is one way to match your expectations to reality. 'Check that sales of houses in the area in which you are interest in purchasing are similar or under what you're willing to pay,' Mr Haratsis said. 'Check the market to match your target. The aspirational purchaser end up paying more than they can afford and expose themselves to greater risk,' he said. Peter Kelahar, director of PK Property Buyers Agency agrees, noting that buyers can fall into the trap of paying too much for a property if they don't do their research first. Both experts also advise prospective property buyers to look at the facilities in the local area, and to commission inspections of the property. 'Arcona', 33 Hawthorn Grove, Hawthorn in Victoria, was built in 1896 and is up for grabs this Saturday and is listed in excess 5.5 million . This timeless Victorian residence offers four bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as a grand triple-arched hallway, a granite kitchen with built-in pantry, a sub-floor cellar, and beautiful north-facing rear garden with secluded entertainment area and self-cleaning heated pool . Agent Greg Toogood from Jellis Craig- Hawthorn said that the house is situated in one of the 'top three streets in Hawthorn,' and that the surrounding houses feature 'lovely traditional style architecture with period character' 'Always get a pest and building inspection to make sure the property is sound,' said Mr Kelahar. 'Next, check out the infrastructure and public transport nearby. For those looking to buy as an investment, don't buy in an area that has a high vancancy or unemployment rate, as there will be no capital growth and you won't be able to rent it,' he said. Don't get emotionally attached to a property (until you own it) While it can be easy to fall in love with a beautiful house, never compromise your bidding position by making a property the be all and end all. The advice from both experts is to remember that there will always be another property, and there is no 'ultimate house'. 'Don’t get emotionally involved in a property, and only pay what you think it’s worth,' said Mr Kelahar. This is especially important to keep in mind when looking to buy at auction, as emotions can get the best of you if you get caught up in the excitement of buying a property then and there. 'Make sure at auction you don’t bid in too large amounts, and when you are bidding, be aware of other people bidding, so you know when to start and when to stop,' he said. 34 Arnold Street in Killara, NSW, is listed in excess $5.75 million, and boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms, and an avante garde teen retreat or guest accommodation with it's own entry . The house has original ornate ceilings and pavilion living enhanced by highlight windows . The property also features a sandstone surrounds in-ground mosaic tiled swimming pool, as well as a championship size tennis court with north/south orientation . Never go beyond your set budget . By setting a budget, and sticking to it, you will avoid greater risks of debt and ensure that your money goes towards what you intended. 'Have an amount of money which you are prepared to spend, and don’t go over that amount,' said Mr Haratsis. The same goes for interest rates, and Mr Haratsis advises that prospective buyers should assume that mortgage interest rates will increase over time. 'Assume that the mortgage interest will reach long term average levels and increase,' he said. 'Australia at the moment has very low interest rates, and people often believe these rates will be maintained very long time, but the Australian Reserve Bank has indicated that the rate of growth will increase in 2016.' Don't buy for the short term . While buying for investment can be a very lucrative option, Mr Kelahar advises that when purchasing for personal use, it's best to look at the long term as buying and reselling can end up costing you more than it's worth. 'When buying property for yourself, look for the actual property that you want to live in long term,' he said. 'It can cost a lot jumping in and out in terms of stamp duty.' 81 Wood Street in Manly is set to go under the hammer this weekend and is listed for over $3 million . The beautiful family residence has panoramic harbour views and comes with a staggering six bedrooms and four bathrooms . The residence boasts an enormous family room, sitting room, and loft entertainers' retreat, as well as a self contained lower level with separate entrance . For entertaining, the property features a Cabana with wet bar and bathroom, sparkling pool with a beach, and is only footsteps to Little Manly Beach, and a stroll to Manly Beach, ferry and wharf . Don't buy at the wrong time . Never buy when prices have increased, despite the temptation to think that the market will only get more expensive if you wait for it to cool off. 'What happens is people see a market 'hot', and think that they better get into the market before the prices get even higher,' said Mr Haratsis. He advises to make sure you buy at the right time, which may mean waiting until the next set of interest rates are released. 'Prices will then come off or at least moderate. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you should get in now or you'll lose out forever,' he said. 'There will always be another property out there.' 'Shenstone Moss', built in 1898 at 13 Kintore Street in Camberwell, Victoria is up for auction this weekend in excess of $3 million . The two-storey Federation home is set on a 1118 sq. metre allotment with a north-facing entertainment area and a heated pool . The house boasts four fitted bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as an executive study, formal rooms, a large family zone, and a fitted Gaggenau/Miele Kitchen .","Many prospective buyers fall into traps when buying a house, which can see them paying more in the long run .

"For many women, a wedding dress is one of the priciest and most treasured possessions in their wardrobe. But for Maryborough local Kim Sheard, hers was a reminder of some memories she would rather keep firmly in the past. In need of some cheering up, and with a pretty white gown she would never use again, 37-year-old Kim's creative friends came up with an idea - trash the dress, by dredging it through some of the harshest conditions imaginable. Kim Sheard decided to thrash her wedding dress after her marriage failed . Armed with her photographer friend Rowena Walker and social media genius Tabitha Penman, Kim and her mates thought up some of the wackiest ways to make sure the dress would never be worn again. Inspired by a man in America who had trashed his ex-wife's wedding dress, the trio set up the 'Trash -That - Wedding Dress' page on Facebook, accumulating over 600 followers all eager to see Kim's dress take a trashing. Kim and her friends didn't go easy on the white gown, testing it's material to the maximum by trawling it through a round of zorbing, parasailing, dirt-biking and even dirt-tobogganing. Kim didn't go easy on the dress, dragging it through a dirt-biking session . The former bride had a food fight on the beach with her pals . Kim decided to have fun with her wedding dress and made sure it would never be work again . 'My friend Kim had recently broken up with her husband and we were trying to cheer her up, so the idea was that we would see how many ways we could trash her wedding dress but with a twist,' Kim's friend Tabitha told Daily Mail Australia. 'Instead of it being a bitter thing about revenge or spite we would use it as a great and fun excuse for us mums to get together and have fun doing things we wouldn't normally do' 'We are all housewife’s and working mums so we get so little time to do anything that’s fun or for us so we decided to use it as an excuse' she said. Inspired by a man in America who had trashed his ex-wife's wedding dress, the trio set up the 'Trash -That - Wedding Dress' page on Facebook, accumulating over 600 followers all eager to see Kim's dress take a trashing.\ . Tabitha said it was 'therapeutic' for Kim to trash her dress after the breakdown of her marriage, however it became more about a bonding session with her friends than a revenge plot against her ex-husband. 'Obviously she was upset that her marriage had ended,' she said, . 'It became more about having fun with your girlfriends and the bond of friendship and good times that help you get over the hurt and move on.' By the end of their trashing, the dress had completely split up the back and was unwearable. Kim and her friends didn't go easy on the white gown, testing it's material to the maximum by trawling it through a round of zorbing, parasailing, dirt-biking and even dirt-tobogganing . The girls were forced to put an end to their trashing when the dress ripped and Kim entered into a new relationship. 'Now I still moderate the page and find and encourage other brides and photographers to share any fun trashes they have had,' Tabitha said. Kim's dress stood up well until it split down the back near the end of their dress thrashing antics . Tabitha admits that she has seen similar pages on Facebook urging women to trash their wedding dresses. However she believes their journey is unique as no other page documents the journey of one woman trashing her dress on numerous occasions. Tabitha revealed that the Facebook page encourages women to have fun after the breakdown of their marriage. The fun stopped for the girls when Kim's wedding dress split down the back . 'If one chapter in your life closes then open another with friends, laugh at yourself and start afresh,' she said. Deliberately ruining a wedding dress soon after a couple's big day has also been marketed as a romantic ritual by U.S. photographers. For some, the trashing is an act of commitment, as the wedding dress can never be worn again. The idea originated in Vegas and was touted as a way to give brides the chance to reuse their dresses in a scruffy atmosphere, in a total contrast to how they wore the gown on their wedding day. Some women decided to be tame on their dress, posing in the sea or in a forest, wrecking the dress only slightly. The trash the dress concept has been gaining momentum around the world for a number of years and is quickly coming into its own in Australia . However there is evidence of women burning their dress, rolling through mud and scuba diving in their gowns. The trash the dress concept has been gaining momentum around the world for a number of years and is quickly coming into its own in Australia. The results have been known to resemble art and are akin to what would be seen in a high fashion magazine.","Kim Sheard decided to wreck her dress after her marriage came to an end .

"Jailed: Former Ukip candidate David Evans has been jailed for four months over the deaths of 260 sheep . A former Ukip candidate has been jailed for four months over the deaths of 260 sheep after some were found rotting in his fields. Police found 119 dead animals on David Evans' farm in Cornwall in what one animal welfare officer described as the most sickening case of neglect he had ever seen. Their bodies were left decomposing in the field while many others were discovered rotting after being dumped in waste bags. A further 141 sheep were then found languishing in squalid and sodden conditions and were so badly emaciated, they had to be put down. Evans, 71, was deselected as Ukip’s parliamentary candidate for the Camborne and Redruth seat in Cornwall last month, after he admitted animal welfare charges. He appeared before Bodmin Magistrates Court yesterday where district judge Kevin Gray jailed him for four months and disqualified him indefinitely from keeping sheep. Mike Brown, defending, immediately lodged an appeal against the sentence but the judge refused to let Evans out on bail while it is decided. A previous hearing was told how the sheep were kept as pets but were left to fend for themselves after Evans abandoned them over one of the wettest winters on record. Kingsley Keate, prosecuting, said Cornwall Council dispatched investigators to Trehausa Farm in Week St Mary, owned by Evans on February 6 after a string of complaints. A team of police and council officials including health inspector Jonathan McCulloch and veterinary officer Sue Potter arrived to find his land strewn with carcasses of sheep and lambs. Some of the animals were decomposing in paddocks and fields while others had been scooped up and left to rot in bags. Mr Keate said over a further three visits they located dozens more live animals who were emaciated, suffering from lameness and 'close to death'. A total of 141 sheep had to be put down in February and March due to their condition. Disgrace: Inspectors located dozens of live animals who were emaciated, suffering from lameness and 'close to death' Mr Keate told the court that Evans treated the flock as pets but they had been 'left out to their own devices to survive a very wet winter'. He added: 'There was insufficient food, bedding or dry areas for the sheep, which were huddled together and did not have food of the quality which would be expected. 'Sheds which could have housed them were being used to store machinery.' The court heard that Evans bought the farm in 2001 and brought in sheep to help maintain the grassland. Mr Brown, defending, said Evans has an extremely high IQ of 130 to 142 but suffers from a form of Asperger’s syndrome that means he struggles to interact with other people. As he became more reclusive, the former parliamentary candidate started treating the animals as pets but when their numbers swelled to 450 he simply couldn’t cope, Mr Brown added. Scandal: 119 sheep died and those who survived were starved of proper food and kept in squalor - with many more put down because of their poor condition . Evans admitted six charges including failing to dispose of carcasses and causing unnecessary suffering to sheep by failing to address their emaciation and lameness. He was also ordered to pay £714.42 in costs. Speaking after yesterday’s sentencing, health inspector Mr McCulloch said: 'In 15 years this case is by far the worst I have ever experienced. 'Dead sheep were scattered across the farm, new born lambs had died after getting stuck in mud. 'Mr Evans had done very little to ensure the safety of his sheep, his sheds were full of junk so the sheep had no shelter from the weather. 'The lame and emaciated sheep were just ignored.' A spokesman for the RSPCA added: 'The scenes that greeted the local authority animal health team look appalling. 'Anyone who is responsible for an animal - whether that is one or 100 - has a duty of care for them. 'We are pleased to see the courts take this issue so seriously and sentence the defendant accordingly.'","David Evans admitted neglect after dead sheep were found at his farm .

"Even in the world's war-torn nations, there are moments of joy, and in the case of these Afghani children, it's the Kabul amusement park. City Park, an oasis of colour in the otherwise grey concrete of Kabul, has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since opening last month. For families in Kabul, who have suffered war for the past three decades, Afghanistan's first amusement park offers a rare escape from their everyday lives blighted by conflict, death and misery. Scroll down for video . Happy days: An actress wearing a giant Minnie Mouse head makes a young boy laugh at City Park, Afghanistan's first amusement park . As families walk through the gates of the amusement park, they are met by their favourite cartoon heroes, Minnie Mouse and Tom the Cat from Tom and Jerry. Minnie might not look as authentic as the one walking the boulevards of Disney World Paris, but the children of Kabul do not care, or know the difference. The excited children scuttle round the actors' feet, as they hug and dance with children, before they run off to go on a ride or have their face painted. City Park, located at the foot of the snow-capped Hindu Kush mountains, next to the filthy Kabul River and near a zoo famous only for its abused, one-eyed lion. It has all the traditional fairground rides, including carousels, a Ferris wheel and bumper cars, although the paint is chipped in places. Light at the end of the tunnel: Tens of thousands have already visited City Park since it opened in October .

Contrast: The brightly coloured train carts stand out against the grey concrete of the homes in Kabul . It is is one of few places where residents of the Afghan capital can take their children for a relaxing day out. 'It's very nice, everything is very beautiful, the carousel horse ride is nice,' said 6-year-old Sadaf through a gap-toothed grin as she had her face decorated like a mouse. The city of almost 6 million people is a virtual fortress. Major buildings are protected by concrete and barbed wire, roads are choked with traffic as former thoroughfares are blocked to prevent suicide bombers reaching potential targets like the Presidential Palace. Gun-toting security forces guard almost every street corner. Afghanistan has been at war for more than 30 years, and while U.S. and NATO combat troops prepare to leave next month, the Taliban insurgency shows no sign of abating. Few families in Kabul have been untouched by the violence, said Almas Qaseemi, the park's deputy general manager. 'The park is a place for entertainment, and there is not much of that in Afghanistan.' A group of children enjoy a spinning teacup ride City Park during a runny day in Kabul . Both for children and the older generation, City Park offers space to breathe and forget the war . Bringing joy: £960,000 has been invested in the park, which sees thousands flock to its gates every day . 'We have a great feeling when we see our people forget their sorrows for a few minutes and smile when they come here,' Qaseemi said. Thousands come every day, he said, peaking on the weekly Friday holiday at close to 10,000. The park is set on 24 acres of land owned by the Kabul Municipal Government and leased for five years to a private company called Mufkora - which means 'concept' in English. Rahela Kohistani, the municipality's cultural director, said that $1.5million(£960,000) has been invested in the park with the municipal authority taking 26 percent of profits and the rest going to Mufkora. 'So far we are happy, and it seems that people are happy, too,' she said. For Ishfaq Ahmad Adeb, 20, who spends his days at City Park as Tom the cat, and 18-year-old Omid who plays Minnie Mouse, the children's joy rubs off. 'When the children see me in this outfit, they really believe that Minnie Mouse has come to Kabul,' said Omid. 'They laugh and try to shake hands with me, they really enjoy it.'","City Park is a fairground located in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan .

"It might seem an unusual accomplishment for a banker from the big end of town, but Harrison Young isn't concerned with what other people think. Mr Young, who is a director Australia's Commonwealth Bank, has just launched his second saucy novel: 'Submission: Lessons from the desert'. 'I'm sure there are colleagues who think it's foolish, but I say: sex and laughter? What's not to like?' 'Submission' is the second piece of erotic fiction by former soldier and director of the Commonwealth Bank, Harrison Young . 'Submission' is an erotic thriller set in Alibi, a fictional middle-eastern country where 'perfection is tangible, women are invisible' and 'warmth is a drug.' According to Cassandra, the 'all-seeing secretary' to Alibi's Prime Minister, and one of the novel's central characters, it's a place where people come to make their fortunes. 'So the expatriate compounds are full of ambitious, oversexed fools,' she tells the reader. Harrison Young says the title does make people wonder. 'You can't write any good story about adults without sex and certainly, there are a few scenes in the book that are a bit confronting,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Harrison Young graduates from the US Military's Officer Candidate School in 1967 . In Submission, Young draws on his pre-corporate life as a Special Forces officer in the US Army to tell the story of three ex-pats; their 'spiritual awakenings' and their passions in Arabia. There's Philip, a New York lawyer and Vietnam veteran who has been sent by his firm to advise Alidir's Prime Minister  - though he's not quite sure why. There's Allison Baxter, a 'sincere' American with an absent banker husband and there's Cassandra, the  gorgeous secretary and a former high-end-call girl who takes a fancy to Philip. 'It's an action movie in prose,' says Young. 'It presents as a literary thriller, spy stuff, and gradually turns into a love story with a fair amount of self awareness for Philip and a degree of spiritual awakening for the two women,' he tells Daily Mail Australia. Young says his early experiences in the army helped him build Philip's character in the novel. 'It's in the way he sees the world, his attitude to violence and the way you always know where you stand with him,' he says. 'I think anyone who's served in the American Army will get some good laughs from the book.' Early days: Harrison Young, pictured right, in his Special Forces green beret  in Hong Kong . Young says the setting for Submission was inspired by six months he spent living in Bahrain, where he was sent by international firm Morgan Stanley in 1991. He spent a lot of time in a hotel room with not enough to do. 'It was the kind of place where you heard the first half of a joke at someone's lunch and you'd hear the punchline  at someone else's dinner,' said Young.  'I realised very quickly that I could either become an alcoholic or try writing.' In fact, Young began writing much earlier, beginning his professional life as a journalist with a four-month gig at the Washington Post. He says he soon decided he didn't want to write about what other people do, but felt he didn't have any stories of his own to tell. 'I stopped writing for 18 years then finally thought, maybe I'd had enough life experience now.' I always wanted to write but didn't think I had a story to tell: The Commonwealth Bank Director and former US Army officer, pictured here in 1970 in Okinawa, actually began his career as a journalist in Washington DC. So how does Young find the time to write around  his demanding responsibilities with one of Australia's biggest banks? 'We always find time for the things we love,' he says. The other thing Harrison Young loves, and something he's famous for, is giving 'brilliant, animated dinner parties.' 'I always try to have a mixture of people - you don't want big bankers sitting around a table talking to themselves, that would just be boring - you want artists, academics, journalists, a diversity of people.' Certainly, Young's own story has been a diverse one. Do his dinner guests enjoy his books? 'Well they say they do!' Submission: Lessons from the desert by Harrison Young is available through Jane Curry Publishing.  Young's first erotic novel, 'Partners: love is a law unto itself' was called  the business world’s equivalent of E.L. James’ hit novel Fifty Shades of Grey. Dr. Maloof allowed another silence to grow between them. Allison forced herself not to fidget, but she found it impossible to hold his gaze. “Miss Prime, you are direct, so I will be direct. I would like you to take off your clothes.” Allison flushed. “For money?” She didn’t know what had made her say that. “Certainly not. For the experience. I judge that you have never done it before, for a man.” Allison stood up and began. “You are charmingly awkward,” he said. “It is better to start with your shoes, and sitting down. But never mind, you are doing fine. Hang your dress in the closet. There are hangers. Put everything in there and close the door.” “Now what?” “Sit back down. No, over there on the couch. You are extremely pleasant to look at.” Silence. “Change your position from time to time, so that I may appreciate all of you. You look fit. Do you run?” “Every morning.” Allison’s throat was dry and her voice cracked a little. “Would you like a glass of water?” “Yes, please.” Allison started to rise. “No, don’t move. I am happy to wait on you.” He went in to his kitchen and returned with an expensive looking tumbler of ice water. He set it on the table beside her and she drank. He returned to his chair. “Better?” “Yes.” “You have a dignity about you that I like.” “It is surprising,” said Allison, “but I am not at all ashamed.” “There is no reason to be.” “My pulse is racing, though.” “Of course it is.” “I wish it would calm down.” “That is quite unnecessary. The point is to give me aesthetic pleasure – for you are a lovely woman – and to give yourself an interesting experience.” “I am not sure I’d call myself a woman.” “You are on the verge of womanhood.” “How reassuring.” For the first time, she laughed. “If you ever are ashamed, there is pleasure to be taken in that too, you know?”","Commonwealth Bank Director Harrison Young has launched his  second erotic novel 'Submission'

"The unprecedented scale of the Conservative operation which failed to hold back the Ukip tide in Rochester and Strood can be laid bare today. Leaked emails sent by the party’s Whips’ Office show that in the 54 days since MP Mark Reckless’s defection to Ukip, there were around 100 separate visits to the constituency by Cabinet ministers, including five by the Prime Minister. Some 246 Conservative MPs – 80 per cent of the total – hit the campaign trail, with so many there that they were asked to sit in offices stuffing envelopes rather than knocking doors, amid reports voters were sick and tired of constant canvassing. Scroll down for video . On October 16, David Cameron introduced the Conservative Party's candidates Anna Firth and Kelly Tolhurst at the Wainscott Memorial Hall in Rochester . On October 24, Mr Cameron attended a community forum in Chatham, Kent, as he campaigns for the Conservative party in the Rochester and Strood by-election with candidate Kelly Tolhurst (second right) In the early days of the campaign, David Cameron was quoted as saying privately he wanted to kick Mr Reckless’s ‘fat a*** out of the Commons’ and insisting he would ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at winning the seat. Ukip’s triumph – its second by-election win in weeks – shook all three main parties. Nigel Farage declared there were now no no-go areas for his party and neither the Conservatives nor Labour could hope to win next year’s General Election outright. But Tory jitters were limited by the smaller-than-expected majority, with senior Eurosceptics, including John Redwood and John Baron, speaking supportively. Ukip had forecast a win by 15 percentage points or more just days ago, but Mr Reckless won by 2,900 votes, or just 7 points. ‘It isn’t big enough,’ said one MP sceptical about the party leadership of Mr Reckless’s majority. ‘If you’re an MP flirting with defection and you look at those numbers in a by-election when people want to kick the Government, you have to be thinking you wouldn’t hold on to your seat at the General Election.’ On November 4, Mr Cameron (centre) with Kelly Tolhurst (left), the new Conservative candidate for Rochester and Strood, were shown around the Crossrail site in Chatham, Kent . On November 11, Mr Cameron spoke to pupils of Strood Academy in Rochester, Kent . And on November 18, Mr Cameron and Ms Tolhurst, visited a company in  Rochester . Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m absolutely determined to win this seat back at the next General Election. Because anything other than a Conservative government will put our recovery at risk and mean Ed Miliband in Downing Street.’ Bookmakers have installed the Conservatives as favourites to retake the seat in May’s election. Emails prepared by the Whips’ Office show that at least 100 visits were made to Rochester by Cabinet ministers, with each member asked to go five times, and MPs to make three visits at their own expense. The emails reveal that 246 MPs made at least one visit, and most had made several. Mr Cameron said he would ‘lead from the front’ by doing the same, but his final two visits to local businesses, as Ukip surged in the polls, were notably low-key. Ukip and Labour believe the Tories must also have come close to the spending limit for a by-election – of £100,000 – after holding an expensive open primary vote of residents to choose their candidate. The party also hired no fewer than four shops in the constituency to act as bases. Every Saturday, buses full of young activists – so-called Team 2015, who were used to great effect in the Newark by-election the Tories won earlier this year – arrived to pound the streets. One minister was quoted at the start of the campaign as saying it would be ‘like Newark on crack cocaine’. The Tories’ operation to try to secure the seat for their candidate, marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, reached fever pitch on polling day as hundreds of activists, including MPs, went canvassing. Miss Tolhurst had used a public meeting to appeal to voters from the Labour, Lib Dems and Greens to vote tactically for the Tories in order to keep Ukip out. And on the final day, thousands of glossy personalised leaflets – bearing the name of each voter – were sent to likely Tory voters, encouraging them to go to the polls. One MP, who is on the Right of the party, said they and several colleagues were ‘incandescent’ about a letter Miss Tolhurst sent to voters, approved by Tory HQ. Despite not once mentioning she was a Conservative, it mentioned Ukip twice. It also mentioned ‘uncontrolled immigration’ and the fact some local people felt unsafe on their high street due to crime, in a way that critics said made it appear the issues were linked. Miss Tolhurst denied she had intended a link. The MP said: ‘A lot of us thought it was deeply unpleasant.’ Patrick Brione, director of research at pollster Survation, said: ‘All MPs were instructed to visit the constituency at least three times and over a hundred MPs did so on multiple occasions; David Cameron himself made five visits. The party had shipped in activists from across the country to bombard the constituency with canvassing – their resources extended as far as being able to pull off a logistically impressive 6am mail drop to households across the seat on the morning of the vote. ‘Despite all of this, the party failed to retain a seat with a 10,000-vote majority, against an opposition party which had not even fielded a candidate at the previous election. The implications for the Conservatives are potentially dire.’ Michael Gove accused Mair of playing a game of 'political snakes and ladders' on Radio 4 . Michael Gove today accused the BBC of ‘political game-playing’ after he was repeatedly asked about the Prime Minister’s failure at the ballot box. In a hostile exchange on Radio 4’s PM, the Chief Whip told presenter Eddie Mair he was playing a game of ‘political snakes and ladders’ rather than asking about issues of substance. After Mr Mair accused Mr Gove of dodging a question about whether he should resign if there are more defections to Ukip, the former education secretary seemed to become frustrated. ‘Your question was, if I may say so, the type of political game-playing that puts people off BBC interviewers because of instead of asking about policy you’re asking about position,’ he told Mr Mair. ‘One of the things people dislike about politics is the way that commentators instead of talking about issues of substance, such as employment or inflation, play a game of snakes and ladders, and who is up and who is down.’ Mr Gove said the Conservatives were on course for victory in May’s general election despite suffering a second drubbing at the ballot box in just six weeks. When repeatedly pressed to explain why Mr Cameron ‘can’t win’, Mr Gove insisted he ‘secured a bigger swing than any leader since 1930s’ at the last general election and is ‘winning the economic argument’. He added that ‘there is no one to match David Cameron in terms of the strengths of leadership’ among current politicians. Asked if he would resign as Chief Whip if another Tory defects to Ukip, he told the programme: ‘I’m convinced that nobody will so the matter doesn’t arise.’ Mr Gove has previously said that there are not too many immigrants in Britain – a key Ukip claim – but he refused to repeat the comments in an interview with Channel 4 News last night. Queue of others waiting to defect gloats Farage . Nigel Farage today predicted that more MPs would defect to Ukip next year. Arch Conservative eurosceptic Philip Hollobone flanked Tory defector Mark Reckless as he was sworn in as Ukip’s second MP, raising speculation he may be next to jump ship. Ukip leader Mr Farage suggested Tory MPs facing a threat from Labour in northern constituencies would be the most likely to see their future in his party, and mentioned a list of five of the most likely. Some have ‘no chance of winning on a blue rosette but might do on a purple rosette’ at the general election, he said. Asked who he was thinking of, he gave no names but referred to a list drawn up by academic Matthew Goodwin of the five most likely Tories to defect to cling on to their seats. Winner and loser: Ukip leaderNigel Farage, right, and Prime Minister David Cameron, left, today . It includes Chris Kelly, MP for Dudley South, who is already quitting in May, David Nuttall in Bury North, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and Nigel Mills in the Amber Valley. All have denied they will defect. The fifth, Basildon and Billericay MP John Baron, said recently that ‘you should never say never in politics’. Another who has denied he will defect is Adam Holloway, Tory MP for Gravesham in Kent, who Mr Farage said he had spoken to but would not say when, or what they discussed. Mr Farage did not expect more MPs to join Ukip straightaway, but expected some to reach a decision over Christmas. He said: ‘I would be very surprised if there weren’t defections of MPs between now and the general election.’ He had spoken to Labour figures, but they were more scared of a voter backlash.","Scale of operation which failed to hold back Ukip in Rochester and Strood can be laid bare .

"Hundreds of people gathered to pay tribute to former Queensland Labor Premier Wayne Goss at a public memorial service to celebrate his life.

But it was not just Wayne Goss the progressive politician who was remembered. His personal characteristics - punctuality, meticulous organisation, a sense of humour and a commitment to stand up for what's right - also made him a successful lawyer, businessman, father and husband.

"At 19-years-old, Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of her chemical engineering degree at Stanford University and used her tuition money to pursue a business idea she hoped would change the landscape of healthcare. With a major fear of needles, she decided the current system for testing blood - implemented in the 1960s - was archaic, expensive, painful and slow. Holmes, 30, endeavored to change that method and develop a way that would eradicate the need for vials of blood to be taken and for blood tests to have to take place at the doctors or a lab. Working mostly in secret for the last 11 years, her company, Theranos, is now valued at $9 billion and, according to Holmes, is changing people's lives. Scroll down for video . Revolutionary: The CEO of diagnostic center Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, 30, is the brains behind a $9 billion company that has changed the medical landscape by developing a new method to run blood tests . Theranos' technology requires only a finger prick of blood to be drawn from a patient in order to get fast, effective results. One drop can run 30 lab tests, the company claims. Holmes told Wired they can get results in less than four hours. She said that her fear of needles allowed her to realize that people avoid blood tests for that reason. Partnered with Walgreens, the flagship Theranos Wellness Center is based in Palo Alto, California. There are also 20 others that have opened inside Walgreens around Phoenix. Patients are able to walk into the stores, have their finger pricked, and get blood results within hours. The cost, depending on the extent of the tests, averages around $30. Holmes' goal is to launch Theranos in all 8,200 Walgreens across the country. 'Our work is enabling everyone, no matter how much money they have, or where they live, or what kind of insurance they have, to be able to have access to the kind of testing information that could change their lives,' she told USA Today. 'Theranos is a company dedicated to the belief that access to actionable health information at the time it matters most is a basic human right.'

'Archaic': Holmes decided the current method for testing blood, requiring one or multiple vials of blood and first introduced in the 1960s, was out-of-date and needed to be streamlined . New system: Theranos developed software that allowed blood tests to be performed using a 'micro-sample', needing just a drop of blood taken from a person with a finger prick . Menu: Now in 21 locations - a flagship in California and 20 smaller clinics in Phoenix - Theranos charges different amounts for their blood tests, depending on what is being tested . Now 30, Holmes was the youngest self-made woman on this years Forbes 400 rich list. Shes owns 50 percent of Theranos, and has a net worth of about $4.5 billion. 'She could totally overturn an entire industry if Theranos is as successful as it seems to be,' Abram Brown, associate editor at Forbes, told Yahoo. Holmes has a team of influential backers behind her company. The Theranos board of directors includes former secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, former Defense Secretary William Perry, and former senators Sam Nunn and Bill Frist. Holmes is getting great responses from patients using the Theranos diagnostic centers. Dropout: Holmes left her chemical engineering degree at Stanford to develop a way to take the pain and cost out of getting blood tested. She is now worth $4.5 billion . She told USA Today of a diabetic woman who wrote to her that had three fingers picks for a wide-range of blood tests. She paid $34. The woman said she had undergone the same tests earlier this year and that it cost her insurance $876. 'When I realized this is what I wanted to do with my life, things got easy,' Holmes told USA Today. 'Because when you reach that moment when you've found what you're born to do, well then you just go do it.'","Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University in 2003 .

"A Texas mailman was arrested for using methamphetamine and selling it during his mail route, investigators say. After a 10-month investigation, police arrested 39-year-old Edward Flores, of Lorena, on Thursday on charges of possession of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone, the Waco Tribune-Herald reports. During the investigation, authorities watched Flores, during surveillance operations, delivering meth from his U.S. Postal Service vehicle while wearing his uniform, the Smoking Gun reports. Arrested: Edward Flores, 39, was arrested after a 10-month investigation for selling methamphetamine out of his home and during his mail route . Family: Flores is accused of selling the meth out of his home as well, where he lives with his wife and three children . His Facebook profile indicates that Flores is a father of three. The investigation began when authorities received tips that narcotics were being sold from Flores' home as well as from a USPS vehicle. The investigation culminated in a raid of Flores' home last week, authorities seized 175 grams of methamphetamine, according to the Waco-Trib. This amount is reportedly worth $17,000 in street value. No Knowledge: Authorities say that Flores' wife had no knowledge of his illegal activities . Raid: The investigation culminated in a raid of Flores' home last week,  authorities seized 175 grams of methamphetamine which is worth $17,000 in street value.

"Italian tennis players Daniele Bracciali and Potito Starace are facing corruption accusations after intercepted internet conversations claiming they sold matches were printed on Wednesday in Italian media. The conversations are part of the extensive data that judicial investigators in Cremona have been sorting through in a match-fixing inquiry into soccer. In a July 2007 conversation on Skype between Bracciali and an accountant who was arrested in 2011, it is reported Bracciali discusses arranging a match in Newport, Rhode Island, against American player Scoville Jenkins. Jenkins won 6-2, 6-1. Italian tennis player Daniele Bracciali, pictured here in 2006, is facing accusations of match-fixing . In 2011, an owner of a betting parlor who was later arrested is heard saying that former world No 27 Starace agreed to sell the final of a tournament in Casablanca. Pablo Andujar of Spain won the final 6-1, 6-2. Prosecutor Roberto Di Martino, who is leading the Cremona inquiry, confirmed to The Associated Press the authenticity of the conversations. Di Martino added that foreign tennis players might also be involved. 'I can't rule that out,' Di Martino said. 'But I can't say anything more for now.' Bracciali and Starace, neither of whom are officially under investigation, refused to comment after pairing together to win a first-round doubles at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow on Wednesday. The Italian tennis federation (FIT) said it will request copies of all the documents from Cremona authorities involving tennis players. 'If the inquiry confirms what went on in the intercepted conversations published by the newspapers then we'll be dealing with serious and intolerable offenses,' FIT president Angelo Binaghi said in a statement. Potito Starace, the former world No 27 pictured here in 2012, refused to comment in Moscow on Wednesday . The Last Bet operation has resulted in more than 100 people placed under investigation in Italy since mid-2011, with suspect soccer matches being looked at by prosecutors in Cremona, Bari and Naples. The inquiry is branching out to other sports. The 36-year-old Bracciali is a doubles specialist while the 33-year-old Starace is ranked 150th in singles. Bracciali and Starace were already two of five Italians - along with Alessio Di Mauro, Giorgio Galimberti and Federico Luzzi - who were given suspensions in 2007-08 by the ATP ranging from six weeks to nine months for betting. In other cases of match-fixing in tennis, life bans were handed to Daniel Koellerer of Austria in 2011, David Savic of Serbia in 2012, and Andrey Kumantsov of Russia this year. In July, one man was charged and five others arrested in an Australian police operation against an international tennis match-fixing syndicate.

"Some cash strapped NHS trusts have been telling consultants to switch to Avastin (file picture) Eye specialists claim a cancer drug should be used on the NHS to prevent patients going blind – even though it is unlicensed. Avastin is cheaper than the NHS-recommended treatment for age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of vision loss in those aged over 50. According to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, Avastin could save the Health Service £100million a year. Some cash-strapped NHS trusts have been telling consultants to switch to the drug rather than use the recommended Lucentis, which is around ten times more expensive. But in doing so, doctors could fall foul of General Medical Council rules, says the Royal College. It is calling for ‘bureaucratic hurdles’ to be removed by the GMC and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which would pave the way for use of the cheaper drug. Lucentis, which costs around £700 for an injection, is approved by Nice but Avastin, costing an estimated £70 a shot, is not licensed for eye conditions. However, findings from clinical studies suggest Avastin – used to treat bowel and breast cancer – is as effective and safe as Lucentis. Carrie MacEwen, president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, is co-signatory to an editorial in the British Medical Journal, which appeals to the Government to remove the hurdles preventing Avastin’s use. But she falls short of encouraging eye specialists to use the drug since the GMC’s rules permit an unlicensed drug to be used only in the absence of a licensed medicine. Hospital eye services are struggling to cope with demand posed by the need for patients to have regular injections at a ‘time of austerity’, she said. ‘Consequently patients may not be getting treatment when they need it.’ A study found switching from Lucentis to Avastin could save NHS England £102million a year, and the money saved could be invested in the eye services. The Department of Health said it did not intend to ask Nice to review the use of Avastin. A spokesman said: ‘Age-related macular degeneration is a very serious condition and there are already other licensed and Nice-recommended drugs available to treat this condition.’ According to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, Avastin could save the Health Service £100million a year (file picture)","Unlicensed cancer drug should be used on the NHS to prevent blindness .

"Mother Teila Veronica Williams, 24, is charged with first degree cruelty to children . A mother has been arrested after her ten-week-old baby was diagnosed with multiple broken bones and a detached retina. The baby's twin brother was found dead at the weekend - his cause of death has not yet been determined. Mother Teila Veronica Williams, 24, was arrested Wednesday night and charged with first degree cruelty to children. Additional charges are possible when investigators determine how the baby boy died, police said. The baby girl was found after police were called to the home in Snellville, Georgia, following reports of her twin's death. But it soon became clear that his twin sister needed urgent medical attention and she was taken to a local hospital, reports AJC.com. At the hospital, doctors determined she had broken ribs, arms and legs, as well as a detached retina, the warrant states. The little girl was then flown to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, the arrest warrant states. 'Child likely suffered from nutritional neglect and given the infant's clinical picture, it is consistent with medical neglect,' a doctor said according to the warrant. Investigators have not determined who caused the baby's injuries. Captain Carey Roberts told Channel 2 Action News officers plan to interview three other adults who also live in the home. Williams was being held on $5,700 bond Thursday night at the Gwinnett County jail, booking records showed. Her other four children are in protective custody, according to police.

"Protesters angry at the presumed massacre of 43 students clashed with police outside Mexico's National Palace on Thursday after a massive march demanding President Enrique Pena Nieto's resignation. The face-off in Mexico City marred a rally of tens of thousands of black-clad people, where they waved blackened Mexican flags and chanted 'Urgent! Urgent for the president to resign!' Parents of the 43 male college students, who reject claims their sons are dead and demand the government find them safe and sound, led the latest nationwide demonstration to the historic palace. Scroll down for video . Protesters angry at the presumed massacre of 43 students clashed with police outside Mexico's National Palace on Thursday . Some 30,000 people took part in the protest, according to the city government . Before the march, masked protesters threw firebombs and used bazooka-like tubes to launch firecrackers at police . Federal police spray protestors with fire extinguishers as they drive them back from the National Palace . 'We won't rest until we find the boys,' Felipe de la Cruz, father of a missing student, told the crowd after the parents arrived in the capital following a week-long bus protest tour of Mexico. Some 30,000 people took part in the protest, according to the city government. Some protesters burned an effigy of the president and threw powerful firecrackers at the fenced-off palace, which Pena Nieto only uses for ceremonies. Hundreds of riot police sprayed water and fired tear gas at protesters. Some charged the officers, kicking at their shields. Other protesters shouted 'No violence!' before the police swarmed and cleared the Zocalo square, where the palace lies. Officials said 31 people were detained throughout the day. At least five people were injured during the mostly peaceful rally, an AFP photographer said. Authorities said two police officers were also injured. The crime involving the students has infuriated Mexicans fed up with corruption, impunity and a drug war that has left more than 100,000 people dead or missing since 2006. The case has turned into the biggest challenge of Pena Nieto's nearly two-year-old presidency, on top of another scandal over a mansion his wife bought from a government contractor. Prosecutors say a drug gang confessed to slaying the students and burning their bodies after receiving them from corrupt police in the southern state of Guerrero in September. 'Mexico is used to tragedy, robberies and corruption, and we need to begin to exercise our rights as citizens to get the government working,' said Lili Correa, 46, wearing black.

Protestors tear down barriers surrounding the National Palace . Federal police advance into the Zocalo as they drive back violent protestors from the National Palace . The demonstration coincided with the anniversary of the start of the 1910 Mexican revolution, prompting the government to cancel the annual parade. Before the march, masked protesters threw firebombs and used bazooka-like tubes to launch firecrackers at police, who hit back with tear gas to disperse them on a street near the airport. Protesters also blocked the main road to the airport for an hour. Police vehicles picked up passengers hauling their suitcases along the road. Thousands protested in several other cities, including Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, the violence-plagued southern state where the students vanished nearly two months ago. Support was shown in other countries, with thousands marching in Bolivia and some 200 in El Salvador. The demonstration coincided with the anniversary of the start of the 1910 Mexican revolution . Mexico and Real Madrid football star Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez tweeted a picture of himself wearing a black hoodie and the hashtag #WeAreAllAyotzinapa, referring to the young men's Ayotzinapa teacher-training college. 'This is a nationwide problem. Nothing like this happened before and Pena Nieto doesn't care, he's useless,' said Luis Angel Garcia, a 19-year-old Ayotzinapa student. With the annual parade called off, Pena Nieto led a ceremony with top officials at the Campo Marte military field, where he denounced violent protests. 'Mexico is hurting, but the only path to soothe this pain is through peace and justice,' he said, hours after making his personal assets public to quell conflict of interest allegations over his wife's mansion. The 43 students, pictured, went missing as they travelled to a protest in Iguala, Guerrero State  in September . Investigators believe the bodies of the 43 missing students were burned at this rubbish dump outside the mountain town of Cocula, near Iguala . Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos said violence 'only leads to national failure, social backwardness, ungovernability, instability.' The crisis erupted after the mayor of the city of Iguala ordered police to confront students on September 26, sparking a night of violence that left six people dead and 43 missing, authorities say. Members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang told investigators they killed the students and burned the bodies after police had handed them over. Officials stopped short of declaring the students dead, pending an Austrian university's DNA tests on charred bones. Federal authorities continue to search for them in Guerrero. Highlighting their deep distrust of the authorities, families of the missing say they will only trust DNA test results from independent foreign forensic experts.","Protesters angry at presumed massacre of 43 students clashed with police .

"Authorities say unemployment and drug addiction have spurred an increase in the destructive practice of cutting off the knobby growths at the base of ancient redwood trees to make decorative pieces like lacey-grained coffee tables and wall clocks. The practice — known as burl poaching — has become so prevalent along the Northern California coast that Redwood National and State Parks now closes the popular Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway at night in a desperate attempt to deter thieves. Law enforcement Ranger Laura Denny said that poachers have been stalking the remote reaches of the park with their chain saws and ATVs for decades, but lately the size and frequency of thefts have been on the rise. Hacks: Northern California park officials say that poachers are endangering 1,000=year-old coastal redwoods as by hacking off chunks of their wood, mostly to buy drugs or get them through tough financial times . 'When I interview suspects, that is the (reason) they say: their addiction to drugs and they can't find jobs,' she said. Burly: The burls of redwood trees (a refrigerator-sized example is seen here) fetch the largest sums from dealers who sell slabs from them to make tables that can fetch upwards of five figures . Her husband, park district interpretation supervisor Jeff Denny, said it is comparable to poor people poaching rare rhinos in Africa to sell their horns. Jobs are hard to come by since the timber and commercial fishing industries went into decline. 'Originally there were 2 million acres of old growth forest that spanned the coast of Northern California from Oregon to Monterey,' he said. 'Over the past 150 years, 95 percent of that original forest has been cut. The only remaining old growth forest in existence now is almost entirely within the Redwood national park' and some state parks. A redwood tree can survive the practice, but the legacy of the organism that could be 1,000 years old is threatened, because the burl is where it sprouts a clone before dying. Sprouting from burls is the prevalent method of redwood propagation, and the source of the Latin name for coast redwood, Sequoia semper vierens, or forever living, he added. Lorin Sandberg is a burl dealer in Scio, Oregon. He occasionally goes to Northern California to buy burl, but it is tough to find any more, with almost all of the old growth that makes the best burls protected on public land. The good stuff with a lacey grain full of eyes will go for $2 to $3 a pound, unseasoned. Finished dining room tables are being offered for $1,300 on eBay. 'I don't buy them unless they have proof of where they got it,' he said. 'I've got to have a paper trail. If there's not a paper trail, it can stay in their yard.' With few law enforcement rangers — and 133,000 acres of park stretching south from the headquarters in Crescent City, California — to patrol, arrests are rare, Laura Denny said. She can recall two or three over the past 12 years. While charges can be felonies carrying prison time, convictions usually end up as misdemeanors carrying fines. Soaring: The majestic trees can grow to around 400 feet tall, the greatest heights attained by any tree in the world . She was recently chasing a bunch that cut a massive burl from a redwood just south of the mouth of the Klamath River that was discovered by a bear researcher tramping the woods in April. The cut left a scar measuring 8 feet by 10 feet. Over the course of weeks, the thieves cut the burl into slabs weighing more than 100 pounds each that they dragged behind ATVs through the woods several hundred yards to a road. She found the slabs in a burl dealer's yard. After matching the wood to pieces left behind at the scarred tree, she seized the slabs. The dealer had paid $1,600 for eight slabs that he was going to sell for $700 apiece, for a total of $5,600. 'They are very difficult to catch because they move site to site,' operate in remote areas far from roads, and even the sound of a chain saw doesn't travel far in the woods, she said of poachers. She hopes that the road closure will raise awareness among park visitors so they question the source of slabs offered for sale at burl shops.","The poachers are after giant gnarled knots on the tree called burls where the interesting grain fetches more money .

Its shape, size and lack of a tell-tale name plate, which went on all play equipment when he began to sell it in 1926, show it was a prototype given by Wicksteed to his family as part of pre-production trials. Wicksteed opened Wicksteed Park in Kettering in 1921 because he wanted to give something back to the town he loved. The swing’s existence was discovered after the park appealed for photographs and evidence of old Wicksteed play equipment as part of a project to archive the history of the park.

'But when we appealed for information about Wicksteed play equipment, I never dreamed the search would take us back there. 'The swing is still painted green with red mountings, which were the traditional Wicksteed colours but significantly, there is no name plate, which went on all commercially produced equipment. 'It is in remarkable condition. There is some minor wear and tear on the frame but the big, thick wooden seat is as sturdy as ever and the whole thing looks like it could survive another 100 years.

"A honey badger was able to fight off a pride of lions and escape despite being trapped in one of the big cat's jaws during the struggle. The fearless mustelid held its ground and didn't give an inch when the lions began circling it at the Selinda Reserve in Northern Botswana, thinking they had found an easy meal. While fending off the lions the badger cunningly led the animals more than 300 feet away to a small hole which it was then able to squeeze into and escape. Get back: The honey badger lunges at one of the lion cubs after they outnumber it at the Selinda Reserve in Northern Botswana . Biting down: The honey badger nips the side of the lions face at it pins the mustelid to the ground and sinks its teeth into its body . Running free: The cunning honey badger leads the lions towards a small hole which it squeezes into to makes its escape . Safari guide Kane Motswana, 35, captured the fight unfolding and explained that initially eight lions - four adult lionesses and four young males - were involved. He said: 'The older, wiser females knew this would be a futile battle with this feisty little honey badger and backed off. 'But the inexperience of the young males showed as they continued to pursue him.' Mr Motswana said the outnumbered badger was 'very smart indeed' to hold off its attackers while also plotting its escape. Outnumbered but not outfoxed: The young lions gather around the honey badger and swipe at it with their paws while it plots its escape . Come back already: A safari guide who saw the incident said a group of adult females gave up after realising the badger wasn't an easy kill . Ducking and diving: The badger scurries under the lion's paws as it tries to pounce on the small animal it had hoped to eat for afternoon tea . He said: 'The honey badger was fortunate enough to escape the jaws of the lions as he very cunningly drove them towards a hole where he knew he could run into for protection.' Mr Motswana said the badger was so fast 'clambering into the hole it took us by surprise'. Despite working in 'the bush my entire life' Mr Motswana said the fight isn't something he will soon forget.

"Charged: Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, allegedly tried to steal two beers but lost his clothing instead . A man from Oregon attempted to rob a convenience store of two beers and lost his most of his clothing in the process earlier this month. Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, was stripped down to his boxer shorts during a fight with the owners of the Best Mart in Beaverton on November 9 after he allegedly tried snagging two beers from the cooler. In surveillance footage of the three minute battle, the owners of the store can be seen grabbing him in attempt to stop him from walking out the door. Berhane finally manages to escape the owners' grips and runs out the store wearing nothing but his boxer shorts. After scampering off, the half-naked suspect was arrested by police nearby and no one was injured, reports Oregon Live. Berhane was charged with resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, third-degree robbery, third-degree criminal mischief, third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault. In the surveillance footage, the owner can be seen trying to stop Berhane from leaving the store with two stolen beers. She calls her husband to help detain the alleged thief. Oregon Live reports that the owner recognized Berhane because she refused to sell him beer a week before and he smashed some bottles on the ground. When Berhane entered the shop he was wearing a hat, jacket, t-shirt, and sneakers but rapidly begins losing items of clothing during the scuffle. At one point the owners try to pin him to the counter but he starts flinging candy off the shelves in attempt to break free.

"Militants could flood some of Iraq's major cities by blowing up the country's biggest dam, it was feared last night. Fighters from the Islamic State jihadist group seized control of the Mosul Dam yesterday after an offensive lasting barely 24 hours. Its capture could prove a turning point in the growing civil war in the country. A file picture shows the Mosul Dam on the River Tigris: Fighters from the Islamic State jihadist group seized control of the Mosul Dam yesterday, a victory which could prove a turning point in Iraq's growing civil war . The flood threat could give the Sunni fighters a key bargaining point in their bid to topple the Shi'ite-led government of prime minister Nuri al-Maliki. The fighters from Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS, also took over an oilfield and three more towns after inflicting their first major defeat on Kurdish forces since sweeping through the region in June. The Islamists overwhelmed Kurdish forces in Zumar after attacking from three directions in pick-up trucks mounted with weapons, and then hoisted their black flags, a ritual that usually precedes mass executions of their captured opponents. 'Inside the apostates' HQ': The Islamic State posted this picture of one of its masked fighters holding up a pistol and sitting at the desk of the mayor of Sinjar . On its Twitter feed, the Islamic State posted a picture of one of its masked fighters holding up a pistol and sitting at the abandoned desk of the mayor of Sinjar. Behind him was the image of a famous Kurdish guerilla leader. In a statement on its website, The militants said their fighters had killed scores of Kurdish fighters. 'Hundreds fled leaving vehicles and a huge number of weapons and munitions and the brothers control many areas,' Islamic State said. 'The fighters arrived in the border triangle between Iraq, Syria and Turkey,' it said. The group poses the biggest challenge to the stability of OPEC member Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Since thousands of Iraqi soldiers fled the Islamic State offensive, Shi'ite militias and Kurdish fighters have been seen as a critical line of defence against the militants, who have threatened to march on Baghdad. But yesterday's battles have called into question the effectiveness of the Kurdish fighters and have increased pressure on Iraqi leaders to form a power-sharing government capable of countering the Islamic State. The group has systematically blown up Shi'ite mosques and shrines in territory it has seized, but so far its drive to reach Baghdad has stalled near the town of Samarra, 62 miles north of the capital. Islamic State has been trying to consolidate its gains, setting its sights on strategic towns near oil fields, as well as border crossings with Syria so that it can move easily back and forth and transport supplies.","Islamist group inflicts first major defeat on Kurdish forces since June .

"The father of a girl who plunged 90ft to her death from a tower block window after a fight with her ex-boyfriend has launched a court battle to have her accidental death inquest verdict overturned. An inquest into 17-year-old Emily Mather's death ruled that she pushed open the bedroom window of a ninth-floor flat  and accidentally fell head-first through it, shortly after an argument with her ex-boyfriend who was in the next room. But her father, Malcolm, believes the full facts surrounding her death are yet to emerge and has taken the case to the High Court. Emily Mather (left) died after plunging 90ft from the ninth floor window of a tower block, but her father, Malcolm (right), wants her 'accidental death' inquest verdict overturned . Miss Mather, who lived in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, with her father and sister Beth had been out with her friend Laurie Coxon, now 25, in June 2006. They decided to contact Laurie's then boyfriend David Metcalf to ask if they could stop by at his flat in Eslington Court. Miss Mather's ex-boyfriend Michael Boslem was also at the home and she was worried there was going to be 'some trouble' because of their recent break-up. An argument between Mr Boslem and Miss Mather, who had recently had an abortion, broke out at the flat, the inquest in October this year heard. The 17-year-old then went into the bedroom where she was left alone. South Tyneside coroner Terence Carney ruled that Miss Mather, who had been drinking, stood on the bed to  push open the window but accidentally fell out as she did so. However, Mr Mather, 48, claims there is no evidence to suggest his daughter touched the window. He said: 'I don't think she could have been standing on the bed, opened the window and fallen out. 'There were no fingerprints or other evidence on that window.' A coroner ruled that 17-year-old Miss Mather, who had been drinking, fell out of the bedroom window of Eslington Court tower block (pictured) while trying to open a window . Yesterday Mr Mather began his fight at the High Court to overturn the inquest's accidental death verdict. 'It's been hard work but the whole family are determined to continue the process,' he said. 'It's up to the High Court to grant the judicial review but of course we want a positive outcome and we want to get the inquest verdict overturned.' After the hearing last month, solicitor Sefton Kwasnik, speaking on behalf of the family, hit out at the coroner's verdict. He said: 'It's astounding to say that Emily opened that window when there is no physical evidence that details this having taken place. 'For the coroner to say that this was an accident caused by Emily's actions is mystifying.' Miss Mather, an award-winning sixth-form student, was studying for her A-levels at the time of her death and wanted to work with children. Her father last saw her on the night she died when he gave her some pocket money. The following morning two police officers arrived at his home deliver the tragic news that his daughter was dead. A post-mortem examination revealed Emily died of a spinal cord injury due to a fracture to the cervical spine and a fall from a height. Investigations revealed that Emily had alcohol, pholcodine, which was identified as a cough medicine, and traces of cocaine in her system. The restraining arm on the bedroom window was detached and damaged.","Emily Mather, 17, was killed after falling from a tower block window in 2006 .

"Over 250 cans of food and essential items bought in the 1970s have been found in near-perfect condition in a mysterious cupboard that hadn’t been opened in 40 years. The extraordinary find was made by the caretaker of a tower block in Hove, East Sussex - and because there was no key, he had to use an angle grinder to gain entry. Once Ronald Mclintock, 64, had opened the door on the 11th floor he was transported back in time. Time warp: Items discovered in the cupboard are post-decimal 1971 but still have half pence on their prices, which were abolished in 1984 . To Boldy go: Bold detergent (above) was launched in 1974 and this packaging was on the shelves until 2004, when it was given a major revamp. The design of the Heinz soup on the right has barely changed since the 1980s, but was very different in 1910, when it was first brought to the UK. Pumphrey's sugar crystals (far right) are no longer available but the firm still makes a tasty range of coffee. The Cadbury's Drinking Chocolate (far left), meanwhile, has a notable one and a half pence off . Inside he found tins of Heinz lentil and chicken and mushroom soup, mackerel in tomato sauce, Waitrose scotch broth soup and washing-up liquid. Packs of Johnson’s baby powder, brown sugar crystals and cling film were also hidden inside the well organised cupboard. Items discovered in the cupboard are post decimal 1971 but still have half pence on their prices, which were abolished in 1984. Devon knows how it got here: Ambrosia has been making rice pudding since just before the outbreak of the Second World War and a tin of it was found in the corner of the mysterious cupboard in Hove. These days the product comes in a pot with a lid. On the right is another family favourite - Batchelors. They still make their famous Cup-A-Soup, but not the Pack-a-Pie filling pictured . Mr Mclintock also stumbled across baked beans, jars of coffee, unused pots and pans, a variety of cleaning products and powdered milk. The items still had price labels on them including from shops such as Sainsburys, Waitrose and some were simply tagged ‘International’. The cupboard is next to an access point and Mr Mclintock only made the discovery because he asked why no one had opened it. No one in at the flats knows why the items would have been stored in such an unusual place or who may have put them there. Remarkable find: Mr Mclintock (left) said the discovery he made at the tower block in Hove (right) was 'a little treasure trove of history' and he's reluctant to dispose of it . Mr Mclintock said: ‘It was pure curiosity. I thought it was just going to be full of rubbish so when I popped it open I got quite a shock. ‘No one can throw any light on where it all came from. ‘There were hundreds of old cans and goods, there was probably at least 250 items stored in the cupboard. ‘Someone had obviously spent a lot of money and were stocking up for some reason. ‘Apart from an exploded tin of prunes, it was in perfect condition.’ Mr Mclintock continued: ‘The seventies was a very uncertain time, with the miner’s strikes, the three day week and the Cold War - so maybe someone was preparing for the apocalypse. ‘I am reluctant to dispose of it as it is a little treasure trove of history - whoever stocked it up must have spent a fortune.’","The extraordinary find was made by Ronald Mclintock in a tower block in Hove where he's the caretaker .

"Frances Moore was 18 when she was hired to help out for the holidays at an Alabama jewelry store in 1939 and she's still there today. The 93-year-old Birmingham woman is celebrating 75 years as an employee of the family-owned Bromberg & Co. She's the longest-tenured employee at one of the nation's oldest family-owned retailers. Moore, then a teenager, was hired to polish silver on Nov. 21, 1939, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president and before the United States entered World War II. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Frances Moore, 93, is pictured putting a tag on a necklace at Bromberg & Co. jewelry in Mountain Brook, Alabama . She made $8 a week initially, but she was happy since the trolley ride to work only cost only 7 cents. She soon transferred to gift wrap. By around 1970, Moore was managing the company's multimillion-dollar jewelry inventory. 'I didn't think I'd live 75 years let alone work for somebody 75 years,' Moore said in an interview Monday as she put tags on rings and bracelets for sale. Moore said her parents taught her to work hard and Bromberg's is a good employer, so she never left. She retired from full-time work a few years ago but still comes in to sort and tag jewelry. She's also done some other jobs for the company through the years, including refinishing silver and arranging flowers. Frances Moore, 93, sorts bags of necklaces at Bromberg & Co. jewelry in Mountain Brook . 'Anything I wanted to do in the store I started going it,' she said. 'I'd go move from one department to the other because I just like going around in the store and looking at the pretty things.' Bromberg said Moore is still a valued employee who contributes to the bottom line. The company honored her with a breakfast on Friday, the anniversary of her hiring. Moore, who has outlived two husbands and has no children, still lives at home but says church friends help her clean and cook. Friends or relatives typically drive her to work at the Bromberg's store in Mountain Brook. Moore said she plans to keep working as long as the can. 'Last year I thought I was going to have to give up because of the fact I broke my hip several years ago, had knee surgery and all those things,' she said. 'But I snapped back every time.'","Frances Moorehas outlived two husbands and has no children .

"A lottery winner who quit his factory job to go on a £72,000 round-the-world pub crawl with his best friends has returned to the UK to find he can't get a mortgage. Matt Myles took his brother, Pete, and three of his friends on an eight-month holiday after winning £1million in April. After spending nearly eight months visiting seven countries, the 28-year-old has returned home to Hereford where he has had to buy a house outright after being turned down for a mortgage. Matt Myles spent £72,000 on alcohol during a round-the-world pub crawl with his best friends and brother after scooping £1million in the lottery in April. Above, at the beginning of his trip in Bali . The party didn't stop once back on home soil where Mr Myles spent thousands flying two DJs from Ibiza to Hereford for his Great Gatsby themed bash . Speaking of his £72,000 bar bill, Mr Myles said: 'The money has been mostly spent on the p****'. I mean, why wouldn't you?' 'We got through £80,000 in less than eight months. I would say about 90 per cent of that was spent going on the razz. 'We basically tried to do a night on, a night off the sauce, but most of the time it was night on, night on, night on. 'In America we did drinking games with fratboys. People call it pre-gaming; when you start drinking before you go out to a bar. 'So we were trying to teach them English drinking games. 'I would say America was my favourite purely because it is English speaking.' After picking up his £1million cheque in April, Mr Myles paid for the group to fly to Bali where they spent ten days before moving on to Thailand. The boys spent five weeks island hopping in the popular tourist country before jetting to Brazil for the World Cup.

Ibiza followed, with Mr Myles spending £7,000 in one of the island's most popular nightclubs, Space. They then spent three weeks in Spain before flying to Italy. Their trip was rounded off in America, where they spent five weeks in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and New Orleans. Bali - Thousands spent on a luxury hilltop villa and bottles of 2003 vintage Dom Perignon . Thailand - Elephant Trekking, visits to tiger enclosures and the infamous Full Moon Party .

Spain -  Three weeks of drinking and tanning with his friends and brother . Tuscany -  A luxury villa for two weeks for the rest of the family . America - £4,000 in a New York nightclub and thousands in Washington DC, New Orleans and elsewhere . Speaking of the Big Apple, Mr Myles said: 'The only way to describe New York is London on crack. 'Everyone is going a million miles an hour. 'It is expensive in New York. We spent £4,500 just to get in and sit at a table in one place in New York. 'It was one of the best nights I have ever had in my life. It was insane.' The extravagance didn't stop once the boys were back on home soil, with Mr Myles splashing out for a Great Gatsby themed birthday party in September. 'For my birthday in September, we threw a Great Gatsby party for 350 people. There were champagne showers. I had a 12 litre bottle of Veuve (Clicquot). 'I flew two DJs in from Ibiza. We had this massive marquee next to Kentchurch Court in Herefordshire.' But the former engineer's long-term plans were stunted when he was turned down for mortgages due to a pre-existing poor credit rating. He now plans to spend £150,000 on buying a property outright. Eventually the group had to come home before they did serious damage to their health, the millionaire said . The good life: Despite having an 'insane' time with his brother and friends, Mr Myles admitted the group had to come home to 'grow up'. He is pictured in New York (left) and in Bali (right) Mr Myles, pictured with his brother at his birthday party in September, described the trip as 'insane' As well as buying a house in Hereford, Mr Myles has splashed out on a Porsche and an Omega watch . 'We had to come home for the sake of our livers,' he said. 'We had an amazing time but we all had to come home and grow up, I’ve got to buy a house and we couldn't carry on much longer without doing ourselves serious damage. 'I was going to buy a load of houses with mortgages and then get people into rent them to pay for the mortgage. 'But mortgage lenders don’t see the interest of an investment as income so, in effect I am a millionaire, but I can’t even get a mortgage.'","Matt Myles quit his job and jetted off with friends after winning £1million .

"A century ago, King Island was a bustling community of 200 people who passed their days hunting seals and their long winter nights dancing beneath the wide Alaska skies. But now, after a series of tragedies, the island stands deserted, reduced to a collection of crumbling, empty homes - a mere skeleton of the thriving neighborhood it once was. Seventy years ago, as the island's men were shipped off to battle in World War II and a savage outbreak of tuberculosis claimed many of those left behind, numbers began to dwindle. The lure of . jobs and better medical care on the mainland also added to the exodus, and finally the . Bureau of Indian affairs closed the island's only school in 1959 because of fears of a . rock slide. Scroll down for video . Abandoned: The residents of King Island in Alaska built their houses on stilts on the side of a jagged island . Settlement: Before a series of tragedies, a community had lived on the island for thousands of years . With . their school closed, the remaining families were forced to begin a new . life in the nearby mainland town of Nome - but the move brought a new series of hardships, with families . separated, children put into care because of truancy laws, and others . forced to attend boarding schools. 'In short, the fabric of King Island . extended family life was shredded without cause,' the Alaska Dispatch reported. 'The stated reason for . the move... was that a boulder was about to roll down the . hill and crush the school. More than 50 years later, the boulder still hasn't moved.' Before the tragedies and fears of rock slides, families had lived on the island - which is 40 miles west of the mainland - for thousands of years, propping their community up on the steep, rocky banks. The island, which is just a mile long, was inhabited by a group of Inupiat who called themselves Ukivokmiut, which means 'People of the sea'. The small village was named Ukivok. The men gained fame as hunters and ivory carvers, and survived on walrus, seal, birds and berries before heading to the mainland in the summer to sell their carvings. Former homes: An image from 1928 shows King Island when around 200 residents would have lived there . Villagers: King Island residents in kayaks in an image taken around 1892. The kayaks are the characteristic King Island style as they carry more than one person or items on deck . Community: A group of men aboard a ship from the island in 1898; the men caught seals and fish . Way of life: Pictured in 1928, an Inupiat man on King Island uses a bow-drill to drill a hole in a walrus tusk . Today, the mystique of the tiny deserted . island lives on, with the granddaughter of former residents finally . achieving her wish to visit their one-time home. Joan Naviyuk Kane had been raising money . to fund a two-week trip to King Island, a tiny village of houses built . on sticks along the jagged island, when an unnamed foundation donated $32,000. Ms Kane had been struggling to raise the money to visit when she received the anonymous gift. 'I'm still in disbelief,' Mrs Kane, who is half Inupiat, said. 'I've been trying to wrap my head around it.' For years the 35-year-old, who lives with her husband and children in Anchorage, has felt drawn to the village, which was deserted in 1966. She wants to spend two weeks at the remote spot, taking photographs and finding inspiration for her writing.

"Japanese students are being taught how to speak the Queen's English by watching Downton Abbey DVDs and reading scripts from the hit show. The course in Iidabashi, Tokyo, has proved so popular that some pupils make a 600-mile round journey every week to lessons. The 90-minute classes came about after a Japanese national television station suggested the idea to the British Council – the body responsible for promoting British culture abroad. Hit: A Japanese television advert for Downton Abbey. The period drama has proved popular in Japan   prompting the British Council to start a language course where students watch episodes and read scripts . It was planned to coincide with the screening on the first series of Downton, which has only just aired in Japan. However, the course was oversubscribed within days, forcing the Council to hastily arrange a second set of classes to deal with the extra numbers. 'Japanese people are completely fascinated by the programme and the way the characters speak,' said English teacher, Sarah Greet, who works for the British Council. The course followed a Downton Abbey Night organised by the British Council and held in a Tokyo pub. Among the guests was the British ambassador to Japan, Tim Hitchins. Role models: The Downton language course has proved so popular that some students are reportedly making 600-mile round trips to attend the classes . 'The Japanese are fascinated by our old traditions. Afternoon tea is very popular here and there's a real trend for Harris tweet handbags, hats and accessories at the moment,' said Ms Greet. 'It's a very traditional society in Japan and they can relate to Downton Abbey's values and etiquette, as well as the opulence and lifestyle.' The Japanese students range in age from university students to pensioners in their seventies. They watch DVD's of the Edwardian drama and then act our scenes in English, using scripts provided by the TV company. The first series of Downton, which stars Maggie Smith as Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, was shown in Japan this year . 'It's noticeable that when they choose to play the posh characters, like Countless Violet, played by Dame Maggie Smith, their voices go up an octave. 'If it's Carson the butler, or Anna Smith the housemaid, their voices drop lower,' said Greet, who teaches one of the classes. 'They are aware that Britain is no longer like Downton but they still love that part of our culture, especially the politeness, our terms of address depending on rank, and the way food was served. 'I think they relate more to the people below stairs but they adore Countess Violet because she is hilarious and has all the killer lines.' Greet says her students are so motivated it's hard to get them to leave her classroom after a lesson. 'Quite a few of them have visited England and now they all want to go to Highclere Castle where the series is filmed.' Student Akiko Kinoshita, 26, an engineer from Toranomon, says she is a huge Downton fan: 'I don't have much opportunity to speak English and Downton is a really interesting show to watch. 'Sometimes the way the characters speak sounds too English and their accents are difficult to understand. Japanese people like the programme because it focuses on the life of different classes.' The council plans to start a new series of classes when the second season of Downton is screened in Japan in January. The British Council has also held a series of one-day workshops on Dr Who, Sherlock and traditional British food at Christmas.","The course in Iidabashi, Tokyo, is organised by the British Council .

"These horrific pictures show the aftermath of a high speed police car chase which somehow left only one person injured. The collision, in the early hours of this morning, saw a Mini collide with a VW Golf and a Mitsubishi before hitting a wall and flipping on to its roof, police said. Amazingly the only person hurt was the driver of the Mini, who was taken to hospital with a broken collar bone. Carnage: A Mini (pictured) driven by a 30-year-old woman hit a wall and flipped on to its side after colliding with a VW Golf and a Mitsubishi . This VW Golf, which is understood to have been parked at the time of the crash, was severely damaged . Officers chased the Mini after it was seen at speeds of 80mph while driving 'erratically and with no lights on' moments before the crash in the early hours of this morning in Oldham. It is understood that both the VW Golf and the Mitsubishi were parked when the Mini, driven by a 30-year-old woman, collided with them on Middleton Road in Chadderton. Police, ambulance and fire crews were scrambled to the scene at around 3.45am but the woman had freed herself by the time they arrived. She was breathalysed at the scene and taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. He added that the woman had not been arrested but may be summoned to a police station at a later date.

"A teenager who decided to teach a much younger boy a lesson by pushing him over in a park has been left with life changing injuries after a 30-strong mob took their revenge. Hsieh Feng, 18, is said to have pushed a 10-year-old boy over in a park in Kaohsiung city, southern Taiwan, because he was being rude. But what Hsieh had failed to realise was that the youngster was the son of a local gang boss, who did not take kindly to his pride and joy being beaten. Mob: The 30-strong gang hunted down Hsieh Feng, who had pushed their boss's son over in the park . Brutal: They found him outside a college in Taiwan, and started beating him with clubs and fists . Indeed, the boy's father Cheung Yu was furious when he heard what had happened, and immediately rounded up 29 thugs before setting off to find Hsieh. Cheung - dragging his son along to help identify the boy who beat him - quickly spotted the teenager standing alongside a row of motorbikes outside local college. He then ordered the mob to attack him, using clubs, bats and their fists. Hsieh was knocked to the ground, where the gang continued to beat him. They then dropped one of the nearby motorbikes on top of him. Video footage of the incident shows the teenager struggling to stand as the mob moves away, before he then collapses and is rushed to hospital. Medics said Hsieh suffered internal injuries including extensive damage to his kidneys, which doctors fear may never heal. Doctor Yul Ni said: 'It seems as if he will be on dialysis for the rest of his life.' Injuries: Hsieh ended up on the floor, and the gang then decided to drop a motorbike on top of him .

"A curry-mad couple longed for their favourite Indian takeaway so much that they had it delivered almost 500 miles to their new home. Whitney and Adam Gardner, from Crawley, Sussex, moved to Brittany eight months ago but complained that they couldn't find a decent takeaway in France. So they convinced their mothers to pick up orders of chicken dansak, pilau rice and Peshwari naan from Tarana Restaurant in Turners Hill before making the six-hour journey through the Channel Tunnel. Whitney and Adam Gardner from Pound Hill, Crawley at Tarana before they emigrated. They love the food so much that they had it shipped 500 miles to their new home in Brittany, France . The Indian takeaway orders are sent either fresh or frozen so they couple can enjoy their meal at their leisure . And the Indian restaurant's food is so popular that they have customers requesting for it to be flown over to Greece and even as far as Dubai. The couple relocated to Brittany to start their own fishery business and claim it is impossible to get a decent takeaway in France. Whitney, 27, said: 'It's a beautiful way of life over here, very relaxed and calm, but you just can't get the same food. 'There are kebab places but it's not the same thing. I don't think they [the French] have the taste for it. The couple's relatives pick up their orders before making the six-hour journey through the Channel Tunnel . Mr and Mrs Gardner are trying to convince the owner of their favourite restaurant to open a branch in France . 'We used to live in Pound Hill in Crawley and had our UK leaving party, and joint hen and stag dos in Tarana restaurant. We absolutely love the food.' The couple's strange demands are nothing new for Shah Jahan, who has been the manager of the restaurant in Turners Hill since it opened nearly six years ago. He has a customer who took a curry to their sister in Poitier, France, and even one who sent someone to pick up an order to take to Greece by private jet. A businessman in Dubai has offered Shah plane tickets to take their in-demand food abroad. Lorraine Gardener (right) and her sister Angela Shoubridge picking up the curry from Mr Jahan . Mr Jahan said: 'The guy in Dubai keeps asking for our recipes and asking if I'll take some food to him by plane. 'I'm originally from Bangladesh and my flights home always stopover in Dubai, so I told him the next time I go out there I'll bring him something. 'But I'm not going there just to deliver a takeaway. We don't even deliver to our Turners Hill residents, so it would be really unfair to deliver to someone in Dubai and not them.' On a recent trip, Mr Gardner's mother Lorraine popped in to grab the takeaway order before making the journey to visit the couple. The busy duo haven't had time to tuck into the meal yet and are saving it for a quiet evening when they can heat it up and enjoy it together. 'We keep joking with Jahan that he should come over and open an Indian takeaway in France,' Mrs Gardner said. 'Sometimes he sends it over fresh or frozen, depending on what we want. 'He'd bend over backwards for anyone.'","Whitney and Adam Gardner from Crawley moved to Brittany for business .

"Knock knock. Who's there? The last thing you'd expect is a two-and-a-half metre snake at your door. When a Queensland family discovered a carpet python slithering up the side of the back door outside their home, they were in for a big surprise. But snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home in Buderim on the Sunshine Coast on Thursday night. Two-and-a-half metre carpet python was found slithering up the side of the back door outside a Brisbane home . 'It brought a smile to my face when I saw him,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was awesome because normally pythons are found curled up behind someone's cupboard but this little fella was fully stretched out and reaching upwards across the brick wall. 'He was holding himself up by just the tip of its tail, which is something I hadn't seen before.' Earlier in the day, the homeowner spotted the reptile but he managed to move it to the back of the block and away from the property but he spotted it against the brick wall  shortly after 8pm. 'I'd imagine the male snake might have been trying to get into the roof because he caught a female snake's pheromone trail, which is a scent that females release.' Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the Sunshine Coast . The snake catcher was amazed at what he saw, that he took  to his Facebook business page and posted a joke after his catch. 'Knock knock, Honey I'm home!!! Imagine opening the door to this big fella. You might get a bit of a fright,' he posted on Facebook. 'If it made me smile I'm sure all you guys will love it too. Amazing animals. So strong.' Mr Gilbert runs his own business called Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week and has been catching snakes since the age of five. 'I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing them since I was little. And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them,' he said. When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance . Mr Gilbert has been quite busy during the summer season, saying he received 15 phone calls by Friday afternoon and catching and relocating seven of them from people's homes. After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild. 'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said. 'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.' Mr Gilbert, who owns the Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher, has been catching snakes since the age of five . When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance. 'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if its venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said. 'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us.'

"Chewing gun companies have been told they must contribute to the £60million bill to remove gum from Britain's streets. The appeal is issued today by the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales. It believes the chewing gum firms must stump up a 'substantial' sum of the costs to remove the 'plague on our pavements'. Town halls want firms to make a 'substantial' contribution to the £60m cost of removing gum from UK streets . LGA environment spokesman councillor Peter Box said: 'Chewing gum is a blight which costs councils a fortune to clean up and takes hours of hard work to remove. It's ugly, it's unsightly and it's unacceptable. 'The UK gum industry is a multimillion-pound business and we believe in the principle of the ""polluter"" paying. The chewing gum giants should be making a substantial contribution to help with the sterling work that councils are doing in removing it. 'Councils have no legal obligation to clear up the gum. They are doing the right thing but unfortunately the manufacturers are not. 'We acknowledge firms are contributing to litter prevention campaigns. However, given the size of the bill faced by councils in these tough economic times, this isn't cutting the mustard.' The problem of discarded gum is most acute in city centres - here workers scrape gum from Oxford Street . The average piece of gum costs about 3p to buy but around £1.50 - fifty times that price - to clean up, according to the LGA. Councils are also calling on producers to switch to a type which is biodegradable and easier to remove. The problem of discarded gum is most acute in towns and city centres. Westminster Council says almost three million pieces are dropped on the streets in the West End of London each year. Ed Argar, Westminster Council's cabinet member for city management, transport and infrastructure, said: 'Dealing with the sticky mess of discarded chewing gum on our streets swallows a huge amount of resources, in terms of both money and man-hours. 'Something needs to change if we are to find a real and lasting solution to the problem, rather than just dealing with the consequences.' Wrigley's said it was taking the issue of littered gum 'seriously' and urged people to dispose gum properly . Local authorities have tried a number of measures to tackle the problem of discarded gum. Hundreds of thousands of pieces of gum were removed from Manchester's streets in a £40,000 blitz, while other councils have brought in recyclable paper sheets to fold around gum and bins with anti gum-littering messages. Despite that, the LGA stressed it was not calling for a fresh 'gum tax', instead appealing for firms to show 'corporate responsibility.' Gum giant Wrigley said it 'takes the issue of littered gum very seriously'. A spokeswoman added: 'Wrigley is dedicated to tackling the issue of litter and will continue to support these and other initiatives that focus on achieving behavioural change amongst the few who continue to dispose of their waste irresponsibly.'","Local Government Association said chewing gum firms must help pay fee .

"It's not the size of your purse that reveals your shopping habits, but the size of your bra, according to new research. Ladies with a cup size of B or smaller tend to save their pennies, while more well-endowed women are more likely to splurge on luxury items, claims e-commerce group Alibaba. The Chinese group compared underwear sales on their site to the total amount spent and placed customers into five categories: low, slightly low, middle, slightly high, and high. Ladies with a cup size of B or smaller tend to save their pennies, while more endowed women splurge on luxury items, claims a new study . The data revealed only seven per cent of B-sized women buy in either of the 'high spending' categories. Around 17 per cent of C-sized are high spenders, D-sized women are at 24 per cent, and E-sized women are at 33 per cent. Overall, Alibaba found 65 per cent of women with a B-size cup fell into the 'low' spend category, while those of a size C or higher can be found mostly into the 'middle' or higher group. One reason for this may be that younger women with less disposable income are the ones buying smaller bras, according to Quartz. The high cost of speciality bras for well-endowed women may also have skewed the results. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, has made it into the world's 100 richest men . After his company's record-breaking entry into the U.S. stock market in November, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has made it into the world's 100 richest men. But before his stratospheric rise to wealth and power at the head of his company, an internet giant which dominates the Chinese online economy, Ma couldn't even make it into a chicken shop. The 50-year-old entrepreneur who founded Alibaba with a group of 17 friends in 1999, had humble roots in the city of Hangzhou, eastern China, where he taught English in a local school. But, hoping to better his lot in the early 1990s he applied, and was turned down for, a slew of other jobs, including with a KFC in the city. Ma's luck changed, however, when a job came up in 1995 which let him travel to the United States as a translator, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. While there he caught his first sight of a computer linked to the internet - which began a chain of events which would lead to him joining the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos in the ranks of those made fabulously wealthy by new technology. Today, Alibaba's value is just shy of £147 billion ($230 billion), putting it just above Procter and Gamble on the NYSE, and just below JP Morgan Chase. 'We've only seen the tip of the iceberg,' Alibaba Vice President Joseph Tsai told Quartz of the company's data-dive. 'We really haven't done even five per cent of leveraging that data to really make our operations more efficient, consumers more satisfied.' Singles Day, on November 11, triggered online sales totalling £6 billion ($9.3 billion) and revealed the data mining strength of the company. Alibaba turned Singles' Day into an online shopping festival in 2009. It copyrighted the 'Double 11' term three years later after recognising its commercial potential. 'You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer,' Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, said. Alibaba's founder Jack Ma claims that data mining is one of the company's priorities, a last year set up an 800-strong group of employees dedicated to analysing shopper statistics. The data revealed only seven per cent of B-sized women buy in either of the 'high spending' categories .","This is according to data from Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba .

"Unmasked: Security expert Brian Krebs has identified Andrew Hodiverski, pictured, as the operator of the underground online 'card shop' Rescator.la that has been selling millions of credit card numbers stolen from Target . The web security blogger who broke the news about the massive Target credit and debit card breach has identified a Ukrainian national who allegedly has been selling some of the stolen data on an online black market. In an article published this week on his site KrebsOnSecurity, blogger Brian Krebs laid out all the facts he has managed to gather about the suspected hacker, whom he identified as Andrey 'Andrew' Hodirevski. According to Krebs, Hodirevski, who goes by the user name 'Helkern' or 'Hel,' runs one of the premier underground 'card shops' on the web offering hacked credit cards numbers for sale. Rescator.la reportedly has been doing brisk business unloading millions of credit card numbers that had been stolen from Target customers across the country from mid-November to mid-December. Krebs also has managed to unearth a pair of photos allegedly portraying Hodirevski, including a selfie showing a dark-haired, clean-shaven man in his 20s. Another image, which was originally posted on a Russian hacking forum by Hodirevki's rivals, depicts a man identified as 'Helkern' emerging from a beat-up Range Rover painted with a Swastika, a star and the word 'peace' in Russian. The blogger was careful to point out that there is no evidence to suggest that Hodirevksi was behind the cyberheist that pulled 40million credit and debit card accounts from Targets' cash registers nationwide. Payback: This image of allegedly portraying Hodirevski, who goes by the user name 'Helkern', was posted online by rival hackers . Instead, Hodirevski/Helkern is suspected of selling numbers on his shadowy portal, Rescator.la, for as much as $100 a pop. Rescator is only one of several underground 'card shops' where the stolen data has been showing up, including Kaddafi.hk and cheapdumps.org. Krebs revealed that a day before publishing his expose, he had a brief online chat with the elusive Mr Hodirevski, this time using the moniker kaddafi.me, who offered him $10,000 not to run the story. 'I have no idea if Rescator/Helkern/Andrew was involved in hacking Target, but it’s a good bet that he at least knows who was,' Krebs wrote. As part of his extensive investigation, Mr Krebs scoured the darkest corners of the internet, as well some more mainstream social media sites, in search of information about the Ukrainian computer whiz. Shadowy figure: Krebs discovered that a user dubbed Helkern was one of three founders of the now-defunct hacking forum darklife.ws . Priorities: A profile from 2010 for Hodirevski included a list of goals he had in life, among them marrying his girlfriend, buying a $20,000 Toyota Solara, moving to Helsinki and 'world domination' The web security expert explained that it all started when he came across the user name Rescator and was able to link him to the person running the eponymous online black market that has been known to sell stolen Target accounts. The data theft, unprecedented in its scale, took place over a 19-day period that began the day before Thanksgiving. Target said that it identified and resolved the issue on December 15. It is thought hackers obtained the data by remotely installing software on 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores nationwide. After doing some research, Krebs found a comment posted by Rescator two years earlier bragging that he was 'Hel,' one of the three founders of the now defunct hacker forum darklife.ws. The trail then led Krebs to another Russian hacking forum, Cih.ms, which had been breached in 2009 by a rival group of hackers from darklife. In retaliation, the founders of Cih unmasked the people responsible for the hack, posting their photos and other personal information, including phone numbers, addresses and instant messaging logins. Among the half-dozen young men identified as the rogue hackers, a user by the name 'Helkern' was mockingly described as 'the man of the hour.' It was supposedly the illusive 'Helkern' pictured posing in front of a mirror and next to a defaced Range rover. Breach: It is thought hackers obtained credit and debit card data by remotely installing software on 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores nationwide . Krebs went to work collecting kernels of information about 'Helkern' online and came up with an instant messaging name, email address and several posts that linked the hacker to a town near Odessa, Ukraine. More sleuthing uncovered that Helkern's web address was registered to an Andrey Hodirevski. A LinkedIn profile for an Andrew Hodirevski, believed to be the same person, describes his profession as a web developer and administrator for the now-defunct hosting site called Ghost.ua based out of Ukraine. Brian Krebs also came upon a profile from 2010 for Hodirevski, in which the young man listed his goals in life: marrying his girlfriend, buying a $20,000 Toyota Solara, moving to Helsinki and ‘world domination.’ 'Will probably have to rob all banks in the word,' the user wrote.","Security blogger Brian Krebs identified Andrew Hodirevski, of Odessa, Ukraine, as one of people selling stolen credit card numbers .

This digital version is a 3D image that can be manipulated. As the electron beam traces over the object, it hits the surface and sends secondary electrons from this surface into unique patterns. A secondary electron detector attracts those scattered electrons and, depending on the number of electrons that reach the detector, registers different levels of brightness on a monitor. These patterns and images can be used to learn about the surface topography and composition. A secondary electron detector attracts those scattered electrons and, depending on the number of electrons, registers different levels of brightness on a screen. These patterns and images can then be used to learn about the surface topography and composition. The electon beam itself is controlled by a microscope, and the SEM creates a magnetic field using a scanning coil. By changing the voltage, experts are able to manipulate the strength and position of the beam. In this case, they used this to control the movement of the needle. The nanoscientists from Geneva-based Gillette worked with McLaren Mercedes on the project, and the car featured on the blade is the MP4-29. The autographs of F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen were also etched onto the surface. The team spent around 25 to 30 hours trying various different designs, sizes and ratios, to get the precise final result. Dr Christopher Parmenter, research officer in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy from the University of Nottingham was involved in the project. He said: 'This was a unique project because it was the first time I had ever tried to engrave a signature, or a Formula 1 car. 'I’ve never engraved a razor blade before.

Jenson Button said: 'The role of a racing driver is the management of high-precision performance - in a grand prix, finding the last millimetre on the track or the final thousandth of a second of laptime sometimes counts the most.

"A new report has found that young Australians are travelling farther, taking more trips abroad and receiving their passports at an earlier age than ever before. Expedia's State of the Nation study has found that young Aussies, in the 18-24-year-old age bracket, are more likely than any other age group to have taken an international or domestic holiday in the last two years. The report questioned 2,567 Australians aged 18 and older and found that a massive 83% of them plan to take an international holiday in the next 12 months. A new report has found that young Australians are travelling farther, taking more trips abroad and receiving their passports at an earlier age than ever before . The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age. This is a stark contrast to the average adult, who received their first passport at 17-years-old. Expedia 's State of the Nation study has found that young Aussies, in the 18-24-year-old age bracket, are more likely than any other age group to have taken an international or domestic holiday in the last two years . Currently more than half of the nation's youngsters aged 17 and under own a passport. 'More than any generation before them, young Australians are seizing every opportunity to see the world, explore new destinations, enrich themselves with cultural experiences and meet locals in different lands, said Georg Ruebensal, Managing Director Expedia Australia and New Zealand. 'They're travelling more and spending more than ever,' he said. Interestingly, metropolitan travellers have taken nearly one more international holiday in the past two years, than those living in the countryside. The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age . They are 20% more likely to take an international holiday in the next year, and 30% more likely to travel overseas at least once a year, than their country counterparts. 'Our data shows international air ticket prices have been declining by approximately 20% over the last three years, driven by low cost carriers and increased competition. 'Combine this with the rise in mobile device use, there is now more flexibility and choice than ever when planning and booking travel, and younger travellers are really taking advantage of this.' Mr Ruebensal said. The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age . The study also reveals that Aussie parents rate beach holidays as the number one choice for a family holiday. The Gold Coast has been rated as the number one domestic holiday destination in Australia for families with kids. The study also found that Australian kids, 17-years and under, are applying for their first passport at two-and-a-half years of age. Parents travelling with kids are more likely to include an overnight stopover when travelling abroad. When it comes to stopover destinations, Hawaii has been ranked as the place parents would most like to stay.","Young Australians are taking more trips abroad than ever before .

"A suspicious package has been destroyed at Fremantle Prison after a former inmate contacted police claiming a bomb had been hidden in the building 25 years ago. The bomb squad were called to the confinement block of the historic Perth prison on Tuesday, where the explosive device was unearthed from underneath the floorboards. It is suspected the bomb was being stashed away in conjunction with a thwarted mass break out planned in the 80s. A suspicious package has been destroyed at Fremantle Prison after a former inmate contacted police claiming a bomb had been hidden in the building 25 years ago . Western Australia police said the area was evacuated while the bomb was destroyed. Acting on the tip-off, police discovered a package, reportedly containing gelignite. While police refused to confirm where their information had come from, they did clarify that the bomb had been destroyed due to its age. The bomb squad were called to the confinement block of the historic Perth prison on Tuesday, where the explosive device was unearthed from underneath the floorboards . The former prisoner, who is still believed to be locked-up in another prison, told police he had been an inmate of the prison when the bomb was buried underneath the floor. The cell had been used as a solitary confinement unit when the prison was functioning, but was later renovated into an art supply and storage room. Speaking to the ABC, The prison's executive manager Bevan Beaver said the bomb was not a danger to the public, even though visitors were taken past the cell where the bomb was buried. It is suspected the bomb was being stashed away in conjunction with a thwarted mass break out planned in the 80s . 'They came down, investigated, found a substance, they buried it, and exploded it,' he said. 'They didn't want to take it away on precaution; they didn't know what it was so they just buried it. It was in a bag, they didn't uncover the bag, they just took [it] as it was, and buried it. It has been reported that the bomb may have been linked to the 1988 prisoner riots, where officers were overthrown and the prison was set on fire. The former prisoner, who is still believed to be locked-up in another prison, told police he had been an inmate of the prison when the bomb was buried underneath the floor . Fremantle Prison operated as a maximum for almost 140 years before it was decommissioned in 1991. Daily tours operate out of the prison and it is listed as as one of the top tourist attractions in Perth. Since opening to the public in 1992, the prison has seen over three million visitors walk through the doors.","A bomb hidden in a cell at Fremantle Prison 25 years ago has been destroyed .

"Chased: A burglar ran terrified from a home when he was chased away by a tiny Yorkshire Terrier (not photographed) Lions and tigers and Yorkies, oh my! A South African burglar was caught on surveillance camera trying to sneak into a house, instead he was chased away by a dog, facing his worst fear -- literally, as he has cynophobia, an abnormal fear of dogs. In an approximately 40 second video captured Nov. 13, the perpetrator is seen snooping around the backyard of a home. He goes out of frame for less than three seconds before bursting across the yard and over the wooden fence trying to get away from a tiny Yorkshire Terrier. The tiny terrier appears to be barking as he chases the man off of his territory. As the man clears the fence, the tiny dog is seen doing, what can only be described as, a victory spin. Yorkshire Terriers are typically between eight and nine inches tall and usually weigh between four and six pounds. OV reports that the burglar was arrested four days after the incident. The video has more than half a million views on YouTube and nearly one million views on Reddit, where it was originally posted. Scroll down for video . Snooping: The man is first seen snooping around the back yard of the home before leaving the frame .

"Louisiana has emerged as America's most corrupt state with the highest rate of convictions for people in public office, official figures revealed this week. The Southern state came top for public corruption convictions with nine per 100,000 population. Overall Louisiana convicted 403 public officials in the past ten years. The data was compiled by the Justice Department, covering the period from 2002 until 2011. Dirty politics: Edwin Edwards, 85, served four terms as Louisiana governor before being jailed for bribery and extortion. He married Trina, 34, in 2011 . Shady business: Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (right) and his attorney arrive at court in February. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of taking bribes and free trips in exchange for city contracts . Florida had the largest number of convictions in the ten-year period at 618 but Louisiana came out ahead per head of population, according to Business Insider earlier this week. The Southern State has been rocked by corruption in public office for decades. Perhaps the most infamous is former governor Edwin Edwards, who had four terms in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before serving time in federal prison for bribery and extortion over a scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses. On release from jail in 2011, the ex-con  launched himself as a reality TV star in a show called The Governor's Wife, following the 86-year-old and his 35-year-old wife Trina. It is due to air in the fall. The couple had their first son in August. The former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin is currently waiting for his trial to begin in October after he was charged with accepting more than $200,000 in bribes, . plus free trips and other gratuities in exchange for helping contractors . secure millions of dollars in work for the city. The charges against Nagin were the product of a City Hall corruption investigation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Nagin pleaded not guilty. Nagin was a political novice before he was first elected mayor in 2002, but Katrina turned him into a national figure with a reputation for cringe-inducing rhetoric. A 2013 indictment accuses Nagin, 56, of accepting more than $160,000 in bribes and truckloads of free granite for his family business in exchange for promoting the interests of Frank Fradella, a local businessman. Fradella pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit bribery and has been cooperating with federal authorities. The Dakotas - North and South - came in second and third place for corrupt public figures with Kentucky and Alaska close behind. The lowest conviction rates for public corruption are South Carolina, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Minnesota . and Utah - with 1 per 100,000 population. Corrupt public figures in Louisiana have littered the headlines in the past few years. Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin pleaded not guilty in February 2013 to charges he accepted more than $200,000 in bribes, plus free trips and other perks in exchange for helping contractors secure millions of dollars in work for the city. Charges included bribery, wire fraud and filing false tax returns. The charges against Nagin were the product of a City Hall corruption investigation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. It also resulted in guilty pleas by two former city officials, two businessmen and a prison sentence for a former city vendor. Nagin's trial is due to begin next month after months of delays. Perhaps the state's most infamous is Edwin Edwards  - who was governor four times in the 1970s, '80s and '90s - before being sent to federal prison for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s.

"The International Space Station will have its most female-heavy crew in years as when Italy's first female astronaut joins the vessel this weekend. Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, will launch into space from a facility in Kazakhstan this Sunday, where she will join Russian Elena Serova, who has been in orbit since September. It will only be the second time that two women have been on board the ISS at once, making the six-member crew one third female. Space-bound: Samantha Cristoforetti, posing above with the spacesuit she will wear, is Italy's first female astronaut . Companion: Elena Serova, a Russian, is already in orbit on the International Space Station. Cristoforetti's arrival will make the crew more women-heavy than it has been since 2010 . Cristoforetti's arrival will also bring a new first to space, as she will bring a specially-designed Italian espresso machine along with her. The so-called ISSpresso machine, which weighs 44lbs, is designed to work in zero gravity, and will be the first device of its kind outside the earth's atmosphere, the Guardian reported. A joint statement from coffee company Lavazza and space-food makers Argotec said Cristoforetti: 'will be not only the first female astronaut from Italy to go into space, but also the very first astronaut in the history of the conquest of space to savor an authentic Italian espresso in orbit'. She will take just 20 capsules with her, but more can be sent up if the machine proves popular. Cristoforetti's expedition has not been attended by looming questions of gender, unlike that of Serova, who found herself quizzed on her hair and make-up decisions by Russia media. Proud: Cristoforetti, 37, was a highly-decorated military pilot before she joined the European Space Agency . 'Space is what I do for work, and that's what I think about it: It's my work,' Serova said in a NASA interview before launch in late September. Russian reporters asked if she was taking up makeup and wondered how she would wear her hair during her six-month mission. Serova ignored the makeup question. As for her hairdo, she shot back: . 'I have a question for you — why don't you ask the question about Alexander's hair, for example,' she said, referring to crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev seated next to her at the news conference. 'I'm sorry, this is my answer. Thank you. More questions?' Both Serova and Cristoforetti will spend six months aboard the 260-mile-high complex, following in the footsteps of nine American women who logged lengthy stays. Two of those U.S. women shared the place in 2010, with four men. Another two women rose to station commander rank. Cristoforetti is the first woman assigned to a lengthy space station mission by the European Space Agency, which recently masterminded the Philae rover landing on a comet. Serova is one of only four Russian women to fly in space and the first to live at this space station. It was 1963 when Russia launched the world's first spacewoman, Valentina Tereshkova, beating America by two full decades, and 1984 when it flew the first world's female spacewalker, Svetlana Savitskaya. That's my ride: Cristoforetti, and her espresso machine, will be carried into space by a Russian Soyuz-FG booster rocket, pictured above at its launchpad in Kazakhstan . Serova and Cristoforetti's joint flight comes as U.S. medical researchers take an updated look at gender differences in space. With space station missions spanning a half-year and expected to last considerably longer on trips to Mars, NASA wants to make sure all astronauts — male and female alike — stay safe and healthy. This month, the Journal of Women's Health published a series of studies on the impact of gender on adapting to space. It turns out that women tend to suffer more faintness when trying to stand upon immediate return to Earth and also more vertigo, according to the report, and they appear to lose more blood plasma during spaceflight. Male astronauts seem to suffer more vision impairment due to intracranial pressure in orbit than women, although the difference is not statistically significant given the small number of subjects, researchers noted. There also are concerns about astronauts' reproductive health stemming from space radiation as well as weightlessness. 'Many questions remain unanswered,' the executive summary concluded. Dr. Saralyn Mark, an endocrinologist who serves as a government science adviser, said in an accompanying commentary that the findings can still be useful in shaping health-related policies and procedures. Mark and the other authors and researchers — representing NASA, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute in Houston and various universities — recommend that more women fly in space, and more astronauts of both genders participate as test subjects. That will be challenging given the overwhelming number of male astronauts. Of NASA's 43 current active astronauts, 11 are women.","Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, will join crew of ISS this Sunday .

A photo was uploaded on Friday of Sean Pollard with girlfriend Claire Oakford, captioned: 'Back home and doing as well as can be' Girlfriend Claire Oakford has been supporting Mr Pollard since the shark attack almost two months ago . Mr Pollard's family launched an appeal to help fund the 23-year-old's long road to recovery. A Facebook page was set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Mr Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation. The social media page has been frequently updated with Mr Pollard's condition - the most recent being the photo of him with his girlfriend and reporting that he's going back home to Bunbury, south of Perth. Funds will also be raised for The Sean Pollard Appeal at a silent auction and trivia night this Saturday night in Launceston, Tasmania. Items up for auction include wetsuits and framed images of surfers catching a wave. Sean Pollard's family have launched an appeal for his long road to recovery . Department of Fisheries examinations have revealed that the bite marks on Sean Pollard's surfboard would indicate a Great White shark was responsible for the attack . A facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay on WA's south coast on Thursday . Mr Pollard's appeal was established soon after WA fisheries revealed bite marks on the 23-year-old's surfboard, indicating a Great White shark was responsible for his injuries. The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts. Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday [the day of the attack] and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said. Surfer Sean Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia on Thursday . Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark . Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark . 'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.' 'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.' 'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley. WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety. 'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said. 'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials. Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible. Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident.

"One of Britain’s biggest hotel chains has removed Bibles from its rooms to avoid upsetting non-Christians. The decision by Travelodge has been condemned as ‘tragic and bizarre’ by the Church of England, which says Bibles in hotel rooms are important to provide hope, comfort and inspiration to travellers. But the chain, which runs 500 hotels, said the country was becoming increasingly multicultural and it had taken the action for ‘diversity reasons’. Scroll down for video . 'Tragic and bizarre': The Church of England says Bibles in hotel rooms provide hope and inspiration to travellers . It said the policy was implemented ‘in order not to discriminate against any religion’ – despite having had no complaints from guests. Bibles were taken away at the same time as a refurbishment of its rooms, removing drawers where they were kept. The Bibles, which were provided free by the Gideon Society, have been retained and are stored behind reception for guests to borrow on request, the company says. A Church of England spokesman said: ‘It seems both tragic and bizarre that hotels would remove the word of God for the sake of ergonomic design, economic incentive or a spurious definition of the word “diversity”.’ It seems not all Travelodges even have Bibles available on request. At the branch in Battersea, south London, there was no Bible in the room or behind reception. Hidden: The Bibles, donated by the Gideon Society, have been retained and are stored behind reception for guests to borrow on request, the company says . When requested, the receptionist could not find a copy and said no one had ever asked him for one in his four months of working there.Instead, he suggested using the hotel’s free wifi to ‘Google it and read it online’. When pushed for a hard copy, he rang his manager who told him they used to have them in rooms, but hadn’t had any at the hotel since refurbishment last year. But other hotel firms, including Britain’s largest budget hotel company, Premier Inn, and InterContinental Hotels, owners of the Holiday Inn chain, say Bibles are being retained at their hotels. A Premier Inn spokesman said: ‘Bibles are available in Premier Inn rooms. ‘On the rare occasion that a customer does not wish to have a Bible in their room, they can request this to be removed ahead of their stay by contacting the hotel directly.’ Upmarket hotel chain Millennium & Copthorne, which runs four-star hotels in areas including Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge, confirmed it still has Bibles in rooms and has no plans to remove them despite ‘welcoming guests from around the world’. Travelodge is the first national hotel chain to remove Bibles – although in 2012 one independent hotel, the Damson Dene Hotel in Crosthwaite, Cumbria, replaced them with the erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. A Travelodge spokesman said: ‘The reason is because of diversity. With the country being increasingly multicultural, we didn’t feel it was appropriate to just have the Bible because there are people of other religions. People were also taking Bibles away and with the redesign of the rooms, it was felt that it would be better to remove them.’ Another spokesman added: ‘In order not to discriminate against any religion, customers who would like a Bible can pick a copy from any one of Travelodge’s 500 hotel reception desks across the country, whilst staying at the hotel. To date, Travelodge has not received any customer feedback regarding this decision.’ They went on to say: ‘The removal of Bibles from . hotel rooms was a policy we decided upon in 2007 and has been gradually implemented . over the following years.’ The practice of placing Bibles in British hotel rooms originated with the Commercial Travellers’ Christian Association late in the Victorian era. The organisation was founded in 1888, with backing from the owners of biscuit manufacturer McVitie’s, and donated bibles to hotels around the country. In more recent years, the work was taken over by the Gideon Society, which distributes free Bibles in almost 194 countries worldwide. Members of the Gideon Society, an evangelical Christian organisation founded in the US in 1898, were inspired to give out free Bibles in hotel rooms after visiting Britain and seeing the Commercial Travellers’ Christian Association’s work. In the UK, the Gideon Society, whose income comes from donations and bequests from wills, still continues this mission – giving out free bibles to large institutions, including hospitals and prisons. Copies of the New Testament are also presented to school pupils, members of the armed forces, police, ambulance and fire services.","The chain, which runs 500 hotels, has made the move for 'diversity reasons'
Said country is becoming increasingly multicultural and Bibles 'discriminate'
Church of England condemned action, branding it 'tragic and bizarre'
Bibles are 'important to provide inspiration to travellers', they said .
The books donated by Gideon Society are now hidden behind reception ."
"Life-saving drugs could be available years earlier  under Government plans to overhaul ‘broken’ NHS rules. The time it takes for breakthrough drugs to be tested and cleared for use could be halved, ministers believe. Life sciences minister George Freeman said patients must 'get access to new life-saving drugs years faster than they do now. Not one or two years, but six or seven'. He promised that this would save hundreds of lives a year. New life-saving drugs can take up to 10 years to get tested and signed off for use on the NHS . The Department of Health said a fresh approach was being made possible by ground-breaking developments in medicine and digital technology. Officials said the review would examine how precision medicine and digital health technology could enable new products to be brought from the laboratory ‘as quickly and safely possible’. ‘This will transform the landscape of drug development,’ Mr Freeman told The Times. He added: ‘For too long NHS patients have seen drugs and innovations developed in the UK but not adopted here in our NHS. ‘We are determined to unlock the power of our NHS to be a test-bed for the 21st-century medical innovations we all need, getting NHS patients faster access, reducing the cost of drug development and boosting our life science sector.’ Life-sciences minister George Freeman said a fresh approach was being made possible by ground-breaking developments in medicine and digital technology . Among the issues the review will consider is how a more ‘collaborative’ approach between the pharmaceutical companies and the regulatory and evaluation bodies can can be developed to ensure innovative products are assessed more quickly. It will also look at whether charities and patient groups could play a greater role and what more could be done to promote the rapid adoption of important medical innovations into clinical practice. Lisa Brydon was given 12 months to live by doctors when she was diagnosed with brain tumours . A terminally-ill woman has slammed the NHS claiming they refuse to pay for her life-prolonging drug - but will still fund cosmetic surgery. Lisa Brydon, who was given 12 months to live by doctors when she was diagnosed with aggressive brain tumours, said it was unfair that the NHS is still funding non-emergency treatment rather than other ‘life and death situations’. An application from her specialist has three times been rejected, with a final appeal now pending - despite scans showing the drug has shrunk her tumours and significantly reduced her dependence on steroids, both improving her condition and saving the NHS money. Aggrieved Lisa, 43, has already paid £21,000 since July for the drug Avastin but she and her husband are rapidly running out of cash and are warning they face selling their house to fund it. Avastin has been previously given to several dozen brain tumour patients in Yorkshire by the Government’s Cancer Drugs Fund but funding was axed following the NHS re-organisation last year. Former triathlete Lisa said: ‘I feel aggrieved that I’ve paid for my own mini-trial to see if this drug will work. I’ve shown it has worked and is working and nobody is listening to us. ‘The NHS is still funding non-emergency treatment such as cosmetic surgery, compared with my case and others which are life and death situations - it seems unfair.’","Time  for breakthrough drugs to be tested and cleared could be halved .

"A shocking photo have emerged of a bloodied brown bull mastiff with an arrow sticking out of its chest while a vet looks  at the terrible injury. The dog, four-year-old Zeta, reportedly strayed onto the property of a New Zealand police officer who shot the dog with an arrow. The police officer has reportedly confessed to the incident which happened in Whakatane in the eastern Bay of Plenty, 90 km east of Tauranga and 89 km north-east of Rotorua, reports Stuff.co.nz. This is the shocking image of four-year-old Zeta with the arrow in his chest at the vets . Zeta's owner Jess Wallace said: 'He walked straight in the door – which we thought was weird [because he's strictly an outside dog] – and fell on the floor in front of us and the arrow was sticking out of him.' The incident happened last Wednesday and three days later a police officer came forward to claim responsibility. Miss Wallace and vet Travis Baxter who looked at Zeta were reportedly shocked to know that a police officer was responsible for the act. The incident happened in Whakatane in the eastern Bay of Plenty in New Zealand . She added: 'It is not the behaviour you would expect from someone who's supposed to be an upstanding member of the community. 'It is a bit of a shame. Whether he (the dog) was doing something he shouldn't; whether he was on their property or not – that's why the council provides the dog control service,' reports stuff.co.nz. New Zealand Police confirmed a criminal and employment investigation was underway. Vicki Barnard, Whakatane SPCA president, said it was unacceptable for anyone to shoot an animal and branded the incident 'appalling'.

"The FBI arrested two men in connection with a gun plot in Ferguson days before a grand jury is expected to decide whether officer Darren Wilson should be indicted for shooting dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, it has emerged. Detectives detained Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Davis after the pair allegedly plotted to distribute illegally purchased firearms in the city marred by violent conflict and racial divides, according to court documents seen by CBS. It came days before President Barack Obama issued an appeal to the people of Ferguson to remain calm as unrest that has lasted more than three months shows no sign of waning. Scroll down for video . Approaching the verdict: Protesters surround a crashed car in Ferguson awaiting the grand jury verdict . Eerie: Witnesses have described an ominous atmosphere is the atmosphere amid the protests . Anger: Protests again alleged police racism in Ferguson following Michael Brown's shooting have spread across the US, with mock lynchings staged in Washington (pictured) as the grand jury verdict approaches . Not waning: Protests calling on Officer Darren Wilson to be indicted have lasted more than three months . Unrest: 100 FBI agents have been sent to Ferguson to prepare for unrest following the grand jury verdict . Arrest: A demonstrator is led away in Ferguson late last night after protests outside the town's police station ahead of a grand jury decding on whether to indict officer Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown . Police arrest a demonstrator (pictured) protesting. A grand jury is expected to decide this month if Wilson should be charged in the shooting . Anger was high - on Thursday it emerged Wilson has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department . The FBI has sent nearly 100 additional agents to the Missouri city to help law enforcement there as officials prepare for possible outbursts of violence when the jury decision is announced. The National Guard is also in force and hordes of civil rights lawyers are making their way to the city, while a number of schools are preparing to close for fear of dangerous clashes. Protesters in Ferguson have been threatening to rape the wives of front line police and kill their children during the latest clashes, the wife of one officer has claimed. A grand jury has been meeting for weeks to hear evidence on the incident and expect to reach a conclusion in the next few days. Authorities fear the result could refresh violent protests across the city which have shown no sign of waning since the shooting on August 9. Protests over the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown more than three months ago have spread across the US. Today, as Ferguson braces itself for an imminent decision on whether gunman Officer Darren Wilson should be indicted, demonstrators in Washington (right) staged mock lynchings, in reference to the alleged racism of American police. In a desperate plea for calm, Obama told ABC News in an interview on Friday that using any event as an excuse to carry out violence is unacceptable. 'I think first and foremost, keep protests peaceful. 'This is a country that allows everybody to express their views, allows them to peacefully assemble, to protest actions that they think are unjust,' Obama said. 'But using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law, contrary to who we are.' Demonstrations resulting in hundreds of arrests have broken out across the US in the last three months. Shooting: Unarmed black teen Michael Brown (left) was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson (right) in August . The moment: This image shows Officer Wilson standing over Brown's body which was left for four hours . Appeal: President Barack Obama said protesters should not use the shooting as an excuse for violence . An unnamed woman said that her husband, a police officer, has been 'screamed at' as he faced off with the angry crowds amid heightened tensions in the suburb of St Louis, Missouri. She told Fox 2 News that they threatened a home invasion in an apparent attempt to provoke the officers. The wife claimed the protesters said: 'We're going to go to your house. We're going to rape your wives then we're going to kill them and we're going to kill your children'. The allegations comes after many police officers' families in Ferguson, Missouri, were reported to be in hiding or running from town amid death and assault threats. One police wife told KTVI that she's received threats over the phone and she's been paranoid for her and her young daughter's safety ever since. 'Did they follow me here?' she told the station. 'Did I do a good enough job after work today of taking different routes, on my way home?' St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman alluded to the abuse in his latest press release on the three arrests made on Thursday night. He wrote that 'several vocal and defiant protesters arrived chanting derogatory phrases'. They also made 'insulting personal verbal attacks on officers', he said. Tensions are rising in Ferguson as a grand jury decides whether to charge white Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18. In one recent message, a caller says: 'Would you rather hear me coming out, coming out and robbing your house? And it would be like, it'd just be like silence man, you couldn't hear nothing.' 'It's very frightening,' said the police wife, who asked to not be identified. 'Most people who have a family member who's a police officer are very proud of what they do.' She added: 'This is real and people actually do know how to find us and they do want to harm us.' The police wife says some officers' relatives have been leaving town to protect themselves — but she plans on staying. 'I'm very worried about what's going to happen to the citizens and what's going to happen to the businesses and what's going to happen to the police officers,' she told KTVI. 'This is a good community with a long history and they love their community.' The unrest has highlighted severe racial divides in Ferguson where the predominantly African American city is patrolled by a majority white police force. Law enforcement: State, county and local police are all present in Ferguson where there were clashes last night and tensions remain high . Violence: Hundreds of people have been arrested in Ferguson during protests over racial divides in St Louis . A U.S. official said on Friday that the agents will supplement the law enforcement presence in the next few days as a number of schools prepare to close down for fear of violence. The official was not authorized to discuss the FBI plans by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. About a dozen protesters gathered again outside the police station in Ferguson in frigid conditions Thursday night, sometimes blocking vehicles as they waved placards and chanted 'Whose streets? Our streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!' Officers in helmets and shields were deployed after a commander told protesters not to block traffic. Brief scuffles broke out and at least one woman and a man were handcuffed and taken away. Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested. Wilson's camp has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department. Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting. 'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said. Meanwhile, Wilson may announce  his plans to resign from the force before the verdict, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting. Obama's comments on the unrest came after Brown's father and Attorney General Eric Holder also made separate appeals. 'Thank you for lifting your voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation, but hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' the victim's father, Michael Brown Sr, said in a somber video plea. Escalated: Teargas has been thrown between the majority black protest groups and majority white police . Clashes: Police can be seen breaking up a fight between protesters as a grand jury decision is imminent . Angered: The shooting provoked hundreds to speak out about racial divides and discrimination in St Louis . 'No matter what the grand jury decides, I don't want my son's death to be in vain.' In the United States, grand juries meet in secret to review some cases before deciding whether criminal charges should be brought. The jury could indict Wilson, meaning he could face trial, or determine there is no case for him to answer. Authorities have previously said they expect the grand jury decision any time between mid- to late-November. Holder, America's top law enforcement official, released a video urging restraint from his subordinates if people take to the streets. 'Over the past few months, we have seen demonstrations and protests that have sought to bring attention to real and significant underlying issues involving police practices, implicit bias and pervasive community distrust,' Holder said. 'This is the hard work that is necessary to preserve the peace and maintain the public trust at all times, particularly in moments of heightened community tension.' Distraught: Brown's parents Lesley and Michael have encouraged people to continue raising their voices . Support: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (left) has enlisted the National Guard to patrol the streets as Attorney General Eric Holder (right) released a video urging his subordinates to exercise restraint in St Louis . Brown, a high-school graduate planning on attending technical college, was shot at least six times by Wilson. His body was left in the street for hours. Wilson has reportedly told the grand jury he acted in self-defense after tussling with the youth. Others claim Brown had his hands up in the air when he was shot. Some demonstrators complained that police used undue force during peaceful protests and there was widespread criticism of the military-style equipment and uniforms deployed by local officers. In his video plea, Brown's father appealed to locals to come together. 'We're stronger united. Continue to lift your voices with us and let's work together to heal, to create lasting change for all people regardless of race,' he said.","Grand jury expected to decide whether to indict Officer Wilson this week .

The National Weather Service has already reported a tornado touched the ground during the afternoon near the town of Perkins in northeast Oklahoma. A second tornado from the same storm system was reported near Ripley. Both twisters were in rural areas and didn't seem to cause significant damage.

"Sacked: David Lowe, who has 32 years' service with the BBC, lost his job for playing The Sun Has Got His Hat On . The BBC was accused of ‘appalling’ double standards last night after forcing a veteran DJ to quit after he innocently played an old version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On which featured the ‘N’ word. David Lowe was ordered by bosses to ‘fall on your sword’ – even though Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson kept his job when he appeared to mumble exactly the same racist term. Mr Lowe lost his job after playing a 1932 version of the song, performed by Ambrose & His Orchestra, on his Sunday night golden oldies show on BBC Radio Devon. Unknown to Mr Lowe, a popular presenter who has spent 32 years with the BBC, the secondverse features the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming back to do the same to you.’ The BBC took action after just one listener complained to say he was ‘horrified’ by what he heard. But last night the Corporation faced a storm of protest over its treatment of the 68-year-old host, who had immediately offered to apologise on air when he realised his ‘genuine error’. Friends and colleagues rallied to his support, while fans used Twitter to express their incredulity. Roy Corlett, Mr Lowe’s former boss at BBC Radio Devon, said: ‘To end David’s career in this way when Clarkson was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling. It is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee. You couldn’t wish to meet a nicer man.’ And another former Radio Devon station manager, John Lilley, added: ‘It is a tragic end to a 32-year career with the BBC. I think what they did to David was disgraceful. He is a lovely man and has long been known to his colleagues as the Gentle Giant.’ Mr Lowe played a 1932 version of the son, performed by Amrbose & His Orchestra, on a Sunday night golden oldies show . Rejecting Mr Lowe’s offer to apologise, BBC executives instead tried to silence him saying: ‘We prefer that you don’t mention anything about last week’s broadcast.’ Then they asked if they could announce that he wanted to leave to ‘pursue other interests’. But unwilling to cover up the incident, Mr Lowe refused, and was pointedly ignored when he repeated his desire to apologise to his listeners. Finally, Emma Clements, BBC Devon’s acting editor, wrote to him saying: ‘I agree you have acted properly throughout and we are grateful for both your apology and your appreciation of the seriousness of the situation. 'But regrettably, I think we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword to resolve this situation.’ Support: Mr Lowe tweets the news of his sacking, and fans back him in their own words . In contrast, Mr Clarkson, who has a history of making offensive remarks on air, was let off without even a suspension. Yesterday it emerged that Mr Clarkson was saved from disciplinary action by the intervention of director-general Tony Hall. Yesterday lunchtime – after being contacted by The Mail on Sunday – the BBC appeared to undergo an abrupt change of heart over Mr Lowe. It said in a statement that the situation ‘could have been handled better’ adding: ‘We have offered David Lowe the opportunity to continue presenting his Singers And Swingers show, and we would be happy to have him back on air.’ Contrast: Mr Clarkson, pictured above using the 'N' word in an unused scene in Top Gear, was not sacked . At this stage, though, Mr Lowe had not been offered his job back. ‘It’s news to me,’ he said during an interview at his Torquay home. It was to be another two hours before he was called by the BBC with their offer. The lyrics to The Sun Has Got His Hat On have been changed several times since Noel Gay (below) and Ralph Butler wrote the original in 1932. It was composed for the musical Me And My Girl and first recorded by the Henry Hall BBC Dance Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing. The second verse went: ‘He’s been tanning n*****s out in Timbuktu, Now he’s coming back to do the same for you.’ Jonathan King, who was jailed in 2001 for sexually abusing teenagers in the 1980s, covered the song in 1971. He changed the lyric to: ‘He’s been tanning negroes in Timbuktu.’ More recent versions have changed it to: ‘He’s been roastin’ peanuts out in Timbuktu’ or just ‘shining brightly out  in Timbuktu’. But he said he was going to turn them . down as the stress caused by the row had aggravated his dystonic tremor . condition, a permanent shake. ‘These events have taken their toll on my disability and I have to put my health first,’ he said: ‘I will say thank you but respectfully decline.’ Ironically, the row was triggered by Mr Lowe being sensitive to the possibility that a requested song might cause offence. A woman from Cornwall wanted him to play Abdul Abulbul Amir – which featured in an Whitbread beer advert in the 1980s. But Mr Lowe was concerned that it mentioned the Prophet Muhammad and, after speaking to his producer, decided to play The Sun Has Got His Hat On instead. ‘I thought I’d avoid the earlier request and play it safe,’ he said. ‘It’s so ironic that I’ve ended up in a bigger trap of my own making. ‘When I was told about it on Facebook, I thought, “Goodness gracious me”. My heart was in my mouth. 'I must have played the song half a dozen times over the years and I’ve never heard the ‘N’ word. I said to the person who told me about the song that political correctness will be the death of me. ‘Twenty-four hours later, all hell broke loose. I don’t have issues with my colleagues but I do have issues with a repressive system that encourages wholly disproportionate reactions to innocent errors of judgment. 'It is quite topical at the moment with Jeremy Clarkson although I didn’t actually say the word. Would it be different if I was Clarkson? I don’t know. ‘It was a genuine error on my part, the first in 32 years. But given today’s unforgiving obsession with political correctness I have been compelled to pay a heavy price.’ The BBC said last night: ‘At a local level, we got it wrong and we have offered Mr Lowe his job back.’ Uncensored: Jay Z in concert . Many hit songs – often by rap artists – contain the ‘N’ word, but BBC producers usually use edits which censor the word. However, the BBC website is full of videos of artists using the term at live shows. Jay Z and Kanye West performed N****s In Paris [the offensive word spelled with an ‘a’ rather than ‘er’] at Radio 1’s Big Weekend in Hackney, London, in 2012 which aired live on BBC Three. The online video features the stars using the N-word repeatedly without censorship. And last year, BBC 6 Music was criticised for editing the line ‘one less white n*****’  from Elvis Costello’s Oliver’s Army. BBC editorial guidelines say: ‘Strong language [should be] used only where it is editorially justified.’ After more than 32 years of programme-making, I have hung up my headphones for the last time. Why? Because I made a silly mistake. [And] where political correctness is concerned there is no room for excuses or forgiveness. That said: let me stress here, I have no quarrel with anyone at the BBC in the West and South West. However, I do have issues with a repressive system that encourages wholly disproportionate reactions to innocent errors of judgment. On April 27, I featured an 82-year-old recording [which] includes one of today’s ‘forbidden’ English language expressions… the ‘N’ word! You’ve got to listen very carefully to hear it but, yes, it is there on the recording. 'An honour': Mr Lowe explained his 'silly mistake' to his listeners online after he was stopped from doing so on air . I was alerted to my error by BBC management who had, in turn, received a complaint from a listener, who, suffice it to say was ‘horrified’ by what he heard, and added, ‘I hope that someone in authority will deal with Mr Young appropriately.’ (He referred to me as David Young throughout).  I know of no other complaint. Nevertheless, I admitted my mistake; apologised to my managers, and offered to apologise to the listeners. Alternatively, I offered to fall on my sword. A series of emails ensued. In the end, the BBC wrote to say, ‘Regrettably… we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword.’ Sadly, many thousands of BBC listeners have now been deprived of a programme they came to look forward to. This regrettable episode provides proof of the damaging effect political correctness in all its pernicious forms is having on British society. Sorry folks, but I made a stupid mistake and I was left with no other option. It has been an honour to entertain you.","David Lowe, 68, gave 32 years of service to the BBC as a local broadcaster .

"Lorry drivers have been ordered not to stop within 130miles of Calais to try to prevent migrants clambering aboard in a desperate bid to reach Britain. Haulage firms have told truckers that taking a break for a rest, to eat or refuel close to the port risks stowaways sneaking on to their vehicles before they cross the Channel. More than 2,500 illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, are massing in shanty towns around the French city’s freight terminal in the hope they can smuggle on board UK-bound wagons. By law, lorry drivers must take a 45-minute break every four-and-a-half hours. Scroll down for video . Truckers have been told that taking a break close to the port of Calais risks stowaways sneaking aboard their vehicles . Now MPs have been told transport companies are advising truckers take it well away from Calais so they do not make themselves a sitting duck for determined illegal migrants who are prepared to die to get to Britain. Transport chiefs revealed the measures during a hearing of the Commons’ Home Affairs Select Committee, which is investigating the crisis. Peter Cullum, head of international affairs at the Road Haulage Association, said: ‘We have members who will not let their drivers stop within 200km of Calais. ‘Most of our members are telling their drivers to park as far away from Calais as possible so that when they get nearer the port they don’t need to stop.’ A shanty town near the French city. More than 2,500 illegal migrants are massing in shanty towns in hope of getting to the UK . Britain has pledged £12million to help the French tighten security at the terminal. Much of the money is being spent on moving the 9ft-high fences which guarded world leaders at the recent Nato summit to Calais. Calais’s mayor Natacha Bouchart has said migrants were desperate to reach Britain to claim benefits, because they believed it was like El Dorado, the mythical lost city of gold. But the UK Chamber of Shipping told MPs that stowaways found on Dover-bound ferries pleaded to be sent back to France, because they did not want to get caught up in the asylum system in the UK. Instead, they wanted to have another go at sneaking into the UK ‘out of sight’ of the authorities so they could work illegally in the black economy. Under British rules, asylum seekers are barred from working.","Truckers taking a break near port risk migrants sneaking aboard .

"A Brit with a condition which causes tumours to grow all over his face is set to star in a new music video after impressing the director with his performance alongside Scarlett Johansson in one of 2013's best films. Adam Pearson, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis, caught the eye of Slovak director Andrej Kolencik with his appearance in sci-fi film Under The Skin. Kolencik was so impressed, he pulled out all the stops to get Pearson, 29, over to Slovakia so he could star in popular Slovak rock band Ciste tvary's latest music video. Star: Andrej Kolencik (right) sought out Adam Pearson (left) after seeing his performance in Under The Skin . Hit: Pearson appeared alongside Scarlett Johansson, pictured here together in the 2013 film . Fairytale: Pearson played the main character in the video for Slovak rock band Ciste tvary . Kolencik revealed: 'I had not known him before Under the skin. 'I watched the movie when we were preparing the music video and looking for a main character and we felt it was just perfect.' The award-winning film director and visual artist said they managed to contact him through social media to ask him if he wanted to do the job. The Slovak director had no big expectations - so was absolutely delighted when Pearson agreed. He said: 'To be honest I only really started to believe it when I saw that Adam and his agent had agreed.' The director, 30, needed ten actors for the yet-to-released music video, described as a dark fairytale. He said: 'Adam stars as one of criminals sentenced to death and he and the other criminals to walk through woods to a public execution.' Locations: The video was shot in a village in north-western Slovakia, and in a studio in Bratislava (pictured) Make up: Pearson gets ready to go on set, where the actors were telling a 'dark fairytale' Delighted: 'He is very humble but also very professional,' said Kolencik after working with Pearson, pictured here with staff and the other members of the cast . The video was filmed in woods near the town Malacky, in the north west of Slovakia, and in a film studio in Bratislava. Pearson, who had the starring role, also had to lie in snow and is later seen kissing a fairy. 'The co-operation with Adam was great,' Kolencik said. 'He always tried to give his maximum. He is very humble but also very professional. 'In the movie Under The Skin he played the part really well and it was likewise in our video, we got exactly what we wanted.' Adam Pearson has been an outspoken campaigner for people with facial disfigurement for a number of years. Pearson's condition, which affects one in every 2,300 people and which causes non-cancerous tumours to grow on nerve tissue, has left him acutely aware of the way people perceive him - and how he is potrayed in the media. Before he appeared in Under the Skin, he starred in Channel 4 documentary Beauty and the Beast: The Ugly Face of Prejudice, which tackled the problem of prejudice head on. Writing for the Daily Mail  last year, he said he would love to play a Bond villain - but only if he was evil for the way he behaved, and not the way he looked. 'It would be an opportunity to raise the profile of people like me who have a condition that affects their appearance,' he said. 'What I hope I can do is help to create a society where grown-ups don’t hold these immature, naive prejudices.'","Adam Pearson got a starring role in rock band Ciste tvary's new video .

"The mother of the Boston Marathon blast suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, says it is impossible that her two sons were responsible for the violent events this week and insists the brothers have been setup by the FBI. Zubeidat Tsranaeva, who lives in Russia, said on Friday that her sons were innocent, while their father screamed and yelled in a separate interview in defense of the brothers. 'They never could have done this. Never, ever, ever!' said their father Anzor Tsamaev who lives in an area of Russia called Makhachkala. Scroll down for video . In defense: The suspect's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, left, is staunchly defending her two sons. Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, right, similarly said his two sons are not to blame for the Boston attacks . He also said that he believes that his . sons were set up, and without going into specifics, he said that if his . younger son was killed once he is found, then he would see it as proof . that there was a conspiracy afoot. 'If they killed him, then all hell would break loose,' he said to ABC News. 'If they kill my second child, I will know that it is an inside job, a hit job. The police are to blame.' In a surprising twist, he said that he spoke to both of his sons just yesterday, days after the two bombs killed three and injured more than 180 people at the Boston marathon on Monday. The boys told him: 'Everything is good, Daddy. Everything is very good.' When asked what he would say to his . living son, he said: 'Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead . of you. Come home to Russia.' The boys' mother, Zubeidat, echoed those sentiments, similarly accusing the FBI of setting up the boys in a Friday interview with RT America. She said her older son, Tamerlan, became religious five years ago and claimed he had been spotted as a 'leader' in the movement and was being watched by the FBI. 'My two sons are really innocent and I know neither of them have never, never talked about what they're saying about them now,' she said. Trying to understand: Anzor Tsarnaev said that he could not believe that his sons were behind the fatal bombing . In sync: Both Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife, Zubeidat, alluded to the existence of a conspiracy involving police or FBI meant to frame their innocent sons . Suspect: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, now 19-years-old, is seen in these two pictures that were released by authorities . Zubeidat described the boys as very communicative and said they called her often, telling her everything that was going on in their lives. 'I know my son never spoke about those things. I am a mother, I raised them.' 'My oldest son used to tell me everything. He used to call me and ask me ""how are you mama?"" Both of them, ""mama we love you, mama how are you, we miss you.""' 'My sons would tell me. My son would never keep it a secret. If there is anyone who would know, it would be me.' The father has openly discussed the family's situation with the media. 'I feel terrible! Why they kill my son? Something wrong! My sons never do bombing. They hated guns – how they do bombs?' the boys father told People. 'I talked to my sons yesterday, both of them. We talked about the bombing. I was worried about them, they said they were okay.' The first suspect- identified by . officials as 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev- was shot and killed during a . firefight with police but his younger brother Dzhokhar was able to . escape and remains on the run. He went on to say that they were good kids with 'big dreams'. 'I am very depressed. How am I going . to live? Never I think in my mind this happen. My sons hate people who . do bombs, they hate terrorists. Why they kill my son? And where is my . other son? They have time to catch my other son, not kill,' he said. 'Deserved to die': An uncle of the first suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) said his nephew was a 'loser'. The second suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) remains on the run . Earlier on Friday, Anzor talked to the Associated Press, calling Dzhokhar 'a true angel'. 'Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.' Back in the day: Dzhokhar's friends from high school paint a portrait of him being quiet but well-liked, one even saying that he was a 'class clown' The siblings' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, gave an interview to the English-language Russian news channel RT America, insisting that her sons are '100 per cent innocent,' and that they have been framed. 'This is a set up, my son would never ever carry out such terror attack,' she said Friday. She went on to say: 'FBI knew everything what my son was doing, told me he was serious leader, that they were afraid of him.' Mrs Tsarnaeva went on to say that Dzhokhar was raised in the US and insisted that 'no one ever talked about terror' in their house. That favorable picture of the . 19-year-old and 26-year-old bombing suspects comes in stark contrast to . what one of their uncles recalled. An uncle of the Boston bombing suspect who died early Friday morning said that he was a 'loser'. Rather than being upset about his . nephew's death, their uncle Ruslan Tsarni who lives in Maryland called . Tamerlan a 'loser; and said that he 'deserved' his death this morning. Initial . reports say that he was strapped with an explosive when the shoot out . began in the early hours of Friday morning, though it still remains . unclear whether he died because the explosive or because of a gunshot. He was declared dead within ten minutes of being taken to a local hospital. 'I wish they never existed,' Mr Tsarni, who lives in Maryland, told local Boston station WBZ. Ruslan Tsarni said that the brothers had lived in America for nearly decade since traveling from Chechnya in Russia. He . had not spoken to the boys since 2009 and said that he did not . recognize them when he saw the photos released by the FBI on Thursday . evening. 'I'm wordless... shocked,' Mr Tsarni said. 'They do not deserve to exist on this earth.' Ruslan called Tamerlan a 'loser', he described his younger nephew Dzhokhar as a quiet kid. The boys' aunt, Maret, is a surgeon who . lives in Canada. She used to be in Chechnya and her acts as a . battlefield surgeon are described in a book. 'This is a huge tragedy for the family. My brother’s two boys, they are growing up so fast,' she told The Toronto Sun. Unconvinced: Maret Tsarnaeva, the aunt of the two suspects, said that she could not believe the news . The devastation: Ms Tsarnaeva, who lives in Toronto, Canada, holds up a picture of the bombing . 'My first reaction is, ‘Why the hell . would they do this?’ But when I go through all the material, it’s not . giving anything... the whole world is now making a decision (on them) now by just seeing these pictures and not having anything else.' She told how her older brother Anzor had high expectations for his children, especially his older son Tamerlan. Anzor was disappointed when he heard that Tamerlan, who was killed in a shoot out early Friday morning, had dropped out of college, but she thought that he had a happy life. 'Within the family, everything was perfect,' she said. One hint of tension that she did reveal, however, was that Tamerlan 'seemingly did not find himself yet in America, because it's not easy.' She said that the 26-year-old became a devout Muslim 'but just recently, maybe two years ago, he started praying five times a day.' 'He has a wife in Boston and from a Christian family, so you can't tie it to religion,' Maret told reporters. The FBI has cordoned off the three-story brick building where the bombers' sister lives in West New York, near Union city in . New Jersey. Unexpected: Friends and former classmates are painting a portrait of a normal young boy who went to parties and had friends . The New Jersey Star Ledger . spoke to her earlier in the day and she said that she has not been in frequent contact with either of them. 'They were great people. I never would have expected it. They are smart– I don’t know what’s gotten into them,' she said. When . asked if she was okay, she said: 'No I’m not okay– no one is okay right . now. I’m hurt for everyone who has been hurt. I’m sorry for all the . people who are hurt and for all the people who lost their lives.' Several . former classmates described Dzhokhar as a friendly, smart kid, and they . said they were shocked that he was part of the pair who killed three . and injured more than 180 in the marathon bombings on Monday. An unidentified friend told CNN that he 'hung out, went to parties, smoked some weed... its not like he's some foreign dude'. A different uncle, Alvi Tsarni, who lives close by in Boston was visibly upset when he spoke about his nephews. 'I don't believe any of my nephews are involved in this horrible incident,' Alvi Tsarni told the Boston CBS affiliate WBZ. 'If he did this I'm sorry too. It's crazy, it's not possible. I can't believe it. Who can do this stuff?'","The father of Boston marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev spoke from his home in Russia .

"Former Labor leader Mark Latham has faced a torrent of criticism after he penned a bizarre attack on mothers who take anti-depressants, labelling it the 'easy way out'. In his regular Australian Financial Review column on Thursday, Latham took aim at a Sydney writer who confessed to using 'caffeine and anti-depressants' to help raise her two young children. 'Why do people like this have children in the first place?' he wrote, referring to medical student Lisa Pryor. 'How will children feel when they grow up and learn that they pushed their mother onto anti-depressants?' Scroll down for video . Mark Latham (pictured) wrote a controversial column where he said 'left feminists hate children' Latham was widely pilloried for his remarks, in which he said mums who take anti-depressants were 'taking the easy way out' Latham, who came within a polite handshake of becoming prime minister, was widely pilloried for his statement, which focused upon why 'left feminists demonise children'. Describing inner-city feminists, Latham said: 'More often than not, they don’t like children and don’t want to be with them.' He said taking pills was a 'cowardly' alternative to 'facing up to the responsibilities of adulthood' and described his children as his own 'anti-depressants'. Writer Clementine Ford's retort to Latham was widely shared . Author Tara Moss questioned whether Latham should be 'given a platform for attacking working mums' 'Oh boy... The man must have a death wish': Industrial relations expert Grace Collier reacted to Latham's column . Columnist Mia Freedman said Latham's column was an 'extraordinarily irresponsible and repugnant attack on women, on mothers and on anyone who seeks help for mental illness'. 'Mark Latham’s column is a piece of bile that should never have been published,' she wrote on women's website Mamamia. 'It shamefully and cruelly annihilated Lisa Pryor, chastising her as a bad mother, a bad feminist and a bad human being.' Feminist group Destroy the Joint said Latham's was making 'sweeping generalisations' and described him as a 'loser'. At the 2010 Federal election, Latham confronted the nation's political leaders as a reporter for 60 Minutes . While Latham confronted Tony Abbott, pictured, Prime Minister Julia Gillard - a member of his own party - also copped an earful from the wayward reporter . The handshake: Latham famously shook prime minister John Howard's hand in a rather aggressive manner . The Daily Telegraph's Alicia Wood pointed out how Latham's considerable parliamentary pension made his life easier. 'Unlike Mark Latham, this inner-city feminist does not have the benefit of earning $70,000 a year for doing absolutely nothing,' Wood wrote. Writer Clementine Ford tweeted: 'Every so often, Mark Latham comes along and reminds you why we were so lucky not to have him as Prime Minister.' The controversial leader quit politics in 2005 after his party was cleaned up by Prime Minister John Howard at the previous year's federal election. That year, he released an inflammatory account of his time in politics, the Latham Diaries. He has since become a full-time carer for his children, has written several tomes about the future of the Labor party and held a brief role as a reporter for 60 Minutes during the 2010 federal election. In response to Latham's attack, Pryor pointed out on Twitter that she spends five days a week working at a western Sydney children's hospital. Lisa Pryor, the author of the piece Latham took exception to, responded to the former Labor leader .","Mark Latham wrote that mothers who take anti-depressants are taking 'the easy way out'

"Smokers who nip out of the office for fag breaks work a whole week less than their non-smoking colleagues each year, research shows. Every day smokers spend an average of 45 minutes away from their work, which adds up to nearly four hours per week. Over a year this amounts to smokers working seven fewer days than their colleagues who do not smoke, according to a study for Voucher Codes Pro. Time out: Smokers spend an average of 45 minutes every day having cigarette breaks (library image) Fewer than one in five of those surveyed believed that smoking made them a less hardworking employee than their non-smoking peers. Nearly half of those surveyed, 46 per cent, thought smoking actually improved their work performance because they felt it relieved stress and was a chance to chat to colleagues. One smoker said: ‘The smoking area at work is one of the most sociable places in the office to get to know co-workers well.’ Another said: ‘If I didn’t smoke I would be a lot more stressed and wouldn’t be able to get half the things done in a day that I currently do.’ George Charles, marketing director of Voucher Codes Pro, said employers might think twice about hiring smokers due to the amount of time they spend not working. ‘The subject of employing smokers is an undoubtedly controversial one, but clearly one that needs to be highlighted looking at the results of our study,’ he said. Productive? 46 per cent of those surveyed thought smoking improved their work (library image) ‘Whilst it could be argued that there are many different reasons as to why employees may need to take time out of work, it is not surprising that many employers would be wary of hiring smokers if they are going to be using more than 170 hours a year feeding their habit.’ Those who were surveyed said they took six fag breaks a day and spent seven minutes and 30 seconds to get through their cigarette. The smokers who responded to the study also said they tend to take five sick days a year due to illnesses or medical appointments directly linked to smoking. Mr Charles added: ‘Only the employers themselves will be able to assess for sure if their non-smoking employers outperform those that smoke to the extent that it makes a huge difference to their business. ‘However, with the rules on smoking in the UK becoming stricter, who knows what this could soon mean for those with an addiction for cigarettes.’","Smokers spend 45 minutes away from work - nearly four hours per week .

"Apocalyptic snowfall over upstate New York that has killed 13 people is set to bring even further misery as the area is hit by warmer temperatures and rain over the weekend. More buildings could collapse and flooding devastate the area as chilling downpours soak into the feet-thick blanket of snow already coating most of the buildings in the area around Buffalo. Officials have predicted waters six feet deep will hit parts of the area. The town has already experienced almost a year's worth of snow in just a few days - in the worst-hit areas 7 feet of powder has fallen, close to the yearly average of 8 feet. Thirteen people have died in the bout of lake-effect snow around Buffalo and Erie county, either from exposure to the chilling weather or through heart attacks caused by trying to shovel the snow away.

She and 180 others were evacuated amid fears the roof would cave in . Two elderly people died after they were evacuated from a nursing home where the roof was in danger of collapsing. A thirteenth death was confirmed today after a man was found dead in a car. More than 30 roof collapses, most involving farm and flat-roof buildings, were reported overnight, officials said Friday. Due to the high snow risk, buildings in Buffalo are required to be able to support 50 pounds per square foot on their roofs - but according to experts this limit has almost been breached. Widespread travel bans are in effect in darkness hours around the area, and the intense snowfall has forced the Buffalo Bills NFL team to cancel a home game Sunday and move it to Detroit for Monday instead. Little or no extra snow is due, but forecasts predicting rising temperatures of up to 60 degrees could bring further danger for the area, along with forecast rain for Saturday and Monday. At a news conference Friday, Erie County Executive Marc Poloncarz warned that floods are likely to hit in a few days' time and could cause even worst damage.

He said: 'Now we have to be prepared for the flooding - there will be flooding in all likelihood from Sunday through Tuesday... We fully expect some low areas to have five to six feet of water in a very short time.' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the weather was of national significance and has caught the attention of President Obama. He said: 'The President himself sends us his best wishes - he was concerned with the situation... He's thinking abvout us and he cares about us.' He also said that officials will likely seek funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to pay for some of the damage, expected to reach the tens of millions. According to officials, 5,000 people, some 200 snowplows and thousands of trucks were working to clear the snow from the worst-hit areas. Homeowners and store employees around the region climbed onto roofs Thursday to shovel off the snow and reduce the danger. 'It's getting heavier,' said Cheektowaga resident Thomas Mudd Jr., who with his wife spent several hours shoveling 4 to 5 feet off their roof. 'It's supposed to warm up and we're supposed to get rain on the weekend, which will make it even heavier. So I didn't want my roof collapsing.'

'No matter how you cut it, this event will end up in the top five for the Lake Erie area,' said National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini. More than 50 people were evacuated from several mobile home parks in suburban Cheektowaga and West Seneca because roofs were buckling. Bellevue Fire Department Lt. Timothy Roma said more than a dozen buildings and carports collapsed, as did a metal warehouse operated by a Christmas decorations company, where damage was estimated in the millions. Some 180 residents of a Cheektowaga assisted living facility were evacuated after staff members noticed the ceiling bulging under the weight of the snow. With roads impassable, driving bans in effect and the Buffalo Bills' stadium buried in snow, the NFL decided to move the Bills' Sunday home game against the New York Jets to Monday night in Detroit. National Guardsmen drove nurses to their hospital shifts. State troopers helped elderly residents trapped in their homes. State officials assembled 463 plows, 129 loaders and 40 dump trucks from across the state for a massive cleanup effort. Some Buffalo-area schools were closed for the fourth day, burning through snow days with winter still a month away. A stretch of the New York State Thruway through western New York remained closed, with more than 300 truckers idled at truck stops and service areas, waiting for the highway to reopen. Amtrak has continued to restore rail service through the region, but with modified schedules. With deliveries interrupted, some grocery stores reported running low on staples like bread and milk. Pushing through: A snowplow in West Seneca clears a street, leaving feet-high snow either side of the road . Necessary: Firefighters took to snowmobiles to get around in the worst-affected areas, such as West Seneca, pictured . Struggle: A snow plow pushes along the highway in Lackawanna, near Buffalo, on Thursday. A travel ban has been put in place in the area .

"Authorities in Paris are investigating the disappearance of a North Korean student amid fears he may have been forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed. The man, identified only by his surname Han, has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason last December. Inspectors arrived at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette last week in search of the architecture student, but were told he had not been seen for 15 days. Scroll down for video . French authorities are investigating the disappearance of a North Korean student  amid fears that he may have been taken back to the secretive country to be executed (pictured, Kim inspects an air base this week) Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors . A source said Han had been picked up by North Korean agents sent to the school, before being driven to Charles de Gaulle airport, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap. According to reports he managed to escape his captors, but it is not clear whether he was recaptured or whether he is still hiding somewhere in France. Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer. Han had been studying at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government. It was initially reported that the other nine students had also gone missing, but they have now reappeared according to Le Parisien. As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations. However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities. Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup. According to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea) Since Jang was executed last December Kim has rounded up hundreds of his supporters and relatives. Han's father, a close aide of Jang, is known to have been purged recently . In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'. Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out. There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks. However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle. This week Kim was pictured visiting an air base at an undisclosed location in North Korea to offer 'field guidance' to soldiers there. He was also pictured being cheered on by crowds of workers on a visit to a fishery.","Student known as Han has not been seen at French school for 15 days .

"A boy who grew up suffering daily abuse at the hands of his own mother has shared his horrific story. Craig (not his real name to protect his identity), from Yorkshire, said he received so many broken bones and serious injuries as a boy that he knew all the names of the nurses at his local hospital. He was so abused he thought daily beatings were a normal part of growing up. He explains: 'For as far back as I can remember my mother was violent towards me. I was physically assaulted virtually every day of my childhood. If I got through a day without being hit to the floor or in pain from a slap then it was a good day. I thought it was normal to live the way I lived and to be punished the way I was punished.' Scroll down for video . Now grown-up, Craig has had numerous tattoos to cover the scars given to him by his abusive mother (picture posed by model) He added: 'The injuries I sustained from my mother's physical abuse were frequent and serious; burns, broken ribs, broken limbs. For my 11th birthday she put both my hands on the table and broke each finger with a hammer. 'Another time she pressed a hot iron into my back. She told me she was punishing me for things I'd done wrong but I think she used to get a kick out of being abusive to me. The worse and more in pain she made me feel, the happier she seemed to be.' Despite Craig regularly being hospitalised due to his injuries, his mother's violence was not uncovered because she was 'an expert liar' and Craig was too afraid to tell the truth. He said: 'My mother would have an excuse for every injury; she was an expert liar. On one occasion, my mother told the nurses that I'd busted my head open by riding a bike down the house stairs. The truth was that she threw me down the stairs and a bike on top of me but I stayed silent because I didn't think anyone would believe me. 'When we had visitors to the house, she'd put on a loving mum act. She explained my bruises and broken limbs to family as me being clumsy. People believed her because she was a pillar of the community – she was well liked and very popular. No one could see behind the façade.' Craig's biological father left when he was born and his mother had a succession of boyfriends who were also abusive. Craig recalls: 'Growing up I had five different surnames as my mother moved from relationship to relationship. All the men in my mother's life were the same – they had alcohol problems and would physically assault my mother and me when they were drunk. 'My mother blamed their behaviour on me and I would get an extra beating off her to punish me for what they'd done to us. If they smacked her, she would smack me. I was like her personal punching bag and I think she took out the frustrations of her life on me.' As well as physical violence, Craig was also subjected to emotional abuse which made him feel worthless. Horrific childhood: Craig suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his own mother (picture posed by model) 'My mother told me her life was ruined the day I was born,' he said. 'She said that everything that had gone wrong in her life was my fault and that she wished she had killed me when I was a baby. 'The emotional abuse was cruel and constant. If I wasn't being shouted and screamed at and called a mistake then I was being ignored. I was never shown any love.' Christmas is meant to be a magical time for children but for Craig, it meant more emotional trauma and violence. He said: 'My first memory, when I was around four or five years old, is from a Christmas morning. I was made to sit and watch my older sister unwrap her presents and then I was told I didn't have any presents to unwrap because I didn't deserve any. I was sent upstairs to spend Christmas Day alone in my room without any food. 'Another Christmas morning she slammed my head in the fridge door, breaking my nose.' Craig has shared his shocking story as new figures released by the NSPCC's Childline this week have revealed that calls to their counsellors increase in December. In December 2013, their trained counsellors carried out almost 23,000 counselling sessions with children and young people on a huge range of subjects. The most common reason for contacting ChildLine was family relationship issues – anything from worries relating to parents separating to arguments with family members and wanting to leave home. In the same period, more than 1,600 children and young people contacted ChildLine feeling suicidal - a disturbing 38 per cent increase compared to December 2012 - and there was a 36 per cent increase in counselling sessions on the subject of low self-esteem and unhappiness. In addition, in December 2013, ChildLine counsellors handled 776 counselling sessions where children mentioned feelings of loneliness, isolation or exclusion. ChildLine also reported a 24 per cent increase in the number of counselling sessions on Christmas Day compared to December 2012, speaking to one child every four minutes on average. The new figures coincide with the launch of the NSPCC's Call for Help appeal to ensure its ChildLine service is able to offer support and hope to the thousands of children and young people expected to make contact this December. Life line: Craig said speaking to ChildLine counsellors pulled him back from the brink of suicide (picture posed by model) It was this service that helped Craig and convinced him not to take his life when he was at his lowest ebb. He recalls: 'I called ChildLine for the first time the day after my 14th birthday. Someone had visited my school and given a talk about how ChildLine could help people going through abuse. I called four times before I was able to speak. I was so afraid of my mother finding out and what she'd do to me. 'With ChildLine I heard a reassuring adult voice who wasn't going to hurt me. I told them what my mother had done to me that day and they listened to me and didn't call me a liar. I cried for about 20 minutes in that telephone box because for the first time in my life, I was told that what was happening to me was wrong.' He added: 'I've always wanted to say thank you to those voices on the other end of the phone. They don't know it, but without them, I wouldn't be here now. I know how close I came to ending it all – ChildLine was the only thing that pulled me back. 'My message for a child or young person going through what I went through is please know that you're not alone. Talk to someone and get help. Don't go through it on your own because with help from other people, your abuse can be stopped.' Craig finally became free of his wicked mother when he left home at 16 and joined the navy. Now 32, he is now married with a daughter and is determined to put his past behind him. He said: 'I don't like looking back on my childhood. I've tried to forget my past and what my mother did to me. Every tattoo I have covers a scar she gave me. The tattoos cover burn marks, surgical scars to repair broken bones and old wounds. I have over 30 tattoos on my body – I would rather see a tattoo than a scar. 'I'm not in contact with my mother or other family members anymore. My family is now my wife and daughter who have shown me what love is. I'm determined to give my daughter all the things I didn't have growing up. I make sure that every Saturday is our day where we spend time going out to museums or playing together. Through my daughter I feel like I'm having my childhood again, I'm trying to make up for lost time.'

"Sometimes all you need in life, as suggested by legendary Disney slacker Baloo the Bear, is the bare necessities. This brown bear appears to follow the lead of her idol, as she scratches her back against a tree, mimicking the much-loved cartoon bear. Although in this case, the bear with an itch is far from Kipling's India, enjoying a self-made grooming session in a forest in northern Finland. Bare necessities: The female brown bear enjoys a self-made back-scratch with the help of a tree . After using the tree-trunk, the female bear uses a giant branch to scratch, and she looks the spitting image of Baloo from the famous scene in the Rudyard Kipling inspired Disney movie. Jamen Percy, from London, spotted the bear during a trip to northern Finland, while watching the bears activity discreetly from an armoured hide. He said: 'It was like a scene straight out of Jungle Book with Baloo scratching himself on the tree. 'Although this was a different species of bear, they all seem to love a good tree scratch.' Mr Percy spent hours covertly covering the trees in honey in a bid to attract the bears. Hello there! The bear appears to be waving to the photographer from her spot the woods in northern Finland . Look-a-like: The bear resembled everyone's favourite Disney bear - Baloo from the Jungle Book . That's why a bear can rest at ease: The brown bear grabs hold of a young tree for a scratching session . The original: Baloo, voiced by Phil Harris, uses a palm tree in the 1967 Disney animation of the classic book by Rudyard Kipling . He then retreated to the camouflaged hide around 30ft away where he patiently waited, finally capturing the bears in action three hours later. Mr Percy added: 'I was at the mercy of the bears. I was alone in this hide, which the bears could very easily dismantle if they wanted to. 'There were several precautions I had to undertake to make sure there were no traces of honey left on my hands which could attract the bears. 'They absolutely love honey and nothing will get in their way when they smell it, so it was very important not to have a single trace of the stuff on me. Scratching an itch: The female bear made sure she sharpened her claws on the tree-trunk as well . Peekabo: Photographer Jamen Percy, from London, spotted the bear during a trip to northern Finland . Omnomnom: Mr Percy admitted to spending hours covering the trees in honey in order to attract the bears . 'But I was still on edge. Bears have an incredible bite force and strength well capable of crushing most man made objects.' Mr Percy says he honed the techniques he used to capture these intimate images during repeated trips to the remote Finnish forest. He said: 'I have visited this area for three years in a row and had many great encounters. 'Basically the area is run by a wilderness centre in the north of Finland. You trek into the forest away from any civilisation, they then lock you in a hide and leave you. 'You live among the bears for a night. The guides come and collect you in the morning at 7am when the bears are sleeping.'","Baloo look-a-like spotted in a forest in northern Finland .

"A Florida woman is facing life in prison after she was convicted of killing her estranged husband during a 'date rape' sex game. Anita Smithey, 46, sobbed and collapsed in court after she was found guilty of second degree murder following the death of Robert Cline III in May 2010. She shot him in his Oviedo, Florida, home while they were having sex during violent role play which involved using a knife as a prop. Convicted: Anita Smithey, 46, sobbed in court after she was found guilty of second degree murder following the death of her estranged husband Robert Cline III in May 2010 . Injuries: The day after the shooting, she was pictured with knife marks around her throat, covered in cuts and bruises and with a shallow stab mark on her side. Prosecutors said they believe these were self-inflicted . The couple were separated at the time, but would still meet up every Monday night to have sex. Prosecutors said it was scene they would frequently act out, according to theOrlando Sentinel. Smithey's attorneys said she shot him in self-defense because he was raping her and she wanted to go home, but prosecutors said it was just rough, consensual sex. She had got in the shower and was preparing to leave, but she claims Cline then grabbed her again, tossed her back onto the bed and assaulted her. The day after the shooting, she had knife marks on her throat, a chipped tooth, facial bruises and a shallow stab wound on her side, but the court heard some of these may have been self-inflicted. Assistant State Attorney Kelly Jo Hines told Smithey: 'You're not allowed to kill a houseguest who's overstayed their visit. Reaction: She collapsed into her attorney;s arms after the verdict was read out. Smithey claims she shot her husband in self-defense because he was raping her, but prosecutors said it was just rough consensual . The jury took less than three hours to come to a guilty verdict. Over the course of the investigation Smithey's accounts of what happened varied. At first she told officers the gun had gone off by accident, but she then changed the story to say she had actually pulled the trigger. Assistant State Attorney Stacey Salmons told jurors there was no rape and argued that she inflicted the cuts on herself. Some witnesses who were at the scene described Smithey as crying and hysterical, but paramedic who rode with her in an ambulance believed she acting. A nurse who performed a rape exam on her in the aftermath said she thought she had been a victim of sexual assault. Prospect: The 46-year-old is facing life in prison for the murder. Some of those who attended the scene after the death said they believed Smithey was acting while crying and hysterical .","Anita Smithey, 46, sobbed as jury found her guilty of second degree murder .

The 21-year-old, who has two other children aged six and three, has vowed to take care of Gammy . Just this week, Thailand's military-appointed cabinet reportedly authorised new laws to prohibit commercial surrogacy. This comes after Ms Chanbua alleged West Australian man David Farnell and his wife Wendy abandoned their baby son Gammy. The Farnells caused international outrage when they were accused of leaving the Down syndrome boy in Thailand but took healthy twin Pipah home to Australia. It was later revealed that Mr Farnell, Gammy's biological father, was convicted on 22 child sex charges in the late 1990s. Ms Chanbua, the 21-year-old who also has two other children aged six and three, has vowed to take care of Gammy. Since then, she had her children have moved into a new house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations. About half of the money raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, leaving $120,000 to cover Gammy's future medical and living expenses, said charity Hands Across The Water.

Pipah recently returned to Australia after a trip to China with Mrs Farnell for her mother's funeral. WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her father David Farnell, a convicted child sex offender. 'The department was fully aware of her travel and was supportive of her taking time to grieve and spend time with her family,' Ms Morton told the West Australian. 'While this specific case is still subject to an ongoing thorough assessment, I can assure you that much has happened behind the scenes.'","Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua hopes Australian citizenship will secure the future of the baby boy with Down's syndrome .

"A new Trulia reports shows that owning a home is increasingly hard to do for most middle class families, listing the best cities to buy a house. The site defines an affordable city as one in which the 'total monthly payment, including mortgage, insurance, and property taxes, is less than 31 per cent of the metro area's median household income.' The two cities where a middle class income is most likely to find you a home are Dayton, Ohio, followed by Rochestor, New York. The two cities where a middle class income is most likely to find you a home are Dayton, Ohio, followed by Rochestor, New York . Ohio was the state with the most affordable cities in the top ten with three cities listed. Meanwhile, the majority of most affordable cities are around the Great Lakes. The least affordable cities tend to be on the coasts, with six on that list being in California. The Huffington Post notes that the site's map is broken down with bubbles representing each area's housing market. Rochester, New York, (pictured) was one of the most affordable cities for middle class earners to buy a home, just behind Dayton, Ohio . 59 per cent of all homes for sale are considered affordable for the middle class, which is a drop of 62 per cent from one year ago. Trulia economist Jed Kolko said the data showed the dream of owning a home falling out of reach. 'Homeownership is getting less affordable for the middle class,' he said. 'Unless incomes increase substantially, homeownership will slip further beyond the reach of many households.'","Only 59 per cent of all homes for sale are considered affordable for the middle class, which is a drop of 62 per cent from one year ago .

"The brave astronauts who risked their lives to venture into the unknown have been hailed as the heroes of the space race. But the incredible infrastructure that sent these men and women into orbit has largely been forgotten, leaving haunting reminders of one of humanity's greatest achievements. For the best part of half a century, one photographer has been on an adventure across the US to capture abandoned Nasa sites before they are lost to their environment. Scroll down for video . An inside look: Pictured is a Saturn V F1 engine at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 'I was asked, in 1997, to photograph the newly opened Saturn V Center, including access to a high-lift for vantage points like this view of the center Saturn V F1 engine,' said Mr Miller . Roland Miller, 56, from Grayslake, Illinois, has dedicated 25 years to the personal project and has now compiled his life's work in a book, 'Abandoned In Place'. 'I think that many children of my era wanted to be astronauts,' said Mr Miller, a photography instructor at the College of Lake County in Grayslake. 'Unfortunately, because of my need for glasses in the third grade I knew becoming an astronaut was not an option. Well, glasses and about 40 IQ points. 'My parents would wake me and my sisters up early to watch the launches from Cape Canaveral. The nuts and bolts: Pictured is a cable tunnel at the Gemini Titan Complex 19 in Florida, pictured in 1993. Often overlooked in early space history, the Gemini program provided the basic research for many critical steps in proving that men could survive long duration flights in space and testing the orbital rendezvous procedures which would eventually be used in the Apollo program . Space history: Mr Miller has visited 16 space launch sites, research facilities, and museums, in Virginia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas, Utah, New Mexico, and California. Pictured is a wind tunnel test chamber at the Langley Research Center in Virginia . 'As an adult it has been an amazing experience to explore and photograph these historic launch complexes.' Mr Miller has visited 16 space launch sites, research facilities, and museums, in Virginia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas, Utah, New Mexico, and California. 'Cape Canaveral has the most facilities remaining, though many of them have been demolished or repurposed since I began the project,' he said . 'Launch Complex 34 is my favourite. LC34 is the site of a number of unmanned test launches of the Saturn I and IB rocket. 'The first manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7, lifted off from Complex 34. It is also the site of the Apollo One capsule fire that killed Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Snapped: A fuel tank for a lunar module pictured at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in 2002. 'As an adult it has been an amazing experience to explore and photograph these historic launch complexes,' said Miller . Space race: On the left are bolts pictured at Atlas Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The right image shows a plug board at Complex 26, also located in Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . Flooded: This is an image of a large square girder in a flooded compartment beneath Launch Pad 19, the Gemini-Titan facility at Cape Canaveral. 'I was intrigued by the colour and the light,' said Mr Miller. 'What I couldn't have predicted were the swirling reflections of light in the water coming from openings in the roof. They look like little galaxies' The blockhouses, launch towers, tunnels, test stands, and control rooms are rapidly giving way to the elements and demolition. 'By my estimates, fully half of the facilities I have photographed no longer exist,' said Mr Miller. 'The costs involved in restoring, maintaining, and securing these sites are enormous.' Most of these historic facilities are located on secure military or Nasa facilities, which drastically limits access by the public. Mr Miller wants to capture these amazing facilities before they are lost forever. 'There is a spiritual quality to Launch Complex 34. The launch pedestal with its large round opening to the sky gives it the look of some ancient astronomical archaeological ruin-something like Stonehenge.' In 1984, Mr Miller moved to Florida's Space Coast to teach photography and was contacted by an environmental engineer at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The engineer needed help disposing of old photographic chemicals, which required a visit to Launch Complex 19, the Gemini Program launch facility. 'I knew immediately I wanted to photograph the decaying launch structure, and I soon realised there were other deactivated launch facilities on Cape Canaveral that I would also want to photograph,' he said. It was down to this chance encounter that led Mr Miller to spend a large part of his life travelling across country to document the forgotten history of the space program. 'You have to understand that all of these launch complexes and test sites are on secure military bases or Nasa and contractor operated facilities with numerous security considerations and hazardous operations,' he said. Decommissioned: 'I made this photograph of Atlas Launch Complex 36B while it was being decomissioned,' said Mr Miller. 'The mobile service towers of Pads A and B were imploded in 2007. Launch Complex 36 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station sent Surveyor, Mariner, and Pioneer missions on their way to explore the ,oon and the planets of our solar system' Haunting: Pictured on the left is Navaho Complex 9 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station pictured in 1990. On the right is a Nasa logo at Mercury Mission Control in Florida . Revived: A launch ring restored at the Apollo Saturn Complete 34. 'In 1998, the launch ring at Complex 34 was sandblasted and painted to protect it from weathering,' said Mr Miller. ;I had been trying for years to capture the spiritual quality of this site. I made this photograph near sunset with the blue sky reflecting on the launch pedestal and the last pink rays of sunlight illuminating the ring and clouds behind' 'You can't just say to Nasa, 'I would like to run around on your secure facility and make a bunch of pictures.' 'It wasn't hard to get out and photograph for a short period of time, but I knew I need extended time and numerous visits to accomplish the project I had in mind. Mr Miller said it took about two years of attempting different avenues to get the access he required. 'Once I was able to make a couple of excursions and then show the work to Nasa and the Air Force, they were supportive of my visits,' he said. Mr Miller, who successfully raised over his $25,000 (£16,000) target through Kickstarter to part-fund his work, said he plans to continue photographing abandoned space centres when they become available.

Unlike all the other service towers at the pads on Cape Canaveral, the erector at Pad 19 was hinged at the base. It was lowered before every launch' Abandoned: Mr Miller managed to capture these liquid fuel tanks used for the Apollo program which landed the first twelve humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. 'Their were two of these fuel pressure spheres near the entrance to Launch Complex 37,' he said. 'One has been repurposed and is now used to support Delta IV rocket launches. The other sphere was removed' Inspiration: Pictured is a blockhouse - a isolated fort - at the Apollo Saturn Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral in Florida. 'These abandoned space launch and test facilities bring to mind other archeological sites. This blockhouse reminded me of a pyramid or ziggurat,' said Mr Miller .","Stunning images were taken by photographer Roland Miller, 56, from Grayslake, Illinois, over 25 years .
He visited 16 space launch sites and research facilities in areas including Virginia, Florida and California .
Launch Complex 34 is his favourite, as it is site of unmanned test launches for the historic Saturn rocket .
'There is a spiritual quality to Launch Complex 34,' said Mr Miller, adding that it reminds him of Stonehenge ."
"He’s a bit early for Christmas … but perhaps someone told this robin that the early bird catches the worm. And in this case, he’s catching mealworms, breadcrumbs and even bowls of hot porridge. The redbreast has started visiting Pat Lowe as many as 15 times a day, cheekily tapping on her window every morning until she lets him into her kitchen. Bob the Robin visits Pat Lowe's kitchen up to 15 times a day to peck on breadcrumbs, worms and porridge . While Bob snacks on most things laid out by Mrs Lowe, his favourite is cooked porridge, she said . Mrs Lowe, who has eight grandchildren, cooks porridge for the animal to keep him warm in the winter . Mrs Lowe has tried to shoo the animal away to 'find his friends' but he returns day after day for more food . Once inside, he breakfasts on the array of food that she buys to feed to the birds in her garden – as well as the treats his ‘surrogate mother’ whips up just for him. And then he makes himself at home, fluttering to and fro through the back door all day as he picks up more snacks. Grandmother-of-eight Mrs Lowe, 77, said the bird, who she calls Bob, first appeared over the summer in the garden of the home she shares with husband Richard, 82, near Lydney, Gloucestershire. She added: ‘I didn’t go out into the garden one day and then he started coming into the house – he thinks I’m his mummy. The 77-year-old said Bob has begun following her into the house after she didn't go into the garden one day . Favourite things: Mrs Lowe leaves out a tray with a variety of snacks on it for the little bird to enjoy . Making himself at home: Bob is not frightened off by either Mrs Lowe or her husband but isn't quite comfortable enough to start eating out of the 77-year-old's hand . While the pensioner enjoys having the bird in her home, she said she will be forced to make him wear a nappy . The animal appeared at Pat Lowe's window one day when the pensioner failed to go out into the garden . Puffing his red and grey belly out, the bird rests on the edge of a chair and on Mrs Lowe's kitchen counter . Taking off: Once he has had enough to eat Bob goes out back into the garden before returning later . The bird is not frightened by humans and once flew over the postman's head to get into the house . Bob taps on the window with his beak when he wants to be let back into the house in Gloucestershire . 'Umpteen times I’ve let him out the window and said “Go and find your friends”. ‘But he goes away for a little while and then the next day, he’s back. 'He’s not scared of anybody. The other day, I opened the door for the postman and Bob flew over the postman’s head and came in. ‘He loves porridge – I cook it for him to keep him nice and warm for the winter. He’s not eating out of my hand yet, but I’m working on it.’","Bob the robin visits Pat Lowe in her home up to 15 times a day .

"No good deed goes unpunished and one man had to learn that lesson the hard way earlier this month when he was stabbed nine times after asking a man to stop catcalling his girlfriend. Ben Schwartz, 31, of San Francisco was brutally stabbed nine times while walking home from a party with his girlfriend Miyoko Moody and another friend. He is now recovering from the attack and is in stable condition. Schwartz's friend, Daniela Saavedra, said that Schwartz asked a man who had been catcalling his girlfriend to stop after he made passes at her at least two times, reports The San Francisco Chronicle. Stabbed: Ben Schwartz was brutally stabbed after he told a man to stop catcalling his girlfriend Miyoko Moody . In recovery: The suspect stabbed Schwartz nine times in the back, face, neck and arms, puncturing a lung and just missing his spine but Schwartz is on the steady road to recovery . 'All he said was, ""Can you please just stop?""' Saavedra said. 'The man then sort of trailed behind them, and that’s when he attacked,' she continued. Schwartz was brutally stabbed in the back, face, arms neck, and even had a punctured lung. The suspect just nearly missed Schwartz's spinal cord before jumping into a silver sedan. Police are still on the lookout for the man who ruthlessly stabbed a Good Samaritan. 'He definitely sticks up for women, for anyone really,' Saavedra said. 'If you’re his friend, you’re his friend for life, and I’ve watched him just support many friends through many hard times. He’s just so kind-hearted, and you can see that in everything that he does.' Helps others: Not only did Ben Schwartz defend his girlfriend, he helped to return a stolen bicycle in February . For love: Ben Schwartz told the suspect to stop catcalling his beautiful girlfriend Miyoko Moody several times . This isn't the first time Schwartz has made the news for helping someone., . The San Francisco Chronicle did a story on Schwartz back in February when he bought a bicycle on the street he guessed was stolen then did whatever he could to get it back to its original owner. The owner of the bike happened to be a freelance photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle. 'I’ve had friends get their cars broken into, smashed-in windows, stolen laptops, stolen cell phone — there’s nothing I can do a lot of those times' Schwartz said in February. 'But this way, it was easy. It was safe, and it got him his bike back. ... I just wanted to do somebody a solid for once.' Those wishing to help Schwartz in his recovery can donate to his GoFundeMe page. So far they have raised $17,000  out of their $25,000 goal. “Street harassment is definitely more dangerous than people think it is,'Saavedra said. 'A point my fiancé brought up was you know this isn’t the first time this man has stabbed someone, or acted out in this way. To be that angry and aggressive and mentally unstable, that is just terrifying to think about.' There are currently no leads on a suspect responsible brutal attack but those with any information are asked to call (415) 553-0123. Help him out: Those wishing to donate money to Ben Schwartz so he can pay his medical bills can donate online to his GoFundMe page set up by friends .","Ben Schwartz, 31, of San Francisco was brutally stabbed nine times after asking an unidentified suspect to stop catcalling his girlfriend .

"As the fashion world descends onto the French capital again it seems designers' creativity has gone sky high. American designer Thom Browne’s collection had distinctive aviation and military themes, with male models strutting down the runway in pilot caps and aviator sunglasses. Strong military trench coats swept the floor as high-shine army regulation style boots stomped down the catwalk. Aviators, caps and a lot of red lipstick were the order of the day at Pret a Porter Men's spring/summer 14 shows in Paris . There were white pilot gloves paired with army parade plumes on Tom Browne's catwalk . The collection took inspiration from across the armed forces, with white pilot gloves paired with army parade plumes emerging from captain's hats, and navy anchors embroidered on many pieces. A heavily monochrome colour palette was brightened with a slew of fire engine-red coats and mirrored aviators were a key accessory throughout. Thom's specialty is distinctively structured suits with exposed ankles in a range of charcoal-grey colors . Thom Browne is the founder and head of design for his eponymous New York City-based menswear and womenswear brand. His first womenswear collection was debuted in the early 2000s and he was named the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Menswear Designer of the Year in March 2006 as well as being named the GQ Designer of the Year in November 2008. His menswear line was established, he claims, as a response to the general acceptance of business casual designs in lieu of formal attire. His specialty is distinctively structured suits with exposed ankles in a range of charcoal-grey colors. Since its début in 2001, the collection . has expanded into a more complete menswear line with dress shirts, . sweaters, ties, underwear, and accessories.

"A new documentary is lifting the veil on one of the most exotic travel destinations that very few people know exists. Socotra: The Hidden Land offers a revealing look at the remote island’s stunning landscapes and its people, whose ancient beliefs and lifestyles are under threat as they embrace modern practices and technology. With hundreds of endemic plants and animals the four-island archipelago of Socotra has been dubbed the Galapagos Islands of the Indian Ocean and one of the most alien landscapes on Earth.

The ‘lost world’ territory that belongs to Yemen is best known for having 800 rare species of flora and fauna – a third of which are found nowhere else on the planet. Located 155 miles east of Somalia and 210 miles south of Yemen, Socotra lures adventurers with its sandy beaches, limestone caves and towering mountains, in addition to its unusual wildlife and vegetation. While plenty of attention has been given to the flora and fauna, the island’s 40,000 residents remain somewhat of a mystery to the outside world as they have been isolated from modern society.

Socotra, a territory of Yemen, is best known for having 800 rare species of flora and fauna . The documentary, directed and produced by Carles Cardelus, exposes the islanders’ lives and customs as they struggle to preserve centuries-old traditions. He tells the island’s story through its shepherds, fishermen, traditional healers and imam. Mr Cardelus, who is in London for a screening of Socotra: The Hidden Land at the UK Film Festival, told MailOnline Travel: ‘They have ancestral cultures and they are now very focused on the influence of modern ideas. ‘A few years ago fishermen never used money because they shared the fish. Capitalism is going there and this is changing their culture very fast. ‘The landscape and all the environment is amazing.

At one point in the documentary the Barcelona-based filmmaker meets a local healer who uses ancient rituals and medicines to rid his patients of evil spirits. Mr Cardelus, 33, said: ‘Some people believe in spirits, but some say they have doctors on the island now so they don’t need the healers who use plants. Their cultures are changing very fast. ‘They love the new things. For example, many people are selling their land to buy a car or a bigger boat. They love all these new things.’ Socotra has been called one of the most alien landscapes on Earth thanks to its unique flora and fauna .

A popular destination for eco-tourists and daredevil travellers, Socotra does not have any traditional holiday resorts or luxurious hotels, and very few people speak English. It offers very basic lodging or campsites where people sleep under the stars in a hot and dry climate. Mr Cardelus said: ‘The climate is strong. It’s very hot and very windy but it’s a strong desert in the middle of the sea. It’s like going back in time.’ In the film, Mr Cardelus and his crew spent time with fishermen on the Arabian Sea .

"Armed bandits in Guinea have stolen a batch of blood samples infected with the deadly Ebola virus which were being delivered to a test centre. The robbers held up a minibus near the town of Kissidougou which was transporting the samples from central Kankan prefecture  to the test site 165 miles away in southern Gueckedou. The blood was stored in a sealed container and was being escorted by four Red Cross officials. It is believed the bandits had no idea what it was they were stealing and may have thought there was cash hidden inside the container. Children  climb a wall to see a  helicopter land in Gueckedou, Ginea. Officials in Guinea say bandits   stole a cooler containing blood samples that are believed to be infected with the Ebola virus . Guinea authorities publicly appealed on national radio to the unidentified robbers to hand over the stolen samples  that are understood to have been taken from a single person. The theft underscores how hazards abound and hiccups remain in the aid response, despite millions of dollars' worth of international support pouring into West Africa to fight a virus now responsible for more than 5,000 deaths. Guinea Red Cross press officer Faya Etienne Tolno explained that the Guinea Red Cross did not have its own vehicles for transport, which explains why a taxi was commissioned. 'We don't understand why they stole the blood sample. Perhaps they thought there was cash hidden in the flask,' Tolno said. Dr. Barry Moumie, who heads patient care for the national Ebola response coordination committee, told The Associated Press: 'We have informed the security services. If these thieves handle this blood, it will be dangerous.' 'I can assure you, however, that the sample-transportation procedures will now be strengthened to avoid such disappointments,' he said. Awoman runs through a village near Faranah, in Guinea. A coalition of companies and aid groups announced plans this week to test experimental drugs and collect blood plasma from Ebola survivors to treat new victims of the disease in West Africa . Ebola, which has killed more than 5,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is spread primarily by contact with infected bodily fluids including blood, feces and vomit. Yesterday a doctor in Mali died of Ebola after treating an imam who also succumbed to the disease, taking the total toll in the west African country up to seven, health authorities said. The World Health Organization declared today that an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo was over after no people showed symptoms for two incubation periods since the last case. The outbreak, the seventh in the former Zaire since the virus was identified there in 1976, was separate from the one spreading in West Africa, where more than 5,400 people have died. There were 49 deaths out of 66 people infected in the remote northwestern Equateur province during the three-month outbreak, Congolese authorities said last week. A WHO spokesman confirmed the figures. Two maximum incubation periods of 21 days each must pass with no new cases being detected before the United Nations health agency can declare that an outbreak is finished. 'Having reached that 42-day mark, the Democratic Republic of Congo is now considered free of Ebola transmission,' the WHO said in a statement. The World Health Organization said the virus was 'almost certainly re-introduced into Mali by a 70-year-old Grand Imam from Guinea, who was admitted to Bamako's Pasteur clinic on 25 October and died on 27 October.' The doctor had been undergoing treatment for Ebola for nearly two weeks, according to the health ministry. A total of five infections, all of which have proved fatal, were now linked to the imam. As well as the doctor they include a male nurse who cared for the imam at the Pasteur clinic, and a 51-year-old friend who came to visit the imam. A two-year-old girl also died from the disease last month in an unconnected case in the western town of Kayes. The health ministry said a total of 303 people were under surveillance and had their temperatures taken twice a day. The Malian government had on Wednesday cited a figure of 413 people being monitored. The WHO said Wednesday 5,420 people have died from Ebola in the current outbreak, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Meanwhile a Cuban doctor who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone has arrived in Switzerland for treatment. The Swiss news agency SDA reported Friday that Felix Baez Sarria arrived on a flight overnight and was transported in a specially outfitted ambulance with a police escort to Geneva University Hospital.

Geneva Canton Dr. Jacques-Andre Romand told the news agency that the 43-year-old Baez was able to disembark the plane on his own, and wore a protective suit and mask. The doctor's treatment in Switzerland was organized by the World Health Organization. Cuba sent a 165-member medical team to Sierra Leone to help in the fight against the Ebola epidemic.

"A New York man doused a woman in lighter fluid before setting her face on fire - because she refused to return his $10, it is claimed. William Norwood, 52, allegedly splashed the woman's face with the highly flammable fluid before flicking his lighter on near her face in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The two are said to have been quarreling over money. Violence: The victim was allegedly set on fire in an attack which took place outside this block on Wednesday . He then fled the house in Tremont, in the Bronx, while the woman was rushed to the nearby Jacobi Medical Centre.

"This is the astonishing moment a group of frustrated tram passengers picked up and moved a Mini off the road after its driver blocked two trams when she parked it across tracks. The fed-up bystanders shifted the car after two trams were delayed for 15 minutes by the red Mini which had been left clumsily parked in their way. Incredibly, the female driver had left her motor illegally parked on double-yellow lines on the tram line in Nottingham at 11.10am yesterday. Dozens of people gather on the pavement after the parked vehicle (pictured) blocks two trams from passing . The group of passengers and bystanders then collectively lift the Mini off the tram tracks . It is lifted and then pushed out of the way of the trams, much to the delight of stranded passengers . Trams couldn't get around the parked vehicle, which was left sitting across the curb and sidewalk . The woman then failed to return to the car despite hundreds of people gathering near it. A group of passengers eventually decided to lift and move the Mini off the tramlines and out of the way when she showed no sign of appearing 20 minutes later. The red-faced driver eventually returned to her car from a nearby coffee shop shortly afterwards and was given a penalty ticket by a waiting Nottingham Community Protection Officer. She was then greeted by ironic cheers from the gathered crowds as she performed a U-turn in the road and drove off. Nottingham Trent University student Billy Taylor, 20, captured the moment the frustrated passengers moved the Mini out of the way. His video shows the tram blocked by the red car before the bystanders managed to wheel it onto the pavement. Mr Taylor, who is from Newham in London, said: 'The car was parked half on the pavement and half on the tram lines, and the tram was unable to get past. 'There was a long stand-off. The tram was beeping its horn and no-one came to get the car. The driver was given a ticket by a waiting Nottingham Community Protection Officer upon her return . 'It was about 11am and we waited for about 20 minutes before people got fed-up and started to move it. 'It did cause quite a lot of disruption because the people on the tram weren't allowed to get off, because they weren't at the stop. 'There was another tram behind it as well, so there were two trams stuck at one point. The driver turned up shortly after her car got pushed out of the way because I think someone had alerted her. 'She seemed quite calm and collected considering the dozens of people that were outside and the fact she was holding up this big tram. 'She drove off and did a U-turn in the middle of the road and everyone started cheering. 'She was a middle-aged woman, I think she was very embarrassed.' The stand-off between the Mini and tram even trended on Twitter under the hashtag #TramVSCooper, with hundreds of people posting comments.

"Eight people have been injured after a stray firework fell into a crowd during a Christmas lights switch on by Eastenders actor Steve McFadden. Mr McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell in the soap, turned up to switch on the festive illuminations in Salisbury in Wiltshire. The fireworks, which cost £4,000, were fired from the roof of the city's Guildhall to mark the end of the event, which was attended by up to 14,000 people. Scroll down for video . Paramedics treated eight people in Salisbury city centre after a stray firework fell into a crowd during a Christmas lights switch on . The fireworks, costing £4,000, were set off from the city's Guildhall, pictured, to mark the end of the ceremony . Just before the stray firework hit the crowd Eastenders actor Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell in the soap had turned on the city's Christmas lights . The fireworks were to mark the end of the event attended by Mr McFadden, pictured, which has attracted around 14,000 people . However, one firework malfunctioned causing debris to fall to the ground in Queen Street and New Canal, where the crowds had gathered. Eight people had to be seen by paramedics, with five treated for minor injuries at the scene, and one woman taken to hospital as a 'precaution', after she was bumped on the head. An eight-year-old girl also suffered a 4cm facial burn in the incident. One of the victims, Brett Bowles, told the BBC he was hit by pieces of firework at the beginning of the display. He said: 'I had my daughter in my arms watching the fireworks. 'The first few had gone over and then suddenly it felt like someone had thrown a bottle, which hit me in the side of the head. As the stray fireworks began to fall among the crowd, safety stewards moved people back to a safe distance . Salisbury City Council say the fireworks had been provided by a professional firm and had been due to last between six and eight minutes . 'Then I looked down on the floor and there were some old firework remains there and the blood just pouring from my head.' Fellow spectator Hannah Austin claimed she avoided more than one falling fireworks at the festive ceremony. She said: 'It wasn't just one stray firework, I was in the ‘backstage’ area directly in front of the Guildhall and avoided about seven coming straight down towards me. 'Luckily only one hit the audience, although this should not have happened either. 'There were cardboard tubes everywhere after the event.' But the malfunctioning firework fell to the ground in between Queen Street and New Canal, causing debris to fall . The stray firework bumped one woman on the head and she was taken to hospital as a precaution. An eight-year-old girl also suffered a 4cm facial burn . A spokeswoman for Salisbury City Council said that the display had been provided by a professional firm and had been due to last for between six and eight minutes. She explained: 'Salisbury City Council are today beginning to conduct a full investigation into an incident that occurred at the Salisbury Christmas lights switch on event on Thursday 20 November. 'During the firework part of the event, at approximately 7.05pm, it would appear that a firework malfunctioned. One of the victims who was struck by the fireworks likened the blow to his head as being struck by a bottle . Salisbury City Council has been running the Christmas lights switch on event, which featured the fireworks since 2009 . 'This resulted in debris falling to the ground in Queen Street and New Canal. St John Ambulance, who were present throughout the event, saw eight people. 'One person was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. 'The council apologise for any distress this incident caused and are currently carrying out a full investigation with all involved.

"If you've ever dreamed of becoming a particle physicist, now's your chance. Cern has launched its Open Data Portal, which lets members of the public pore through collision data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is the first time data has been made openly available for research and educational purposes. Scroll down for video . Cern in Geneva has begun releasing collision data from the LHC on their Open Data Portal website (screenshot shown). The public are invited to use the information for research and education. Data will come from various experiments at the particle accelerator . To date, all publications from the LHC have been published Open Access, free to read and re-use. But this latest development is the result of LHC teams approving Open Data policies to release collision data to the public. Yesterday scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern, Geneva said they had discovered two new subatomic particles by smashing protons together. The two new particles, called Xi_b'- and Xi_b*, were previously predicted to exist but had never been seen before. It's hoped the discovery could shed more light on how the universe works beyond the currently accepted models of physics. The new particles were created by firing protons around the 17-mile (27km) tube of the LHC, specifically the Large Hadron Collider Beauty (LHCb) experiment. They were then smashed together at 99.9999 per cent the speed of light, replicating the conditions at the Big Bang . 'Launching the Cern Open Data Portal is an important step for our Organization,' said Cern Director-General Dr Rolf Heuer in a statement. 'Data from the LHC programme are among the most precious assets of the LHC experiments, that today we start sharing openly with the world. 'We hope these open data will support and inspire the global research community, including students and citizen scientists.' The first data to be released on the Open Data Portal will be from the LHC's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, first recorded back in 2010. To view the data, users will need to run Linux, and will also need to install open source software provided by Cern on their computer. The CMS team will release data three years after it has been collected, to give those on the team time to analyse the data before others get their hands on it.

"Sir Ian Botham’s attack on the leadership of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has drawn a massive response from Mail on Sunday readers, who say they feel ‘betrayed’ by an organisation they have backed for years. The England cricketing legend, who fronts You Forgot The Birds, a new grassroots campaign, wrote a devastating open letter to the charity in The Mail on Sunday last week. A small selection of the postbag received by this newspaper in response is reproduced below. One reader said that having joined the RSPB as a founder member aged 16, he was now resigning. Another said she was also quitting because of the charity’s decision to install a wind turbine near its reserve in Bedfordshire. Since the Mail on Sunday ran the story, the You Forgot The Birds website has attracted 25,000 hits. Now a new front in the campaign has opened up following the RSPB’s decision to block measures designed to help one of country’s rarest and most iconic birds – the hen harrier. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has blocked a plan to protect both hen harriers, right, and grouse, left . There are only four breeding pairs left in England which, says the RSPB, is because they have been ‘persecuted’ by gamekeepers as they eat grouse chicks. Since 1998, the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) has been pushing for a compromise scheme that would protect both hen harriers and grouse – so allowing them, and the game bird industry on which many jobs depend, to co-exist. It is backed by landowners and other conservation groups. The idea is known as ‘brood management’. Extra food would be provided on grouse moors for both species, and as harrier numbers recovered, the RSPB would work with gamekeepers to remove harrier chicks from the moors. They would be raised in an aviary, then released back into the wild. But at a meeting involving all concerned parties last week, the RSPB refused to endorse the removal of chicks, although it does support the provision of extra food. Martin Harper, the RSPB’s conservation director, said the society opposed the scheme because the grouse moor industry could not be trusted. He said: ‘The industry has to prove that it can deliver the recovery of hen harriers before we can even consider brood management. If chicks were taken from the wild, reared and released, we have little confidence that they would be allowed to fly free from harm.’ The RSPB’s opposition drew a withering response from Sir Ian. He said: ‘The RSPB has once again wilfully blocked the government’s plan for the recovery of hen harriers. More and more people are realising that the hen harriers’ biggest enemy is the RSPB – not rogue gamekeepers.’ Andrew Gilruth, a spokesman for the GWCT, said that industry bodies such as his ‘utterly condemn any illegal killing, anywhere’.

"A police officer and former Mr Gay UK is facing the sack after head-butting a man in the toilets of a nightclub. Police Constable Mark Carter has been suspended from duty following the assault during which he headbutted a man in the toilets of The Thompsons Arms in Manchester's gay village. The high profile cop was convicted of assault by beating following a trial before Manchester Magistrates Court last week. The victim was a man Carter had been friends with on Facebook. Police officer and former Mr Gay UK Mark Carter (pictured left and right) has been suspended from duties after he was convicted of assault for headbutting a man in the toilets of a nightclub . Carter was made the subject of a 12 month community order and told to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £100 compensation to his victim. The conviction comes three years after Carter, of Gomersal, West Yorkshire, was cleared by a jury of raping a man at a Leeds hotel following a high-profile court trial. Carter, who was named Mr Gay UK in 2006, was cleared of raping the man and carrying out two sexual assaults  following an alleged incident in December 2009. Speaking after Carter's assault conviction last week, Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's professional standards department, said: 'West Yorkshire Police expects the very highest standards of its officers and staff, both on and off duty. Left, Carter is pictured during his acceptance speech for the 2006 Mr Gay UK title. Right, he poses topless in a promotional photograph . Carter pictured posing for photographs in a mock police uniform. The police officer won the Mr Gay UK competition in 2006 . 'Criminal behaviour or conduct which falls below this standard will not be tolerated. 'We note the verdict of the court in relation to this officer. PC Carter remains suspended from duty ahead of an internal misconduct hearing.' When approached  yesterday, Carter said he was appealing the conviction and would not comment further until matters were concluded, but said he wanted to 'move on'. Nick Smart, chairman of West Yorkshire Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said it would be inappropriate comment until the conclusion of internal disciplinary proceedings. In 2009, Carter was alleged to have sexually assaulted three men before raping a 22-year-old man in the Leeds hotel room Carter was staying in. Carter pictured accepting the title of Mr Gay UK at the Flamingo nightclub in Blackpool in 2006 . Two years later, a jury returned not guilty verdicts on the two rape and two sex assault charges laid following what was a police Christmas night out. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third sex assault charge but a decision was taken not to pursue a further trial. Carter told the jury he believed the 22-year-old complainant had willingly gone back with him to the hotel to have sex. Following the acquittals, Carter was also charged with possessing anabolic steroids but the case was discontinued after prosecutors accepted his explanation that the drug was for a medicinal purpose. He returned to work in December 2011.","Former Mr Gay UK Mark Carter suspended from duty following conviction .

"Jailed: Ariel Castro has been charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape . In the suicide note purportedly written by Cleveland kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro, he claims that he was abused as a child and raped by an uncle, it was revealed today. According to a law enforcement source, the letter contained details about his whole life and the three abductions - detailing what led him to kidnap the three women off the street and hold them captive for ten years, . The FBI found the note when they were searching Castro's house and said they were fairly certain from its contents that it was a suicide letter. He detailed that he wanted all his money to be left to his victims Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. Castro's home on Seymour Avenue is now a crime scene, with investigators carrying out numerous pieces of evidence - including ropes and chains. 19 Action News reporter Scott Taylor says he received a copy of the letter, which he claims was written in 2004 and found by police inside Castro's house. Taylor posted excerpts of the letter on his Twitter page late Wednesday night, including a confession that he was 'a sexual predator' and 'I need help.' In one, Taylor says that Castro didn't know why he kept looking for another victim, because 'I already had 2 in my possession.' Investigation: The letter, allegedly written by Castro in 2004, is believed to be one of the items collected from his home in the days after the women were freed . Revelations: 19 Action News reporter Scott Taylor says he received a copy of the letter, which he claims was written in 2004 and found by police inside Castro's house . Haunting message: The letter purportedly written by Castro describes how he though about committing suicide . In another, Castro allegedly wrote that he was surprised how young his daughter's best friend Gina DeJesus was - because he 'thought she was much older.' One other excerpt revealed by Taylor even appears to blame his victims for their predicament, saying: 'They are here against their will because they made a mistake of getting in a car with a total stranger.' Castro has been charged with four . counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Two of his brothers were . also arrested on Monday, but have not been charged in connection to the . case. Police announced the charges on Wednesday - two days after Castro and his two brothers Pedro and Onil were arrested.

Castro will make his first court appearance on Thursday amid tight security at Cleveland Municipal Court. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, police chief Ed Tomba said the women did not have any opportunity to escape and had only been outside the house twice in the last ten years. 'We were told they left the house and went into the garage in disguise. They never left the property.' He added: 'The first time they have been outside the house in ten years was when they escaped from the house' he said. He said Castro had been cooperating fully with police and had made a detailed statement having read his rights.

"Fitting an airport into an area that measures just 2.3 square miles was never going to be easy task. Thankfully, Gibraltar had a novel way of solving the issue. The airport which serves the British overseas territory has made full use of the minimal space and lack of flat land available by building its only runway through the heart of the peninsula’s busiest road. Scroll down for video . The History Channel programme Most Extreme Airports once ranked Gibraltar's airport as the fifth most extreme airport in the world . Gibraltar airport has made full use of the minimal space and lack of flat land available by building its only runway through the heart of one of the peninsula’s busiest roads . It means that cars travelling along Winston Churchill Avenue must stop for planes several times a day. For about 10 minutes, traffic stays at a standstill to allow a flights to depart and arrive from UK cities including London, Birmingham, or Manchester. A pair of barriers close ahead of every landing and departure, which currently number around 30 a week, all flying to and from the United Kingdom. The airport is just 500 yards from the centre of Gibraltar - the shortest commute of any major airport in the world. As well as serving cars and other vehicles, the road also carries pedestrians in and out of Gibraltar. There are currently three flights operated daily to Gatwick and Luton, and three flights a week to Manchester . It was in 2007 the government released plans for a new four-lane road that would divert traffic through a tunnel under the runway . As a result, the History Channel programme Most Extreme Airports once ranked the airport the fifth most extreme airport in the world. Gibraltar is a self-governing British overseas territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula and Europe, overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar. It has been under British sovereignty for over 300 years after it was captured by the UK in 1704. It was formally ceded by Spain in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, although the Spanish have long disputed the UK's sovereignty, arguing that the Rock should be returned. As well as serving cars and other vehicles, the road also carries pedestrians in and out of Gibraltar . For about 10 minutes, traffic stays at a standstill to allow a flights to depart and arrive from UK cities including London, Birmingham, or Manchester . Pedestrians and cars are held at barriers on either side of the runway while a plane taxis across the four-lane Winston Churchill Avenue after landing . The airport was constructed during World War II when Gibraltar was an important naval base for the British and was built over a horse racing track. Originally opened in 1939, it was only an emergency airfield for the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. However, the runway was later extended into the Bay of Gibraltar using rock blasted from the historic Rock of Gibraltar which was being excavated by the military who were creating a series of tunnels inside. The four-lane main road was then added which leads from the centre of Gibraltar, through the airport, and up to the Spanish border which lies just north of the runway. At one stage, the road across the runway was considered to be constraining operations at the airport because of the increase in traffic following the signing of the Córdoba Agreement in 2006. The airport is 500 yards from the centre of Gibraltar - the shortest commute of any major airport in the world . While the average time the road is closed for an aircraft to land or depart is ten minutes on certain days the road is closed for over two hours . The agreement between the Governments of Spain, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, opened up the airport to allow flights to and from Spain which had previously been banned because of tensions between the two countries. Prior to this agreement, only three flights operated daily to Gatwick and Luton, and three flights a week to Manchester. The airport is frequently used by visitors and tourists travelling to or from neighbouring parts of the southern Spain such as the Costa del Sol, and handles more than 300,000 visitors a year in addition to frequent cargo flights. On busy days some seven flights now arrive and depart. While the average time the road is closed for an aircraft to land or depart is ten minutes on certain days the road can be closed for over two hours. It was in 2007 the government released plans for a new four-lane road that would divert traffic through a tunnel under the runway. The road, scheduled to open in 2009, has still not been completed.","Gibraltar airport has been built within the 2.3 square mile peninsula .

"More than 50 people have been massacred in a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo by machete and axe-wielding attackers. The killings happened yesterday near the Ugandan border around 10km from the town of Beni, where the army and UN peacekeepers are stationed. Government officials blamed the massacre on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group. More than 50 people were massacred in a Congo village near Beni (pictured) on the Ugandan border . Officials added that more than 200 people have been killed near Beni since early October by the ADF. North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told Reuters nine bodies . had arrived at the morgue in the nearby town of Oicha but said . the toll could rise. He also blamed the Ugandan rebels and said: 'They were savagely killed by the ADF.' The killings occurred in the troubled east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near the town of Beni . 'It was far from the . main road. About 12 kilometres from Mavivi, I believe, in the . bush.' Amisi Kalonda, the regional administrator, told the BBC that searches were ongoing as the dead were spread out across the forest. In Beni, UN peacekeeping mission spokesman Major Raphael Shonza said he could not confirm details of the attacks would send troops on Saturday to the site of the violence. The ADF, a secretive organisation formed in the 1990s to fight the Ugandan government, has also been linked to a string of recent attacks in eastern Congo. But some analysts have questioned this assessment. Blue helmet members of MONUSCO sit on the back of a UN pick-up truck in Beni last month . The massacre comes after demonstrators -- some armed with spears, machetes and arrows -- recently barricaded roads in the troubled east of the country after a peacekeeper allegedly shot and killed a man in a dispute over motorbikes blocking the passage of a UN convoy. After angry crowds descended on the town of Mbau, a protester was killed and two others badly wounded after clashes with the police.","Killings happened near town of Beni where UN peacekeepers are stationed .

"Alleged Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is awake and responding to questions in his hospital bed. The 19-year-old is responding sporadically in writing to questions from investigators regarding other cell members and other unexploded bombs, law enforcement officials said. Agents are quizzing Tsarnaev about whether he had any accomplices who helped him carry out his attacks. The news comes as it is revealed Tsarnaev, who is badly wounded in the throat, meekly pulled up his shirt to show officers that he was not wearing a vest strapped with explosives on Friday night as he emerged from the boat he had been cowering in. 'At the end they were just making demands of him: Show your hands, lift your shirt. And eventually that's what he did,' Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told ABC News. 'He was very slow and lethargic in every move that he made and they could see that there was no device on his chest. They kept creeping closer to him and then they felt it safe enough to pull him away from the boat.' Authorities initially said they couldn't question the terror suspect because of his severe throat wound. Tsarnaev is believed to have shoved his pistol in his own mouth and . pulled the trigger in a failed suicide attempt as SWAT officers and federal agents closed in on his backyard hiding place. However, instead of killing . him, the bullet simply tore through his neck. CNN reported earlier today that Tsarnaev was 'intubated and sedated' at a Boston hospital. Scroll down for video . Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound . Wounded: Tsarnaev was immediately loaded into an ambulance and rushed to the hospital, where he remains in serious condition . Site: A blood stain can be seen on the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding after a massive manhunt that left the Boston area paralyzed in fear . Hiding out: This is a surveillance video image of Tsarnaev getting out of the boat where he was pinned down on Friday night . The Boston police commissioner said . Tsarnaev is in 'critical but stable' condition on Sunday - which appears . to be a downgrade from reports earlier this weekend that his condition . was only 'serious.' Boston Mayor Tom Menino had earlier feared that federal agents would never be able to interview Tsarnaev but it seems that investigators may already be making progress. Police sources told MailOnline that investigators are looking into the possibility that Tsarnaev . and his older brother Tamerlan had a suicide pact so that neither of . them could be taken alive and put on trial. Authorities believe Dzhokhar likely killed him brother, who was handcuffed, when he ran over him. A suicide pact could also explain why 19-year-old Dzhokhar ran over his own brother in his stolen Mercedes SUV as he escaped from the scene, the sources added. Tamerlan was killed early Friday after a running gun battle with police. Doctors say he appeared to have multiple gunshot wounds, blast injuries and major trauma from being hit and dragged by his brother's car. The new twist in the story of Tsarnaev's . dramatic capture comes as the Boston police commissioner warns that he . and Tamerlan were plotting more bomb attacks on the city and they were . caught just in time. Authorities insisted that the pair were working . alone. Ed Davis said the bombers were . flushed out of hiding when the FBI released close-up surveillance video . of their faces and asked for the public's help in tracking them down. 'The news conference forced them out of their hideout . and they decided to commit further violent acts. But it’s my belief that . they were already manufacturing explosive devices. Further violent acts . were inevitable,' Davis told The Boston Globe. New video also revealed the final moments of Dzhokha's . standoff with police. The images come from a thermal imaging camera . aboard a Massachusetts State Police helicopter that was hovering above . the dramatic police standoff. Tsarnaev, 19, was captured by police on . Friday night after the boat's owner found him hiding out when he went to check on his beloved watercraft in that was . parked on a trailer at a house in suburban Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is awake and responding to questions. Authorities are anxious to talk to him to learn his motives behind the attack . Still: The suspect appears to be laying flat in the boat in the final moments before his capture . In hiding: The dramatic footage released by police shows where the teenager lay hiding in a boat in the quiet suburban neighbourhood of Watertown . Blast: Video appears to show a flash grenade being thrown into the boat where the suspect hid . Show of force: The Massachusetts State Police has released this video showing an explosion resulting from a grenade thrown into the boat where the suspect lay . It is believed that federal . prosecutors are putting the final touches together on charges against . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and could filed them today. The most serious charge . available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass . destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick revealed on Sunday that surveillance . video from the Boston Marathon attack shows one suspect dropping his . backpack and calmly walking away from it before the bomb inside it . exploded. The video clearly puts 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at the scene of the attack, Patrick said on NBC. 'It . does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, . put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then . moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,' Patrick . said. 'It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, . frankly.' Tsarnaev reportedly lost significant . amounts of blood after suffering two wounds. One was a gunshot to the . leg he sustained during a running gun battle with police early Friday. Another was the wound to his neck. CBS News . correspondent John Miller reports: 'They say it appears from the wound . that he might have stuck a gun in his mouth, and fired and actually just . went out the back of his neck without killing him. 'That's . one of the reasons he's unable to communicate, but he can understand . what they're saying. And they believe there will be a point where he . will be able to talk to him.' Law enforcement sources tell MailOnline that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were determined not to be taken alive. Dzhokhar was also responsible for driving over his brother as he was being handcuffed by police following a fierce gun battle in Watertown in the predawn hours of Friday. The teen floored a stolen Mercedes SUV and drove it straight at the police and his 26-year-old brother who was on the ground after being seized. The police were able to jump out of the way - but Tamlerlan was dragged for up to 40 feet under the wheels of the speeding car. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old . brother Tamerlan 'were going to attack other individuals' —says Boston police commissioner Davis and . says that opinion is based on the evidence at the scene and the cache of weapons . the brothers had at their disposal. Planning further atrocities?: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan were believed to be about to unleash further terror attacks on Boston according to the city's police commissioner . The crush injuries are thought to have contributed to his death but police have yet to reveal an exact cause of death. 'These guys did not have an exit plan . after the bombing, and from they way they have both ended up it looks . like they planned on never being taken alive,' said a law enforcement . source. 'Why else would this kid drive over . his brother. It does not make any sense until you realize he also tried . to take his own life. They had some sort of suicide pact worked out so . they would not be taken alive.' Exactly . what happened in the boat remains unclear. Neighbors reported hearing . police SWAT officers unleash several bursts of automatic weapons fire as . they closed in on the 25-foot vessel. A police robot tore open the cover of the boat and a state police helicopter used an infrared camera to reveal Tsarnaev's location in the stern. Officers lobbed flash grenades into the boat in attempt to stun the suspect and called from him to surrender. He later climbed out of the boat and surrendered. After he was taken into custody, he was rushed to the hospital. Suspects: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, was reportedly run over by his accomplice and younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19 . Evidence: Investigators gather evidence on Saturday, near the location in Watertown, Mass., where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was captured . Many reports say he climbed out of the boat on his own power. The Los Angeles Times reports that Tsarnaev was swearing profusely in the ambulance. However, Boston Mayor Menino said Tsarnaev was in 'very serious' condition at a Boston . hospital after being captured Friday night. 'And we don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,' he said without elaborating. The suspect later awoke and is now communicating with investigators in writing. Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana . Republican who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said earlier that it was . questionable whether Tsarnaev would . be able to talk again. 'The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat,' Coats said. 'It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a . condition where we can't get any information from him at all. 'We . are hoping, for a host of reasons, that the suspect survives, because . we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered,' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said.

"Arrested: The prime suspect has been identified as 52-year-old Ariel Castro . The prime suspect in the astonishing kidnapping case of three women held captive for ten years posted a final message on Facebook saying: 'Miracles really do happen'. Ariel Castro, 52, of Cleveland, Ohio, was arrested on Monday after one of his alleged victims escaped his home and called police and is now in custody along with his two brothers. Neighbors in the street were shocked to hear that Castro, who was a school bus driver in the Cleveland area until last year, could be capable of abducting three innocent teenagers from the street and tying them up with chains in his basement. Castro's Facebook page depicts a man with a passion for motorcycles and the bass guitar. His last post to the social networking site on May 2 says: 'Miracles really do happen, God is good :)' The man who came to Amanda Berry's rescue, Charles Ramsey, expressed disbelief that his neighbor could be capable of such a disturbed and shocking crime. He told NewsNet5: 'I've been here a year. I barbeque with this dude, we eat ribs and what not and listen to salsa music. Not a clue that that girl was in that house or that anyone else was in there with. 'He just comes out to his backyard, plays with the dogs, tinkering with his cars and motorcycles and goes back in the house. 'He's somebody you look and then you look away because he's just doing normal stuff. You got some big testicles to pull this one off because we see this guy every day.' Sources close to local station WOIO said the women were reportedly tied up during their captivity and police found chains hanging from one of the ceilings . They also reported there were signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house, though police continue to investigate whether or not the dirt will lead to any new evidence in the case.

Occasionally, he would turn on a dim . porch light, but the house was always dark, she told The Plain Dealer. Shades blocked the windows, and at least one window was boarded up. Gomez said he never had much to say, she said. He would say 'Hi' back, but there was never much conversation. The . county prosecutor joined dozens of police officers and sheriff's . deputies at the scene as they began searching the house late on Monday. Authorities say the women have been taken to a hospital to reunite with relatives and seem to be in good health. Michelle Knight had been missing since 2002, Amanda Berry since 2003 and Gina DeJesus since 2004. Remarkably, Castro's son - also named Ariel who . now goes by 'Anthony' - penned an article for the Cleveland Plain Press . about the disappearance of Miss DeJesus back in 2004 when he was a journalism student. He even interviewed her mother for the piece, not knowing that the teen was tied up in a basement owned by his father. He started the story with: 'Neighborhood residents have been taken by an overwhelming need for . caution. Parents are more strictly enforcing curfews, encouraging their . children to walk in groups, or driving them to and from school when they . had previously walked alone. 'One thing is for certain, however. Almost everyone feels a connection . with the family, and Gina’s disappearance has the whole area talking.' Mother Nancy Ruiz told him at the time: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids. 'It’s a shame that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors. Bless their hearts, they’ve been great.' Anthony Castro told WKYC-TV reporter Sara Shookman yesterday: 'This is beyond comprehension … I’m truly stunned right now.' Neighbor Juan Perez told News Channel 5 about Castro: 'He was a nice guy, he would come around and say hi.

Also struck by the allegations, the suspects' uncle, Julio Castro, told CNN: 'I never want to see them again. For me, it's bad on one side and good on the other side.'

He said he . believes his nephew knew the family from the club and the neighborhood. Another neighbor Juan Perez told News Channel 5: 'He was a nice guy, he would come around and say hi. He gave the kids rides up and down the street on his four-wheeler. 'I’ve known him since I was like five or six years old myself, he would asked me if I wanted a ride. He seemed like he was a good guy to the kids that were here, I don't think he had any bad (attention).' He also revealed that his sister once heard a scream come from the home and called police but nothing ever came of it. Looking back, he said, he should have seen the signs that something was not quite right. 'Now it's like, red-flag, red-flag, red-flag, somebody should've said something and my sister actually a few years ago heard a scream and she called police. 'He was a fun guy. I mean, parents trusted him. He talked to the parents. He was just a regular guy on the street. He put on that great mask that everyone thought he was a good guy.' Police didn't immediately provide any . details of how the women were found but said they appeared to be in . good health and had been taken to a hospital to be reunited with . relatives and to be evaluated. They said a six-year-old also was found in the home. On a recorded 911 call Monday, Amanda declared: 'I'm Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years.' She . said she had been taken by someone and begged for police officers to . arrive at the home on Cleveland's west side before he returned. House of horrors: Only Castro is believed to have lived in the house where the women were found . Other case: Gina DeJesus went missing in 2004 on . her way home from school, and her parents think that part of the reason . why her case was not given much attention was because no Amber Alert . was issued since no one actually saw the abduction take place .

"Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will this week deliver a stark warning – that Britain will 'run out of electricity' unless it abandons its main green energy target. Mr Paterson, who was sacked from the Cabinet in this summer's reshuffle, will argue in a lecture that the target enshrined in the Climate Change Act – which binds the UK to reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 – is unaffordable. He will go on to say that the current energy policy is a 'slave to flawed climate action', and warn that 'in the short and medium term costs to consumers will rise dramatically'. Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will argue that Britain will 'run out of electricity' unless it abandons its main green energy target . In Wednesday's lecture, organised by the 'sceptic' think-tank Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is chaired by former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, he will say: 'There can only be one ultimate consequence: the lights will go out.' Because the Act forces Britain to invest in renewable electricity sources, mainly wind, he claims it 'blocks other feasible policies that would cut both emissions and costs'. Previous energy secretaries –Labour's Ed Miliband and the Liberal Democrats' Chris Huhne – claimed to want to help the poor, he will say. But Mr Paterson believes their actions led to 'the most regressive policy since the Sheriff of Nottingham' – with vast subsidies on consumers' bills going straight to the pockets of landowners and green investors. At an event organised by the 'sceptic' think-tank Global Warming Policy Foundation, the former minister will say: 'There can only be one ultimate consequence: the lights will go out' He will go on to stress that although he has been accused of being a 'climate denier', he accepts the main points of greenhouse theory. But he will point out that temperatures have risen much more slowly than scientists predicted, while by some measures, the current 'pause' in global warming has already lasted for 18 years. To stand a chance of meeting its obligations, Britain should be building a new giant nuclear power station every three years, as well as thousands more of the turbines which have 'devastated landscapes, blighted views, killed eagles and carpeted the very wilderness that [greens] claim to love'. Instead, Mr Paterson will argue, policy should focus on supplying cheap energy and cutting emissions. This, he says, can best be done by fracking for shale gas and building small gas and nuclear-powered electricity stations. Mr Paterson told The Mail on Sunday that adding green energy costs to people's household bills and building onshore wind farms are policies that are sending Tory voters into the arms of Ukip – the only party committed to scrapping them. 'Ukip's opposition to green energy targets and wind is tapping a tremendous tide of anger felt across the country,' Mr Paterson said, adding: 'Everywhere I go, this issue comes up all the time. You could live with that if the policy was actually working, but it's not. If we change direction on this it will make a huge difference. 'It's an opportunity for the Tories to steal one of Ukip's most popular campaigns.' Changing course would require the Climate Change Act's suspension, and possibly its eventual repeal, while the separate targets imposed by the EU would have to be part of the treaty renegotiation Mr Cameron has promised if the Tories win next year's election. Mr Paterson insisted he was not trying to embarrass the Tory leadership, saying: 'I want to be seen as a constructive critic.' He added: 'I represent people who are not well off, old age pensioners, people who run businesses, and they've all got to pay their bills. 'Under current policy, we will fail on emissions targets, and we will fail to deliver a reliable energy supply. 'I think a large majority of Tory MPs will be sympathetic to what I'm saying.'","Owen Paterson will warn energy policy is a 'slave to flawed climate action'

"A Florida woman who allegedly stole a credit card and willingly posed for a photo with the pocketed plastic was arrested on Tuesday. Mashana Harris, 26, was nabbed by police at an Ocala motel and has been charged with felony fraud for stealing a card belonging to 74-year-old Josephine Lupo.

Harris supposedly illegally bought goods at Family Dollar and Looking Good Beauty Supply shop. After seeing a hefty false transaction, Police contacted Looking Good Beauty Supply and spoke with the clerk Addel Kassem who 'did not feel comfortable' with the $430 purchase when it occurred so he asked Harris to take a photo with the credit card. She obliged. The credit card scam was reported after the 74-year-old victim saw several false transactions on her credit card and went to the police. This is not the first time Harris has been arrested. Her record points to arrests for larceny, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.

"Torture claims: Ahmed Zeidan said he just wanted the treatment to stop, so he signed a confession . A British student sentenced to nine years in prison last week for possessing cocaine worth less than £5 says he was brutally tortured into making a false confession, written in a language he does not understand. Ahmad Zeidan, 21, who was born and brought up in Reading, Berkshire, was studying aviation in Dubai. He was arrested last December in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah. In a dramatic phone call to this newspaper from his cell two days after his trial in Dubai, he said he only signed the confession, in Arabic, because he was hooded, repeatedly beaten, stripped naked and threatened with sexual assault. ‘I didn’t know what I was signing. I can’t read Arabic,’ he said. ‘But I wanted the torture to stop.’ Zeidan said he had gone for a drive with two acquaintances one evening when the car, being driven by a man he barely knew, was stopped by police. The drugs – just 0.04g of cocaine, with a British street value of about £3 – were found in a bag in the glove compartment. The two other men received much shorter sentences last week of four and six years. Zeidan said his was longer because he faced a charge of ‘inciting’ the others to use the drug – on the basis of the disputed confession. ‘I had no idea there were drugs in the car. I only signed the papers after hours and hours of torture that went on for days,’ he said. ‘Every time the guards’ shift changed, they would beat me. They stripped me and said they would have me raped.’ Another prisoner, facing trial on rape charges, was moved into his cell and threatened to sexually assault him. When he complained, he was beaten again, then put in solitary confinement. Zeidan studied in Dubai (pictured) in the UAE, where human rights lawyers have alleged 20 torture cases . He added: ‘For eight days I just disappeared. My family had no idea where I was, and they [the authorities] wouldn’t let me call the British Embassy. 'A lot of the time I was hooded. They were the worst days of my life.’ Foreign Office documents seen by this newspaper say that when Zeidan was finally allowed to meet consular staff, UK officials raised his claims with the Sharjah authorities. They were told he was being punished for making ‘false allegations’ about the rape threat. Last week, lawyers from Reprieve, the human rights charity, submitted a dossier to the UN, setting out details of 20 cases of alleged torture in the United Arab Emirates – Zeidan’s included. Three of the cases involve British citizens. The use of torture by Emirates police is ‘systematic’, the dossier says.","Ahmad Zeidan, from Reading, Berkshire, 'beaten and stripped naked'

"For Elle Watmough, it would be an understatement to say the prospect of having a child with the love of her life is exciting. But the 25-year-old, who began trying for a baby through IVF since she became engaged to NRL player Anthony Watmough nearly four years ago, has been enduring years of physical and emotional pain. Having kept her struggles private for the past few years, the former model and her husband who live in Dee Why - northern Sydney - made the decision to share their story on a blog on Friday. While it was difficult to reveal some of the intimate details of her personal life, Mrs Watmough told Daily Mail Australia her aim isn't to gain sympathy nor to shed negative light on IVF. Instead she wants to urge women to educate themselves about their own health and body as she found out the hard way that not all medical professionals are accurate with their prognosis. Scroll down for video . Elle Watmough says she's been undergoing IVF treatment for three years when she became engaged to Anthony Watmough . But the 25-year-old has revealed that she's endured years of pain whilst trying to fall pregnant . Mrs Watmough recounted the troubling moments she underwent during the IVF process, including when she found out she had endometriosis - a hormonal and immune system disease with symptoms such as painful periods and reduced fertility. Endometriosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease. It occurs when cells from the Endometrium (uterus) migrate to the pelvic cavity, causing lesions and inflammation. Endometriosis can also attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, bladder and other organs. The symptoms of endometriosis include: . Many women think that painful periods are normal. If you have bad period pain, you should see your doctor and mention the possibility of endometriosis. Not all women experience typical symptoms of endometriosis. They may not discover it until it has already damaged their reproductive organs. Endometriosis is one of the three leading causes of infertility in women. 'I cried. I even screamed. I told my doctors it was my body and I knew something wasn't right. I was told I had ""unexplained infertility"",' Mrs Watmough wrote on her blog. 'They couldn't find anything that was wrong with myself or my husband. Every time my doctor called to speak to me after a failed cycle, she told me she was ""baffled"". For some unknown reason it just wasn't working and not even the doctors could tell us why. I was told to be patient. 'I was FINALLY admitted into surgery at North Shore Private Hospital [in Sydney]. I was told it would be a one hour procedure to ""have a look around"". 'They didn't expect to find anything. Six hours later I woke up with a catheter in, to be told I had severe stage 4 endometriosis with benign tumours that had fused my bladder and bowel together. My endometriosis was so bad that it was from the top of my uterus right down to my bottom and covering many major organs. The doctor actually asked me how I was even able to physically try for a baby without excruciating pain. 'We were absolutely bewildered when told that I should never have undergone IVF or any fertility treatment before the endometriosis was removed because it makes it worse, and even if by some miracle an embryo was able to implant and grow, chances are I would miscarry before term due to the state of my uterine cavity.' This was just three months ago. Needless to say Mrs Watmough felt betrayed and angry to find that the tens and thousands of dollars spent on treatments, the four miscarriages and the six injections she took every day upon other medication  could have all been prevented had the doctors listened to her years ago. The former model posted a photo of some drugs she had to inject daily which caused huge bruises all over her body . Mrs Watmough's eggs shown on an ultrasound. However she's since had four miscarriages . The IVF embryo transfer room - a process which has been described as 'invasive and unpleasant' 'It's been emotionally draining,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Doctors were telling me I was overreacting and I've been putting my body under a lot of strain, taking unnecessary medication just because it was an easy way out for doctors. 'I've been in pain for six years and the doctors haven't listened to me and we've been put through numerous miscarriages. That makes me angry.' Mrs Watmough, who married the former Manly Sea Eagles in January last year, says it's impossible to lead a normal life when undergoing IVF. But the pressure she placed on herself, of being a young and healthy, also added to her stress. 'You judge yourself if you do something ""bad"" and wonder if you screwed the whole process up, and are left riddled with guilt,' she wrote in her blog. 'Its beyond devastating. Each month you are SURE it worked. And when it doesn't, you feel like a complete failure. 'How can something that is meant to be so natural become so difficult? Isn't this the sole thing a women is MEANT to be able to do? 'No matter how many people tell you its not your fault..at the end of the day you feel like it is.' Mrs Watmough says she is grateful for the support of her husband, extended family and friends . The couple married in January last year and live with Mr Watmough's two children . The former Manly Sea Eagles player recently announced he has signed with the Parramatta Eels club . Although Mrs Watmough feels 'completely let down and betrayed by professionals', she is also left with regret and wishing that she had sought for more medical advice years ago. 'Considering my condition is stage 4, it is safe to assume if they had investigated it years ago we would have caught it earlier,' she wrote. 'I wish that I hadn't let doctors put me on dangerous steroids. I wish I had trusted my gut before I trusted fertility experts to do the right by me and my husband. And I wish I had someone my age to talk to that had been through this process - because that's the hardest part, finding someone to relate to. 'I wish I hadn't had to put my future health in jeopardy with fertility hormones being linked to future cancers. My goal is to bring to light the importance of pushing to have conditions investigated, because you may not need to go down this path.' For now, she's on the mend with the support of her family, including her two step children and 30-year-old husband who also recently announced he has signed with the Parramatta Eels club. But Mrs Watmough still isn't 100 per cent. 'I don't know what to do next and we haven't found a cure but I made the conscious decision to take a break from it all because I wasn't in the right emotional state and if I had started trying again, I'd think to myself: ""what's the point"",' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The IVF process is intense. The needles are fat and I had bruises all over my stomach so when I ran out of room I had to inject in my bum. 'But I'm not bagging out IVF because I know it's been great for some of my friends. It's just that my case was mismanaged. 'So I just want women to be in charge of their own bodies because it's important to educate yourself on your own health and to get a second opinion.' Mrs Watmough says she's glad that she made her story public. 'It was hard to write my story and quite emotional for me but I feel like it has been very rewarding,' she said. 'I have also received so many private messages from many women in the same boat. I can finally relate to women who are going through the same ordeal and we can all talk and hear each other's stories. Weirdly it's very empowering.'","Elle Watmough, 25, has been undergoing IVF treatment since she became engaged to NRL player Anthony Watmough .

He was allowed a five minute break every hour, and sipped on green tea and a ginger drink for energy.

"Concerns: A previously hidden email from NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh criticised 'persistently high' death rates in Welsh hospitals . Labour has been accused of trying to cover up warnings over high death rates and lengthy waiting times at hospitals in Wales. An email written by Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director in England, said mortality rates at six sites were ‘persistently high’ and criticised ‘worrying’ waits for cancer tests. But it has emerged that officials in the devolved government tried to suppress the message’s release because the information it contained would ‘prejudice the conduct of public affairs’. Sir Bruce’s email to Dr Chris Jones, his counterpart in Wales, was only uncovered when it was released under Freedom of Information laws. An email sent by the director of corporate and legal services at the Welsh Government, Joanna Jordan, to NHS England, argues that there is a risk the two medical directors might be too scared to communicate with each other in future. The details were uncovered by Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie – again using Freedom of Information laws – who accused the devolved Labour Government in Wales of being ‘committed to cover-ups.’ ‘If it was not for Sir Bruce Keogh, this evidence of potentially fatal diagnostic waiting times, and high mortality rates would probably have been hidden from the public and the welsh people, to protect political careers and pensions.’ In her email sent to NHS England in February – days before the information was released – Joanna Jordan argues that it should not be made public because the medical directors need ‘a safe space.’ It adds: ‘Disclosure of the records of these conversations would likely undermine this safe space, and would severely limit the ability of Medical directors in England and the devolved administrations raising and work through sensitive and complex issues together. She says the email is a follow-up to an earlier phone-call to NHS England – presumably trying to block the release of information – and adds that Wales’ First Minister, Carwyn Jones, ‘is very likely to support our approach.’ Yet despite Sir Bruce’s warning email five months ago, the Welsh NHS have still failed to investigate death rates and waiting times. Miss Leslie, who sits on the health select committee added: ‘This all reeks of the fatal cover-ups at Mid Staffs. The Labour party say they have learned lessons from the Mid Staffs scandal. 'If they have, for the sake of Welsh patients, I would make a plea to Andy Burnham to prevail upon his Welsh Labour colleagues to make them agree to conduct a Bruce-Keogh style review of safety in the Welsh NHS. 'Likely support': A government lawyer implied that First Minister Carwyn Jones supported the email being suppressed . ‘The time for attacking the messenger is over, we need urgent action. Lives could be at stake.’ The situation in Wales has prompted thousands of patients to cross the border to English hospitals in the hope of better treatment and shorter waits. Concerns have also been raised by Labour MP Ann Clwyd who emotionally revealed the shocking care of her husband Owen in 2012 at one of those hospitals with high death rates, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Latest figures show that 15 out of the 18 district general hospitals in Wales have higher than average mortality rates. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, South Wales, said: ‘This smacks of a cover-up. I’m hugely concerned by the plummeting standards of care in Wales. ‘People are queuing up to get out of the Welsh system to come to England because they are worried about the lack of care and much longer waits. Now it seems the Assembly is deliberately trying to cover up the very serious concerns. ‘What’s happening in Wales should serve as a warning sign to anyone thinking of voting Labour in the next general election. The NHS cannot be trusted in their hands.’ Deadly: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is one of those with high death rates . Welsh Assembly Member Darren Millar, the Shadow Health Minister in Wales, said, ‘The Labour ministers in the Welsh Government have been caught red handed trying to cover up concerns from England’s most senior clinician about high death rates in Welsh hospitals and excessively long waiting times. ‘The 2013 data shows that every hospital . in Wales, bar three, has a death rate above the England and Wales . average yet Labour Ministers wanted to keep it all hush-hush to avoid . criticism and refused to take advice and investigate - it’s a disgrace. A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'These emails have been in the public domain for three months. 'This letter was sent as part of the normal process of considering an FOI request. 'The Welsh NHS is open and transparent - our diagnostic waiting times are published every month and mortality rates are published every quarter.' ‘If anywhere else in the UK had death rates as high as some of those in Wales, there would have been a Mid Staffs-style investigation by now, but Labour are shamefully covering up their own failure for narrow party political reasons.’ ‘The Welsh NHS is on its knees, reeling from Labour’s record-breaking cuts, closures and cancellations. Patients deserve better.’ Unlike the NHS in England, whose budget has been protected from public spending cuts, the Welsh Government have slashed theirs by eight per cent since 2009. In addition, Welsh Labour health ministers rejected Tony Blair’s target regime and allow private sector firms to carry out some NHS treatment which have both been credited with bringing down waiting times. Figures show that almost 50 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer compared with a 1 per cent figure in England. And Wales refused to implement a National Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval, meaning many patients are denied life-saving drugs they can get in England.","Government tried to cover up release of email from Sir Bruce Keogh .

"Former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Rakib Amin became involved with militant group Isis after breaking up with his fiancée, it has been claimed . A British man who appeared in a recruitment video for Islamic militant group Isis became involved with the group after breaking up with his fiancée, it has been claimed. Former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Rakib Amin was identified this week as the third Briton in the recruitment video for the hardline Al-Qaeda-linked terror group. Former school friends and neighbours have spoken of their shock after he was identified in the video. It has now been claimed he became involved with the militant group after splitting up with his girlfriend. One friend told The Sun: 'I think that was the turning point. He was vulnerable - and that made him easy pickings for the monsters who have brainwashed him.' Amin was filmed alongside fellow Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana, both 20, urging other Muslims to fight for Isis in the Middle East. Wearing wrap-around sunglasses and a white scarf around his head, Amin describes jihad as ‘the cure for depression’ in the video. Speaking in front of Isis’s black flag, he says: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have? Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah? ‘Definitely, if you sacrifice something for Allah, Allah will give you 700 times more than this.’ Amin was educated in Aberdeen after . moving from Bangladesh and his family left the Scottish city for . Leicester a few years ago, according to reports. Stunned former classmates have described how Amin was a 'really outgoing guy' who 'could have done really well for himself.' Amin (right) was identified this week as the third Briton in the recruitment video for the hardline Al-Qaeda-linked terror group . It has now been claimed Amin became involved with the militant group after splitting up with his girlfriend . Former classmate Naz Hussain said: 'He seemed like a really nice guy, outgoing, up for a laugh, a bit cheeky, getting into trouble now and then. 'Nothing like this I would have expected - how has somebody from Aberdeen managed to get involved with something like this? 'Fighting an organisation that people . are saying even Al Qaeda are scared of? When I knew him as a kid he was . all right, he wasn't overly religious. 'I would just see him at school, have a kick-about, always speak to him when I saw him in the street. Amin was filmed alongside fellow Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (pictured), both 20, urging other Muslims to fight for Isis in the Middle East . 'Then he suddenly changed, his appearance changed, he started growing a beard, but I never thought anything like this would happen. 'You can't just think if somebody becomes more religious in their appearance that they'll become involved in something like this. 'I didn't see him too often when he changed but I used to just see him on the street and say hi and things like that. 'He just seemed like a really outgoing guy, he was bright, he was clever, he could have done really well for himself and now he's doing something like this. 'All my pals on Facebook and that they're all going crazy for it, because everyone knew him, he was a popular guy people are just commenting and saying they can't believe it, they're not sure what's happened to him.' Neighbour Michael Hind, 65, said: 'I'd seen him about a few times and whenever I ran into him he was always really nice. 'There was always a bit of a crowd hanging around up there, some of the guys were a bit stand-offish but that guy would always say hello. 'He'd give my dog a good pet and be friendly to it. Unless it was a Friday and he was in his clothes for the mosque, he wouldn't pet the dog then. 'I think he used to go to the mosque quite often. I think they were very religious. But I'm surprised he's involved with something like this.' Ibrahim Alwawi, imam of the Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre, told the BBC: 'We, as the Muslim community in the city of Aberdeen, are shocked like everyone else. 'We are co-operating with the authorities as we usually do.' Meanwhile, . a mosque attended by two of the British jihadis fighting with Islamist . rebels in Syria has denied teaching extremist ideologies. 'He just seemed like a really outgoing . guy, he was bright, he was clever, he could have done really well for . himself and now he's doing something like this' - Naz Hussain . The Al-Manar Centre reportedly confirmed that two men who appeared in the Isis propaganda video had visited the mosque. But it denied encouraging members to take up arms to join extremists abroad. In a statement reported by Sky News, the Al-Manar Centre said: 'It is worth mentioning that ACT's stance is well known, that we are opposed to going to Syria or any other country, to participate in an armed struggle and have always made this clear. 'We have on many occasions tackled the issues of extreme ideologies. Indeed, feeling the responsibilities towards our local community, especially those concerning the youth, we have engaged with parents warning against such dangers. 'We would like to emphasise that the vast majority of the local Muslim community are law abiding British citizens. 'May . we reiterate our concerns that the internet has become an alarming . source for radicalisation of such vulnerable members of our British . society.' Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, both from . Cardiff, featured prominently in the polished video by Isis, which . urged Muslims in the West to join their fight. Wearing wrap-around sunglasses and a white scarf around his head, Amin describes jihad as 'the cure for depression' in the video . The father of a British teenager who is thought to be fighting with Isis in Syria has also spoken of his 'limitless grief' and begged his son to come home. Rahim Kalantar said he fears his 18-year-old son Ali may die fighting, kill innocent people or cause trouble if he returns to the UK. Addressing his son on the BBC, Mr Kalantar said: 'You are my son. When you return I will be beside you everywhere and all the time. I won't let others harm you, whether's it's in the UK or anywhere else.' 'Just come back. Return and put an end to the grief of your father, mother and sisters.' Mr Kalantar's anguish has been matched by the father of Nasser Muthana, who has said his son had 'betrayed' his country. Ahmed Muthana believes his other son, 17-year-old Aseel, is also in the Middle East and said they were 'brainwashed' in the UK.","Abdul Rakib Amin was identified this week as third Briton in Isis video .

"Women are losing their lead over men in life expectancy as they trade homemaking for careers. Work stress – and related drinking and smoking – are taking an increasing toll on their health, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 1963 men were twice as likely to die early as women. Last year however the increased risk fell to one and a half times and the life expectancy gap has fallen from six years to fewer than four. Scroll down for video . Mortality rates among women have fallen among all age groups since 1963, as the nation lives longer . The Office for National Statistics said in improvements in the health of men has lead to a rise in male life expectancy which has increased at a greater rate than for women . The ONS study is the first official recognition that women who have abandoned the domestic lives of their grandmothers now face the same shorter lifespans of men. ‘Ministers want women to work long hours when they have children, but these figures…indicates there may be public health problems as a result,’ said Laura Perrins of the pressure group Mothers at Home Matter. ‘There is clearly now a health interest in providing transferable tax allowances that would make it possible for people to stay at home with young children.’ Higher premature death rates for women were most marked in the 55 to 69 age group, the paper found. ‘Increases in women entering the labour force over the last 50 years are considered to have had an impact on stress, smoking and drinking, leading to changes in the health of females,’ said the ONS. It said male health had improved with lower smoking and drinking rates and fewer dangerous jobs in industrial environments. Two years ago ONS research found for the first time since the Victorian age that mortality rates were not improving among some groups of working women. They cited the ‘intermediate’ group that includes saleswomen, counter clerks, clerical workers in the public sector and medical and dental technicians. Women have always enjoyed greater life expectancy. But in recent years, while overall life expectancy has been rising, the gap between the sexes has been closing. Life expectancy for a child born between 2011 and 2013 went up to 78.9 for a boy and 82.7 for a girl, leaving a gap between the sexes of 3.8 years. Women's health has been adversely affected by growing numbers entering the labour market, and smoking and drinking, the ONS said . The move towards millions of women going out to work 'has had a negative impact on their health' However in the early 1980s life expectancy at birth was 70.8 for a boy and 76.8 for a girl – a gap of six years. In 1963 life expectancy at birth was 67.9 for a boy and 73.9 for a girl. Since then there has been an increase of around 11 years for men and nearly nine years for women. Women have been increasingly likely to adopt risky habits to the same level as men. In the mid-1970s, half of all men smoked but only four in ten women. By 2011 overall numbers of smokers had dropped, but women smoked nearly as much as men – 19 per cent against 21 per cent. State surveys also show that while levels of drinking are falling overall, they are falling at a slower rate for women than men. In 2011, 57 per cent of men were drinking at least once a week, against 54 per cent of women, with the gap halved over a period of just six years. Smoking and drinking levels have risen with the advance of women into working lives, a revolution in the lives of millions which has also resulted in women marrying later in life, if at all. The average age at which a woman has a child is now over 30, and numbers of women having children in their 40s has risen fivefold since the 1970s. Some analysts link higher stress levels in working women with the sharp rise in numbers who go to work while they have young families. Official figures this year showed the number of stay-at-home mothers has dropped to just over two million, down from three million 20 years ago. Researcher and author Patricia Morgan said: ‘Men’s life expectancy has been increasing in the way that could be predicted, because of less going down coal mines or falling off scaffolding. ‘However government policies that have put pressure on women to work, whether they want to or not, may not have been entirely a good thing. We may be looking at the unintended consequences of the economic pressure on women to go out to work throughout their lives.’","Increasing numbers of women have joined the labour market over 50 years .
ONS says this has lead to more stress, smoking and drinking by women .
In 1963, mortality rates among  men were at twice the rate for women .
By 2013, the gap had narrowed markedly to just 1.5 times, study shows ."
"Police have arrested a man in connection with arson attacks on four mobile phone and local radio transmission masts last week – the latest in a wave of attacks apparently perpetrated by a group or individual dubbed the ‘Bristol Unabomber’. The Mail on Sunday revealed two weeks ago that an ‘eco-terrorist’ anarchist group calling itself the Earth Liberation Front/Informal Anarchist Federation has claimed responsibility for about 50 attacks in the Bristol area over the past four years. They include earlier burnings of phone masts and vehicles belonging to local politicians and government agencies, the disabling of signal cables on two railway lines and the complete destruction by fire ten months ago of the Avon and Somerset Police firearms training centre, at a cost of £18million. A man has been arrested in connection with a wave of arson attacks on mobile phone masts serving the O2, Vodafone, T-mobile and EE networks across Bristol . Each time those responsible have struck, they have issued statements on the ‘Indymedia’ and ‘325.nostate’ websites, justifying their actions as part of a war on the British state and capitalist society. The attacks last Monday night on masts serving the O2, Vodafone, T-mobile and EE networks conformed to the usual pattern. According to the anarchists’ statement, they were timed to coincide with the World Cup, ‘to show our complicity with the insurgent fighters in Brazil as they answer massive dispossession and militarised slum clearances for the opulence of the games with street battles and arson’. The statement added: ‘It should be remembered that the enthralling spectacle… is staged to make the rich yet more money and to distract us from our daily humiliations.’ Police said the four attacks were probably linked, and that a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of four counts of arson. He was released on police bail while inquiries continue.

"She is the former star of The Only Way Is Essex who broke the rules by shunning fake tan, false eyelashes and skimpy body-con dresses in favour of a more natural and demure look. And . now, after a sell-out summer collection, TV star-turned-fashion-designer Lydia . Rose Bright is channelling her love of retro fashion in yet another clothing range. Taking inspiration from the vintage style she wears so well, Lydia has crafted the eponymous autumn/winter 13 collection using a nod to her love of timeless, feminine . designs with a subtle, sexy twist. She's back! Lydia Rose Bright has unveiled her third clothing collection and she says it's her best yet (Kylie dress, £75) Speaking about the creation of her third collection, the 22-year-old said: 'The inspiration behind this collection remains very similar. 'I still wanted my pieces to have the same influences and tell the same story. The collection is very vintage inspired, glamorous, sophisticated and timeless. 'I have taken inspiration from my favourite 1950s Hollywood style icons like Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn. 'Along with watching all my favourite designers on the catwalk showcasing their A/W ranges and picking up new trends.' Demure: Lydia says that she wants her clothes to exude sexiness without being too revealing (L- Spot, £70, R- Cara, £50) Vintage: Evolving the brand's signature aesthetic, the new collection combines iconic vintage silhouettes with playful, feminine detailing (L-Talia £50, R- Sandy, £80) Her first 10-piece capsule collection . was a fashion hit so she extended her range into a 25-piece . collection for spring and incorporated a lot more colour. She explained: 'This collection is my first autumn/winter range so I could experiment with a darker colour palette. I have chosen a rich berry, blood red, deep navy, soft greys and of course the staple black. 'I feel like this collection is my best to date as I really feel my clothes have a real identity now and a signature look. 'I now have a real understanding of my bestsellers and customer feedback so I believe this range has something for everyone.' Berry nice: Lydia's signature crochet detailing and unique ribbon ties have been recreated in a variety of rich berry shades for autumn (Evangeline £75) Dressing up: A staple for the Lydia Rose Bright collection, the midi-dress returns for AW13, updated for the new season in an array of statement colours (L- Larna, £80, R- Effie, £70) Unlike many of her former co-stars and Brentwood friends, Lydia has shunned the classic Essex look for a much more demure style - favouring vintage designs over figure-hugging bodycon dresses - and her new collection reflects this. She said: 'Looking sexy I believe doesn't mean showing as much as possible. Looking sexy is about being confident and wearing something that leaves men lusting for more. 'A dress should bring attention to your best assets. That is why I have designed dresses for all shapes and sizes. But they should not show every asset. This I believe always attracts the wrong attention.' Speaking about the pieces she like best from the new collection, she said: 'I have three drops for A/W13 and I have a favourite piece in every drop. 'It's hard to pick just one, but my I like pieces that sit off the shoulder.' Personal favourite: Lydia, who designed the whole collection from start to finish, loves the £75 off-the-shoulder Kitty dress . 'It's such a classic look and so hard to find dresses that sit on the shoulder comfortably. My favourite from the first drop is the Kitty.' Lydia was born into a fashion-mad . family - her mother Deb was a fashion buyer and her aunt was a designer - . so it came as no surprise to the Bright clan when Lydia ventured into . the world of fashion. The budding fashionista and her . sister Georgia May Bright were even honoured with a prestigious Drapers . award for the Independent top 100 fashion retailers for their . Essex boutique, Bella Sorella. Speaking about her success, Lydia said: 'I feel I have grown as a designer as I now have a really good knowledge about the whole process. Monochrome: Elegant pencil skirts and ladylike button up blouses complete the new Lydia Rose Bright collection (L-Penelope £50, R-Dolly, £75) 'From mood boards, drawing sketches, learning about the different qualities of fabrics, CADs, grading and buying meetings. I now have a lot more confidence with all these procedures and will carrying on learning more and more as each new collection evolves. 'I am still in love with my designing even when I have a break in between each collection I find myself cutting snippets from magazines and popping into vintage stores for inspiration. I am so grateful of the platform I have been given to launch me into the fashion industry.' And after such a successful foray into . the world of fashion, the future is most certainly looking bright for . the young starlet - and she is loving every minute. Fashionista: Lydia advises: 'Simply pair with chic courts and a slick of red lipstick for Mad Men inspired boardroom-to-bar style' This year, she will start her designs for spring/summer 14 and hopes to move into other areas of designing like footwear and accessories. She is also soon to start a UK summer tour of her store Bella Sorella where she will be opening seven pop-up shops around the UK in London, Bristol, Southampton, Liverpool, Glasgow, Redditch and Sheffield. She has also recently launched her own YouTube channel and online fashion blog along with two new online shows called Dating Dilemmas and Spin The Bottle.

"The attack was as daring as it  was destructive. In the early hours of August 27 last year, anarchists slipped through the cordon around a highly sensitive construction project: a firearms training centre for Avon and Somerset police, next to their HQ near Portishead. This is how the perpetrators boasted of what happened next when they claimed responsibility online: ‘We used accelerant to burn the major electrical cables at five junction points throughout the complex, and doused and lighted a pallet of fittings and wires… we left it with flames licking high.’ The blaze was so intense it took four days to put it out. The firearms centre – a state-of-the-art-facility designed to serve forces across the South West, with classrooms and two firing ranges – had been due to open within weeks. It was wrecked. Police said the cost of the damage was £18 million. The Bristol Bomber is believed to have been behind the arson attack on Avon and Somerset's new firearms training unit causing £18 million worth of damage. The blaze took four days to get under control . Local MP Charlotte Leslie said if this was the work of a religious extremist rather than an anarchist group it would be receiving far greater attention from the police and the media . There was an extensive investigation and . Chief Constable Nick Gargan promised they would catch whoever was . responsible by ‘developing the intelligence picture’. To date, they have . failed. They did make one arrest, but Mr Gargan – who is now suspended . following allegations of sexual harassment – has admitted this ‘didn’t . lead to anything productive’. Yet the anarchist or anarchists – dubbed the ‘Bristol Unabomber’, after reclusive American killer Ted Kaczynski, by a domestic extremism analyst who believes it is one person – is apparently not only laughing at the law, but has struck repeatedly, getting away with serious crimes time and again. For The Mail on Sunday can reveal that although the Portishead attack was the most costly, it was just one in a series of about 50 incidents in and around Bristol, dating back more than four years. Some are seemingly trivial: minor fires that soon fizzled out; graffiti daubings of businesses and paint-stripper thrown on cars. Others, however, are far more serious – and there is evidence that they are linked. No other UK city has been subject to anything remotely comparable. Yet the Avon and Somerset force have resisted suggestions that the many components are connected, despite an obvious common factor – the online claims of responsibility, all written in an outraged jargon that seems to reject every aspect of contemporary Britain. The Bristol Bomber claimed responsibility for the attack on the training centre, pictured, on behalf of a group opposed to culling badgers . Avon and Somerset police denied that yesterday's attack which forced the evacuation of more than 460 homes in Bristol was linked to the ongoing campaign of terror . Early yesterday, hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in the Fishponds area of Bristol, while police carried out a controlled explosion on a suspicious car. However, police said the incident was ‘isolated’. The most recent ‘Unabomber’ attack – by a home-made incendiary bomb that gutted the front and lobby of North Avon Magistrates’ Court – took place ten days ago, in the small hours of May 22. So far, no one has been injured, but some of the attacks might easily have led to loss of life. One of the worst took place in May 2012, when train signal cable wires were dug up and set on fire at two stations on Bristol’s network, Parson Street and Bedminster. The attacks have hit offices, vehicles and shops, targeting businesses  such as the supermarket Tesco, the banks Barclays and Santander, energy companies EDF and E.ON, and private security firms G4S and Serco. Royal Marines vehicles were set on fire at a base in the Clifton area in February, and three cars, two people carriers and a van were torched inside a UK Border Agency garage last year. The arsonist or arsonists have also destroyed cabling in television, radio, police and mobile phone transmitter masts at least four times, causing damage worth many tens of thousands of pounds. After an attack on a mast at Bathampton in April 2012, 80,000 homes lost their TV signal for several days. Calculating a total sum for the damage caused is difficult. But, adding the cost of the firearms to the masts, the railway and office attacks and the many vehicles damaged or destroyed, it must be more than £20 million. The Bristol Bomber also claimed responsibility for an attack on a UK Border Agency in Portishead, Bristol on June 21, 2013 . Each incident has followed a similar pattern: First the attack, then a long communique claiming responsibility, usually posted on the ‘Indymedia’ and international anarchist ‘325.nostate’ websites. These have often appeared before any reports have been carried by news media. They usually contain crucial and accurate details not reported elsewhere and, say analysts, are therefore almost certainly the work of those responsible. The statements justify the target, and the methods used. In the case of the firearms centre, the statement said: ‘The police and security industry specialise in making us feel powerless in our own lives, and making these attacks goes a long way to overcoming this feeling.’ According to the statement, this attack was mounted by a group called the ‘Angry Foxes Cell’. More usually, the organisations cited are the ‘Earth Liberation Front’ (ELF) and the ‘Informal Anarchist Federation’ (FAI). The statement issued after the court firebombing said it was carried out with ‘an IED [improvised explosive device]’ made of ten camping gas canisters and ‘home-made napalm’. It added: ‘The justice system tries to pass itself off as the only protection from the very same desperation  and imbalances that civilised society creates. Its real function is and has always been to protect and sanctify property and privilege above all.’ All the statements end the same way – with appeals for support for anarchists jailed abroad, in countries such as Greece, Italy and Mexico. Some are supposedly FAI members. As part of his campaign of terror, the Bristol Bomber attacked the front of North Avon Magistrates' Court with an improvised incendiary device, causing damage to the front entrance, pictured . The police have not so far admitted any of the attacks are linked – which, say some, is a grave mistake. A former police expert in domestic extremism, now working as a security consultant, told The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity: ‘We’ve been trying to draw Avon and Somerset’s attention to the obvious links between these attacks for more than two years. ‘There is clearly a pattern, yet they for a long time just didn’t seem to want to know. That means they ignored what should have been critical leads, such as the similarities between the online statements, and the clues they seem to contain.’ Charlotte Leslie, MP for Bristol North West, said ‘most people would be completely stunned’ to discover ‘this series of highly professional, apparently orchestrated attacks’. She added: ‘If these attacks were the work of a religious extremist, the police and the rest of the media would be all over them. Yet this is every bit as serious, and, potentially, every bit as dangerous. How far does this network go? Who is collaborating with it?’ This . newspaper spoke to two officers dealing with the attacks, Det Supt . Rachel Williams and Supt Kevin Instance. He admitted for the first time . that police are now pursuing connections between the statements, adding: . ‘There are similarities between some of the incidents, but as yet there . is nothing conclusive.’ The . connections might seem clear to national experts, but in Avon and . Somerset, he insisted, the police were ‘keeping an open mind’. Ms Williams added: ‘There probably are relatively few people causing significant amounts of damage, and they are being camouflaged by their communities.’ The striking fact about the attacks is the almost total absence of clues. Bristol is covered by a dense network of CCTV cameras, and yet these have provided no evidence strong enough to lead to an arrest.The attacker or attackers have never triggered an alarm, nor left fingerprints or other forensic clues. If they do comprise a cell or group, its membership appears to be watertight: No-one has blabbed. According to the ex-police security analyst, these factors suggest that all or most of the more serious attacks are the work of one person – probably not a youthful hothead but an older, reclusive person. The Bristol Bomber claims responsibility for his terrorist attacks on several anarchist websites . Like the American Unabomber Kaczynski, this person seems determined not to be caught and endowed with a high degree of self-control: ‘If you look at the pattern over the past few years, you get a little flurry of incidents, provoking a lot of police activity, and then you get a lull until the fuss dies down.’ Last year, more than three months elapsed between the firearms centre arson and the next incident, the torching of an EDF van. After the Marine base attack in February, three months elapsed before the bombing of the magistrates’ court. Kaczynski, the analyst pointed out, was only caught – having already killed three people – when his brother recognized linguistic quirks in his public claims of responsibility: ‘It may well take something similar to identify this guy.’ An Avon and Somerset police spokesman said anyone with information should call the police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Yet even as the force investigated the court bombing, he insisted that the online claim of responsibility and echoes of earlier attacks were merely ‘one line of inquiry’. Ms Leslie said the time had come for a radical rethink: ‘The police need to admit the attacks are probably connected and be much more vocal in their appeals for help. If this is a trend, we need to stamp it out.’","Bristol bomber uses Indymedia website to boast about his latest attacks .

"Banned: Adam Walker has been prevented from teaching again after driving at a group of boys . An outspoken BNP activist has been given a lifetime teaching ban for chasing children in his car after they were verbally abusive towards him. Adam Walker, who has been pictured on BNP marches with the far-Right party's leader Nick Griffin, had initially been banned for two years by the College for Teaching and Leadership. However, Education Secretary Michael Gove has over-ruled that decision, and imposed a lifetime ban on returning to the classroom. Walker, 44, has 20 years of teaching experience, having worked in Japan before returning to North-East England, where he taught at Houghton Kepier School in Sunderland. He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence and lost his licence for 12 months after he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Durham Crown Court. At a St George's Day celebration in 2011 at Tudhoe, near his home town of Spennymoor in County Durham, Walker was abused by three boys aged between 10 and 12, the court heard. He chased the children in his car, then slit the tyres on their bikes with a Stanley knife. Recorder Ben Nolan said that his actions were extremely dangerous, and claimed he could have killed the boys. When the teaching council imposed a ban, it said: 'He had been provoked, but his reaction failed to meet up to the high standard expected of a teacher both in and out of school.' Supporter: Walker, pictured with BNP leader Nick Griffin, is a member of the far-Right political party . 'Vendetta': Walker, right, insists his teaching ban is politically motivated and not based on his crime . However, Walker insisted that the punishment imposed on him by Mr Gove was excessive, and the result of a 'personal vendetta' based on his controversial political beliefs. 'Clearly the Secretary of State has an axe to grind,' he said. 'I was dealt with first by the courts, then the teaching council, and accepted their decisions, but the Secretary of State has overruled all that. 'When I compare the punishments given to other teachers, including proven paedophiles and the like, what's happened to me seems totally disproportionate.' In his judgement for the Secretary of State's office, Alan Meyrick said: 'Mr Walker's convictions involved threatening behaviour and criminal damage of a serious nature aimed at children. 'The reputation of the profession would be seriously damaged by allowing a teacher with this combination of convictions to be able to teach again.'

"No self-respecting fashionista would be seen without perfectly pedicured nails, but most would probably think twice about giving their cat colourful claws to match. Yet one particular devoted follower of fashion decided to do just this - before realising the newly adopted addition to her family was making her break out in a rash. Which means Broccoli the cat is now back at the shelter looking for a new owner - complete with her very own 'peticure'. Scroll down for video . Tickled pink: Broccoli was given colourful claws by her owner, who then discovered she was allergic to cats . It is understood Broccoli had been particularly chosen by the young woman because she thought her black coat would make her the perfect addition to her chic home in Geneva, Switzerland. However, it appears she also felt the poor animal could do with a flash of colour. And no one would have been any the wiser, if the woman hadn't broken out in a rash and begun sneezing - caused by a hitherto unknown allergy to cats. Valerie Derivaz, the head of the SOS-Chats animal home in Geneva, said: 'This time Brocoli returned with bright pink claws which were certainly not there when she left the home. 'We found out they are actually something called soft claws that look just like the acrylic nails you would get during a manicure.' It transpires the woman - who had agreed to take Broccoli in for a temporary period until a more permanent home could be found - had fitted the cat with special soft claws. Trend: The cat was then returned to the shelter - who were surprised to see Broccoli's pink nails . They are designed to stop cats from scratching furniture, wooden floors or humans, and last for four to six weeks before dropping off naturally. But, Ms Derivaz explained, they are not seen  as a viable alternative to simply keeping a cat's claws neat and tidy. She said: 'These nails actually really restrict cats. They need claws to be able to take care of themselves, to climb and to cling on after a jump . Vet Rodolphe Spycher also believes they are not a good idea. 'There are yet more alternatives like getting a scratching post for your cat so they pay more attention to that than your leather sofa,' he pointed out. Concerns: The shelter's director is worried these 'soft claws' will inhibit the cats ability to exercise . But it seems Broccoli is not the first, or last, cat to get their very own petitcure. Ms Derivaz said: 'Just after Brocoli was returned to the home, I saw another cat on the the street with brightly coloured plastic nails. 'I really hope this isn't some kind of trend.' However, Peter To - the director of UK company Soft Claws - says they are not fashion accessories. 'Soft claws are designed only for indoor cats, where it does not inhibit their ability to exercise,' he said. 'It is not a fashion accessory: the colours are a bit of a novelty, but the main consumers are people who need to find a solution other than re-homing them.'","Broccoli was given a pink pedicure by her fashion conscious owner .

"An off-duty US navy sailor wrestled a bus driver to the ground and beat him into submission after he attempted to rape her at knife point, a court heard yesterday. Prosecutors said that she knocked the knife from his hand, broke it in two, bit him in the hand, forced him to the ground and locked him between her thighs. The woman, 28, was on 24-hour shore leave in Dubai and was attacked as she returned to the port where she was based after a day shopping. The off-duty navy sailor was attacked at knife point as she returned to the port in Dubai (STOCK IMAGE) She had been attempting to hail a taxi after visiting shopping centre, Mall of the Emirates and a supermarket when a bus pulled up next to her . After climbing aboard she became suspicious of the drivers route. She said: ‘I noticed he did not take the main road and when I asked him he told me not to worry.’ He then drove for a further 10 minutes before stopping in an area where other buses were parked and attempting to kiss her. When she refused him he pulled the knife and threatened to rape her but she was able to subdue him. Following the attack, which occurred on . January 19 of this year, she left the bus and reported it to her . commander at Port Khalid. She had spent a day shopping at the massive shopping centre Mall of the Emirates in Dubai . The court heard that the woman quickly returned to Port Khalid to report the incident to her commander . The driver, named as K S, from Pakistan, was arrested the next day at his home and the attending police officer said that he was intoxicated at the time. The court ordered that the 21-year-old be examined to establish his age after he did not produce a birth certificate. He has been charged with attempted rape, threatening to kill, assault and consuming alcohol illegally.Having confessed to the alcohol charge, the driver claims to have been too drunk to remember what happened. Traces of the woman’s hair and blood were found on his bus. The case was adjourned to May 1.

"Human remains are set to be placed in a Neolithic-style burial chamber in Britain - the first to be built in the country for 5,000 years. Tim Daw, 52, has almost completed his long barrow burial mound, which will eventually hold the remains of thousands of people. Some 40 people have already reserved a £1,000 ($1,680) spot in the 165 ft (50 metre) long structure, in Daw’s field near All Cannings, Wiltshire, and it is set to be completed this summer. A farmer in Wiltshire is building the first long barrow to be seen in Britain for 5,000 years (pictured), a type of Neolithic burial mound that is designed to hold thousands of dead people. The first human remains to be buried in such a tomb since 3,000 BC could be placed there in a few weeks when Tim Daw's project is complete . The hollow mound, filled with stone chambers and niches, will be non-religious, but due to its alignment to the solstice sunrise and sunset, has attracted interest from the Pagan community. 'There’s been lots of interest in it, and already 40 people have reserved a niche inside for their or their loved one’s ashes,' said Daw. 'Some of those are people who have paid for their own ashes to be placed inside, while others already have their loved one’s ashes and said they had not been able to find anywhere they thought was suitable to place them until they heard about this. 'We’ve completed the frontage and a few of the niches inside to let people get a feel for what it will be like, and when it is completed in August, there will be urns going in there immediately. 'It’s gone really well. I think it looks superb. Everyone who’s seen it says it is really nice, and it is wonderful to get such positive comments from people. 'It is a very large structure in what is a really sensitive landscape, but everybody has been very positive, which is great. It’s rather touching that people are saying such nice things about it.' Daw's neolithic-style tomb will be based near his farm in All Cannings, Wiltshire. His 220-acre farm lies in the middle of Wiltshire's 'crop circle country', where mysterious patterns appear in fields of crops overnight.  Theories as to how they occur range from UFO landings to over-zealous cider drinkers . Wiltshire . is strewn with Neolithic burial mounds, or barrows, dating back to the . new stone age period, beginning about 10,200 BC and ending between . 4,500 and 2,000 BC. They were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud, soil and grass. West Kennet Long Barrow, . six miles from Daw's barrow at All Cannings, is one of the largest, . measuring 100 metres (330 feet) long. Excavations suggest work began on the tomb, which . has five sarsen stone chambers, in 3,600 BC - some 400 years before . Stonehenge was begun.

Lanhill Long Barrow, . near Chippenham, is a late Neolithic long barrow which was found to . contain the remains of several people from the same family, ranging in . age from 12 months to 60 years. Beckhampton Long Barrow, . near Avebury, is one of the oldest known barrows in the country, dating . back to around 3,200 BC. Its two ends have been ploughed away and . destroyed, but the remains of one of the Beaker folk, migrants into . Britain in 2,500 BC who were notable for the beaker shape of their . pottery, have been found in the barrow. Silbury Hill, . a vast chalk mound 16 miles (26 kilometres) from Stonehenge, is not strictly a barrow . but is a man-made mound from the same, Neolithic period and can be seen . from many of the barrows that post-date it. Despite various attempts to . excavate it over the years, and despite a common assumption over the . years that it must be a burial mound, its purpose is still a mystery. source: Wiltshire Web . Daw (pictured), 52, said the project to recreate the resting place of our ancestors for the 21st century has proved a success, with 40 people signing up to be buried here at £1,000 ($1,680) each so far. He said it is 'quite a large' Neolithic long barrow for the Wiltshire countryside . There will be four separate chambers inside the burial mound, each with shelves containing lockable individual ‘niches’, that can be secured for a family. The first phase will consist of four chambers, each with 250 individual slots, with a second phase planned for a further three chambers. It has been positioned to allow the midwinter sunrise to shine directly down the length of the tomb. The design is based on the famous long barrow at West Kennet, near Silbury Hill, a few miles from his farm, the largest man-made mound in Europe. Inside the burial mound chamber the ashes of today's dead will be placed in special niches (shown). After winning permission for the new long barrow in a landscape dotted with ancient monuments construction work began at the start of the year, and is set to be finished by August . A further expansion of the burial mound is tentatively planned to the barrow for a couple of years' time after the current construction is finished (pictured). 'There's been lots of interest in it, and already 40 people have reserved a niche inside for their or their loved one's ashes,' said Daw . Here can be seen the interior of the burial mound. 'Some of those are people who have paid for their own ashes to be placed inside,' said Daw, 'while others already have their loved one's ashes and said they had not been able to find anywhere they thought was suitable to place them until they heard about this.' Daw . added: “We’ll have to keep the inside secure as other people’s remains . will be in there too, but the idea is that it will be a place for . families to come.

"The Environment Agency put water voles, greater water parsnips, silver diving beetles and large marsh grasshoppers ahead of people in the flood-ravaged Somerset Levels, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. A 250-page agency document issued in 2008 shows that years of neglecting vital dredging which used to let water drain away much faster is part of a deliberate policy to increase flooding in the areas now worst affected. The policy was revealed as agency director of operations David Jordan angered residents yesterday by calling the flood defences a ‘success story’. In a 250-page document on flood risk (right) the Environment Agency sets out how it plans to deliberately increase flooding in the areas now worst affected, and appears to prioritise animals above people . He said: ‘We need to recognise that 1.3 million other properties would have flooded if these flood defences had not been built. That is the success story, if you like, that we are talking about.’ Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater & West Somerset constituency has been among the worst affected areas said: ‘What a stupid man – this is absolute stupidity and arrogance. This is a tragedy and disaster.’ The 2008 agency document shows the objective for the Levels was to ‘take action to increase the frequency of flooding to deliver benefits locally or elsewhere’. In the document the agency says flooding on the Somerset Levels 'is not in itself a major problem' because it will be beneficial to wildlife including greater water parsnips (right) and greater silver beetles (left) The agency claimed this might ‘constitute an overall flood risk reduction’. But it added: ‘This policy option involves a strategic increase in flooding in allocated areas [the area of the Levels on the Rivers Tone and Parrett now underwater], but is not intended to affect the risk to individual properties.’ Lord Chris Smith, head of the Environment Agency, was called a 'coward' and a 'git' yesterday on his first visit to the Somerset Levels . From an environmental point of view, the document says, flooding on the Levels ‘is not in itself a major problem’, because it is beneficial to wildlife. Among the species it listed as expected to thrive were the voles, parsnips (a type of flower) and insects, as well as various birds. Under European Union directives, the policy document says, ‘we  have obligations to protect the habitats that have developed hand in hand with the man-made flood-risk infrastructure’. ‘From an economic point of view, a lot of money is required to protect relatively little when considered at a £ per square kilometre point of view,’ it says, adding that farming and housing, first established 250 years ago when the Levels were drained, might suffer from what it called the ‘redistribution’ of future floods. However, the use of the land by humans was ‘based on historical practice which should be challenged in the future’. ‘This will have social and financial implications which will have to be considered carefully . . . We are aware that challenging centuries of drainage operations may be difficult, and it requires good communication and co-operation between various authorities.’ The document says the agency might have to close pumping stations built to move floodwater from the fields into the rivers and aqueducts: ‘It is likely that there  are some pumping stations that are not economic. ‘Many pumping stations are relatively old and in some cases difficult to maintain . . . Redistributing floodwater, while logical in some areas, may be difficult to promote because individual farms will be affected in different ways. Homeowners in Moorland, Somerset, have been forced to wade through murky to escape rising flood waters . Residents on the Somerset Levels have been angered by the Environment Agency describing the flood defences in their area as a 'success story' Phil Smithen, 63, was one of the last people to leave the village of Moorland which residents now believe will be completely lost to the water . 'From an agricultural perspective, some may gain financially but some may also lose.’ The document, the Parrett Catchment Flood Management Plan, went through five successive drafts, the last in March 2008, shortly before the agency’s then chairman, Baroness Barbara Young, stepped down. Last Friday, her successor, former Labour MP Lord Smith, was given a hostile reception when he toured the flood-affected area. As he tried to address the TV cameras at Stoke St Gregory, a village on the shores of what has become a vast inland sea, one heckler told him he was ‘toast’. On the ground – what is left of it – the reasons for the bitterness were readily visible. Lord Smith had claimed that all the pumping stations were working flat-out, but on the Tone and Parrett, they are deserted and not functioning – because the silt which has clogged the rivers means there is nowhere for pumped water to flow. In the document the Agency says that flooding on the Levels isn't a problem as it is beneficial to wildlife . The document shows the objective for the Levels was to 'take action to increase the frequency of flooding' Lord Smith promised residents after flooding last year that there would be dredging in 2013 . The last dredging took place in 2003, and since that time, an agency spokesman admitted, the rivers’ water-carrying capacity has declined by almost half. Even in mid-stream, clumps of weeds and islands of willow mark the areas now clogged with mud. Last year, after another flood, Lord Smith stood on a bridge over the Parrett and promised residents there would be dredging in 2013. But all that took place before the onset of the current floods in December was the removal of a few ‘pinch points’ on the Tone. In his own flying visit to the Levels on Friday, David Cameron described the floods and waves of storms as ‘biblical’ events. But the point being made by locals is that while some flooding this year would have been inevitable, when the rivers were not clogged and the pumping stations were working, water levels could be drastically reduced in a day or two. If the drainage system had still been functioning, this could have been done in the gaps between each storm – greatly reducing the floods’ impact. Dramatic confirmation can be seen just a few miles away, in the northern part of the Levels. The agency has admitted that water-carrying capacity of rivers around the Levels has decreased by half since the last dredging took place in 2003 . In a visit to the Levels on Friday, David Cameron described the floods and waves of storms as 'biblical' At the Gold Corner pumping station, three giant pumps are still lifting the waters from the rivers Axe and Brue up seven feet into the Huntspill Drain – an artificial watercourse about 100ft wide which runs straight to the sea. But unlike the southern Levels rivers, the Huntspill is not silted up. The land for miles around is just as low-lying as the drowned villages and fields near the Parrett, but the flooding is far less severe. ‘The purpose of the rivers has been forgotten,’ said farmer Ray Adlem, 65. It should be to get rid of the water as quickly and efficiently as possible. 'You can read that 2008 document and conclude that running the system down has been deliberate. The Levels has always been an artificial landscape. 'If you don’t maintain an artificial landscape, it reverts to nature – and that’s what some people wanted.’ The tragedy is that even the intended beneficiaries of the agency policy have suffered. ‘Any time you went for a walk in the Levels, you’d hear plopping – the sound of the water voles diving  into the rivers,’ said farmer Edwin White. ‘I haven’t seen a vole for ten years. They’ve all been drowned.’ As apocalyptic weather batters large parts of the British Isles, a few patches of brightness have nonetheless broken through. A double rainbow brought a welcome splash of colour to the urban landscape of East London yesterday as it shimmered over the dull skies of Hackney. And in Portsmouth, a mother and her young son seized their chance when the city’s Bransbury Park was briefly bathed in sunshine. The pair were even treated to a foretaste of spring as they found themselves walking among a vivid yellow bed of crocuses which had managed to defy  the downpours and emerge undrowned from the sodden soil.","A 250-page Environment Agency document on flood risk has emerged .

"Ex-Ex Gay: John Paulk, pictured here as he looks today, was once the face of the gay conversion therapy movement . A man who was once one of the most visible advocates of so-called gay conversion therapy has now come out as still gay. You might call John Paulk ex-ex-gay. In 1998, he appeared on the cover of Newsweek alongside his wife. The headline asked ‘Gay for Life?’ Now estranged from his wife and sporting a much less conservative . look, including long blond hair and a deep tan, Paulk seems to have the . answer. And if you haven’t figured it out, it’s a yes. ‘My . beliefs have changed,’ Paulk told PQ Monthly, which stands for Proud . Queer. ‘Today, I do not consider myself “ex-gay” and I no longer support . or promote the movement.’ This is a huge departure from . Paulk’s prime ex-gay days, when he founded and ran a ministry called . Love Won Out based on what he called ‘reparative therapy.’ The . psychology community would now, as much of it did back then, be quick . to balk at the idea of using therapy to change one’s sexual orientation. But . Paulk was a true spokesman for the technique and was even chairman of . the board of Exodus International, one of the most well-none ex-gay . organizations. Paulk also penned two books on the subject: Not . Afraid To Change: The Remarkable Story Of How One Man Overcame . Homosexuality and Love Won Out, which he wrote with his wife, who also . claimed to have rid herself of her own homosexuality. Then: In 1998, Paulk appeared on the cover of Newsweek touting his belief in conversion therapy and ran a Christian ministry based on those beliefs . Change of mind: Mr Paulk, right, is pictured in drag for a 1990s photoshoot after his conversion . He . remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until September of . 2000, when it was widely reported that the self-proclaimed born-again . heterosexual was seen living it up in a Washington, DC gay bar. Now, . the 50-year-old says he’s come along way and apologized for harm he’s . done to people close to him and to the LGBT community as a whole. Changed: Paulk wrote two books on gay conversion with wife Ann, pictured, but now makes his living in the catering business . ‘Please allow me to be clear,’ Paulk said. ‘I do not believe that reparative therapy changes sexual orientation; in fact, it does great harm to many people.’ He later said: ‘I know that countless people were harmed by things I said and did in the past.’ Paulk’s wife Anne, according to PQ, remains a vocal proponent within the ‘reparative therapy’ movement today. Paulk now supports himself in the food service industry, running a catering company in Portland, Oregon called Mezzaluna Catering, and says he no longer profits from his former job. ‘I don’t get any royalties from these publications,’ he told PQ Monthly. ‘I discourage anyone from purchasing and selling these books or promoting my “ex-gay” story because they do not reflect who I am now or what I believe today.’","Living in Portland and working as a caterer after leaving his reparative gay therapy ministry, and wife, behind ."
"Two unnamed U.S. officials have told the Associated Press that the surviving suspect in the Boston bombings was unarmed when police captured him hiding inside a boat in a neighborhood back yard. The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture on Friday - after commissioner Ed Davies described a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured. The New York Times also said an M4 rifle had been found on the boat - another claim contradicted by the latest revelations. Officers had originally said they had exchanged gunfire with Tsarnaev for more than one hour Friday evening before they were able to subdue him. But on Wednesday, the law enforcement officials told the AP that no gun was found aboard the vessel. Scroll down for video . Hidden: Authorities say that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not armed as he hid in this boat in a Watertown, Massachusetts backyard . Hideout: Dzhokhar was found hiding in this boat in Watertown on Friday following a massive manhunt . Apprehended: Dzhokhar is searched and given medical attention after he is found hiding on Friday evening . It also contradicts many media accounts of Tsarnaev's final moments of freedom. The New York Times . reported that an M-4 carbine rifle - similar to the weapon . used by American troops fighting in Afghanistan - was found aboard the . boat and that officials had recovered two handguns and a bb gun used by the two brothers. The throat wound sustained by Tsaernev was also said by numerous law enforcement sources to be self inflicted. Sources told Newsday that Tsarnaev's bullet wound looked to be self-inflicted, due to . the location of Tsarnaev's wound and the trajectory of the bullet. And Reuters reported that the suspect was shot through the mouth by a round that exited through his neck. Dozens of bullet holes were seen on the exterior of the boat in photos taken shortly after the final standoff in the Watertown backyard. The officials told the AP that say investigators only recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, from the site of a gun battle Thursday night, which injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer. Trawl: On Monday, a police forensics team examined the boat where Dzhokhar was found hiding . Scene: He was found cowering in the boat after its owner realized its straps had moved on Friday evening . Dzhokhar was believed to have been shot before he escaped. The officials tell The Associated Press that no gun was found in the boat. Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said. How much of those conversations will end up in court is unclear. Rip: An FBI officer stands in front of the boat . where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon . bombings, was hiding inside . The FBI normally tells suspects they have the right to remain silent before questioning them so all their statements can be used against them. Under pressure from Congress, however, the Department of Justice has said investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about that. Regardless, investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.","Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown .

"Police spied on protesters at Britain’s biggest anti-fracking demonstration, using bugging devices and infiltrating them with undercover ‘covert human intelligence sources’, an official report has revealed. The incendiary revelation emerged only because blundering police failed to properly redact the highly sensitive report. When a computer user changes the colour of the type, the missing text appears. Stand-off: Police escorting a lorry confront activists from the protest camp in Balcombe, West Sussex that emerged to demonstrate against plans to frack for methane gas on a site just outside the village . The existence of ‘spies’ in  the frackers’ camp in Balcombe, Sussex, is meant to be a closely guarded secret. Sussex chief constable Martin Richards reportedly ‘went ballistic’ when told of the mistake. A local private sector security source said: ‘Next time there’s a fracking protest, activists will know what to expect – to say nothing of the consequences if the intelligence source is discovered.’ The report into Sussex Police’s handling of last summer’s protests at the site where fracking company Cuadrilla was trying to conduct test drilling was compiled by Hertfordshire Constabulary. Sussex Police disclosed it last week under the Freedom of Information Act, with the redactions. The error was quickly identified. The report states that police . initially ‘did not properly anticipate the escalation which did occur’, . allowing the protesters to almost close down Cuadrilla’s operations in . July. Police then used secret intelligence methods. The supposedly redacted part of  the . report says: ‘Once the operation moved into August, it was appropriate . that an appropriate range of intelligence sources were being harnessed, . including where appropriate European Convention on Human Rights . compliant covert means.’ Clumsy: Sussex Police's attempt at redaction came unstuck as soon as activists changed the colour of the font in word-processing software . As a result, it became clear exactly when activists planned to step up their campaign. This intelligence was shared with Cuadrilla – prompting the firm to suspend drilling on days when the protests were expected to peak. This was ‘fully appropriate’, the report claims. ‘Not having informed Cuadrilla of the anticipated risks would have been negligent on the behalf of Sussex Police.’ Yesterday a Sussex Police spokesman confirmed that the ‘covert means’ were those set out under the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act – the use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHISs) and ‘electronic interception’. He insisted the inadvertent disclosure ‘does not compromise the operational effectiveness of our plans. We have a responsibility to gather intelligence to assess risk and build plans to keep people safe’. But Craig Bennett, campaigns and policy director for Friends of the Earth, said he was appalled that ‘covert resources are being wasted on people exercising their democratic right to protest’. Ugo Hayter, from solicitors Leigh Day, who are trying to stop Balcombe fracking through the High Court, said: ‘If police were using covert means, such as electronic bugging, this is deeply concerning. 'Such seemingly excessive and intrusive police surveillance only serves to undermine our democracy and is a further erosion of people’s lawful right to protest.’ Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said he had ‘no knowledge’ of the covert methods, adding: ‘This is not a matter for us, but the police.’","Police tried to censor document by changing text highlight to black .

"Row: Renowned Swedish scientist Professor Lennart Bengtsson of Reading University was at the centre of an international row last week . Ground-breaking climate research that was controversially ‘covered up’ suggests the rate  that greenhouse gases are heating the Earth has been significantly exaggerated, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Renowned Swedish scientist Professor Lennart Bengtsson of Reading University was at the centre of an international row last week when his study was rejected by a leading science journal after it was said to be ‘harmful’ and have a ‘negative impact’. The rejection sparked accusations that scientists had crossed an important line by censoring findings that were not helpful to their views. Prof Bengtsson further claims one of the world’s most recognised science publications also decided not to use his research findings, because, he said, they were considered to be ‘uninteresting’. Prof Bengtsson’s critical paper was co-authored with four colleagues. It focused on the growing gap between real temperatures and predictions made by computers. In a recent key report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated the ‘climate sensitivity’ – the amount the world will warm each time carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere double – was between 1.5C and 4.5C. According to Prof Bengtsson’s paper, it is more likely to be 1.2C to 2.7C. The implications of the difference are huge. If the planet is warming half as fast as previously thought  in response to emissions, many assumptions behind targets for reducing emissions and green energy subsidies are wrong. The subsidies in turn have led to a significant increase in consumers’ power bills. Last week, it was revealed Environmental Research Letters had rejected his paper because it would be seized on by climate ‘sceptics’ in the media. Fear: Professor Bengtsson of the University of Reading said the pressure was so great he feared for his health . Established: The Global Warming Policy Foundation was set up by former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson and is regarded as being part of the 'sceptic camp' when it comes to climate change . Later the journal said it had rejected the paper because the reviewers questioned the paper’s methods. But another journal turned it down without it even being sent out for peer review. Prof Bengtsson says this only normally happens if the editors believe the work is ‘trivial’ or ‘unimportant’. Prof Bengtsson, 79, is one of the world’s most eminent climate scientists. Last week he was forced to step down from the council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the sceptical think-tank  set up by Lord Lawson. He was accused by former friends and colleagues of ‘crossing into the deniers’ camp’. Prof Bengtsson said the pressure was so great he had feared for his health. He said he had been stunned by the ‘emotional’ reaction to his joining the GWPF. ‘The way some in the climate community behaved shocked me,’ he said. ‘It was as if I had been married for many years, and then discovered my wife was a completely different person.’ Prof Bengtsson said the paper  was now being considered by a third journal, after some revisions. But  he had asked for his name to be to  be removed in the wake of the row over the GWPF. Some climate scientists have long been warning that the planet is approaching a tipping point. Future historians may one day reflect that we reached it last week. If they do, they won’t mean that this was when global warming became unstoppable. Instead, they’ll be pointing to the curious affair of Professor Lennart Bengtsson of Reading University as the moment that the rigid, authoritarian campaign to shut down debate on climate science and policy finally began to unravel. For several years, this newspaper has been at the forefront of efforts to publicise the highly inconvenient truth that real world temperatures have not risen nearly as fast as computer models say they should have, thanks to the unexpected ‘pause’ in global warming which has so far lasted some 17 years. As Prof Bengtsson has now discovered, anyone who draws attention to this will be vilified  and accused of ‘denying’ supposedly ‘settled’ science. The dogma – the insistence, as Bengtsson put it yesterday, that ‘greenhouse gas emissions are leading us towards the end of the world in the not-too-distant future’ – dominates many aspects of our lives, from lessons taught in primary schools to the vast and rising ‘green’ energy subsidies on household fuel bills. To be sure, Bengtsson’s treatment is not encouraging. As a former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, he is one of the world’s most eminent experts. Yet last week, he was accused of having joined the equivalent of the Ku Klux Klan and the Flat Earth Society, and of peddling ‘junk science’ – all because he accepted a place on the council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Some climate scientists have long been warning that the planet is approaching a tipping point. Future historians may one day reflect that we reached it last week . So great was the pressure, he feared for his health, and decided to resign. The most cursory look at the GWPF’s website makes clear  it does not ‘deny’ any aspect of  the science of global warming, nor that this has happened in response to human activity. Its focus (as its name rather suggests) is on policy, where it has indeed been critical  of the approach thus far. But for the climate enforcers, that was enough. Bengtsson said: ‘I was labelled a heretic. I felt as if I was dealing with the medieval church.’ It also emerged that a paper he co-authored, arguing that temperatures would rise by  only half as much as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claims, had been rejected by a prestigious journal  – after an anonymous reviewer said publishing it would be ‘harmful’ to the environmental cause, because it was bound to be reported by media sceptics. Nevertheless, there are grounds for optimism. Perhaps it was simply that a man of Bengtsson’s stature who is still producing research at the age of 79 deserves respect, but the story was reported – not favourably, from the enforcers’ point of view – around the world. It even made the front page of The Times. Some of those who deplored the ‘climate McCarthyism’ that Bengtsson experienced, such as Prof Judith Curry of Georgia Tech in Atlanta, have received similar treatment for saying global warming may not pose the imminent threat so many want us to fear. Others, however, were from the very centre of the climate science mainstream, such as Prof Mike Hulme of King’s College, London. He condemned scientists who ‘harassed’ those with whom they disagreed until they ‘fall into line’. But if this really was a tipping point, it will be because the areas of uncertainty in climate science are simply too big to be ignored: claiming the debate is over does not make this true. As former Nasa scientist Roy Spencer put it: ‘We might be seeing the death throes of alarmist climate science. They know they are on the ropes, and are pulling out all the stops in a last-ditch effort to shore up their crumbling storyline.’ So here’s a question. Like Bengtsson, this newspaper believes global warming is real, and caused by CO2. It’s also clear that, thus far, the computer models have exaggerated its speed. So what exactly are we and others who hold such views denying?","Professor Lennart Bengtsson's study was rejected and branded 'harmful'

"Authorities in Russia warned the FBI ‘multiple times’ about Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, though the ethnic Chechen could have slipped through the cracks because he was not linked to al Qaeda, it was revealed Tuesday by U.S. Senators who were briefed on the terrorist attacks. The federal agency looked into the eldest brother in 2011 after the Russian government contacted them, warning that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have deveoped radical Islamic ties following a prolonged trip to Russia, including Muslim-predominant Dagestan. However, after its initial search and interviews with him and his family members, the FBI closed the case, and has come under intense scrutiny for doing so. Scroll down for video . Conflicting: Tamerlan Tsarnaev turned from an 'arrogant' sportsman to an increasingly radical Muslim. Studying the Koran alone in Dagestan; Russian authorities tried to alert the FBI over the 'bomber' multiple times, according to lawmakers . Speaking with the Boston Herald, a senator sitting in on Tuesday’s confidential meetings on Capitol Hill said that the FBI could have missed Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s radicalization as he didn’t share links to the terror network al Qaeda. That senator spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Tuesday’s briefings were classified. Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told the Herald that the Russian government also had very different priorities. ‘Their concern was Chechen radicals. Our higher concern was al-Qaeda,’ he told the paper, explaining that the militant Islamist group was more dangerous to the U.S. in light of the 9/11 attacks. Lawmakers . again asked whether a failure to share intelligence contributed to the . deadly, after senior officials briefed them on the investigation into . last week's bombings, the Boston Globe reports. However, members of Congress have not . gone insofar as to say that better or more thorough intelligence could . have prevented the bombings, which many said following the September 11, . 2001 terrorist attacks. 'There still seem to be serious . problems with sharing information, including critical investigative . information ... not only among agencies but also within the same agency . in one case,' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said after the Senate . Intelligence Committee members were briefed by FBI Deputy Director Sean . Joyce. 'I don't see anybody yet that dropped . the ball,' said Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, the committee's vice . chairman, according to the Associated Press. Intel: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Tuesday in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on immigration legislation, that her agency knew of the suspect's trip to Russia even though his name was misspelled on a travel document . On the attack: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told Napolitano that the information contradicted what he'd been told by the FBI .

Behind closed doors: Deputy Director of the FBI Sean Joyce, center, enters a closed Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where he faced questions from lawmakers . 'They told me that they had no . knowledge of him leaving or coming back, so I would like to talk to you . more about this case,' Graham told Napolitano. She said that even though . Tsarnaev's name was misspelled, redundancies in the system allowed his . departure to be captured by U.S. authorities in January 2012. But she said that by the time he came . back six months later, an FBI alert on him had expired and so his . re-entry was not noted. The FBI has not released a new statement . regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s trip to Russia since April 17. Investigators have concluded based on . preliminary evidence that the Russia trip may have helped radicalize . Tsarnaev, the older of the two bomber suspects, who died in a firefight . with police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was investigated by . the FBI at Russia's request and his name was included in a federal . government travel-screening database after that, law enforcement . officials have told The Associated Press. Religious journey? Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent much time in the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala .

The ethnic Chechen brothers imigrated . to the United States a decade ago from the predominantly Muslim region . of Dagestan in Russia's Caucasus. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, . the ranking Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said the . briefing raised questions about the flow of information among law . enforcement and intelligence agencies.

"The BBC has been savaged for its 'astonishing' campaign survey on global warming . The BBC has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money asking 33,000 people in Asian countries how climate change is affecting them. The £519,000 campaigning survey by little-known BBC Media Action is designed to persuade the world to adopt more hard-line policies to combat global warming. It was immediately condemned yesterday as a flagrant abuse of the Corporation’s rules on impartiality and ‘a spectacular waste of money’ by a top academic expert. Every year, BBC Media Action gets . £22.2 million from the taxpayer via the Foreign Office and Department . for International Development. Its climate survey, published this month, is called From The Ground Up: Changing The Conversation On Climate Change. In it, farmers and villagers in India, China, Vietnam, Nepal, Pakistan and Indonesia were asked how climate change was ‘affecting their lives already’ and about their future concerns. They described less predictable rainfall, droughts, declining harvests and an increase in respiratory disease caused by dustier soil, and blamed them on global warming. The survey does not clarify whether these descriptions are supported by data, nor whether climate change is indeed the cause. It also includes graphs showing a steep rise in global temperatures – but they end abruptly in 2000, when temperatures stopped rising at all. The report ends with advice, apparently written for climate activists: ‘Do not talk about scientific or technical abstractions. Talk about the problems they face in their daily lives… Speak in language that makes sense to people in terms of how they experience climate change.’ BBC Media Action has a £40 million annual budget, and the proportion not funded by the taxpayer is paid  by the European Union, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the US government. Its website states it ‘belongs to the BBC’, and ‘builds on the fundamental values of the BBC  to guide its work’. Its chairman is Peter Horrocks, director of the BBC World Service Group. Trustees include newsreader George Alagiah. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Select Committee on Media and Culture, said last night he was ‘astonished’ to see the BBC involved with a survey of this kind. John Whittingdale, pictured, chairman of the Commons Select Committee on Media and Culture, said last night he was 'astonished' to see the BBC involved with a survey of this kind . He added: ‘The BBC brand carries with it a huge reputation for impartiality and objectivity. Even though this is not a mainstream, licence-fee-funded activity, for the BBC to attach its label to something which is so politically controversial is unwise. The BBC has already been attacked for paying too little attention to climate change sceptics, and this bears those criticisms out.’ Richard Tol, professor of economics at Sussex University and a leading authority on climate change impacts, said the BBC ‘would have been better advised to invest this money in proper research’. He said the survey’s assertions are often contradicted by more reliable sources. He said: ‘Objective data  do not corroborate the survey’s reported impacts on health, droughts, predictability of rainfall, and crop yields. Attribution of any of these effects to climate change  is by and large beyond the current level of scientific knowledge.’ Prof Tol was one of the ‘co-ordinating lead authors’ of a report on the consequences of warming by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in March. UN figures show harvests have been rising across Asia for decades. The March IPCC report stated: ‘The worldwide burden of ill-health from climate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantified.’ On rainfall, it stated: ‘There is now low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought since the mid-20th Century to human influence.’ Prof Tol said the survey results were academically worthless: ‘Interviewing 30,000 people across six countries is expensive, and cannot tell us much – previous research has shown people’s recollection of past weather and climate is very unreliable, and people’s attribution of observations to causes is worse.’ The BBC has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money asking 33,000 people in Asian countries how climate change is affecting them . The BBC survey’s campaigning intention is suggested by a chapter entitled The Policy Context which tells readers that next year, world leaders will meet at a UN summit in Paris to hammer out a new treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions. ‘2015 is a propitious moment for reorienting the way that we talk about climate change,’ the survey report says. The Paris talks will ‘open a window of opportunity… to articulate a climate change perspective rooted in people’s needs’. Dr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which argues that the threat from climate change is overblown, said it seemed Media Action was ‘the campaigning arm of the BBC, [its] propaganda bureau’ and the survey is ‘a blatant abuse of the BBC charter’. A spokesman for BBC Media Action confirmed the survey’s £519,000 cost but declined to comment on its alleged lack of impartiality. The BBC has ruled that a radio debate about climate change involving former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson should have been censored – as he did not agree with flawed global warming computer predictions. Fraser Steel, head of the BBC complaints unit, said a Radio 4 Today programme about the causes of last winter’s storms should never have been broadcast. The move has huge implications for future coverage, implying that ‘sceptics’ will be gagged. The BBC has ruled that a radio debate about climate change involving former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson, pictured, should have been censored . And it has been widely condemned by MPs, with Peter Lilley, a Tory member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, saying it shows the BBC is ‘afraid of letting a single critic point out  that the climate change emperor has no clothes’. His Labour colleague Graham Stringer said: ‘This is a form of censorship.’ Citing the bogus claim that the MMR jab causes autism, which was exploded by investigative journalists, he added: ‘After all, it is often non-specialists who prove the specialists wrong.’ Lord Lawson, the chairman of sceptic think-tank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, was invited to discuss last winter’s floods on the Today programme in February. The move by the BBC has huge implications for future coverage, implying that climate change 'sceptics' will be gagged . The former Chancellor often appears on Radio 4 to talk about economics, but this was the first time he had been allowed to discuss climate change. He argued that there was no evidence to prove that the violent storms were caused by global warming – a conclusion later endorsed by the Met Office. However, Bob Ward, a climate change spokesman from the Grantham Institute, complained that the debate created a ‘false balance’ between scientists and sceptics. And in his ruling, Mr Steel said: ‘A false balance should not be created between well-established fact and opinion.  Lord Lawson’s views are not supported by evidence from computer modelling.’ Mr Ward responded to the ruling by calling for ‘necessary precautions’ to ensure that experts are on hand to ‘correct any errors’ if climate change sceptics are allowed on air. But Lord Lawson said Mr Steel’s ruling was ‘completely absurd’, adding: ‘The BBC’s position is quite extraordinary. They are now saying that only alarmism is acceptable.’ And Dr Richard Betts, head of the Met Office Climate Impacts section, said: ‘Unlike the person who complained to the BBC, I don’t have a problem with Lawson or anyone else being given air time to voice their opinions.’","BBC under fire after spending hundreds of thousands on survey in Asia .

"The right of people from across Europe could be curtailed under David Cameron's plans to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels. The Prime Minister has drawn up a 'battleplan' for talks with other EU countries in which he wants to claw back powers over who can move to Britain, find work and claim benefits. Mr Cameron is already under pressure to urged to slash benefits and access to public services for immigrants from Europe, but Downing Street suggested he could go further. Pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron is ready to look at freedom of movement rules which allow anyone from in the EU to settle in Britain . Mr Cameron will use a meeting of European leaders next week to step up pressure for reform, demanding major cuts to red tape which threaten competitiveness. But the government is under pressure to do more to tackle the 'pull factors' which draw thousands of people to Britain every year. A new study reveals a . sharp rise in the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain . to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow. There . was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants . in the country in the three years to 2011, according to the European . Commission. Asked if the government was now examining ways to curb the freedom of movement rules - allowing people from anywhere in the EU to settle in Britain - Downing Street confirmed it was on the table. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I think it is understandable that in the UK and a number of other countries, questions are being asked in this area. 'We have a programme underway, bilateral discussions with other member states. It is not right to pre-empt that now.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is already working with other member states on plans to toughen the habitual residence test to make it harder for immigrants to claim benefits. Mr Cameron’s spokesman added: ‘The government’s view clearly is changes do need to be made in this area and actually the fact that we are co-operating and working in partnership with a good number of other member states I think is significant.’ He added that there are ‘widespread concerns’ across Europe about access to state benefits and public servants of migrants. ‘We don’t think that the current system is working in the right way. By definition we are seeking to take action on these pull factors. ‘There is an issue here fundamentally with regard to access to the welfare system and others around fairness.’ European Commission figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants . Meanwhile, a poll has found that two-thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration. London . Mayor Boris Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long . time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country. The . London Mayor said it was wrong that ‘we have no control over the time . lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to . withdraw benefits’. And he . suggested the Prime Minister should press for a change in the law as . part of his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. ‘That . is something that could be considered by the Government for the . renegotiation of the European Treaty that is about to come up,’ he said. Tory . MP Douglas Carswell also called for a clampdown, saying that migrants . appeared to be fleeing to Britain to escape the eurozone crisis. Boris Johnson said migrants should have to work for 'quite a long time' before claiming benefits in the UK . ‘We . cannot both continue the free-at-the-point-of-use welfare state and . benefits system and allow Europeans to flee the eurozone and come here,’ the Eurosceptic MP added. The European Commission study, . published today, reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779  economically . ‘non-active’ EU migrants living in Britain – up from 431,687 six years . ago. The annual cost to the NHS of treating ‘non-active’ migrants is . estimated at £1.5billion. The Commission’s  291-page report sheds new . light on the impact of EU immigration on Britain. ‘Between . 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the . number of non-active EU migrants in the UK,’ it says. ‘A . particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011. The . number of job-seeking EU migrants increased by 73 per cent, while the . total EU migrant population increased by only 28 per cent.’ The report . was commissioned by Laszlo Andor, the Commission’s employment . commissioner, who is suing Britain over rules that mean some benefits . are not immediately available to EU migrants. A Commission spokesman said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest the report’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants, because the figure includes older children, students, pensioners and other economically inactive adults. ‘All existing studies without any exceptions say that EU migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the Exchequer,’ he added. Despite the evidence it uncovers, the report concludes that the impact of ‘non-active’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘very low’. Sixty-seven per cent of Britons said they want Cameron to take 'drastic action' to cut immigration (file picture) 611,779: The number of 'non-active' EU migrants in Britain - up 42 per cent in six years . £1.5bn: Estimated annual cost to NHS of treating 'non-active' migrants . 73% increase in the number of 'job seeking' EU migrants in Britain between 2009 and 2011 . 3.7m: Increase in the population of England and Wales between 2001 and 2011, of which 2.1million attributed to immigration . £2bn: Potential cost of EU bid to end curbs on migrants claiming benefits . 67% of public want 'drastic action' to cut immigration . 52% of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration 'significantly' But Stephen Booth, of the think-tank Open Europe, said the conclusion was ‘misleading… wilfully or otherwise’. A poll carried out for Sky News by Survation suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration. Sixty-seven . per cent said the UK’s population is too high and want ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration, while 52 per cent said they are more likely to vote . for a party promising to reduce immigration ‘significantly’. And 27 per . cent said the wave of immigration in the last decade had brought no . benefit to Britain. Seventy-four . per cent said they were concerned that Romanians and Bulgarians will be . allowed unfettered access to Britain from the end of this year. Britain uses the Habitual Residency Test to establish whether EU migrants are eligible for benefits. To . qualify for jobseekers’ allowance, employment support allowance, . pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either . worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job. Last . night the Department for Work and Pensions said it was determined to . tighten the test to limit migrants’ access to benefits. But the Commission says this ‘right to reside’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other EU states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts. The test is being challenged in court by Mr Andor, despite warnings from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that the existing rules save Britain up to £2billion a year. Mr Duncan Smith pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘benefit tourism’. A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused. ‘But we are also going further by strengthening the Habitual Residence Test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits. ‘Ministers are also working with their counterparts across Europe to address concerns about the abuse of free movement.’","European Commission found 73% rise in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants .

"A former cancer patient who wrote to Jimmy Savile and thanked him for helping to save her life is claiming £60,000 damages for what she claims was a series of sexual assaults. Her claim is one of many being laid against Savile’s estate which a Mail on Sunday investigation has found to be questionable. Last month this newspaper revealed that West Yorkshire Police were investigating allegations that Savile’s great-niece, Caroline Robinson, is fraudulently claiming compensation for supposed assaults by Savile when she was 12 and 15. Scroll down for video . The former patient wrote to Savile, pictured, and thanked him for helping to save his life. She is now claiming £60,000 worth of damages for what she claims was a series of sex assaults . The Mail on Sunday revealed last month there have been a series of questionable claims against the Savile estate . The inquiry was triggered by statements from close family members, including her daughter, Samantha Smith. A police spokesman said yesterday that the investigation is continuing. Legal restrictions mean those who say they were victims of sexual crimes must remain anonymous, unless they waive their anonymity, as Ms Robinson did. This means we cannot name the former cancer patient. But of the 211 claims for payments from Savile’s estate which have been lodged under a compensation scheme approved in February by the High Court, hers is one of the strangest. Savile's great-niece Caroline Robinson, who is alleged to have fraudulently claimed compensation for supposed assaults . Before Savile’s death in 2011, she wrote warmly of their long bedside conversations when she was at death’s door, saying how grateful she was that he treated her as someone with hopes, dreams and a future. After his death, she ran short of money, and wrote a begging letter to the Savile Trust, the charity to which he left almost all his £4.7 million fortune. It responded with a donation of £2,500. ‘Joyful news that Jimmy’s trust is going to help my determined mission to stay alive,’ she said in a thank-you note. But now the same woman is claiming Savile sexually assaulted her numerous times in BBC dressing rooms and at his London flat. Those who saw the pair together say they are astonished. ‘We spent an afternoon together, and she spoke of Jimmy with deep affection. I simply can’t believe he had been sexually assaulting her,’ said David Gloan, a music promoter who was Savile’s friend. The woman’s mother initially promised to relay a statement from her to The Mail on Sunday, but later said this would not be possible. Another questionable claim is from a man who says he visited Savile’s Leeds penthouse flat in December 1975 when he was a paperboy, to collect his Christmas bonus. Savile did not move into this flat until 1986. This week, the Court of Appeal will hear a submission from the Savile Trust that the compensation scheme be quashed. Its solicitor, Jo Summers, said: ‘The scheme seems designed to give money to anyone who claims they were abused, with minimal due diligence. We hope the Court of Appeal will address these concerns. ‘Otherwise, no one’s estate will be safe when they die.’","Claim one of many being laid against Savile's estate found to be questionable .

"Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, has received well over £400,000 from green energy firms since 2009 . The Mail on Sunday’s investigation shows how MPs, Lords and lobbyists who benefit from green policies also advise the Government on how those policies ought to operate. The result is that the debate over measures of questionable value but enormous cost has been almost silenced. Only three MPs voted against the 2008 Climate Change Act, whose legally binding emissions targets make it the most radical piece of economic legislation in recent history. The present Energy Bill – which will increase renewable energy subsidies to new, eyewatering heights – is backed by all the main parties. Behind this apparent unanimity lies an extraordinary blurring of the boundaries which normally exist between business, politics, academics and campaigners. Top civil servants frequently work one year for the Government and the next for lobbyists, trying to influence their former colleagues. MPs who play major role in energy debates - but are in the pay of green companies . Lord Oxburgh has directorships with Green Energy Options Ltd and clean energy firm 2OC - which he declared. But he failed to reveal his role with another green firm, the Real Asset Energy Fund . The conflicted House of Lords... where peers don't have to state how much they are paid . Lobbyists who bid for green funds - but advise ministers on green policyOne of most influential green lobby groups is E3G – Third Generation Environmentalists. Its London branch and its offshoot Transform UK first conceived and then successfully lobbied for the Green Investment Bank, now spending £3.8 billion of taxpayers’ money, much of it to fund offshore wind – yet another subsidy on top of the levies on bills. Its leadership is the Who’s Who of ecocrats. Chief executive Nick Mabey was responsible for energy in Tony Blair’s No 10 strategy unit; at E3G he replaced John Ashton, who left to become the UK’s chief climate negotiator, serving three successive Foreign Secretaries, Labour and Coalition. He is back at E3G as a ‘founding director’. James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank . The specialist green private equity funds... that are very well connectedSpecialist green private equity funds also have a huge web of links. For example, James Cameron, chairman of Climate Change Capital, advises the Treasury and was a member of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group until last year. He was a member of the commission which set up the Green Investment Bank. Cameron is on the board of Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. There his former Climate Change Capital colleague Ben Caldecott directs the Stranded Assets Programme – an academic project aiming to prove that fossil fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground in order to save the planet, currently a growing demand from green campaigns. Caldecott moonlights as head of government advisory – in other words lobbying – at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. While he was still at Climate Change Capital, he worked on secondment at DECC and as a climate policy adviser for the Conservative Party. The scope of this green elite makes airing objections almost impossible. Last week, questioned at the Commons Energy Select Committee, even Energy Secretary and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey admitted that Britain’s green policies had increased global CO2 emissions – because by increasing the price of energy, they have driven jobs to countries like China, which use coal heavily and have no binding emissions limits. ‘It is certainly arguable that our carbon footprint is bigger,’ he said.

Lord Maclennan of Rogart is chairman of renewable energy firm Inwatur. Together with Lord Lewis and Lord Cameron of Dillington, he was one of three co-authors of a report in May by the Lords EU Committee demanding bigger increases in low-carbon spending who declared interests in renewables.
Few environmentalists have had careers as prodigious as E3G’s chairman, Tom Burke – inventor of the slogan ‘green growth’. Having been executive director of Friends Of The Earth and director of the Green Alliance, he moved into Government, as special adviser to three Environment Secretaries, and then into business, as a green adviser to BP and Rio Tinto. Remarkably he is now also the senior climate change adviser to the Foreign Office.
E3G’s funders reflect its chairman’s diverse interests. They include four Government departments: those for International Development, the Environment, DECC and the Foreign Office – which means taxpayers are funding a lobby group whose actions make them poorer. E3G also gets money from Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.
Another powerful lobby is Renewable UK. Maf Smith, its deputy chief executive, previously worked at DECC on changes to renewable subsidies enshrined in the Energy Bill."
"A gipsy accused of abducting a mystery blonde girl in Greece tried to blame his wife for taking her in yesterday, calling the child a ‘bomb’ who he never wanted. Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, appeared in court to be formally charged with child abduction and forging documents. For several years, they posed as parents to a blue-eyed girl known as Maria, seemingly to make money from her begging. Scroll down for exclusive video . Charged: Hristos Salis (right) told the court he did not want Maria (centre) in the house as he tried to blame his wife, Eleftheria Dimopoulou (left), for taking the child . Arrested: Salis, 39,  left, and Dimopoulou, 40, right, charged with child abduction and forging documents . Bought: Neighbours suggested the couple could have purchased the child for just £850 . Neighbours yesterday suggested the pair could have purchased the child for as little as £850. Her case has attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity. The child – nicknamed ‘the blonde angel’ by the Greek media – was discovered last week when police raided a gipsy camp. DNA . evidence proved she was not related to the couple. The defendants . claimed Maria was four years old, but dental and medical tests suggest . she is five or six. Mystery: Dental and medical tests suggest Maria is five or six years old, instead of four as previously claimed . They . insist they did not abduct her, and have appealed unsuccessfully to be . released on bail so they can trace a Bulgarian woman they say abandoned . her as a baby. The pair were interrogated separately by a magistrate in . Larissa, 30 miles from Tabakou camp, near Farsala, central Greece, where . the child was found. The . couple – who are using different lawyers since their apparent falling . out – offered guilty pleas on lesser charges of illegal adoption, which . were rejected by the city’s prosecutor. Abducting a child under the age of 14 carries a maximum sentence of ten years. The forgery charges relate to fake child birth certificates and two false identities used by Dimopoulou. The pair were not charged with the far more serious offence of child trafficking due to a lack of evidence. The . hearings took place behind closed doors with armed guards, but a source . inside told the Mail that Salis shifted blame on to his wife. The . source said: ‘He said in 2009 he was away from home for a few days when . he received a phone call from his wife, who said that there was a . Bulgarian couple at the home who did not want their child. ‘He . said he did not want a child and said, “I don’t want to put a bomb in . my house”.’ In a seemingly contradictory statement, Salis has also . claimed to know the man who ‘mediated’ the handover of the child. Photos released of the properties being raided when Maria was found show a haul of illegal goods were seized. Police photos show a range of chainsaws and laptops, above . A pen-style pistol and bullets found among other illegal items at the Roma settlement . His . lawyer Constantinos Katsavos said if freed, he could help track the man . down. Mr Katsavos added: ‘It was an adoption that was not exactly legal . but took place with the mother’s consent.’ Members of the Roma community protested at the couple’s treatment outside the court. Haralambos . Dimitriou, leader of the gipsy camp, said: ‘They accuse the Roma of . everything – of stealing, of snatching kids. Do these things only happen . among our race? This is a huge insult for us.’ But . Mr Dimitriou also suggested the couple paid money for Maria. He said a . Bulgarian couple came to the camp in 2009, selling children. Drugs, left, and a cannabis pipe, right, were also found during the raids . The evidence also shows credit cards which are believed to be stolen alongside a pistol and a balaclava . ‘They . had another five children for sale at the time,’ he said. Mr Dimitriou . said that he was offered a child for £850 (1,000 euros), but he . declined. Nikos Paiteris, . of the Thessalia region’s Roma association, said: ‘I believe the child . was given to the family and they may just have given some petty cash... We refuse to accept it is any case of abduction.’ Maria was yesterday said to be in good spirits in the care of Athens charity Smile Of A Child. In court: Members of the media wait outside a courthouse in the town of Larisa, some 350 km (217 miles) north of Athens where the couple appeared yesterday . Appearance: The Roma couple, arrested on suspicion of abducting a young blonde girl, appeared before a prosecutor in Larissa . Director . Costas Yannopoulos has said the couple used Maria as a ‘dancing bear’ to make money, a view bolstered by two videos of the girl being made to . dance in public. Yesterday . locals said Maria was seen begging in a market two weeks ago. One said . the distinctive child asked strangers for money both by herself and with . Dimopoulou. Smile of a Child has received more than 8,000 calls about Maria. But six of the eight leads initially described as ‘promising’ have sadly now been ruled out. 'Dancing bear': A still from a video taken last month shows Maria in the crime-ridden Greek gipsy camp . Video: The child was filmed just three weeks ago at the Roma settlement in Farsala, central Greece . Neat and tidy: Maria's room, the only bedroom in her 'family's' house . Seen: A cupboard, again the only one in the house, contained two rows of little girl's shoes and other clothes . Exploited: Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, is pictured with little Maria in a video shot two years ago . The woman accused of abducting Maria has insisted: ‘We did no harm to her. We love her and she loves us.’ Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who has been arrested with her husband Hristos Salis, told Greek television from her cell: ‘We gave her everything we could, like we do for our other children.’ She admitted Maria was not hers but said she presented her as her own ‘so she could have a proper family environment’. Salis’s sister Dimitra, 34, told the Daily Mail that Maria had been abandoned by a Bulgarian cotton picker when she was two months old. At the family’s small stone hut, she said: ‘The woman told us, “Take this baby. If you do not I will just give it to someone else”. She just left and never came back.’ She said they took in the child to protect her, adding: ‘We brought her up well, we loved her.’ Salis’s mother said: ‘The woman who gave birth to her was incapable of looking after her – she did not want her and begged us to take her.’","Hristos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou been charged with child abduction .

"Scientists may have discovered how more than 50,000 bees suddenly died this week in an Oregon parking lot.Locals became alarmed when tens of thousands of honeybees started dropping like flies at a local strip mall parking lot, a subsequent investigation has discovered a pesticide sprayed on over 50 trees to kill aphids instead resulted in what experts allege is the largest single bee die-off in recorded history.‘This is a big mistake, somebody really screwed up,’ Mace Vaughn, of the Xerces Society, a local organization that works to protect bees, told KGW. Dead: An innocent bee stuck on a Landen flower at Town Loop Shopping Center parking lot in Wilsonville, Ore. Local government workers and . contractors in Wilsonville, Oregon worked feverishly on Saturday to . cover 55 linden trees in a Target parking lot after it was discovered . that a contractor mistakenly sprayed them June 15 with Safari, an . evidently potent insecticide, the station reported. The . total bees killed represent more than 300 wild colonies, according to . Xerces Society biologist Rich Hatfield, who explained in a statement on the group’s website . that ‘each of those colonies could have produced multiple new queens . that would have gone on to establish new colonies next year. This makes . the event particularly catastrophic,' the worst in recorded history. Even worse, the bees were killed, according to KATU, during ‘National Pollenator Week,’ a week aimed at celebrating the vital role the honeybee plays in our ecosystem. Valent, the insecticide’s manufacturer, calls it’s toxic brew ‘super systemic’ and proudly claims that it’s ‘where the wild things aren’t’ on its website. The site claims that Safari is ‘clocked as the fastest broad spectrum insecticide on the market,’ saying that it’s ‘quick uptake and knockdown’ is effective against several bugs including ash borers, mealybugs, pine beetles and other invasive pests known to destroy high value greenhouse and nursery crops.Valant may as well add honeybees to the list as well, as this is not the first incident of the toxin killing them off in mass quantities, according to media reports. Safe: Contractors work to cover linden trees with netting after accidental insecticide application kills more than 50,000 honeybees . The netting is expected to cover the trees for the next two to three weeks, according to KGW. This incident is just the latest in a series of bee die-offs that has resulted in the decimation of 31% of the US’ bee population in 2012 alone, according to the Guardian. The large-scale erosion of bee populations, attributed mainly to ‘colony collapse disorder,’ poses a series threat to the food supply and the economy – bees contribute $20 billion to national economy.Oregon officials are working to determine whether the application of Safari was in violation of any state or local laws, according to a statement obtained by Mail Online.","Over 300 wild honeybee colonies have been wiped out .

"A woman has come out of the woodwork to say that she's been sexually harassed when she was 15 by a YouTube celebrity whose video of him groping women on the street has gone viral and she’s not the only one. The star of the video and former U.K. Big Brother contestant Sam Pepper sparked outrage after a video of him asking women for directions on the street then groping them with a hand hidden beneath a sweatshirt quickly circulated the internet. Right after the video came out, three women came forward to say that Sam Pepper touched them inappropriately in real life without any cameras to witness their reaction. Faces serious accusations: Sam Pepper recently went under fire for posting an offensive video to YouTube of him grabbing girls' behinds and since then women have stepped forward to say he sexually assaulted them . On Wednesday a fourth woman came out to say that Sam Pepper tried to solicit nude photos of her in 2011 when she was 15 and he was 22. Also this week a 20-year-old woman spoke to BuzzFeed and said that she was assaulted by Pepper in 2013 while he was on tour with rapper Sammy Adams and singer Mills. 'I didn’t even know who Sammy Adams was,' she said. 'I just went because my friends, we all really liked that whole YouTube thing at that time and my friends told me about [the concert] and said that [Sam Pepper] would be there.' She was 18 at the time and she and her 21-year-old sister responded to Sam Pepper on Twitter when he said he was stopping in Toronto and they all exchanged Facebook info. When she asked if she could have tickets to his show, Pepper said he might be able to get her a backstage pass, but not her older sister and friend, to the show. He also asked her to come to his hotel before the show—alone. ‘I walked into his room, he was sitting on a queen-sized bed watching TV,’ she said. ‘There were two beds in the room, and I had no interest in lying next to him on a bed, so I sat on the other one and began to talk to him.’ He told her to come next to him, and as soon as she did he allegedly pulled down his pants and tried to have sex with her. She didn't want to participate but said that Pepper forced her to perform oral sex on him. She had never been that far with a boy before. 'The most I could blurt out was ‘Well, I can’t have sex with you. Please don’t have sex with me, I don’t do this kind of thing,' she told BuzzFeed. 'Which was true, at this point in my life I had never done anything like this with a boy.' 'He continued to do things to me against my will and then forced me to give him head, nearly choking me,' she said. 'Afterwards, he threw me a napkin and told me that it was time to go.' Her worried sister and friend waited for her and when she finally came back downstairs he hair was tousled and  she looked distressed. 'We were getting really worried and we started to text her,' the woman’s sister told BuzzFeed. 'She came back downstairs and her hair was all a mess and her makeup was running down her face and she just looked so distraught and I knew right away that it wasn’t an innocent thing that had happened.' When show time came, Pepper only allowed the one girl he allegedly harassed to come inside the venue. Another woman who came out is Dottie Martin who says she went on a date with Pepper when she was 16 and that he 'groped her' and made her feel uncomfortable. She posted a video on YouTube describing her experience. Victim: Dottie says that she went on a date with Sam Pepper when she was 16-years-old and that he tried to grope her and touch her innapropriately . After the viral video came out, Bryony Harris, 19, of West Sussex in the U.K. tweeted screenshots with someone she claims is Pepper when she was only 15 years old. He was allegedly trying to illicit naked images of her. Harris said she met Pepper at a signing for Irish X-Factor and the two exchanged Facebook info. He was 22 and she was only 15 at the time. They never met in person but spoke on Skype. 'I know he was much older than me, yes, but at the time it didn’t matter as I was a huge fan and I went along with it,' Harris told BuzzFeed. 'I had pictures of Sam on my wall in my room,' she added. Cruel: YouTube star Sam Pepper shared a video showing him pinching women's behinds while he is asking them for directions . 'He just asked me to send him pictures of me naked and stuff and go on Skype and I did because I was a child and thought he would meet me,' Harris lamented. 'He was taking advantage of the fact he knew I and many other girls would fangirl over him.' In his conversations with Harris he allegedly said things to manipulate her like 'well not sure is I'm that into you..you need to convince me.' After their exchang Sam Pepper allegedly blocked her. 'He turned rude and ignored me and said he can’t carry on talking. He also asked me to delete the conversation,' Harris said. 'He blocked me on Facebook and we haven’t spoken.' After the video came out, British prankster Sam Pepper, 25, has since insisted that all the girls in his video were in on the joke and that it was simply to highlight how people have different reactions to assaults on men and women. But the video, which has since been removed by YouTube, still has viewers in uproar, with some expressing skepticism over whether the girls knew, while others pointed out that he has created other insulting videos, including 'Easiest Way To Get A Number' and 'How to Pick Up Girls with a Lasso'. Pepper, who has more than two million subscribers on YouTube, posted the video to his account showing him pinching women's bottoms after pretending to ask them for directions. 'Trick': Pepper pretended to ask women on the street for directions before grabbing their bottoms . Shock: The girls in the video look surprised and look around them to see who is responsible for the grope . The women are all shocked, with some looking around them for the culprit, while one clearly says she doesn't like it. 'It’s completely inappropriate. It's against the law, and it just sends the wrong message,' women's advocate Britni Soto told KCAL after the video went viral. Fellow YouTube stars also lambasted Pepper for the video. 'Sexually harassing women is vile to begin with, but normalizing it by calling it a prank? So harmful,' Tyler Oakley tweeted. The video gained more than 1.3 million views before it was removed by YouTube for violating YouTube's 'Terms of Service'. Pepper, who first gained fame in the UK after appearing on the country's reality TV show Big Brother in 2010, stayed largely quiet about the scandal until posting about it on Twitter on Monday. 'If you've seen something one way, will it change what you would of thought of it another way?' he wrote, before sharing a similar video showing a woman pinching men's behinds. Prank: The women look shocked as he pinches them - but he later insisted the girls were all on the prank . Denial: He later posted a video showing women grabbing men's behinds, and on Tuesday he shared this video explaining it had been a social experiment to prove how people regard assaults on men different . This video, which has also been removed by YouTube, sparked some disgust too, but not the same amount as the earlier video, Pepper said. On Tuesday morning following the posting, he shared one final video to YouTube explaining that the two videos had been part of a social experiment to show our flippant reactions to assaults on men. He explained that he had been inspired by a male friend who was in an abusive marriage and whose accounts were doubted by police, as well as his own experiences being sexually assaulted by fans. 'At multiple events some of my viewers will grab my bum and giggle about it among their friends,' he said. 'I don't like it. And if the roles were reversed would people think it was OK to pinch a female celebrity? 'I wanted to do something that would highlight the difference between abuse towards a woman and abuse towards a man in a social experiment with you as unwitting participants at the heart of the experiment.' He added: 'I don't want to turn off a light on a very real and scary issue women face I just want to shine a light on an otherwise dark corner - abuse on men.' Explanation: On Twitter, he said he could have carried out his plan in a smoother way - but that he was glad that it had made people think about how differently they treat men and women . He added that the videos had all been 'staged and scripted' and thanked the women by name for helping him put them together. Some fans applauded Pepper for the series. 'To help out a friend who was afraid to admit he was being abused, @sampepper risked everything he's worked for. So much respect man,' one Twitter user said. Yet others weren't quite so convinced. 'So were all the other videos where you pressure women to kiss you also 'social experiments' too?' one asked on Twitter. Pepper added on Twitter on Tuesday: 'In hindsight we would all do things different in our lives, I could have executed this neater, but would have it as reached as many people?'","On Wednesday a woman came out to say that Sam Pepper tried to solicit nude photos of her in 2011 when she was 15 and he was 22 .

"Jason Hakala is a video specialist, so his marriage proposal was probably always going to be a recording. The Seattle man works for The Cut, who this week hit headlines for producing a hilarious video of some grandmothers who smoked weed together for the first time. But Hakala has now gone viral on his own, after filming a grand marriage proposal to his longtime girlfriend, Stella Yee.

"A man underwent surgery to have 50 maggots removed from his nose before they destroyed his face and killed him. The painstaking operation to remove the creatures - which had buried deep inside his sinuses - took two hours, doctors said. The man was suffering from nasal myasis – where the nose and sinuses become infested with the larvae of flies. Scroll down for video . A man had surgery to remove 50 maggots from his nasal cavities. He was suffering from nasal myasis, where flies lay their eggs in or around a nose and then hatch into maggots which feed off human flesh . A surgeon removed the writhing maggots one by one. If left untreated, they could chew through the flesh and bones of the face and eyes, possibly causing an infection such as meningitis and even death . Flies lay their eggs in or around a person’s nose, and they hatch into maggots. The maggots, which are around a centimetre in length, feed off human flesh. If left untreated, they can chew and destroy the bones and soft tissues of the face, nose and eyes. This can lead to infection in the eyes and brain, and occasionally causing meningitis and even death. Dr Meenesh Juvekar, who carried out the operation was able to see into the man's nose using an endoscope. This is a thin, flexible tube that has a light and a camera on the end. He uploaded the video from the endoscope’s camera to Youtube afterwards, showing the inside of the man’s nose before and after the procedure. It shows the white maggots packed into the nasal cavity, sometimes burrowing deep into the nasal tissue. As they had burrowed so deep, the procedure took two hours to remove them all. The maggots were buried deep into the man's nasal cavities and sinuses. When the light shined on them they burrowed deeper from view . At the end of the video, a metal bowl is seen filled with the squirming maggots amid pieces of bloody nasal tissue. Dr Juvekar said he has seen only six to eight cases of nasal maggots in 15 years of his Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) practice. He added that the man completely recovered from the disease afterwards. Nasal myasis is common in tropical countries such as India. It usually occurs in people who have poor hygiene and nutrition, or alcoholics. It also occurs in people who have a disease of the nose called Atrophic Rhinitis, which produces foul smelling discharge which attracts the flies. Around 50 maggots were collected in a metal bowl at the end of the procedure. They were mixed up with bloody pieces of nasal tissue . People with the condition may not be aware they have maggots in the nose, but they will usually experience irritation, sneezing, tears and a headache. Thin blood-stained discharge often oozes from the nostrils and the eyelids and lips become puffy. Usually the maggots are killed using chloroform water and oil, and warm saline water is used to flush out the dead maggots. Surgery to remove the creatures is performed in extreme cases. Doctors advise that a patient with maggots should covered with a mosquito net to avoid contact with flies, which could lead to further infestation. Parents in Rhode Island in the U.S. are being warned that their children could succumb to horrifying infestations of nasal maggots worming in their noses if they continue snorting Smarties sweets. The unusual trend  seeks to imitate cocaine users seen on television. But doctors are warning the bizarre trend can lead to a condition called nasal myiasis - which occurs when flies lay larvae eggs inside the nose. They are attracted by the rotting debris of the sweets stick inside the nasal lining. According to officials in Portsmouth Middle School, Rhode Island, the trend is a 'widespread phenomenon' that has been sweeping Youtube in recent years and has involved over a dozen students in the area. Parents have been warned to watch their children to see if they develop a tickling sensation inside their noses and ask them if they begin to smell a foul stench from inside their nasal passage.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Taxing: David Cameron is struggling to win over British territories and Crown dependencies to his plan to crackdown n tax havens . David Cameron’s global crackdown on tax avoidance could be jettisoned by Bermuda. The Prime Minister had hoped to secure a major agreement with tax havens suspected of allowing the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the UK taxman. But Bermuda is so far refusing to sign up to the transparency deal ahead of next week’s G8 summit. Mr Cameron hoped to use a meeting with 10 British overseas territories and crown dependencies as proof he is cracking down on the ‘scourge of tax evasion’ which costs Britain billions. Senior ministers from Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are expected to attend the summit in London on Saturday. But Bermuda's Premier Craig Cannonier has signalled he will not sign up to the deal, raising the prospect of other territories refusing to take part. Mr Cameron has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland on June 17 and 18. He has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘get our own houses in order’. Some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens, though they dispute this description and regard their low-tax regimes as vital to their economies. Mr Cameron wants them all to sign up to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which includes keeping a list owners of companies which can then be checked by tax authorities from around the world. However, Bermuda claims it already meets many of the provisions and is not ready to commit to signing the convention. Premier Mr Cannonier told Reuters: ‘There's some clauses in there that we need to look at, that may need to be adjusted, and ... our finance ministry is going over it with a fine-tooth comb.’ He also questioned whether Mr Cameron will be able to achieve broad agreement from all the territories this week. Reluctance: The government of Bermuda is yet to sign up to a global convention on sharing data about companies and the tax they pay . However, a spokesman for the Cayman Islands government said it has already agreed to commit to the Convention. Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have also signalled that they are ready to sign the OECD convention. Mr Cameron yesterday insisted he could secure ‘further progress’ with overseas territories at this weekend’s meeting. He added: ‘People rightly get angry when they work hard, they pay their taxes and then see others not paying their fair share. ‘But in a globalised world, no one country can on their own effectively stamp out either tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance and this is exactly the sort of issue that the leaders of the eight major economies should address. We should be galvanising international action.’ Clash: Mr Cameron hopes to persuade the leaders of the world's biggest economies to sign up to new tax rules but ahead of the G8 summit there have been protests in London . Pressure is mounting on Mr Cameron to secure a landmark agreement on tax at the G8 summit with the leaders of the world's largest economies in Co Fermagh at the Lough Erne golf resort. There have already been angry anti-capitalist protests in London, and campaigners have warned the Prime Minister risks failing to live up to his rhetoric. Last month he wrote to the British overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance’ a priority for the G8 summit. He added: ‘I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership. ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all. ‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. ‘There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.'' He has hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax. The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.","Prime Minister has summoned 10 British territories to London meeting .

"A heavily pregnant woman and her partner were caught having sex in a hospital bed while waiting to have their baby induced. The mother and father were discovered by a cleaner who heard moaning coming from a private room on the maternity ward. The worker told hospital bosses what she had found but was informed there are no rules against having sex on the ward at St Michael's Hospital, in Bristol. A heavily pregnant woman and her partner were caught having sex at St Michael's Hospital (pictured), in Bristol, while waiting to have their baby induced .

The cleaner was utterly shocked. 'She was amazed to be told it was OK. The hospital's advice appears to be just to put a sign up - amazing.' Like herbal remedies and eating spicy food, sex is said to help induce labour in some cases. However, NHS advice says: 'You may have heard that certain things can trigger labour, such as herbal supplements and having sex, but there is no evidence that these work.

'Thankfully, we have not received any complaints or concerns in regard to this matter.' Last year, St Michael's Hospital was criticised for allowing a mother to bring a dog into the maternity ward so it could watch her give birth. The unusual presence was criticised amid claims that no special cleaning took place after the two-hour birth.

"They are barely seven years old, but these glum-looking children are already being drafted into a tyrannical regime hellbent on waging nuclear war with the world. Standing in arrow-straight rows, their faces are hardly the picture of happiness as they are forced to pledge their allegiance to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and call him 'father'. Troubling images of them being inducted into an organisation likened to the Hitler Youth emerged as their despot leader pressed ahead with plans to launch a ballistic missile, potentially with nuclear capabilities.

Rogue regime: Thousands gathered at the Kim Il Sung Stadium in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to watch the youngsters be sworn in . Thousands gathered at the Kim Il Sung Stadium in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang today to watch the youngsters be sworn into the Korean Children's Union, a political organisation for children aged seven to 13, in which they pledge to build up strength to defend their nation. Retired military officers helped them tie on red scarves to help complete the ritual. At a rally last year, members of the KCU wept and jostled to hold Kim Jong Un's hand in what was likened to a welcome given to teen pop idol Justin Bieber than a political leader. In a speech to mark the organisation's 66th anniversary last June, Kim told the young delegates they were the future masters of 'a most powerful country where every home will be full of laughter and everybody lives in harmony'.

A North Korean woman has told how she was so desperate to escape the pariah state's reign of terror she risked the execution of her entire family to smuggle them out of the country. Lee Hyeonseo, right, said the communist regime forced people to live in a 'virtual prison' with no concept of human rights. Anyone caught trying to defect is routinely sentenced to death as Kim Jong Un attempts to hide the reality of food shortages, labour camps and indoctrination from the outside world. And because punishment is handed down for three generations, even the husband or wife, children and grandchildren of those who escape are imprisoned. Miss Lee said she made the 'the long and very difficult' journey to South Korea after bribing her way out of the country. She did not give details how she managed it, but she very likely didn't have any money. Speaking from a drop-in centre for North Koreans at a Seoul University, she told Sky News: 'People in the north don't know the truth about what is going on as they can't hear or see anything about the wider world. 'They don't know about human rights or the suffering. They live in a virtual prison.'

'The rhetoric we are hearing from North Korea is simply unacceptable. I'm here to make it clear today that the U.S. will defend our allies and ourselves.'

"Islamic Shebab extremists ambushed a bus in Kenya before executing 28 non-Muslims at point-blank range in a revenge attack for  police raids on mosques in the troubled city of Mombasa. The heavily-armed gunmen ambushed the bus early this morning as it headed for Nairobi from Mandera, a town that lies on the border with Somalia. The extremists reportedly separated the Muslims from the 28 victims by forcing them to read versus from the Koran. Those that failed were shot in the head at point-blank range. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The bodies of 28 non-Muslims who were executed today by Islamic Shebab lie on the ground in Mandera, before being taken to a nearby hospital . Among the victims were several children, who were shot in the head at point-blank range alongside the other victims . Rescue workers walk near the Nairobi-bound bus that was ambushed outside Mandera town . Security officers gather around the bodies of those who were killed at the scene of the attack . After the ambush, a Shebab spokesman said the 'perishing of the crusaders' was in retribution for last week's raids 'against Muslim brethren' in Mombasa, which heightened tensions in the city. The death toll - which included 19 men and nine women - was confirmed by Kenya's Red Cross, which said it was attempting to retrieve the victims' bodies from the scene. Regional police chief Noah Mwavinda also told AFP. 'I can confirm... that 28 innocent travellers were brutally executed by the Shebab.' Some 60 passengers were on board the bus when it was seized by the gunmen. Gunmen waved down the bus before spraying it with bullets when it did not stop. They then shot a rocket-propelled grenade at the vehicle, before commandeering the bus off the road . They ordered the passengers to get off the vehicle before separating the travellers into Muslims and non-Muslims. The killings took place after extremists hijacked a  bus in Mandera, north Kenya, before separating the Muslims from the non-Muslims . They forced the passengers to read verses from the Koran and killed them if they failed . The gunmen hijacked the bus (pictured), which was on its way to Nairobi, before killing the 28 victims . Gunmen waved down the bus before spraying it with bullets when it did not stop - 28 passengers were then executed . The militants then ordered the non-Muslims to reboard the bus. But when the bus got stuck in the mud, the group of ten militants trooped the prisoners outside before carrying out the executions. They then fled to Somalia. One passenger told the BBC that the victims were shot in the head at point-blank range after being forced to read verses from the Koran. Three people who were due to be killed were reportedly spared after managing to successfully recite some of the verses. Ahmed Mahatsaid: 'When we got down, passengers were separated according to Somali and non-Somalis. 'The non-Somalis were ordered to read some verses of the holy Koran, and those who failed to read were ordered to lie down. One by one they were shot in the head at point blank range.' Relatives of those who were killed cry as the bodies of their loved ones arrive at Chiromo mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya .

She joined a group of other relatives of the passengers who were on the hijacked vehicle earlier today . Hearses arrived at the airport in preparation to transport the victims' bodies before their funerals . Some of the dead were public servants who were heading to Nairobi for the Christmas holiday. Police Inspector General David Kimaiyo told reporters that 19 men and nine women were killed. He said: 'Preliminary reports indicate that the attackers, who were heavily armed, later fled towards the border into Somalia.' Ahmed Maalim, an official at the Mandera East sub-county security force, said three were spared after reciting Koran verses. After news of the incident broke out, the Red Cross said the response team was with security personnel at the scene in an attempt to retrieve bodies from scene.

A police track carrying the bodies of passengers who were killed during an ambush on a Nairobi-bound bus outside Mandera town, leaves the Wilson airport . It later said a helicopter had arrived at the scene to take the bodies to Mandera County Hospital. But a shortage of personnel and lack of equipment led to a slow response by police when the information was received. Two officers told how the attackers had better weaponry than the police who waited for military reinforcements before responding. The executions came after one person was shot dead and more than 350 people were arrested as Kenyan security forces raided mosques in Mombasa. The raids raised tensions in a city that has already been hit by a string of bombings and shootings. During the raids, the officers seized weapons and found black Islamist flags like those flown by the Shebab in the raids. Then, on Monday, four people were stabbed to death in apparent revenge attacks, which saw gangs took to the streets before beating and knifing their victims. Talking about today's killings, Ali Mohamud Rage told AFP: 'The Mujahedeen successfully carried out an operation near Mandera early this morning, which resulted in the perishing of 28 crusaders, as a revenge for the crimes committed by the Kenyan crusaders against our Muslim brethren in Mombasa.' Kenya has suffered a series of attacks since invading Somalia in 2011 to attack the Shebab, later joining an African Union force battling the Islamists. The rebels said they had carried out the 'perishing' in retaliation to 'crimes committed by Kenyan crusaders against Muslim brethren' (file picture) Police officers stand at the scene where a bus and a police vehicle were attacked by gunmen on July 18 near the town of Witu, on Kenya's restive southeastern coast . The Shebab carried out the September 2013 attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall, killing at least 67 people. They said it was a warning to Kenya to pull its troops out of southern Somalia. During the Westgate attack, some of the victims were killed after the gunmen weeded out non-Muslims for execution by demanding they recite the Shahada, the Muslim profession of faith. The Shebab has lost a series of key towns and ports to the AU force and Somalian government army. The advances are said to stem the militants' multi-million dollar business trading charcoal to Gulf countries. But in a recent report, UN investigators warned that the air and drone strikes on the militia have done little to damage it in the long term and that the insurgents continue to pose a serious regional threat.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Today Mars is a cold and barren desert world, with no apparent sign of life. But four billion years ago, scientists believe the red planet was a very different place - one that the believe looked a lot like Earth. A stunning video by Nasa’s Goddard Conceptual Image Lab reveals what Mars may have looked like if its atmosphere allowed for water. Scroll down for video... This is an artist's concept of an ancient, habitable Mars capable of supporting liquid water on its surface . The animation is based on existing data collected by Nasa which suggests Mars was once full of huge lakes and waterways. ‘There are characteristic dendritic structured channels that, like on Earth, are consistent with surface erosion by water flows,’ said Dr Joseph Grebowsky of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The interiors of some impact craters, for instance, have patterns that suggest crater lakes, with many showing connecting channels consistent with water flows into the crater. ‘Small impact craters have been removed with time and larger craters show signs of erosion by water before 3.7 billion years ago,’ added Dr Grebowsky. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like . The video was created ahead of Nasa's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission which will investigate dramatic climate change on Mars. The MAVEN mission is due to launch on Monday November 18 and will arrive at Mars in September 2014. It will take critical measurements of the Martian upper atmosphere to help scientists understand climate change over the red planet's history. Specifically, it will investigate how the loss of Mars' atmosphere to space determined the history of water on the surface. ‘Minerals are present on the surface that can only be produced in the presence of liquid water, for example, in hematite and clays.’ Estimates of the amount of water needed to explain these features suggest as much as a planet-wide layer one-half a kilometre (1,640 feet) deep of liquid. If liquid surface water existed in the past, then Mars' atmosphere had to have a different climate that was warmer. In the video, rapidly moving clouds are used to suggest the passage of time, and the shift from a warm and wet to a cold and dry climate is shown as the video progresses. The lakes dry up and freeze over, while the atmosphere changes from Earth-like blue skies to the pink and tan colours seen on Mars today. It's unknown if the habitable climate lasted long enough for life to emerge on Mars. ‘The only direct evidence for life early in the history of a planet's evolution is that on Earth,’ said Dr Grebowsky. Nasa said the video is one of the most complex animations ever produced by its Conceptual Image Lab, located at Goddard. Liquid water cannot exist pervasively on the Martian surface today due to the low atmospheric pressure and surface temperature . In the video, rapidly moving clouds are used to suggest the passage of time, and the shift from a warm and wet to a cold and dry climate is shown as the video progresses . ‘We used a wide Cinemascope aspect ratio to better showcase the landscape.

"If you can’t resist the chance to put on a bet, blame your insula. Scientists think that when this brain area is overactive, the heart rules our head and we can’t help but chase our losses. The Cambridge University researchers said: ‘Future treatments for gambling addiction could seek to reduce this hyperactivity, either by drugs or psychological techniques.’ Winning big? Scientists think that when the insula area of the brain is overactive, people are more likely to gamble. They came to the conclusion after watching people with various brain injuries and healthy people play slot machine (pictured) and roulette-style computer games . The researchers made the link after . asking people with various brain injuries and healthy people play slot . machine and roulette-style computer games. A near miss on the slot machines made the players, except those with the damaged insulas, extra-keen to try their luck again. Similarly, all of the players, apart from those with faulty insulas, made a common mistake when playing roulette. Dr Luke Clark from the University of Cambridge, who led the research, explained that during gambling games, people often misperceive their chances of winning due to a number of errors of thinking called cognitive distortions. For example, ‘near-misses’ seem to encourage further play, even though they are no different from any other loss. In a random sequence like tossing a coin, a run of one event (heads) makes people think the other outcome (tails) is due next; this is known as the ‘gambler’s fallacy’. There is increasing evidence that problem gamblers are particularly prone to these erroneous beliefs. Intriguing insula: A near miss on the slot machines made the players, except those with the damaged insulas, keen to try their luck again. Similarly, all of the players, apart from those with faulty insulas, made a common mistake when playing roulette. A diagram of the human brain, highlighting the hyperactive area is pictured . ‘While neuroimaging studies can tell us a great deal about the brain’s response to complex events, it’s only by studying patients with brain injury that we can see if a brain region is actually needed to perform a given task,’ he said. The researchers gave patients with injuries to specific parts of the brain two tasks  - a slot machine game that delivered wins and ‘near-misses' and a roulette game involving red or black predictions, to bring on the gambler’s fallacy. All of the groups - with the exception of the patients with insula damage - reported a heightened motivation to play following near-misses in the slot machine game, and also fell prey to the gambler’s fallacy in the roulette game. The finding, which is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), suggests that the insula, which is involved in gut feelings and decision-making, is key to the psychology of gambling. ‘Based on these results, we believe that the insula could be hyperactive in problem gamblers, making them more susceptible to these errors of thinking,’ said Dr Clarke. ‘Future treatments for gambling addiction could seek to reduce this hyperactivity, either by drugs or by psychological techniques like mindfulness therapies.’","Scientists at the University of Cambridge have identified the part of brain responsible for gambling addiction .

"One in three Americans drinks to excess, but a small percentage of these drinkers are actually dependent on alcohol. That's according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control released this month based on data  from 2009 to 2011 collected from around 138,100 respondents about alcohol consumption habits. The study found while heavy drinking among Americans leads to 88,000 deaths yearly, excess drinking is not necessarily tied to alcoholism, which affects around 3.5 percent of the population. Scroll down for video . Consumption: A study by the Centers for Disease Control found that around one in three Americans drinks in excess, though it is not always caused by alcohol dependency . Excessive drinking is defined in the study as 15 or more drinks per week for men and 8 for women, while binge drinking is considered 5 or more drinks a day for men and 4 for women. 'This study shows that, contrary to popular opinion, most people who drink too much are not alcohol dependent,' said Robert Brewer, CDC epidemiologist and co-author of the study, to NPR. Only around 10 percent of those drinking excessively have what is considered alcohol dependency or alcoholism. People can be described as alcoholics when affected by a combination of several factors, including being unable to stop or decrease consumption or allowing drinking to interfere with work or relationships. 'The reality of the situation is that most adults who drink, they're drinking maybe a couple drinks during week and then typically drinking [larger] amounts on weekends.' Still, alcohol dependency was found to be much more common among those who drank excessively or binged than non-binge drinkers, among whom only 1.3 percent could be described as alcoholics. Serving size: The CDC has a chart to describe what is considered one serving of alcohol, defined by the amount of alcohol contained . The study also found that some segments of the population are more prone to excessive drinking and binge drinking than others. Overall, adults ages 18-24 were most likely to be considered heavy or binge drinkers, with 50 percent falling into the category of excessive drinking. The study notes that for adults between 18 and 20, any drinking reported was considered as excessive. While not necessarily a sign of alcohol dependence, drinking to excess brings serious health concerns, including heart and liver disease and liver cancer. According to a study published by Harvard in 2011, binge drinking was linked to increased risk of breast cancer for women.","A study published by the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 138,100 adults about alcohol consumption from 2009 to 2011 .

"Commanding an area larger than Britain with a population of more than four million brutally oppressed citizens, Islamic State terrorists use a strict hierarchical system to manage operations. Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has appointed a rigid chain of command beneath him, divided into separate councils responsible for everything from the sale of oil, to internal communications and decisions on which prisoners to execute and how. The highly detailed information on exactly how the terror group operates, as well as the names of Baghdadi's deputies and department heads, stems from the discovery of a USB stick inside the  home of Abu Abdul Rahman al-Bilawi - the now deceased former-head of ISIS' military operations in Iraq. Scroll down for video . Structure: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi employs a network of deputies, councils and executives with the power to act on the ISIS leader's behalf. These senior militants are believed to give orders to a group of 24 regional governors, who in turn head 'councils' managing everything from the sale of oil, to the treatment of prisoners . While terror group Al Qaeda's central command operates using a small highly-centralized group of trusted advisers close to leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, ISIS has been able to to rapidly respond to issues and developments thanks to a team of executives with the power to act on Baghdadi's behalf. While Baghdadi - whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai - is the overall leader of ISIS, he is understood to have appointed two deputies to oversee operations in Iraq and Syria. Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who uses the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, is understood to be in charge of operations in Iraq, while a man identified as Abu Ali al-Anbari is responsible for Syria. Baghdadi has also appointed a seven-man 'cabinet', with each member reporting to him directly and and advising on operational policy across the territory, according to new research by the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC). Included in this group of seven are thought to be Shawkat Hazem al-Farhat, who uses the code name Abu Abdul Kadr and advises on general management issues, and Abdul Wahid Khutnayer Ahmad, who calls himself either Abu Louay or Abu Ali and counsels on security, according to the Telegraph. Other cabinet member include Bashar Ismail al-Hamdani, AKA Abu Mohamed (head of prisoners), Muafaq Mustafa Mohammed al-Karmoush, known as Abu Salah (head of finances in Iraq), Mohammed Hamid al-Duleimi, who calls himself Abu Hajar al-Assafi (head of internal messages), and Abdullah Ahmed al-Meshedani, AKA Abu Kassem (in charge of the arrival of foreign fighters' arrival). The seventh 'cabinet' member is understood to be have been  al-Bilawi - the now deceased militant and former captain in Saddam Hussein's army, whose USB stick revealed the names of much of ISIS' top brass. It is not known who, if anyone, has replaced him as Baghdadi's military adviser in Iraq. Leader: While Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi - whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai - is ISIS' overall chief, he is understood to have appointed two deputies to oversee operations in Iraq and Syria . More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month, it has been claimed. Of those radical Muslims flocking to ISIS' ranks, at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control, according to analysts from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIS' numbers have swelled in the weeks since America launched the first of 167 air strikes against the militant group on August 8. A number of rebel commanders who oppose ISIS but also fight against their enemy Syrian president Bashar Assad have previously warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists. As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos and digital magazines. The releases are tailored to encourage young Muslims living in the West to join the group. While the 'cabinet' acts strictly as an advisory body for Baghdadi himself, ISIS' leader also employs 12 'governors' in Syria and 12 governors in Iraq who ensure his diktats are implemented. These 24 governors are each responsible for a specific region under ISIS' control, with each one appointing a team of 'councillors' to manage every tiny aspect of everyday life in the area. According to CNN, each governor is in charge of eight councils: financial (managing the sale of oil and the purchase of weapons and supplies), leadership (implementation and drafting of laws), military (defence of the territory), legal (crime and punishment), assistance (ensuring fighters are adequately resourced), security (internal policing), intelligence (information gathering) and media (releasing statements and propaganda, and overseeing militants' use of social media). These regional 'councils' operate on the orders of their governor who bases his demands on those issued by Baghdadi himself, and also according to new laws and advice released by another  group reporting to ISIS' leader and deputies, namely the Shura or war council. The group comprises a group of highly trained religious and military experts, among them Fares Reif al-Naima, AKA Abu Shema, Abdul Rahman al-Afari, AKA Abu Suja, and Khairy Abed Mahmoud al-Taey, AKA Abu Kifah, according to the Telegraph. Militants: Commanding an area larger than Britain with a population of more than four million brutally oppressed citizens, Islamic State terrorists (pictured) use a strict hierarchical system to manage operations . Terror: As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos (such as the one pictured above) and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group . ISIS has most likely split the 'Islamic State' into Syrian and Iraqi branches to make it easier to manage, Jasmine Opperman, TRAC's Southern Africa Director, told CNN. 'They see the caliphate as one state, yet there are two different governments.... I believe this split is purely administrative at this time. They don't want to be seen as downplaying the caliphate, but to make it easier to govern they were forced to make a separation between Syria and Iraq.' According to Opperman, the members of the Shura Council are particularly interesting because - although they are appointed by Baghdadi - they also have the power to punish and even fire him and other senior ISIS figures if they consider them to have breached Islamic law. All major decisions on ISIS' activities, such as the sickening filmed murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines, will also have been given approval by the Shura Council.","Jihadist group uses a strict hierarchical system to manage terror operations .

"Ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism and crimes involving UK Muslims, a senior Home Office adviser said today. The anonymous expert on right-wing extremism warned that the Government is putting an emphasis on the ‘global jihadist agenda’ while possibly ignoring the growth of the far-right at home. The adviser warned of the importance of preventing a violent attack being carried out by the far-right in Britain in the future. Danger: Fighters from ISIS march in Raqqa, Syria, earlier this year. A Home Office adviser has warned ministers must not ignore the growing threat of violence from far-right extremists in Britain in the wake of ISIS terrorism . He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I have been working with people from the far-right for about 27 years now. ‘I can see increases in some of these groups and membership in some of these groups based on things that are happening nationally here and internationally. ‘A lot of the emphasis is put on the global jihadist agenda, which is fine, and it needs to be, but I really feel that this agenda, the repercussions of some of that in terms of the far-right can’t be ignored. ‘I wouldn’t want to get to the point where something happens and we look back and think actually we should have addressed that as well.’ The expert said he had met someone who wanted to put everyone who was not white British into Nazi-style death camps.

Miss Blears said: ‘I honestly do not . think that the Government is doing enough in the whole Prevent programme . to bring people together and to support the Muslim majority who are . absolutely horrified at what’s been happening.’ A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The Prevent strategy tackles all forms of extremism, including from the far-right. As the shocking murder of Mohammed Saleem last year demonstrated, we should not underestimate the threat it poses. Improvements needed: Labour former communities secretary Hazel Blears (pictured) said the Government needs to better support the Muslim majority who condemn Islamist extremism . ‘By fundamentally revising Prevent in 2011, and through the work of the Extremism Task Force, we have improved the way we tackle extremism and radicalisation. Since 2011, we have implemented a raft of practical measures to strengthen our approach in prisons, schools, universities and online.’ And an Association of Chief Police Officers . spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We are not seeing an increase in right-wing extremist attacks or activity. 'The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored' Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman . ‘There’s not been a notable increase in anti-Islamic hate crime - however, some Muslims communities in the UK feel more vulnerable due to the extensive coverage of terrorist activity and the extreme views of Islam promoted by ISIS and other terrorist groups. ‘The police take the threat from all forms of extremism extremely seriously and the specific threat from right-wing extremism is constantly monitored. ‘Police work to prevent people being drawn into extremism through a variety of methods including every day neighbourhood policing and specific community engagement programmes.

Days earlier, Miss Halliwell and her fiancé Christian Horner turned out to support the royal at Sentebale Polo Cup. German Nico Rosberg finished in pole position today after beginning the weekend 17-points behind Britain's Lewis Hamilton. Both drivers belong to the Mercedes Formula One team.

"A pre-Christmas splurge by rich tourists could save what has been a 'suffering' year for international spending in Britain, according to a new report. Analysts forecast China and Middle Eastern nations to lead the Christmas shopping spree with Chinese tourists still the biggest spenders in Britain. Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh are now becoming international Christmas shopping destinations as well as tourist mecca London, according to the report. London is still the premier shopping destination for tourists - and it's the Chinese who contribute most . Tourism shopping tax refund firm Global Blue is predicting that the final quarter of 2014 will boost what has been a slow year in terms of international spend in Britain. VisitBritain's figures show visitor numbers have seen the biggest growth in the fourth quarter over the last five years, while Global Blue reported soaring growth in spending of 16 per cent year-on-year for the final quarter of 2013. Figures for the first 10 months of this year show China and Middle Eastern nations have remained strong as the highest spenders, with China representing 25 per cent of total spend, a five per increase on the previous year,, followed by Kuwait (eight per cent), Saudi Arabia (seven per cent) and Qatar (six per cent). However, spending by Russian tourists in Britain is down 26 per cent so far this year amid political unrest in Ukraine, while weakening currencies have also seen growth from Thailand and other South East Asian nations suffer, with Thai spend also down 26 per cent. However, spending is expected to rise in the run-up to Christmas as tourists flock to snap up British gifts for family and friends that they can't get at home. Christmas shopping in Manchester - where tourists will pay their fair share into the economy . Edinburgh is emerging as a strong alternative to London for tourists . Gordon Clark, UK country manager of Global Blue, said: 'Christmas is one of the key periods for international shoppers coming to the UK. 'Last year saw strong sales across the board, with all nations reporting significant growth. 'Political turmoil and weakened currencies have left shoppers from some nations, particularly Thailand and Russia, less likely to spend in the UK this year, so retailers are focusing their services on targeting the traditional Chinese and Middle Eastern markets who have continued to contribute most significantly to sales. 'Tax free shopping, more than ever, has become an integral part of the Christmas strategy for retailers.' Liverpool's naming as European Capital of Culture in 2008 has helped boost the shopping scene . The Bullring in Birmingham is one of the more modern shopping centres in the UK . Patricia Yates, director of strategy and communications at VisitBritain, added: 'London is an international Christmas shopping destination, but our numbers now show that major cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh are starting to emerge as strong alternatives. 'Last year the North West of England was the second most popular destination for international shoppers. 'Shopping is a lucrative business. 'High spending Qataris contributed an astonishing £5,077 per visit across Britain during the same period last year, that's eight times the market average, so we continually look to tailor our overseas marketing to bring us the highest returns from such regions. 'Whatever the price range or product, shopping allows the economic benefits of tourism to be spread across the whole country.'","London is premier shopping centre of UK, but other cities closing the gap .

"Smithsonian magazine has used an algorithm based on data taken from Wikipedia pages to compile a list of the 100 most influential Americas of all time. Alongside presidents, entrepreneurs and athletes, the group also includes presidential assassins, professional wrestlers, notorious gangsters and serial killers. Surprise names featuring on the list being published in a collector's edition of the magazine include mobsters John Dillinger and Al Capone, cult leader and murderer Charles Manson, movie star-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger and race horse Secretariat. Smithsonian magazine compiled a list of the 100 most influential Americans using an algorithm which took data from Wikipedia pages. The list included President Abraham Lincoln and Muhammad Ali . L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, Lee Harvey Oswald, the man suspected of killing JFK and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan also make appearances. Some of the less unexpected appearances are made by Abraham Lincoln, Muhammad Ali, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr. and Bill Gates. The group is not ranked, but is split into ten groups the magazine believed are significant. They are: Trailblazers, Rebels & resisters, Presidents, First Women, Outlaws, Artists, Religious figures, Pop icons, Empire-builders, Athletes. Steven Skiena, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, and Charles B. Ward, an engineer at Google, came up with an algorithm that ranks historical figures. It is based on not just what an individual has done, but also how well they are remembered for it. By using Wikipedia, which has 840,000 pages dedicated to individuals throughout history, they  produce a single score for each person. Criminals: Two surprising additions were serial killer Charles Manson and the man accused of assassinating JFK, Lee Harvey Oswald . The formula incorporates the number of links to each page, the number of page views, the length of the entries and how often they are edited. Their algorithms differentiate between two kinds of historical reputation, what they call 'gravitas' and 'celebrity.' By their reckoning, Jesus, Napoleon, Muhammad, William Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln rank as the top five figures in world history. According to the pair however, their method does have limitations. Wikipedia for example favors Americans over foreigners, English speakers over others, men over women and white people over other races.

"As suburban populations increase in places like Chicago, there is no space left for coyotes to live and roam for their prey. Therefore almost 2,000 have ventured into a new habitat - among the skyscrapers of downtown Windy City. The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars. Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children. But the suburban sprawl and increase in out-of-town developments have prompted some to migrate to more urban areas. Scroll down for video . Urban crawlers: A Crittercam used as part of a study by Ohio State University shows a pair of coyotes trying to cross a road in downtown Chicago . Lifestyle: The project, which has seen 850 of the creatures tagged with GPS and 400 with radio collars, has found them to be strictly nocturnal, but during the day they sleep yards away from where humans walk . They are strictly nocturnal, curling up in a ball during the day just yards from where people walk, and are able to defend large settlement areas. Stan Gehrt, a wildlife ecologist at Ohio State University in Columbus, told National Geographic that the versatile creatures are 'expanding their ecological envelope'. 'We felt there were parts of Chicago too urban, with too many people, for coyotes to live—and we were wrong,' he said. 'They're a humbling animal'. Gerht, who has been tracking urban coyotes in Chicago since 2000, tagged 850 coyotes with GPS devices and placed radio collars on about 400. During the course of the project they have found that coyotes thrive in urban populations - living longer than their rural cousins and being more active at night. Crittercams attached to the animals show them stopping and waiting for cars, rushing between streets and following their mates. Because of access to a wider range of resources - such as discarded food - they are able to produce larger litters of puppies, with an average of up to nine per pack. One GPS-collared coyote named 748 and his mate were able to raise a litter of five pups inside a secret concrete den in the parking lot of Soldier Field Stadium, home of the Chicago Bears. One GPS-collared coyote managed to raise five pups in a secret concrete den in the parking lot of Soldier Field Stadium, the home of the Chicago Bears . The survey is run by the Urban coyote ecology and management based in Illinois. Their website reads: 'Originally known as ghosts of the plains, coyotes have now become ghosts of the cities, occasionally heard but less often seen. 'With the exception of a few individuals, coyotes have largely learned to avoid us.' The movement of the carnivores into the city was embraced in 2011, when officials used one to help rid the streets of rats. Some locals were surprised at the move because attacks on humans are rare, but not unknown, however the results were limited. They more frequently target pets, prompting some communities around the country to take action to stop them. Residents of a Rhode Island town have enlisted a hired gun to rid the town of coyotes, responsible for several recent attacks on pets. In September officials in a Southern California suburb beset by a surge in coyote attacks on pets, including a small dog snatched from its owner's living room, approved a plan to trap and kill some of the wild canines roaming the town. The City Council of Seal Beach, a seaside community of about 25,000 residents south of Los Angeles, took the action this week following an uproar over a rise in coyotes venturing into neighborhoods to prey on dogs and cats. Earlier this year, an extreme, hybrid form of the carnivore was spotted in West Virginia and land north of the Great Lakes. The 'coywolf' - created after wolves and Eastern coyotes mated - were forced to live in built-up areas because of the increase in population. The wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey, while the coyote genes allow them to adapt to cities.

"Federal law enforcement officials are investigating a former Marine and several active-duty Marines after they allegedly posted threatening and lewd remarks online against President Obama and California Rep. Jackie Speier. The threats were made on one of many Facebook pages that have targeted Speier, a Democrat, since she alerted the Defense Department to an online forum where Marines were posting degrading images of female service members. The page that prompted the investigation, titled 'F*** You Jackie Speier,' has since been removed by Facebook, but another - called 'Jackie struggle snuggle Speier' has gone up in its place with similar content, including a photograph of Speier that has been edited to look as though she has a black eye with the caption, 'She burned the bacon only once.' Threats: Several Facebook pages, including this one, have been targeting Rep. Jackie Speier since the Democratic congresswoman alerted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to inappropriate activity by Marines online . Speier told KCBS that she refereed the original page to authorities after users 'made threatening claims to both the president and me.' Both the Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police are involved in the investigation, according to USA Today. Speier was targeted online after she wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel regarding the Facebook page 'F'N Wook,' on which several active duty and former Marines had posted sexually degrading comments and explicit pictures of female service members. In one photo from that page, which has been removed, a female Marine is pictured putting a male Marine into a choke hold. The caption reads: 'This is my rape face.' Another photo shows a female soldier lying on the ground with a gun and the caption reads: 'Hehe... I can ""bang"" even when I am not on my back!' Several Marines have since been referred to their commanders for punishment as a result of that page and other inappropriate activity online. Outrage: This is a copy of part of Rep. Jackie Speier's letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel concerning a Facebook page called 'F'N Wook' In retaliation against Speier's letter to Hagel, several pages have popped up on Facebook targeting the congresswoman. The page that was referred to authorities for investigation was removed by Facebook over the weekend and its replacement went live on May 24. So far it has 44 'likes.' 'Welcome back my hateful friends,' Facebook user Chris LaCorte, who claims to be a former Marine, wrote on the page. 'What women's group do you think will declare a jihad on us first this time?' Rep. Jackie Speier expressed outrage over the website in a letter sent to the Pentagon . The content includes pictures of Speier . and former Defense Secretary Hillary Clinton with lewd captions and . comments suggesting that women enjoy rape. 'If you get pregnant from a rape than . it means you enjoyed it,' reads one remark, which was 'liked' by a user . claiming to be a former Marine. Another post reads: 'I raped pregnant woman once. Best threesome ever.' The moderator of the page acknowledged the federal investigation in a comment posted to the page late Monday. 'None . of the posts or pictures on this page should be suggested that we are . threatening to harm another person, including Jackie Speier or Obama,' the moderator wrote. 'This page should be looked at as harsh humor and . we will work with authorities on any questions they may ask.' The . message adds: 'This page is meant to distract Jackie and all liberals . who hate freedom of speech. Other military pages were taken down for an . agenda.' Marine . activity on Facebook has come under fire as the military faces . increased scrutiny for increases in sexual assaults within the ranks. As . many as 26,000 military members have reported that they were sexually . assaulted last year, which is up from 19,000 reported assaults in 2011. Taken down: 'F'N Wook' was removed by Facebook after Speier sent the letter . Response: Following Speier's letter, the Marine Corps warned its members to 'avoid inappropriate behavior' online .","The Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the threats against Obama and California Rep.

"Defender Per Mertesacker has called on Arsenal to show their Barclays Premier League challenge is very much 'alive' when they head to West Brom for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off. The Gunners produced a much-improved, composed display to beat Champions League Group D leaders Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night, reaching the last 16 of Europe's elite with a match to spare. Mertesacker, though, believes the Germans' own domestic struggles in the Bundesliga - with Jurgen Klopp's side in the bottom three despite their fine European form - show focus must quickly turn towards getting things right at The Hawthorns. Defender Per Mertesacker wants Arsenal to focus on their match against West Brom . Arsenal's Mertesacker (left) listens to tactics from his manager Arsene Wenger (right) Arsenal beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 on Wednesday and Yaya Sanogo (right) scored the first goal . Arsenal are eighth in the top flight after a 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United last time out. Mertesacker said: 'We were very convincing (against Dortmund). Everyone had to learn. 'We have to show character and that is what makes me really happy for the next few games, because we have to sharpen up in the Premier League as well. Saturday is a good chance to show to everyone that we are still alive. 'Champions League football (in the knockout stages) we have secured and that gives us a life, but that has nothing to do with the Premier League. 'Dortmund are a good example of that, because they are already through, but they have suffered a lot in the league. We have to come back in the Premier League and that is the next target.' Arsenal, who squandered a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht a fortnight ago to draw, will need results to go their way on matchday six to overhaul Dortmund and secure seeding for the knockout stage draw - with the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain, just ahead of Barcelona in their group, potential opponents for runners-up. Olivier Giroud will continue his comeback from injury in Arsenal's game against West Brom on Saturday . Whatever transpires by the time Arsenal's next European fixtures come around in February, manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping to see some key men back from injury. Midfielder Jack Wilshere is expected to face several weeks out after damaging ankle ligaments against United, while captain Mikel Arteta is also being assessed after limping off on Wednesday night with a calf problem. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sidelined by a hip problem, but should return at The Hawthorns, with striker Danny Welbeck rested because of a minor knee injury as was Theo Walcott (groin). France forward Olivier Giroud - who scored on his return from a broken leg against United - was ineligible after not being included in Arsenal's original European squad, so will be pressing for a start this weekend, while defender Laurent Koscielny was on the bench against Dortmund after recovering from an Achilles problem. Yaya Sanogo was substituted late on after pulling up with a tight hamstring, having earlier fired home his first senior Arsenal goal inside just two minutes. Laurent Koscielny (second right) was on the bench against Dortmund after an Achilles problem . Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who cracked a superb 25-yard volley against the crossbar before Alexis Sanchez swept in a well-taken second goal on 57 minutes, is confident Arsenal can now build some momentum. 'Wins always relieve pressure, When we win everyone's happy. The players, the manager, the staff and the fans are happy,' he said. 'There is a long way to go in this competition and the league. We need to try to back this win up with some good results in the future.'","Arsneal are eighth in the Premier League after unimpressive start .

"Latest 'victim': Kristina Ruehli, now 71, claimed the comedian attacked her in 1965 when he invited her round for a party - but arrived and saw no one was there . A New Hampshire grandmother has become the latest woman to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her. Kristina Ruehli, now 71, claimed the comedian attacked her in 1965 when he invited her round for a party - but arrived and saw no one was there. She told Philadelphia Magazine that the 77-year-old, who she met while working for a Los Angeles talent agency, then told her his wife was out of town, so led her into a bedroom where he had an infant in a crib. The child was fast asleep,' she said. 'He seemed so proud of it. He wanted to show me his little baby.' 'We went out into the kitchen. He proceeded to pour some bourbon. I drank a bourbon-and-7 at the time. I could really hold my liquor. I'm Irish. And I had a couple of those - just two - and then I just don't remember much.' When she woke up the next day, she claims her nylon stockings were 'completely tore up' Ruehli claims she ended up in a bed next to his swimming pool and insists he must have drugged her - because two bourbons would not have 'knocked her out' when she was that age. At one point, she came to, she told the magazine that he had his shirt off on top of her while her pants were unzipped. 'He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head,' she added. Ruehli then fully woke up, managed to get away and then was very sick. After the alleged encounter she never saw the star again, and every time she saw Cosby on TV she thought to herself: 'This isn't the good guy that he's portrayed to be.' The grandmother-of-eight, who now spends her spare time skiing, says she decided to come forward when Andrea Constand's lawsuit was announced and she was branded 'a liar'. She became one of the Jane Does in the lawsuit that was eventually settled, a part which Constand's lawyer thanked her for. Lawyers for Cosby have dismissed all the claims as untrue while the star has refused to make any comment. Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has released a statement calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.' 'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer. Scroll down for video . On stage: Her claims came on the same day Cosby received a standing ovation after a show in Melbourne, Florida, in the midst of the resurfacing allegations . 'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?' He then closes by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' The comedian, who has been performing on staged despite the resurgence of allegations, stayed silent during a radio interview with NPR and pressured the Associated Press not to broadcast an interview where he was asked about the rape allegations. The comic was given two standing ovations when he appeared before an enthusiastic audience in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday night. He was cheered as he walked on the stage and later when he completed his 90-minute performance. Many in the audience even shouted for an encore at the end of the show, but Cosby did not reappear. Reaction: Cosby's lawyers have maintained that they will not dignify the accusations, which they have described as 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical', with an answer . On the same day Law & Order: SVU star Michelle Hurd came forward to say that Cosby acted highly inappropriately towards her when she was a stand-in on The Cosby Show, and claimed that she knows of one woman on set who woke up drugged at his apartment. Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. Going public: Renita Chainey Hill accused Cosby of flying her to different cities around the country and drugging her in hotels when she was 17 . Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless .","Kristina Ruehli, now 71, claimed the comedian attacked her in 1965 .

"An accident and emergency unit criticised in an official report for being unsafe and unable to cope with demand is set to be swamped with thousands of extra patients – thanks to emergency department closures elsewhere. The Chief Inspector of Hospitals painted a picture of chaos at ‘very busy’ Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, North-West London, after a recent visit.

In his report on Northwick Park, Professor Sir Mike Richards, who leads the Care Quality Commission’s inspectors, found that: . - Its A&E had ‘inadequate staffing levels to protect patients from avoidable harm’ - Patients were ‘often “bedded down” in A&E’ – because there were no free ward beds . - Ambulances had to wait too long to off-load desperately sick patients – resulting in eight ‘serious incidents’ in just 14 months . - The department ‘struggled’ at periods of high demand and was ‘consistently not meeting the four-hour A&E waiting-time target’ - Staff morale was ‘low’ and senior management was ‘unaware of the issues within critical care’ Sir Mike concluded the hospital ‘requires improvement’ and left managers an urgent ‘to do’ list. Ironically, one of the two A&Es that has just closed – at Central Middlesex Hospital – was ranked ‘good’ in the same CQC review. ‘The A&E department provided care and treatment that was safe,’ wrote Sir Mike and his team of inspectors after their visit to the hospital in Acton in May. ‘Staff expressed pride to be working in the A&E department.’ The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning for two years to save A&Es from closure. But Central Middlesex A&E, which treated 14,000 patients a year, shut on Wednesday. So too did the unit at Hammersmith Hospital, which treated 22,000. Both have been replaced with 24/7 ‘Urgent Care Centres’ (UCCs) – which have been criticised for offering a variable service, with some staffed by nurses alone at night. Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, North-West London, will soon have to deal with at least 8,000 more patients a year due to the controversial closure of two London units last week . NHS bosses hope the UCCs will be able to deal with A&E patients without life-threatening illness or injuries. They insist the ‘changes’ will improve care by centralising staff and resources. They estimate the closure of Central Middlesex’s A&E will lead to another 8,300 patients going to Northwick Park – a ten per cent rise. But predictions following previous closures have been well wide of the mark. The closure of Chase Farm A&E in Enfield was expected to lead to 26,000 more patients at North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton; that was recently revised up to 40,000. Even if the forecast is right, doctors fear the extra patients could cause problems across the whole of Northwick Park. One said: ‘There was no slack in the system as it was.’ Hospital chiefs seemed nonchalant about the CQC report at a July board meeting. ‘Only one issue within the report, in relation to critical care, had not been expected,’ stated the minutes. ‘Otherwise there were no surprises.’ Central Middlesex A&E, which treated 14,000 patients a year, closed on Wednesday (file picture) Gareth Thomas, MP for Harrow West, said: ‘Six months before these closures the trust said that it needed another 123 beds to meet local demand. I’m concerned A&E waiting times will continue to rise – as will waiting times for routine operations, as the hospital will be full up.’ Most Hammersmith A&E patients not dealt with by its UCC are expected go to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington – which was itself working at ‘maximum utilisation’ over the summer. Northwick Park and St Mary’s are being revamped to cope, said a spokesman for the NHS trusts that run them. A new £21 million, 40-bay A&E unit is opening at Northwick Park, and it will get 20 more ward beds. St Mary’s is getting extra staff and beds in A&E, a new 15-bed elderly care ward and an ambulatory care unit. David McVittie, chief executive of North West London Hospitals, said: ‘We do not expect a large impact on Northwick Park as a result of the closure of Central Middlesex and Hammersmith A&E units.’","Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, London, will soon have to deal with at least 8,000 more patients a year due to the closure of two London units .

"More Americans over 50 are getting divorced than ever before. A study out of Ohio’s Bowling Green State University found that 1 out of every 4 divorced person nationwide fits is considered a late in life divorcee. Researchers at the university’s National Center for Family and Marriage Research say that number has doubled since 1990, though race and education level make some more likely to divorce after 50 than others. Demographic shift: A study finds that Americans over 50 now account for 1 in 4 divorces. That's double the rate seen in 1990 . Trending: More Americans over 50 are getting divorced than ever and at twice the rate in 1990, the trend could continue . The study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), which asks respondents if they’ve been divorced in the last 12 months. When paired with other census data, the . ACS allowed researchers Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin to pin age and . other demographics onto a respondent’s divorce history. A study out of Bowling Green State University-based National Center for Family and Marriage Research gives surprising results about older Americans and divorces. 1 out of 4 divorces now involve a person over age 50. That number has more than doubled since 1990, when that number was1 in 10. Black Americans are the most likely to divorce late in life. They are followed by Hispanics, then whites, and Asians in late in life marriage statistics. Better educated Americans are less likely to divorce after 50 than are the less educated. Lead researcher Susan L. Brown attributes the change to several factors, including: . First off, the data told them that divorce rates had continue to increase in those over 50 while rates had begun to plateau in other group. ‘This surprised us, because the rate for younger people has leveled off,’ Brown, a sociology professor, told the Chicago Tribune. ‘In 1990, only 1 in 10 divorces were people 50 and older.’ A recent example of the trend can be seen in documentary filmmaker Michael Moore. In June, Moore filed a complaint against his wife Kathleen Glynn, who is 55, after 21 years of marriage. According to Brown, the change is rooted in several contemporary demographic shifts. Brown says that ‘that huge segment of baby boomers’ who have now entered their ‘senior’ years are simply more prevalent. She also attributes the change to the fact that more women are now in the workplace and, thus, ‘don't have to stay in empty-shell marriages for the money.’ Finally, Brown suggests that fewer people are now observant of their church rules against divorce. In addition to age, the study found that race affected the likelihood of divorce. African-Americans were most likely to divorce late in life. Hispanics less likely, followed by whites and Asians, who were the least likely to divorce after 50. Education level also played a role and the more you’ve had the less likely you are to divorce. Meanwhile, rates of widowhood, the study revealed, have gone down. However, Brown says society shouldn’t forget the plight of yesterday’s spouse left alone in his or her old age. ‘We need to look at these people the way we've looked at widowhood. Many need help financially,’ she says. ‘They had fewer kids, and the kids aren't always nearby, so they more often have to look outside the family for caregiving.’ Race affected late in life divorce as well. Blacks were the most likely to get one, followed by Hispanics, then whites, then Asians .","Study from Ohio's Bowling Green State University shows that 1 in 4 divorces now involve someone 50 or over .

"The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied on Wednesday a claim from a California Congressman that the ISIS terror army is quietly slipping into the United States through its porous southern border – and that American border patrol agents have already captured ten of its soldiers. Republican Duncan Hunter told a Fox News Channel audience on Tuesday that ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is actively infiltrating the U.S. 'I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,' he said. 'There's nobody talking about it.' But DHS fired back, saying in a statement that Hunter's claim is 'categorically false.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep. Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border . Vulnerable: Much of the Texas-Mexico border is essentially undefended, with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side . 'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group. 'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.' CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.' The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally. Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim. “The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement. 'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.' Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency. During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.' But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S. 'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.' 'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have.' 'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US . Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?' 'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.' The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing. Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.' Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. 'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border. 'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.' The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.' The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks. The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline. 'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said . 'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network.","Republican Rep.

"The Navy SEAL who says he's being told to pay $4.5million for his book on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden is suing the lawyer who advised him before he published. Matt Bissonnette filed suit against attorney Kevin Podlaski on Wednesday for $8million, claiming he was told that he did not need to submit the manuscript for his book No Easy Day to the Defense Department. According to the lawsuit, Bissonnette has been forced to negotiate a settlement with the government. He may also face criminal charges for revealing classified information. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Matt Bissonnette is suing the lawyer who advised him not to submit the manuscript of No Easy Day to the Department of Defense before publication . The Daily News reports that the lawsuit claims that Podlaski misled Bissonnette by giving him the impression that he had government clearance that allowed him to review classified material. 'The task (Podlaski) purported to undertake for the benefit of plaintiff and his writing team was absolutely contrary to law and doomed to failure from the start,' the documents state. He 'had no legal right to substitute his judgment for that of the Department of Defense or other agencies of the United States as to what is considered classified or otherwise sensitive information,' the lawsuit continues. Bissonnette's current lawyer, Richard Luskin of the high-powered Washington firm Patton Boggs, told The Daily Beast that he reached a settlement with the Pentagon that's 'temporarily on hold.' In action: Business Insider identified Bissonnette on the right in this file photo, and Bissonnette has stated he was also involved in the rescue of Captain Phillips . According to the lawsuit, Bissonnette's settlement gives up 'the majority of all income he has received from his book as well as all future income he otherwise would have received.' First-hand: No Easy Day, Bissonnette's first book, which was published under a pseudonym, claimed to set the record straight on the raid . It also figures lost income from Bissonnette's upcoming book, No Hero, along with forfeited movie rights and damage to his reputation. 'His reputation and his exemplary military record (have been) tarnished by the false accusation that he sought to profit from disclosure of classified or otherwise sensitive information,' the suit states. Luskin has argued that Bissonnette has shown he takes the government's complaints seriously because he voluntarily stopped promoting No Easy Day and set aside royalties in anticipation of a settlement. US officials have not yet confirmed a settlement. Bissonnette has faced his share of backlash from the SEAL community for the publication of No Easy Day, which he wrote under the pen name Mark Owen. According to Bissonnette, his former SEAL Team 6 commanding officer made a fake tombstone with his name on it after No Easy Day. Bissonnette later said that he texted this Navy captain that he never thought he was putting fellow soldiers at risk, and got back a text that read, 'Delete me.' 'They don’t call it SEAL Team 6-Year-Old for nothing,' Bissonnette said bitterly about that rejection.","Matt Bissonnette, a Navy SEAL who claims to have been on the bin Laden raid, sued attorney Kevin Podlaski .

Tragic end: MasterChef season 3 finalist Josh Marks, 27, was found dead in a Chicago alleyway from what it believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head . Downward spiral: Marks, who had previously spoken publicly about his struggle with mental health problems, was arrested in July after an altercation with a police officer . Officers reportedly found the gun used in the apparent suicide near Marks' body. Marks was arrested July 31 after a bizarre confrontation with University of Chicago police in which he told officers he'd been possessed by Gordon Ramsay - who turned him into God.  - wasn't the first time he's run afoul of the law. The 7 foot 2 cook had several run-ins with the law. Marks was also arrested in June on a trespassing charge. His transgressions have also cost him multiple sponsorships. The trespassing charge stemmed from his constant presence at a condominium complex where he was not a resident, according to TMZ.

Recipe for success: Josh Marks (left) with Ryan Umane at a FOX MasterChef Season 3 event last year . Discovered by the celebrity gossip site after delving into Illinois criminal records, Marks was first corralled by the fuzz for repeatedly sneaking into a Chicago condo complex. Marks allegedly gained entry by telling residents he lived in there, causing building management to circulate a warning to tenants warning them to be on the lookout for a 'very tall' African-American man who 'enters the building by catching the door,' and advising them to call 911, reported TMZ. The trespassing case still pending didn't stop Marks from getting into his latest scuffle, which may cost him 14 years in prison.

Officers reportedly tried to subdue Marks, but the baton and pepper spray they used on the tall foodie had no effect. Marks broke free from officers and began running, he was finally apprehended by five officers in a resident's backyard and taken to hospital for his injuries, according to reports. Marks was . booked on various charges including resisting arrest and assault. Marks . remains in hospital in Chicago where he's being restrained in a bed. It doesn't appear as though drugs were involved in Marks' strange outburst, according to TMZ. Marks, . a U.S. Army contract specialist, was the runner-up to Christine Ha in . the third season of the popular reality cooking show MasterChef last year where he was mentored by Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and Graham Elliot.

Hell's kitchen: It's not clear what the relationship between Ramsay and Marks has been after MasterChef, but Marks allegedly referred to the chef as an 'asshole' and claimed to be possessed by him . Since . the show, he's been involved with the Real Men charities in Chicago and . has spoken about plans to open his own culinary school. Marks was also an official spokesperson for the 'Make a Sound Project' and a celebrity judge for a New York-based culinary competition called 'Culinary Fight Night,' according to TMZ. Both have dropped him from their rosters, the site reported. 'We appreciate what Josh has done for us but we're in the market of helping people. So, we'll keep him in our prayers ... but as of now Chef Marks will be dropped as a spokesman,' a spokesperson for the charity told TMZ. A CFN spokesperson told TMZ that Marks was dismissed from his celebrity judging duties at the cooking competition for the safety of all involved, and also because 'we won't have this man tarnish the integrity of our brand.' Before appearing on the show, Marks told the blog Eat Jackson what he thought about Gordon Ramsay: . 'He has that intensity that I like… He doesn’t intimidate me; he motivates me harder… His personality is milder on [MasterChef] than on Hell’s Kitchen; but he can get intense.' Following the first of two eliminations on the show, Ramsay told Marks that he could call him any time and that he would help the young chef with his career.

"It is a sight which many older generations thought they would never see in this country again. Soldiers in residential tower blocks and green open spaces were yesterday pictured installing surface-to-air missiles at six sites across the capital, a show of strength not seen in this country since the Second World War. With two weeks to go before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games, it marks a dramatic development in the biggest peacetime security operation the country has ever seen. Security: Soldiers in residential tower blocks and green open spaces were yesterday pictured installing surface-to-air missiles at a number of sites across the capital. This image shows Rapier missile systems on Blackheath Common . Show of strength: With two weeks to go before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games, it marks a dramatic development as part of the security operation . Armed: Blackheath Common was chosen because of its strategic location to the Olympic site . Powerful: Rapier missiles are pictured being unpacked on Blackheath Common . Protection: An anti-aircraft rocket is pictured being put into place at the William Girling Reservoir . Yesterday, the military began installing Rapier and high-velocity missile systems at the six sites in Leytonstone, Bow, Blackheath Common and Oxleas Wood, both in South East London, Enfield and Epping Forest. The most controversial of these is at the residential block Fred Wigg Tower in Leytonstone, east London. Swarming like ants across the rooftop, members of the Royal Artillery were pictured setting up the weapons. Troops carried truckloads of equipment up the 17-storey block ready to assemble it to protect the Olympic Games from terrorist attack. The Starstreak high-velocity missile systems, whose laser-guided weapons have a range of 3.4 miles, are so powerful they can bring down an aircraft. Residents this week lost their bid to force a judicial review into the decision to deploy the air defences above their heads. Different times: Anti-aircraft guns similar to those being used to protect the Olympic Games are seen in action in England during World War Two . Deadly: This picture shows troops testing anti-aircraft guns in Hyde Park, London in 1939. Many older generations of people no doubt thought they would never see such weaponry in the capital again . Force: Soldiers are pictured preparing the missile site on the top of Lexington Building, Tower Hamlets. It is part of the biggest peacetime security operation the country has ever seen . Controversial: This picture shows the site on top of the Lexington Building, in Bow, London, from a distance. Residents have been left alarmed by the plans to store missiles on the six sites . The tenants fear the move could make them a terrorist target but security chiefs say there is 'no credible threat' and the siting of the missiles is 'proportionate'. Another Starstreak system was also placed at the Lexington Building, a gated community in Bow, East London. Cover is also being provided by Rapier towed missile systems, which have a range of 7.5 miles, at Blackheath Common and Oxleas Wood, both in South East London, a reservoir in Enfield and a farm in Epping Forest. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), security service and police maintain there is 'no credible threat' to the Games and say the siting of the missiles is both 'legitimate and proportionate'. The Defence Secretary has described . the ground-based air defence systems as 'just one part of a . comprehensive, multi-layered air security plan' which would provide . 'both reassurance and a powerful deterrent' during the Games. The . security plan includes a helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean, being moored in . the River Thames, with RAF Typhoon jets stationed ready at RAF Northolt . and Puma helicopters at a Territorial Army centre in Ilford. David Cameron will have the grim task of ordering the Armed Forces to . use the missile defence systems to shoot down a passenger airliner over Britain if a suicide attack is suspected of being underway. Preparation: Soldiers are pictured yesterday installing Rapier and high-velocity missile systems on the roof of Fred Wigg Tower in Leytonstone, east London . Deterrent: Once on top of the building, they began constructing the surface-to air missile system on the roof . Bizarre: A woman goes about her daily business close to the residential tower block as soldiers prepared the missile defence system . MI5 and MI6 have been put under ‘unprecedented pressure’ by the Olympics, leaving Britain vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The . annual report of Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee . warned that ‘risks’ have been taken with security to concentrate on . protecting the Games. Intelligence chiefs told the committee that spies have identified three potential sources of terrorist threat to the Games. Al Qaeda and its affiliates could launch a conventional terrorist attack which might target American or Israeli nationals. Irish . republican groups are judged to be capable of a smaller attack or a . hoax aimed at causing disruption rather than mass casualties. There . could also be clashes between rival groups or minorities present in . London during the Games who would not normally be considered a security . threat to the UK. The . report says: ‘We recognise that the Security Service has taken all . possible measures to make available the necessary resources during the . period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, but remain concerned at the . risk that is being taken in some areas and the vulnerability of the UK . at this critical period. ‘It is clear that coverage of terrorist groups is by no means comprehensive. The Prime Minister will be ultimately . responsible for a decision to fire missiles to blast a suicide jet, . possibly carrying terrified innocent civilians, out of the skies. Colonel Jon Campbell, commander of the Joint Ground Based Air Defence, has previously said: 'We have done as much as we can to allay people’s fears. 'The Rapier system has a world-class radar on it and is particularly good at picking up low and slow-moving objects in the sky. 'It means we’re able to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of London.' Air Vice Marshall Stuart Atha also . said previously: 'We want the focus to be on Usain Bolt this summer and . not us. We’re very proud to be part of this plan to deliver a safe and . secure Olympics.' A campaign . to stop the Ministry of Defence deploying surface to air missiles on . top of homes as part of Olympic security was taken to Parliament . yesterday. Labour's John Cryer tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons urging MPs to signal their opposition to the plans. The . Leyton and Wanstead MP said residents in his constituency feared the . result of deploying the weapons, which could be used to shoot down . aircraft threatening the London 2012 Olympics over east London. A . legal bid by the residents of the Fred Wigg tower, in Leytonstone, was . dropped after the High Court rejected the challenge yesterday. Mr . Cryer's motion said: 'This House recognises the need to provide . reasonable security for the Olympic Games but is concerned at the . unprecedented decision of the Ministry of Defence, in peacetime and . where no emergency has arisen, to station troops, armed police and . ground-based air defence missile systems on top of Fred Wigg Tower. '(It . is) a civilian residential block of flats, in Leyton, and without any . consultation with the residents affected and without bringing the matter . before Commons. '(This is) despite the fact that seven years have passed since this country was awarded the Olympic Games. 'It calls on the Ministry of Defence . to examine urgently the possibility of building a temporary tower for . the missile systems instead of siting such weapons and launch pads over . the heads of the ordinary men, women and children who have had no say in . the decision. Protected: The missiles are hoped to stave off the threat of a terror attack on venues such as the hockey arena .

'Or, . alternatively, to provide proper security to protect the residents . living in Fred Wigg Tower from potential terrorist attack and to provide . financial assistance to concerned and worried residents who wish to . move for the duration of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.' Early day motions are tabled by MPs seeking to gather support for an issue or cause. Other . MPs can sign them to signal support but they are not debated in the . Commons.

'If we speak about landscape images, I like the ones of Paris, Mallorca or the tulip fields in Holland.'

"Nothing for victims: The £3million left in Jimmy Savile's estate will be spent on lawyers . Almost two-thirds of the damages claims made for alleged sexual assaults by Jimmy Savile have so far been rejected. Lawyers representing NatWest Bank, the executors of Savile’s will, told the Appeal Court last week that out of 58 claims which have so far been considered under a controversial compensation scheme, 36 have been thrown out, and just 22 accepted. The scheme, set up by the bank, was approved in April by a High Court judge, and then advertised in newspapers. The hearing also confirmed that the whole of Savile’s estate is certain to be swallowed up in legal fees – leaving nothing for genuine victims. Last month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that police have launched a criminal inquiry into a claim from Savile’s great-niece, Caroline Robinson, who says he abused her when she was aged 12 and 15. Members of her family, including her daughter, have told police they believe her allegations are false. The court heard that of the £3 million left in Savile’s estate, just over £1 million is due to NatWest’s solicitors, Osborne Clarke. There are more than 150 claims that still have to be processed, and under the scheme’s terms, another £2 million will be due to the law firms that represent alleged victims. Osborne Clarke’s bills take precedence over all other claims on the estate. But victims deemed to be genuine cannot receive a penny until all compensation claims are complete – by which time the pot will be empty. Last week’s hearing was a bid by the Savile Trust, the charity to which Savile left almost all his money, to get the compensation scheme quashed and NatWest removed as executors. The three judges expressed astonishment at the way the scheme works, and at the low level of scrutiny for weeding out fraudulent claims. A small group of ‘consultants’ is being given only two-line summaries of each claim, containing few details. The judges also pressed NatWest’s lawyers to explain how the scheme’s ‘tariff’ of damages – which provides for payouts from £1,500 to £60,000, as well as the enormous associated legal fees – had been calculated. The judges said the bank had an ‘obligation’ to provide evidence of this, but NatWest failed to do so, saying only that the scheme had emerged after months of ‘negotiation’. It was clear the hearing itself will only add to the dizzying legal costs. Claims: Police have launched a criminal inquiry into a claim from Savile’s great-niece who says he abused her when she was aged 12 and 15. Members of her family have told police they believe her allegations are false . There were seven QCs in court, representing the Trust, NatWest, the BBC, NHS, Barnardo’s and some of the alleged victims, as well as numerous solicitors and junior barristers. Lady Justice Gloster, one of three judges hearing the application, commented: ‘There are so many lawyers at this party, I cringe.’ The Savile Trust had tried to ensure that there would only be its own lawyers and those representing the bank in attendance, but the bank rejected this, describing the suggestion as ‘preposterous’. NatWest and Osborne Clarke have refused to comment. Judgment was reserved.","58 damages claims have been considered under scheme for alleged victims .

"Tragic: This screen grab shows the split second before the nine-year-old girl shoots Charles Vacca in the head. In the frame, the girl can clearly be seen to have lost her double handed grip on the Uzi as it recoils after firing. Her left hand is prized free as bullets fire (seen hitting behind the target circled in red). The gun is in her right hand and is clearly moving towards Vacca . These images show the seconds before a nine-year girl accidentally shot her gun instructor dead on Monday. Recorded at the Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, the edited 22-second clip plays up to the point where the girl loses control of an Uzi, striking 39-year-old Charles Vacca. The shocking recording taken by the girl's parents and released by police shows Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode. As the clip unfolds, Vacca is seen to instruct the girl to hold the weapon with two hands at all times and to take a perpendicular stance to the target. Then Vacca asks her to fire one shot for him, which she does. Then, Vacca tells the girl to adjust her stance and squeeze the trigger to let off a volley, but something goes wrong when she fires a second time. His last words to the girl are: 'Alright, full auto.' The girl loses her two-handed grip on the weapon and it pulls to her left, striking Vacca in the head. Charles . Vacca, a father and veteran from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, was . airlifted to hospital on Monday morning after the little girl shot him but died that evening. Mohave County Sheriff Jim McCabe said the full video of the incident was 'ghastly'.

First shot then pause: The nine-year-old fires . one shot as instructed and then prepares to fire again (right) before . the tragedy unfolded . He said that the girl had successfully fired the weapon several times before when it was set on 'single shot' mode. However, the horrific accident unfolded in a split second when the Israeli made weapon was set to 'full-automatic mode' and caused Vacca his fatal injuries. 'The guy just dropped,' McCabe said of Vacca, who suffered more than one gunshot to the head. McCabe told the Las Vegas Review Journal that no charges will be filed because Bullets and Burgers is licensed and legal as an operation. Killed: Charles Vacca, pictured right, was . accidentally shot in the head on Monday as he helped a nine-year-old . girl handle a submachine gun at an Arizona shooting range. He passed . away on Monday night . 'It's so easy for us to go back and look at something that's very tragic and say, 'Boy! Why did that occur? That should not have happened because of,'' said McCabe to Fox News. 'Well, maybe from now on, that 'because of' will be in place.' A spokeswoman with Mohave County Sheriff’s Office said they were shocked by the shooting. 'This is a rarity for something like this to happen,' the spokeswoman said to the LA Times. Vacca was . airlifted to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he . died of his injuries around 9pm on Monday. An autopsy will now be . carried out. The . nine-year-old girl, who has not been identified, was not injured. She . was with her parents as they passed through the area on vacation from New Jersey. The range operator at Bullets and Burgers told KLAS-TV he was shocked by the incident. Veteran: Vacca, a staff sergeant, is pictured right with his best friend Robert Vera when they served . 'We really don't know what happened. Our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they're shooting. If they're shooting right-handed, we have our right-hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way. And if they're left-handed, the same thing,' operator Sam Scarmardo said. Social media was incredulous about the tragic accident, with most people posting comments as to why a nine-year-old was allowed to fire an automatic weapon. Liz Matthews of the John Clayton Show on 710 ESPN in Seattle said, 'A story involving a nine-year-old shooting an UZI at a place called Burgers and Bullets would have been appalling enough. Horrifying.' Nikki Bateman simply asked, 'why you'd even let a nine year old handle a gun in the first place?!' Cameron Atfield directed his anger at the parents stating he 'hoped the parents are charged.' Friends . paid tribute to Vacca, an army veteran and a married father, as a great . friend and soldier on Facebook. Best friend Robert Vera said they often . laughed so much that they couldn't breathe. 'He became a brother and a major part of my life through thick and thin,' Vera said. 'Rest In Peace brother.' Loss: Friends paid tribute to Vacca as a great friend, soldier and father who was always smiling . Another friend added: 'A Soldier, a father, a mentor and a friend. SSG Charles Vacca will always be remembered with a smile and admiration.' The . incident occurred at the Arizona Last Stop, which is about 25 miles . south of Las Vegas, the Mohave County Sheriff's Office told AZFamily. It is home to a shooting range, Bullets and Burgers. 'Our . guests have the opportunity to fire a wide range of fully automatic . machine guns and specialty weapons,' its website states. 'At our range, . you can shoot FULL auto on our machine guns. Let 'em Rip!' When . contacted by MailOnline, staff at Bullets and Burgers would not comment . on the incident and referred questions to a nearby gun emporium, but . would not say whether or not they were affiliated.

"Two Ohio high-school football players . accused of raping a teenage girl may not get a fair trial after a photo . and video allegedly associated with the case were posted on the . Internet by the computer hacking group Anonymous, a lawyer for one of . the accused said on Friday. Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays, . both 16 and members of the Steubenville High School football team, are . charged with raping a 16-year-old fellow student last August, according . to statements from their attorneys to local and national media. Their juvenile court trial is scheduled for February in Steubenville, a city of 19,000 about 40 miles west of Pittsburgh. Scroll down to watch video extract . Taking action: The so-called 'hacktivist' group Anonymous made a video announcing their plan to 'out' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident . The case shot to national prominence . this week when Anonymous activists made public a picture allegedly of . the rape victim, being carried by her wrists and ankles by two young . men, and of a video that showed several other young men joking about an . alleged assault. Horrific: Attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move . Richmond's lawyer, Walter Madison, . said on CNN that his client was one of the young men in the photograph, . but does not appear in the video. But the picture 'is out of context,' Madison said. 'That young lady is not unconscious,' as has been widely reported. 'A right to a fair trial for these . young men has been hijacked,' Madison said, adding that social media . episodes such as this have become a major threat to a criminal . defendant's right to a fair trial. 'It's very, very serious and fairness is essential to getting the right decision here,' he said. Mays' attorney Adam Nemann could not . immediately be reached for comment on Friday. In an interview on . Thursday with Columbus, Ohio, broadcaster WBNS-10TV, Nemann raised . concerns about the effect the Anonymous postings could have on potential . witnesses in the case. 'This media has become so . astronomically ingrained on the Internet and within that society, I am . concerned witnesses might not want to come forward at this point. I . would be surprised now, if there weren't witnesses now who might want to . start taking the Fifth Amendment,' Nemann told the station. Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house . Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence . The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution offers protection against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings. The case has also been a challenge . for local officials because of conflicts of interest. Both the local . prosecutor and police have close ties to the school that the defendants . attend. As a result, the case is being investigated and prosecuted by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office. Interviewed on CNN on Friday, DeWine . said it was not unusual for his office to prosecute or investigate cases . in small towns where close ties within the community caused conflicts . of interest to arise. Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television . Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team . He also voiced concern about how social media may affect the case. 'This case needs to be tried not in the media, not in social media,' DeWine said. He said Anonymous' attempt to shame the alleged attackers had actually harmed the victim. Not only is the victim hurt by the . initial crime, but 'every time something goes up on the Internet, the . victim is victimized again,' DeWine said.","Group of teens seen laughing as one describes girl who was raped and urinated on .

"About the last thing Judith Tebbutt remembered was her husband David turning off the lights and getting into bed. Then, she eventually told detectives, they held hands as they drifted off to sleep. Three hours later her nightmare began. A brutal gang burst into the hut where the Tebbutts were staying at the remote but luxurious Kiwayu Safari Village in Kenya on September 11, 2011. They shot David dead and took Judith hostage. After beating her with a rifle butt, they dragged her to the beach and took her by boat to Somalia, where she was held in primitive conditions for more than six months. A seasoned team from Scotland Yard’s Counter-Terrorism Command reached Kiwayu two days after her abduction. The evidence given by its leader, Detective Superintendent Neil Hibberd, would later prove crucial in the trial of the only man charged in connection with Judith’s kidnap – Ali Kololo, an illiterate Kenyan woodcutter and gatherer of wild forest honey. Ordeal: Judith and husband David in Kenya just days before the gang struck . Trial: Ali Kololo in court . Convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, he is now on death row in a tough jail in Mombasa. After the 16-month trial ended last year, the British Government treated this as a triumph. ‘Welcome conviction… today of Mr Kololo for his role in Tebbutt kidnap and murder,’ tweeted Neil Wigan, the British Ambassador to Somalia. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that if Kenya hangs Kololo, it is likely to be executing an innocent man. We can disclose that: . The conviction is deemed so unsafe it faces a High Court challenge in London, led by Lord Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions. The transcript of Kololo’s trial and key statements taken by Scotland  Yard detectives have been obtained by this newspaper. The documents show the main reason for Kololo’s arrest was a decision by Kenyan police  to quiz anyone seen in the vicinity of the Kiwayu Safari Village. ‘We told hotel workers to arrest anybody seen around the premises and report to police,’ Simon Mutiso, from Kenya’s Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, told the court. Kololo finally does have a local lawyer, Alfred Olaba, who will be fighting his appeal in Kenya. He said yesterday: ‘There were no clues that led  particularly to him. They just took him into custody and then tried to make the evidence fit.’ Of course, by the time the manhunt started, the kidnappers and Mrs Tebbutt were in nearby Somalia.At his trial, Kololo insisted that he himself had been a victim of crime: deep in the forest, ivory poachers had stolen his shoes and his tools – a power saw and a machete called a panga. Escaping their clutches, he came across a police vehicle near Kiwayu. He approached it to report the theft  and promptly became a suspect – mainly, it seems, because he said he thought the poachers were Somalis. Crime scene: The 'banda' where David Tebbutt was killed . Kololo and his family are desperately poor. They live in the village of Roka, a few miles from Kiwayu. Kololo’s wife divorced him after the trial so his two sons, aged five and seven, live in a one-room mud-hut with  Kololo’s father, Babitu, who is in his 80s and blind. Babitu said that without his son, the family has almost no income: ‘We depend on help from anyone who comes to visit us.’ Babitu’s elderly wife weaves mats, but could make less than £1 each from selling them. Babitu is sure his son is innocent: ‘I cry thinking of him and the pain and hardship he is suffering. All we can do is pray. But we are happy that good people have come to be his lawyers.’ In his trial testimony, Kololo claimed he was tortured. As well as beating him, he said police ‘pulled my private parts’ which had made him incontinent. Police denied this, but when he was first due in court in Lamu, two hearings had to be adjourned because he needed hospital treatment. Kololo said at his trial: ‘They wanted me to admit I had witnessed the killing of the white man and kidnapping of the white woman.’ He did not confess. Enter the Yard's finest . Neil Hibberd arrived in Kiwayu two days after Kololo’s arrest, accompanied by six detectives. They were later joined by a ballistics expert, a crime scene manager, a photographer, a blood spatter analyst, and a fingerprint specialist. By now, their Kenyan colleagues were suggesting that Kololo’s role had been to guide the gang to the ‘banda’, the hut where the Tebbutts were  staying. Surprisingly, perhaps, the Yard team did not interview Kololo, though if the Kenyan theory was true, he presumably must have had vital clues to the gang’s whereabouts and identity. In any event, the Yard’s 21st Century expertise was to have little impact: there was no forensic evidence linking Kololo to the crime. But although he failed to come up with any evidence, Mr Hibberd’s stature as a senior Yard officer meant his opinions carried huge weight. Before the trial started, he set down a formal, written statement, which was later read out in court. Its influence was enormous: when Judge J.M. Munguti delivered his final judgment, he closely echoed both the reasoning and the  language of Mr Hibberd’s account. In Mr Hibberd’s view, the critical piece of evidence was a pair of ‘Tanga shoes,’ a type of plastic sandal. According to Mr Hibberd, distinctive Tanga footprints were found leading from the beach where the gang landed their boat to the bandas. ‘These appear to be the shoeprints of someone searching the bandas for potential victims,’ he said. He added in his statement: ‘Kololo was arrested wearing Tanga shoes. It is extremely unusual to find these at the resort. None of the staff are allowed to wear these shoes. All of the suspects in the boat [with Mrs Tebbutt] were barefooted.’ Mr Hibberd went on: ‘Tanga shoes are predominantly worn by Somalians and are not allowed to be worn at Kiwayu Safari Village. To have a set of Tanga footprints at the resort is highly unusual and significant.’ He repeated these claims in court. An unfair trial? Hostage: Judith Tebbutt the day she was freed in Somalia . Apart from the lack of forensic evidence, the prosecution faced a further difficulty. Interviewed by police after her release, Mrs Tebbutt, of Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, was clear the gang had turned the lights on when they burst in. But when detectives showed her photos of Kololo, she said: ‘Prior to seeing these images, I had never seen this man before. He was not one of the men who took me out of the banda, who were present on the boat or held me during my time in captivity.’ It was possible there had been someone else present grappling with her husband, but if so, she had not seen him. There is no legal aid in Kenya other than for defendants charged with murder, and Kololo was ‘only’ charged with robbery with violence and kidnapping. A lawyer arrived to represent him at one hearing, but did not bother to speak to him. For the whole of the prosecution case, dragged out over months, Kololo had no lawyer. Moreover, he is not fluent in Swahili, the language in which the trial was conducted. He asked repeatedly for an interpreter to translate into his mother tongue, Boni – but was refused. Mr Olaba said: ‘A totally uneducated man, he was forced to cross-examine witnesses speaking in a language he did not fully understand. To make matters worse, Mr Hibberd and Mrs Tebbutt gave evidence in English, which he doesn’t know.’ Their evidence was translated into Swahili. So what of the Tanga shoes? They were produced in court as an exhibit, but none of those who first came into contact with Kololo when he emerged from the forest mentioned them. And as for Mr Hibberd’s claim that they were worn mainly by Somalis, several witnesses said they were common in Kenya. Mr Hibberd admitted they did not bear Kololo’s fingerprints. If they were tested for his DNA, this was never mentioned. Nor were there any photos of the footprints. Astonishingly, Corporal Geoffrey Loldoss, the Kenyan officer who arrested Kololo, told the court that the defendant ‘was not wearing  any shoes’. Almost at the end of the trial, Mr Olaba agreed to represent the defendant for free. Aware that the shoes were too small, he asked Kololo to try them on. Mr Olaba said yesterday: ‘He couldn’t get into them at all, much less walk.’ It was all to no avail. On July 27 last year, the judge convicted Kololo and decreed he ‘suffer death, as  provided by law’. Death Row, Mombasa . Scotland Yard and the Foreign Office have agreed to respond to the pending High Court action by June 4. The action, brought by the human rights charity Reprieve, asks the court to issue a statement saying the involvement of UK authorities was unlawful because Kololo’s trial was an abuse of natural justice, and – because he faced a death sentence – a breach of guidelines that say British police may offer only ‘limited assistance’ when a suspect faces such punishment. Scotland Yard refused to comment on the case. The Foreign Office said the Met’s help followed ‘assurances from the Kenyan authorities that UK assistance would not directly or significantly contribute to a violation of human rights and/or international humanitarian law’. But Reprieve’s Maya Foa said: ‘I fail to see what assurances they can have been given when he was facing what amounted to a mandatory death sentence, and a farce of a trial.’ Meanwhile, Kololo languishes on death row at the notorious Shimo la Tewa maximum security prison in Mombasa. One source said: ‘Shimo la Tewa is one of the worst places in Kenya. Just its name instills fear when prisoners are told they are to be moved there.’ Kenya has not carried out an execution since 1987, but Mr Olaba pointed out this policy could change with the government or shifting political whims. The Mail on Sunday approached Mrs Tebbutt via publishers Faber and Faber, where her husband was finance director and which published her account of her ordeal, A Long Walk Home. A spokesman said she could not make any comment. Mr Olaba said: ‘A favourable judgment from the court in London would help Kololo enormously. It could tip the balance. Ultimately, it could save his life.’","Judith Tebbutt was kidnapped by a gang while on holiday in Kenya in 2011 .
Her husband, David, was shot dead and Judith taken hostage for six months .
Ali Kololo, a Kenyan woodcutter, is the only man charged over the crime .
Kololo is currently on death row in a tough jail in Mombasa .
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that he is very likely to be innocent .
Judith said she didn't recognise him as being present during her ordeal .
Astonishingly, Mrs Tebbutt said that until she was shown photos of Kololo after his arrest, she had never seen him before. She told police she didn’t recognise him being present either when her husband was shot or when she was in captivity.
Kololo was said to be wearing shoes that matched footprints at the crime scene when he was arrested. But the arresting officer told the court that Kololo was not wearing shoes at all – and he couldn’t fit into those that  supposedly matched the prints as they were two sizes too small.
The trial was held in a language in which he was not fluent, and for almost all of it he had no defence  lawyer. He had to cross-examine  witnesses including Mrs Tebbutt and Mr  Hibberd on his own."
"A hiker who was stranded in the . Canadian wilderness for nearly three months after a bear destroyed his . supplies was forced to eat his beloved dog. Marco . Lavoie escaped with his life when his German Shepherd chased away the . wild animal that attacked their camp - destroying their canoe and food . supplies - just days into a planned three-month climbing trip. But . three days later, in a real-life display of survival-of-the-fittest, . the 44-year-old killed his heroic Alsatian with a rock and ate it in a . desperate bid to survive. With . no way to call for help, the stranded explorer then spent a further . three months alone and starving before a search party came to the . rescue. Desperate measures: Experienced hiker Lavoie is said to have eaten his pet dog to survive . Incredibly, survival experts have praised Mr Lavoie's actions as a good use of 'reason', which may have saved his life. By the time Mr Lavoie was airlifted out . of the Nottaway River wilderness, about 800km from Montreal, he had lost . half his body weight, was suffering from hypothermia and was unable to . speak. However, Andre Francois Bourbeau, claims it is unlikely he would have been alive at all without sacrificing his dearest companion. 'He . survived because he made ‹good decisions. Eating his dog was one of . them,' Mr Bourbeau said. 'You have to be desperate, but there's no shame . in [eating the dog]. He had to use reason.' Another . expert, Caleb Musgrave, a survival instructor, said the act was a . natural instinct of the human body provoked by extreme hunger: 'When you start to go hungry, you get . mood swings, your mind breaks, and you cramp up all over your body. Eventually, your body will start cannibalizing itself.' Found: Matagami lake, where Marco Lavoie was discovered after his solo trip turned into a disaster . He added: 'Up there, in the Canadian shield, . there's little plant life to live off, so he would have been slowly, . painfully dying when they found him. 'It's an amazing feat that he was . able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment.' Mr . Lavoie's family only reported him missing in the past few weeks after . he failed to return from the planned solo trip to Lake Matagame. Eight . days into the search, Mr Lavoie was spotted by a helicopter crew, but . they were unable to land close by so rescue workers had to carry the . malnourished hiker about a mile to the aircraft. Raided: A black bear in a national forest destroyed food supplies and a canoe before the dog chased it away . Several survival experts agreed that . conditions in the Nottaway River wilderness were tough and, with . temperatures dropping below freezing, the ordeal would have been enough . to mentally break even the most experienced hiker. Andre Diamond, a Waswanipi Cree who lives on an island at the mouth of the river, told the Toronto Sun he had warned Mr Lavoie to stay away. 'He . said it didn't scare him, but it's not a river to travel alone,' Mr . Diamond said. 'Other adventurers have gone there over 20, 30 years and . never came back.' Mr Lavoie is currently in serious condition in hospital.","Marco Lavoie, 44, was close to death when a rescue crew found him .

"A furious Jet Blue passenger claims she was kicked off her flight from Philadelphia to Boston on Tuesday night because she live-tweeted accusations the pilot might have been drunk. Lisa Carter Knight says flight staff and the pilot prevented her from re-boarding the plane after she posted pictures to Twitter and commented that the pilot was undergoing a sobriety test following a passenger's ill-judged joke. The marketing executive, who was traveling to visit her sick mother, claims that even after the pilot passed the test the JetBlue flight staff refused to allow her back on the plane and is outraged posting her personal opinion online cost her the chance to fly. Scroll Down for Video . Fury: Lisa Carter Knight claims that JetBlue staff refused to allow her back onto her Boston bound flight from Philadelphia because she live-tweeted the pilot undergoing a sobriety test . 'JetBlue has denied me service at all on any flight back to Boston because a pilot made a decision that my social media interaction with my friends and family was not appropriate and was not going to be tolerated by him,' wrote Knight. 'So, I was thrown off the flight tonight.' Knight, who was planning to travel to New Hampshire to visit her cancer-survivor mother told MyFoxPhilly that the flight was originally delayed at 9pm. Pictures and tweet: Knight uploaded this tweet explaining to her followers that the pilot was being tested for drinking on Tuesday evening . Follow up: The flight was supposed to leave Philadelphia for Boston around 9pm on Tuesday but was delayed for nearly four hours while the pilot underwent his sobriety test . Knight, who works for DrinkWater Productions, says that annoyed passengers were crowding the jetway when someone waiting joked that they hoped the bar was fully stocked. Just moments later, according to Knight, the pilot appeared on the jetway from the plane and said that he had been accused of drinking and now wanted everyone to go back to the gate while he underwent a sobriety test. According to MyFoxPhilly, another passenger had sparked the test when he joked with the pilot about his late arrival, saying, 'This flight's late, were you at the bar?' It was while the pilot was being tested that Knight began live-tweeting as she and other passenger's waited. Live-tweeting: Knight's follow up postings make it clear that she was not abusive and end with her being denied access to the plane which departed around 1am on Wednesday morning . However, Knight claims that when the pilot was given the all-clear she was not allowed back onto the plane. JetBlue denied that Knight was denied her seat on the plane because of her tweeting and said that their policy extends only to disruptive passengers. However, the airline did not specify what disruptive behavior Knight is supposed to have acted out before she was due to board. 'It is not our practice to remove a customer for expressing criticism of their experience in any medium. We will remove a customer if they are disruptive and the crew evaluates that there is a risk of escalation which could lead to an unsafe environment,' said a spokesman from JetBlue. 'The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. 'If we feel a customer is not complying with safety instructions, exhibits objectionable behavior or causes conflict at the gate or on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane or will be denied boarding especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of accelerating in the air. 'In this instance, the customer received a refund and chose to fly on another carrier.' Furious at being left behind by the flight staff, Knight got in contact with local media in the early hours of Wednesday to express her anger. Waiting: Knight contacted local news and told them that she was still waiting in Philadelphia airport to leave to see her sick mother on Wednesday morning . 'I was just doing what I normally do with my kids, sharing information with my friends that I was frustrated that I was sitting there without a flight home and I miss my children,' said Knight to Eyewitness News. 'Now I’m here at one o’clock in the morning with my mother, who had surgery this weekend, to pick me up because a JetBlue pilot made a decision to kick me off his flight.'

"As one of the most powerful brands in the world and a byword for cool, Apple has become known for its minimalist billboards and ads. But it wasn’t always the case: in the 70s and 80s Apple was a plucky upstart to Microsoft’s dominance, and had to use the power of advertising to get noticed. From the pre-iconic logo Apple-1 computer built by Steve Jobs in his parents’ basement in 1976 to the first colourful iMac in 1998, their adverts have evolved in line with the machinery. Scroll down for video . Apple's first ad: In July 1976, Apple promised 'A balance of features' for the Apple-1 computer, which boasted 4k of RAM and a cassette interface . The company’s early forays into advertising appear to be less than eye-catching - a dreary sepia advert consisting largely of text proclaims the $666.66 Apple-1 has a 'balance of features'. The thinking has changed by the time the Apple II comes along a year later - for which the company chose a simple shot of a housewife tending the kitchen, looking dotingly on her husband who sits working on the computer at the kitchen table. The Apple II ad is a more minimalist attempt, just showing the machine being used with its name . This is followed by the first advert including the now iconic logo against a backdrop of a red apple and a computer. It reads: 'A is for Apple: It’s the first thing you know about personal computers.' Later adverts for the Apple II show signs of Apple’s simple ethos and design philosophy. One featuring an apple against a white backdrop reads: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Introducing the Apple II personal computer.' Later ads for the Apple II show the firm's iconic logo being used for the first time . The multicoloured logo first used by Apple was the star of this ad . The Apple II was designed to look like a home computer rather than a piece of electronic hardware, and this was reflected in some of its adverts. Another inventive and cheeky campaign featured a naked man standing infront of a forest - mirroring Adam in the Garden of Eden - whose blushes are spared by the judicious positioning of a computer. The tag line reads: 'We’re looking for the most original use of an Apple since Adam'. The competition invited people to send in their stories of how they used their Apple computer. The firm ran a contest to find out what its users were doing with their Apple II via this advert in 1980 . Apple also produced its own guide to choosing a computer to help consumers, many of whom where still confused about what the machines could do, make up their mind . It was Apple’s adverts in the 1980s that first forged its link with the student market. On directly targeting students featured an image of youngsters using their computers in a classroom, pronouncing it the 'educational computer'. Others highlighted its appeal to creative types, in contrast to the more business-like approach of its competitors. It used a series of adverts featuring Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Thomas Jefferson, sending the message that buying an Apple would equip the user with similar powers of intellect. One, showing Jefferson superimposed next to an Apple, reads: 'Jefferson had one of the best minds of 1776, but today you can make better decisions with an Apple.' The firm created a series of adverts featuring Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Thomas Jefferson, sending the message that buying an Apple would equip the user with similar powers of intellect . Even in its early days, Apple ads focused on simplicity, showing just the product and a catchline . A later advert emphasises the individuality of Apple users. Against a picture of a hand pulling a computer screen from a bag it says: 'Of the 235 million people in America, only a fraction can use a computer.' In the 1990s, Apple began to branch out and advertise some of its other products including its laptops, software packages and its Newton handheld. An unusual, text heavy ad from Apple explaining exactly what its machines can do . In the 1990s Apple began advertising a wider range of products, including the ill-fated Newton handheld machine which was a precursor to today's iPad . Apple also began advertising its portable machines, which were based on the iMac's translucent design . After the original Apple and the Apple Macintonsh came the brightly coloured iMac, with its stripped down advertising. One advert next to the computer says: 'Chic. Not geek.' Another at a similar time, pulled in a celebrity endorsement of Muhammad Ali and its now well-known slogan 'think different'. A later minimalist advert of a laptop against a white background carried the tag: 'Black tie optional'. An early all in one machine from Apple showed off how BMW designers used the machine . Apple's 'sunflower' iMac design, which targeted PC owners with its comments on their bland design at the time .","Adverts show Apple's products from the Apple-1 in 1976 to the 1998 release of the iMac .

"The Pentagon's top spokesman warned on Wednesday that long-term 'generational' conflicts in the Middle East will require the United States to have a military presence there 'for many, many, many years.' And despite a $500 million commitment from Congress to 'train and equip' moderate Syrian rebels against the ISIS terror army, the Defense Department is mired in planning, still as many as five months away from arming anyone. Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Defense Department's press secretary, made the statements during a press briefing about America's efforts to combat the ISIS terror army in Iraq and Syria. 'Nobody's under any illusion that we're not going to have to maintain our focus, energy and resources in the Middle East for many, many, many years to come,' he said. Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said Wednesday that the US will be in the Middle East 'for many, many, many years to come' Bombs, not boots: Pinprick airstrikes coordinated by the US have taken out strategic targets but failed to slow the advance of the ISIS terror army . 'We've learned that this is a generational issue,' Kirby added, speaking of the sectarian war pitting Muslim sects against each other. 'None of these problems are going to be solved overnight, or quickly.' The admission that a long-term U.S. military commitment is in the offing will likely embolden war hawks in Congress and anger political allies of President Barack Obama, who is struggling to maintain his dovish image going into the November midterm elections. Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, shortly after taking office. He has been insistent that American 'boots on the ground' won't return to Iraq, a war-torn country that had a significant U.S. military presence until Obama withdrew all troops at the end of 2011. Kirby reiterated Wednesday that 'there will not be a return of U.S. ground forces in a combat role in this fight, in Iraq or Syria. That has been made very clear.' The emphasis, he said, is on 'trying to get a moderate opposition trained and equipped.' Most estimates put the fighting numbers of ISIS, the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, at 31,000. At best, defense experts project that the U.S. can train 5,000 opposition soldiers. And as ISIS comes dangerously close to seizing the key Syrian town of Kobane near the Turkish border, Kirby conceded that that effort won't start until months of planning are completed. 'There's been no vetting started yet and no recruiting at this point,' he said, referring to the Syrian rebels whom the U.S. hopes to arm. 'We are in the very early stages right now of trying to develop the procedures and protocols within which we would do that.' Kirby also said the U.S. has no plan to launch a humanitarian relief effort in or near Kobane. 'We should all be steeling ourselves for reality,' he said, suggesting that Kobane and other towns will fall to ISIS. Kirby noted that the U.S. is working closely with Saudi Arabia, which has agreed to host a training facility. That relationship, as Kirby described it, is still mired in bureaucracy and drawing-board efforts, and will consume 'three to five months before we can even get through that process.' Fighting the clock slowly: As America spends 'three to five months' planning a way to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces, ISIS scoops up cities like Kobane in northern Syria, just a mile from Turkey . 'That's before you even start doing any of the training. So this is going to be a long-term effort.' American leaders are 'sizing up the facility, getting a look at the infrastructure, and sort of figuring out the architecture within which the training would actually occur,' Kirby said. The U.S. hopes – eventually, he said – to set up 'a viable, sustainable, verifiable program to properly recruit and vet these opposition members.' That effort, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said a few hours later,'is a key component for our strategy and will be critical to our success.' Training Syrian rebels, he told reporters during his daily briefing, 'will have a pretty dramatic impact on the conditions on the battlefield.' But at present, he admitted, 'our capabilities are still powerful, but they're limited.'","Defense Department spokesman said effort to arm Syrian rebel groups against ISIS hasn't even begun and is in the planning stages .

"When singer Tulisa Contostavlos rose from the sea like Ursula Andress in the Judges’ Houses section of X Factor, she showed off a super-toned body in a tiny bikini. The secret behind her trim new figure? It’s all down to yoga. While she was going through the stress of a public court battle after a newspaper sting and establishing herself as a solo artist, Tulisa started training with London-based fitness instructor Peter Mac. Scroll down for video . Licensed to stretch: Tulisa in the 007-style pose on the Judges' Houses section of The X Factor . And nine months’ worth of downward dogs and chaturangas have clearly paid off. A typical session with Peter involves meditation to channel the reasons for working out, before moving on to a series of stretches. She’s also been working on her flexibility, using weighted bands around her ankles to increase the intensity. A friend of the singer explains: ‘Tulisa’s really changed since starting yoga. Her figure’s incredible and she’s lost a lot of weight. Mentally, it’s given her a focus.

Children who skip breakfast 'more likely to be obese' Breakfast has long been labelled the most important meal of the day by nutritional experts. Now research published in the European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition from eight European countries has revealed that skipping breakfast can be detrimental to the health of children. Those who don’t eat breakfast at home have an increased chance of cardiovascular disease risk factors, according to the study involving more than 8,500 children between two and nine. The study found that children who do not eat breakfast at home had a higher risk of being obese and of having abnormal cholesterol levels. New research has revealed children who skip breakfast have an increased risk of being obese and of having abnormal cholesterol levels . Children who breakfasted at home less frequently also engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity when compared with children eating a daily breakfast. The UK is lagging behind Europe in treating heart valve disease, according to a report from the charity Heart Valve Voice. The charity has highlighted under-diagnosis and treatment gaps across the country for patients with the potentially fatal condition, which affects more than a million people over 65 in the UK. The report reveals that 59 per cent of people over the age of 60 do not have their heart checked with a stethoscope – the simplest way to identify heart valve disease. Fifty-four per cent of patients in some parts of the UK are not referred to a cardiac surgeon despite their diagnosis being confirmed, and many of those who are referred have already developed damage to the heart which can reduce the benefits of surgery. Thirty per cent of sufferers are left untreated despite options being available. Need a reminder to calm down occasionally? A wearable stress sensor, the size of a small computer mouse and resembling a pebble, keeps tabs on your heart rate and breathing patterns, and sends you a message, via an app, with tips on how to calm down if it detects your stress levels rising.

"A massive study of the Pacific Ocean floor shows it’s a huge underwater garbage dump. On over 18,000 hours of footage from deep sea remotely operated vehicles, researchers at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) looked at seafloor as deep as 13,000 feet and found manmade trash items in every place they looked. Deep sea vehicles viewed dive sites all along the West Coast from the Gulf of California to Vancouver Island and all around the Hawaiian Islands, with the worst accumulation of plastic, metal, fishing debris, and other trash in Monterey Canyon off the California coast. Scroll down for video . Widespread: A trash bag is wrapped around a gorgonian coral at 7,000 feet off the coast of Oregon . For more information, please go to MBARI . Researchers found that Monterey Canyon, where MBARI . conducts 200 research dives per year, had more trash than anywhere else. In the deep sea ravine off the coast of California alone, . the researchers noted over 1,150 pieces of debris on the seafloor. Everywhere: A rockfish in a shoe. The study took place over the course of 22 years and found trash everywhere they looked on the sea floor along the West Coast and around the Hawaiian Islands . Mapped: Everywhere the along the West Coast and Hawaiian Islands the seafloor is littered with plastic, metal, and various other man-made trash . Abysmal: The researchers were surprised to find that the deeper they went, the more trash they found. Even as deep down as 13,000 feet . Researchers did not find random spatterings of trash all . across the Pacific seafloor. Instead, they discovered that debris accumulates . in deep sea slopes and rocky areas. There was more garbage found in deeper areas than in more . shallower spots. Trash canyon: A tire rests 2,850 feet down in Monterey Canyon, the most trash-filled spot the study found . Not so refreshing: A Coke bottle keeps company with tiny starfish . Slimy deep: Researchers found more trash the deeper they dove, especially in rocky, sloping areas . ‘I was surprised that we saw so much trash in deeper water. We don't usually think of our daily activities as affecting life two miles deep . in the ocean.’ Said lead author of the study Kyra Schlining. ‘I'm sure that . there's a lot more debris in the canyon that we're not seeing. A lot of it gets . buried by underwater landslides and sediment movement. Some of it may also be . carried into deeper water, farther down the canyon.’ Most of the debris, about a third of it, is plastic. Because . there is no sunlight on the sea floor, these petroleum-based objects can take . hundreds of years to degrade. And as they do, they often turn brittle and break into tiny . pieces. As this happens, it becomes more likely that tiny sea floor creatures . will consume the toxic substances. This can harm the animal and introduce foreign substances . into the food chain. Mystery drum: A ghostly crab crawls along a 55-gallon drum cast to the bottom of the Monterrey Canyon off the coast of California. More trash was found in this deep sea ravine than anywhere else . Deep sea fishing: Fishing gear was also a common. Plastic was the most common type of object found . Paper or plastic: Metal was the second most common item type found. Of the plastic items, about half were plastic grocery bags . Of the plastic items, about half were plastic grocery bags. These increasingly controversial items can choke and smother animals. Los Angeles became the biggest city in the country to ban . free plastic bags in grocery stores following a city council vote this past Tuesday. About $2 million a year is spent to clean up plastic bag . litter in Los Angeles. Sanitation authorities estimate more than 228,000 bags . are distributed in the city every hour. But clearly many of the bags are ending up deep down on the . sea floor. Metal objects were the second most common. Of them, about . two thirds were aluminum, steel, or tin cans. Discarded fishing equipment was also commonly observed. As . were glass bottles, papers, and cloth. Big: A huge shipping container containing a thousand tires was found. Researchers believe such large items could seriously disrupt deep sea ecosystems . Batteries included: In addition to choking and suffocating creatures, some trash can contaminate the deep sea with caustic chemicals . MBARI researchers hope to do additional research to . understand the long-term biological impacts of trash in the deep sea. Working . with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, they are currently finishing . up a detailed study of the effects of a particularly large piece of marine . debris—a shipping container that fell off a ship in 2004. Inside the container are over 1,000 steel-belted tires. Researchers believe such a large item, to which many . organisms have attached despite being in a habitat devoid of solid objects, can . seriously disrupt a deep sea ecosystem. Have a seat: A plastic chair sits ominously on the sea floor . Small but dangerous: Plastic items can break down into small bits and then be eaten by tiny sea creatures . Slow A cast off bag of potato chips. Plastic and metal, in the absence of llight, heat, and bacteria can take many years to degradeA cast off bag of potato chips . There is no way to cost-effectively remove the trash, so education . about preventing further accumulation is a major goal of the project. For now, though—or at least up until now—the problem has . only worsened. ‘The most frustrating thing for me is that most of the . material we saw—glass, metal, paper, plastic—could be recycled,’ said Schlining. ‘Ultimately, preventing the introduction of litter into the marine environment . through increased public awareness remains the most efficient and . cost-effective solution to this dilemma.’",Seafloor along the west coast and all around the Hawaiian Islands is covered in refuse .
